Pfizer said it would slow production in late January to early February due to changes to manufacturing processes to boost production.
""This is unfortunate. However, such delays and issues are to be expected when global supply chains are stretched well beyond their limits,"" Procurement Minister Anita Anand said, confirming that Canada would be affected.
Anand said that despite the delay, Canada was still on track to offer vaccines to everyone by the end of September. The country is struggling to contain a second wave of COVID-19.
Canadian cases are set to continue growing rapidly, driven higher by a spike in the populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec, health officials said in a long-range forecast released separately on Friday.
The forecast said that by Jan. 24 the total death toll could be between 18,570 to 19,630 while total cases could range from 752,400 to 796,630. Canada has recorded 17,538 deaths and 688,891 cases so far.

Karl Erjavec, leader of the Pensioners' Party (DeSUS), said the opposition had gathered 42 signatures in favour of the motion from among deputies in the 90-seat parliament. 
Until recently DeSUS was part of the ruling coalition, but it quit saying it was unhappy with the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, its jeopardising of media freedom and siding with Hungary and Poland in disputes within the European Union over democratic standards in those countries.
""Our partners are the states that have difficulties with the rule of law,"" STA news agency quoted Erjavec as telling a news conference.
Erjavec would be the candidate for the prime minister if the no-confidence vote succeeded in bringing down the current administration.
The opposition needs 46 votes to remove the government and would need support from some deputies from the centre-left Party of Modern Centre (SMC), which with Jansa's Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) and the conservative New Slovenia forms the ruling coalition. SMC has eight deputies.

SMC's leader and the Economy Minister Zdravko Pocivalsek said earlier this week he supported the government, saying stability was needed for the fight against COVID-19 and to secure an economic recovery.

The man arrived on the island of Samos from Turkey on Oct. 4, 2018, and was later transferred to a migrant facility near Thessaloniki where he was arrested on Wednesday under an international arrest warrant issued by Dutch authorities, according to the official.
Two earlier applications for asylum in Greece had been rejected, he added.
The unnamed man was suspected of terrorist offences and being a member of al Nusra, a Syrian group affiliated with al Qaeda as well as migrant trafficking. Extradition procedures were under way.
Tens of thousands of migrants have arrived in Greece in recent years, many fleeing the civil war in Syria.

Lebanon said in mid-December it was expecting to sign a deal for supplies of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine and hoped to receive the first batch eight weeks after that.
But the country, now struggling with a severe spike in infections that has overwhelmed hospitals, hit a legal stumbling block that has so far prevented it from finalising the agreement. 
Friday's law would give Pfizer-BioNtech, and any other company that provides vaccines to Lebanon, protection from any future liability claims for two years. 
The law includes a clause that points to the Lebanese health ministry as the only entity responsible for compensation. 
Lebanon is under a three-week lockdown that ends on Feb. 1 and a strict 24-hour curfew until Jan. 25 after lax measures over the Christmas and New Year's holiday period led to a spike in cases. 
Caretaker Health Minister Hamad Hassan has previously said the ministry secured about 2 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, to cover 20% of the country's nationals, but the government is yet to announce a starting date for a national vaccination programme. 
On Friday Hassan tweeted thanks to parliament for approving the law. He has been hospitalised since Wednesday with coronavirus but is in stable condition and working from his hospital bed. 
Lebanon recorded a total of 237,132 cases and 1,781 deaths since the start of the pandemic to Thursday. 
The latest spike in infections has hit hard as the medical system was already battered by a severe financial crisis, which caused supply shortages, and August's port explosion, which damaged major Beirut hospitals.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Friday issued a new decree extending curbs to keep lid on COVID-19 infections after the health ministry warned that the epidemic was getting worse.
Recorded daily cases have settled at 15,000-20,000 compared with a peak of around 40,000 in mid-November, but pressure on hospitals remains high. Between 400 and 600 people die with the virus each day and the government fears that number will grow.
""In the past week there has been a generalised worsening of the epidemic, we are back to an expansionary phase,"" Health Minister Roberto Speranza told parliament on Wednesday.
The new decree extends until March 5 a nightly curfew between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. and confirms the zoning system designed in November to calibrate the curbs between Italy's 20 regions according to infection levels.
Gyms and swimming pools will remain closed across Italy and in-person take-away services will not be allowed after 6 p.m.
The decree also extends to Feb. 15 a ban on movement between regions, with people allowed to travel only for reasons of work, health or other emergencies. Ski resorts will not be allowed to reopen until Feb. 15.
However, offering some hope to lockdown-weary Italians, the government said most curbs can be lifted in individual regions when their infection rates are sufficiently low.
Italy, the first western country hit by the virus, has reported almost 81,000 coronavirus-related deaths since its outbreak came to light in February, the sixth highest tally in the world. It has seen 2.33 million confirmed cases.
While the health emergency rages, the government was this week thrown into a political crisis triggered by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who pulled his small Italia Viva party out of the coalition, depriving it of a majority in parliament.

In a blog post published on Friday, the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed now needed to live up to the Nobel Peace Prize he was awarded in 2019 by doing all it takes to end the conflict in Tigray.
""We are ready to help, but unless there is access for humanitarian aid operators, the EU cannot disburse the planned budget support to the Ethiopian government,"" Borrell said.
Abiy's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In December, the government's task force for Tigray said it had reached a deal with the United Nations in which Addis Ababa would call the shots on access for aid agencies.
Conflict erupted in Tigray on Nov. 4 between Ethiopian federal forces and the party ruling the northern region. Thousands have been killed, millions displaced and more than 50,000 refugees have fled to Sudan.
Abiy's government declared victory over the rebellious leaders in at the end of November but they vowed to fight on. The United Nations has said there are reports fighting is still going on in various parts of Tigray.
Reuters reported in December that the EU was delaying budget support to Ethiopia over the Tigray crisis, according to internal documents.
Borrell said the Tigray conflict had become far more than an internal ""law and order"" operation and was now a direct threat to the stability of the whole region. 
""We receive consistent reports of ethnic-targeted violence, killings, massive looting, rapes, forceful returns of refugees and possible war crimes,"" he said.
Reuters was unable to independently verify events in Tigray as the government is restricting journalists' access.
""Moreover, there are regional spill-over effects of the conflict, with for instance Eritrean troops being involved in the military operations in Tigray and with Ethiopian troops being withdrawn from Somalia,"" Borrell said.
'SMEAR CAMPAIGNS'
The EU has provided 815 million euros of development aid to Ethiopia over the past seven years, on top of 409 million euros of projects focused mainly on supporting refugees and host communities in the country.
The United Nations said on Thursday there had been major violations of international law in Tigray at two refugee camps, home to people who fled repression in neighbouring Eritrea long before the latest conflict.
It said satellite imagery showed fires burning and fresh signs of destruction at the Shimelba and Hitsats camps.
The U.N. refugee agency, which decried the lack of humanitarian access to the camps, did not say who was responsible, but said there had been additional military incursions over the past 10 days.
""UNHCR seems to indulge, yet again, in another bout of gratuitous & irresponsible smear campaigns against Eritrea,"" Eritrea's Information Minister, Yemane Meskel, tweeted on Friday.
After repeated denials of the presence of Eritrean troops in Tigray by both countries, a senior Ethiopian general has since said they had crossed into the northern region uninvited.
Borrell also said there needed to be a de-escalation of tension between Ethiopia and Sudan.
Ethiopia has said it is running out of patience with Sudan's continued military build-up in an area populated by Ethiopian farmers on the Sudanese side of their disputed border.
Sudan's foreign ministry said this week that an Ethiopian military aircraft had crossed the border in a ""dangerous and unjustified escalation"".

LONDON (Reuters) - A Scottish court rejected on Friday an appeal to overturn the conviction of a now-deceased Libyan man found guilty of the 1988 Lockerbie plane bombing which killed 270 people.
Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, an intelligence officer who died in 2012, was jailed for life in 2001 for the murder of 243 passengers, 16 crew and 11 residents of the Scottish town in the deadliest militant attack in British history.
In March, an independent Scottish review ruled that his family could launch a third appeal due to a possible miscarriage of justice. But on Friday, five judges at the Court of Criminal Appeal in Scotland rejected that. 
""The bombing of Pan Am 103 is, to this day, the deadliest terrorist attack on UK soil and the largest homicide case Scotland's prosecutors have ever encountered in terms of scale and of complexity,"" said Lord Advocate James Wolffe, Scotland's chief legal officer.
""The evidence gathered by Scottish, U.S. and international law enforcement agencies has again been tested in the Appeal Court and the conviction of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al-Megrahi stands.""
Megrahi's son Ali said the family were heartbroken and planned to appeal to the UK Supreme Court, their lawyer Aamer Anwar said. ""He maintained his father's innocence and is determined to fulfil the promise he made to clear his name and that of Libya,"" Anwar said.
Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in December 1988 en route from London to New York, carrying mostly Americans on their way home for Christmas.
After years of wrangling and sanctions against Libya, Megrahi and a second man Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima went on trial before Scottish judges at a special court in the Netherlands. 
Megrahi was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum 27 years, while Fahima was found not guilty.
RELEASED
Megrahi, who denied involvement in the attack, died in Libya in 2012 after being released three years earlier by the Scottish government on compassionate grounds due to prostate cancer.
Former leader Muammar Gaddafi accepted Libya's responsibility for the bombing in 2003 and paid compensation to families, but did not admit personally ordering it. 
However, Megrahi's family and some relatives of the Scottish victims have always doubted his guilt and Libya's responsibility, and say the truth has yet to come out.
At hearings in November, the family's lawyers argued his conviction had rested on flawed evidence, saying prosecutors had failed to prove a link between clothing in the suitcase carrying the bomb and Megrahi.
Last month, the United States unsealed criminal charges against a third alleged conspirator Abu Agila Mohammad Masud Kheir Al-Marimi, a former senior Libyan intelligence official currently in Libyan custody.

The Justice Department accuses Masud of carrying the bomb from Libya to Malta in a suitcase and setting its timer.

LA PALMILLA, Guatemala (Reuters) - Two-year-old Yesmin Anayeli Perez died this week of illnesses linked to malnutrition, the third small child to die from similar causes in an impoverished mountain village in eastern Guatemala within weeks, residents and health officials said. 
Residents of the indigenous Mayan village, La Palmilla, and other parts of a region known as the Dry Corridor sunk deeper into poverty last year when economic damage wrought by droughts and two devastating hurricanes was compounded by the coronavirus lockdown.
The situation in La Palmilla is a stark example of the depth of the crisis in Central America, where governments are hoping for a rapid restoration of U.S. aid under incoming president Joe Biden to stem a new migration wave.
The second of three children, Yesmin had a history of acute malnutrition, which causes rapid weight-loss and wasting, and for which she was hospitalized several times over the past year. 
In the months before her death, Yesmin's legs and arms were stick-like and her belly swollen by water retention, even though she had gained a little weight. Reuters visited her family in their home in October, where Yesmin, dressed in a purple t-shirt, was being fed a high protein mash by her mother. 
In the early hours of Monday, Yesmin died, her eyes bulging and her frail body distorted by a persistent cough and long struggle with lung illness linked to her inadequate nutrition, her father Ignoja Perez told Reuters. 
Just over half the normal weight for her age, she was suffering malnutrition and pneumonia made worse by the cold and damp weather that followed the hurricanes, local health official Santiago Esquivel said.
Sitting in front of her small coffin, in a home with a dirt floor and tin roof, her father said the family had been hopeful she would make a recovery.
    ""I bought her some vitamins on Sunday, to see if she would put on weight, we were going to start the treatment on Monday, with a spoonful,"" Perez recalled. ""But she got worse.""
    Yesmin was buried on a hilltop along with some of her clothes, a bottle of water and a small, orange plastic drinking cup in a traditional ceremony on Tuesday.
The family had celebrated her second birthday with a bowl of chicken soup just a few weeks earlier.
The Guatemalan government denies that Yesmin was suffering malnutrition at the time of her death, or at any time during 2020. However, medical records reviewed by Reuters showed she was diagnosed as suffering from acute malnutrition at least until March.
Guatemala's Food and Nutritional Security Secretariat said in a statement that Yesmin and her family had received support from authorities, in recognition that she had suffered malnutrition and lung problems at birth. 
Asked why she was not classified as malnourished in 2020, the agency referred Reuters to the Health Ministry. The ministry did not respond to requests for comment. 
TRAPPED BY POVERTY
Government data show acute malnutrition among the under-fives rose by 80% in Guatemala in 2020 compared to 2019.
The government said the jump was partly due to improved methodology. However, data gathered by Oxfam last year also showed large increases in families facing food shortages, including a four-fold jump in severe shortages in the province around La Palmilla. 
At least 46 children under five died of hunger-related causes in 2020 in Guatemala, according to the government data, well below previous years. Ivan Aguilar, a humanitarian program coordinator based in Guatemala at Oxfam, said the drop appeared to be due to officials attributing deaths related to malnutrition to other causes, including the case of Yesmin.
Yesmin was the third young child to die in the village of around 3,000 people since October, local health official Esquivel said. Yesmin was buried a few feet away from another girl who died on Dec. 26.
The deaths are unusual even in a region that grew tragically accustomed to such deaths after drought destroyed crops every year for half of the past decade, Esquivel added.
""Sometimes a child would die, but not like this, one after the other,"" he said.
The crisis is driving a new round of migration north just as Biden prepares to take office.
    But in La Palmilla and other villages in the eastern highlands, people said they lack the money to up and leave.
    Without work for months during a lockdown from February, Perez borrowed money and sold his coffee crop, spending the little he raised to pay for Yesmin's treatment in nearby city Zacapa. 
    The two hurricanes in November wiped out his field of beans, leaving only corn in the ground, and the walls of his mud-block house cracked with the rain, letting the winter chill inside. 
""I wish I could go to the United States, but without money, we have to stay,"" he said, looking down at his daughter's still body.

Last month, Washington imposed long-anticipated sanctions on Turkey's defence industry over its acquisition of S-400 missile defence systems from Moscow, in a move Turkey called a ""grave mistake"".
The United States has also removed fellow NATO member Turkey from the F-35 programme over the move.
Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and to NATO's broader defence systems. Turkey rejects this, saying S-400s will not be integrated into NATO and purchasing them was a necessity as it was unable to procure air defence systems from any NATO ally on satisfactory terms.
""No country can determine the steps we will take toward the defence industry, that fully depends on the decisions we make,"" Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul, adding Ankara was in talks to procure a second shipment of S-400s from Russia and would hold talks on the issue later this month.
""We don't know what the Biden administration will say at this stage (on the S-400s),"" he added. ""Despite having paid a serious fee on the F-35s, the F-35s still have not been given to us. This is a serious wrong the United States did against us as a NATO ally,"" he said.
""My hope is that, after we hold talks with Biden as he takes office, we will take much more positive steps and put these back on track.""

Biden will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, replacing incumbent Donald Trump, with whom Erdogan had a close relationship. Ankara has said it hopes for better with Washington then.

The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not provide details on the sanctions, the latest in a series that U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed on the Iranian economy to try to force Tehran into a new negotiation on curbing its nuclear program as well as its missile and regional activities.
Trump in 2018 abandoned the Iran nuclear agreement that Tehran struck with six major powers in 2015 to rein in its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and international sanctions that had crippled its economy.
When he walked away from the deal, Trump said he was open to negotiating a much wider pact that would seek more extensive constraints on Iran's nuclear program as well as limits on its development of ballistic missiles and its sponsorship of militias in regional nations such as Iraq, Lebanon and Syria.
The Republican president's administration plans to unveil the new sanctions five days before Trump is to hand over the White House to Democratic President-elect Joe Biden. Biden has said he will return to the 2015 pact if Iran resumes strict compliance with it. The State and Treasury Departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the announcement.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte worked the phones on Friday, trying to secure enough votes in parliament to allow him to stay in power after a junior ally quit the cabinet this week.
Conte is due to address the lower house on Monday and the upper house Senate on Tuesday about the political chaos, which was triggered by former premier Matteo Renzi in a row over the coalition's handling of the coronavirus and economic crises. 
Confidence votes will be held in both chambers. But while Conte should be able to muster a majority in the lower house, the situation in the Senate is much tighter, with the government on paper needing to find 11 lawmakers willing to join its ranks.
Conte and his team were looking for backing among the list of 21 non-aligned senators and hoping that some of Renzi's own 18-strong Senate team might defect and remain within the ruling coalition, which has been in office just 17 months.
""We have signs of willingness and interest from many parliamentarians. Let's see if this allows the government to keep its majority,"" Andrea Orlando, the deputy head of the co-ruling Democratic Party (PD), told Sky Italia TV.
However, he acknowledged that even if they did manage to scrape together enough support in the 321-seat Senate, it would not resolve all their problems.
""It is clear that a crisis can be avoided by having just one more vote, but one can't govern with just one additional vote,"" Orlando said, pointing to prolonged political instability.
Renzi, who has come under attack on social media for pulling the Italia Viva party from the cabinet, said he did not believe Conte would be able to win Tuesday's vote.
While Conte was searching for stray senators, the opposition centre-right block was also seeking to win over waiverers to try to force the government's resignation, potentially opening the way for early elections, two years ahead of schedule. 
Opinion polls say the opposition, led by League leader Matteo Salvini, would triumph in a national vote.
The political uncertainty has pushed up borrowing costs, with yields on Italy's sovereign bonds (BTPs) set to post their biggest weekly rise in 12 weeks.
Analysts said markets would become much more volatile if snap elections looked likely, amid investor concern over the economic policies of any government headed by the eurosceptic, populist League.

""We see new elections as the worst possible outcome for BTPs, but this is highly unlikely, in our view,"" Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) analysts Jorge Garayo, Ninon Bachet and Adam Kurpiel told clients.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Fiji, the favourite of Western nations, won the presidency of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday, beating Bahrain and Uzbekistan in a secret ballot that resolved a tense deadlock over the selection.
The vote was called after an impasse that meant the Council, the only intergovernmental global body to promote and protect human rights worldwide, began meetings this week leaderless for the first time in its 15-year history. 
The presidency rotates geographically with each region typically making a selection by consensus but members of the Asia Pacific group could not agree, forcing the first-ever secret ballot in the Council. 
Fiji's Nazahat Shameen Khan, a British-educated former High Court judge, won with 29 votes versus 14 for Bahrain and 4 for Uzbekistan, Vice-President Ali Ibn Abi Talib Abdelrahman Mahmoud told a nearly-empty U.N. chamber where delegates voted one-by-one due to COVID-19 measures.
The deadlock over the presidency came at the start of a year that is widely expected to see the United States rejoin after quitting the forum in 2018, and with a review of the Council's activities expected to begin. 
Observers and diplomats saw Fiji's rivals as being backed by Russia, China and Saudi Arabia although a Chinese diplomat said he would be happy for any of the three candidates to win. Officials from Russia and Saudi Arabia did not respond to requests for comment. 
Multiple meetings to resolve the deadlock were unsuccessful amid strong lobbying ahead of the vote, diplomats said. The 47-member Council does not make legally binding decisions but it can authorise probes into alleged rights violations by mandating international fact-finding missions.
Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group think-tank, welcomed Khan's selection.
""It is important for the Council to have a country like Fiji that has a positive record on human rights and a good story to tell,"" he said, alluding to the collapse of the former U.N. rights body after Muammar Gaddafi's Libya led it.
A diplomat said he expected the intensity of debates to increase this year, given that Russia and China return to the Council after periods off it.

""I expect a lot of heated debates and the potential for acrimony,"" he said, saying China's actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang could be flashpoints.

More than 4,000 civil servants in the global financial hub have already made the declaration since Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in June, which punishes anything China considers to be subversion, secessionism, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Western governments and rights groups are concerned that the security law is being used to crush dissent in the Chinese-ruled city. Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing say the law is necessary to bring stability to the semi-autonomous former British colony after a year of anti-government demonstrations.
Civil servants taking the oath will promise to uphold Hong Kong's Basic Law and ""bear allegiance"" to the city and its government, as well as to be dedicated in their duties. 
The Civil Service Bureau said in a statement that all civil servants should in ""no uncertain terms acknowledge and accept these basic duties"".
Those who refuse to sign the pledge could lose their jobs. 
""Negligence or refusal to take the oath or to duly sign and return the declaration by a civil servant casts serious doubts on his or her willingness to take up these basic duties and his or her suitability to remain in the civil service,"" the statement said.
In the past, authorities have disqualified opposition candidates in elections, as well as pro-democracy lawmakers, on grounds similar oaths of allegiance were ""dishonest"".
In a circular to civil servants, officials said it was not feasible to list ""exhaustively"" all types of improper conduct as they may come in many different forms.
However, it said advocating or supporting ""Hong Kong independence"", refusing to recognise China's sovereignty over the city, soliciting intervention by foreign or external forces into the city's affairs, or carrying out activities that endanger national security were not allowed.
Any act that ""aims to undermine the government in the governance and administration of Hong Kong"" would also be seen as violating the declaration, according to the circular.
The government said merely expressing views in public to oppose a certain policy or decision of the government would not normally constitute improper conduct.

The move, announced by Russia's foreign ministry, comes days before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration amid fears of a burgeoning arms race. Moscow's last major nuclear arms pact with Washington is set to expire next month.
The United States left the Open Skies arms control and verification treaty in November, accusing Russia of violating it, something Moscow denied.
Russia said in a statement that Moscow had made specific proposals to other members to mitigate against the impact of the U.S. exit but that those proposals were not backed by Washington's allies. 
Moscow will formally notify other member states about its exit once it has completed unspecified withdrawal procedures at home, it said. The exit process usually takes months to be finalised.
Russia has raised concerns that despite leaving the treaty Washington could potentially retain access to overflight intelligence gathered by allies who remain members in the treaty. 
The Kommersant newspaper reported earlier that Moscow had tried to get guarantees from other countries that they would not share such intelligence with Washington but had not been given any assurances.
Arms control tensions have been rising between Moscow and Washington and New START, their last remaining major nuclear arms control treaty, is set to expire in February. 
Biden has said he's keen to renew it but it remains unclear for how long.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. casino magnate Sheldon Adelson was buried on Friday on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, a city that he fought for years to have recognised as Israel's capital. 
Mourners dressed in black - some in skullcaps and all wearing masks - laid Adelson's unadorned coffin to rest, accompanied by his Israeli-born wife Miriam and other family members.
Praised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a ""huge Jewish patriot"", Adelson died on Monday from cancer, said  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) Corp, which he turned into the world's largest casino company.
A combative, self-made man raised in a poor Jewish immigrant family in Boston, Adelson established hotels and casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore. His wealth made him a formidable figure in U.S. and Israeli politics. 
Netanyahu was present on Thursday when Adelson's body arrived at Israel's Ben Gurion International airport, in a coffin draped in U.S. and Israeli flags, photos published by Israel Hayom showed. 
""It is a great loss for the Jewish people,"" Netanyahu - a close friend - was also quoted as saying by the newspaper, which Adelson launched in 2007.
Known for extensive philanthropy and business ventures in Israel and donations to Jewish causes, Adelson saw his cherished goal for the city come to fruition in 2017, when U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
That move broke with decades of U.S. policy, placed America at odds with most of the rest of the world, and infuriated Palestinians who claim the east of the city as the capital of a putative future state.
The ancient Jewish cemetery where Adelson was buried is on a limestone ridge that overlooks Jerusalem's walled Old City - which contains sites holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims.

In a bizarre case that gripped the nation, Laila Anita Bertheussen, 56, was apprehended by police in 2019, triggering the resignation of then Justice Minister Tor Mikkel Wara of the law-and-order Progress Party.
""We are in no doubt that the case was thoroughly investigated. The police did not have tunnel vision in this case,"" Oslo district court judge Yngvild Thue said while reading the unanimous verdict.
Bertheussen had pleaded not guilty to all charges and rejected the prosecution's claim that she had sought to generate sympathy for the family.
It was not immediately clear if she would appeal the verdict.

The drill, which it said was overseen by Guards commander Major General Hossein Salami in the central desert region, came in the waning days of high tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.
It followed short-range naval missile tests on Wednesday, as well as exercises earlier this month that featured a wide array of domestically produced drones.
""The bomber drones struck the hypothetical enemy missile shield from all directions, completely destroying the targets,"" the state TV broadcast said of Friday's drill.
""Also, an abundant number of a new generation of ballistic missiles were fired at selected targets, inflicting deadly blows to the hypothetical enemy bases.""
Iran, which routinely boasts of technological advances in its armed forces, has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, regarding them as a deterrent and retaliatory force against U.S. and other adversaries in the event of war.
There have been periodic confrontations between Iran's military and U.S. forces in the Gulf since 2018, when Trump abandoned Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and reinstated harsh sanctions against Tehran.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said Washington will rejoin the deal ""if Iran resumes strict compliance"" with the agreement that imposed strict curbs on its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions.

Thongloun, 75, was elected to a five-year term as head of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee – the top post in the country.
Its party congress also chose 13 members of the Politburo, Laos' top political body, and 71 party Central Committee members, it said. 
Thongloun takes charge as the landlocked Southeast Asian country faces challenges from a potential debt default and the global impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on its fragile, $18 billion economy. 
On Thursday, Thongloun outlined a new five-year socio-economic plan targeting annual economic growth of 4% up to 2025 and aims to reach annual average per capita income of $2,887 in 2025, the Vientiane Times said.
The country of more than 7 million people has a current per capita income of just over $2,500, according to World Bank data.
As prime minister since 2016 and a former foreign minister, Thongloun has been the face of the country at international events and summits, including giving addresses to the United Nations General Assembly. 
He is a veteran of the old guard of the party, which first came to power after communist fighters defeated a Western-backed government to form the Lao People's Democratic Republic in 1975.

The same party has been in power ever since, and Laos has traditionally mirrored neighbouring Vietnam's political system, although China's sway has grown in recent years.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The company which approves internet domains in Hong Kong said it will now reject any sites that could incite ""illegal acts"", raising new concerns about freedoms after Beijing's imposition of a national security law on the Chinese-ruled city last year.
Holders of .hk domains were advised of the policy change late on Thursday, sources told Reuters, hours after internet service provider Hong Kong Broadband Network (HKBN) said it had blocked access to HKChronicles, a website offering information about anti-government protests.
The moves came just days after the arrest of over 50 pro-democracy activists, and sources have told Reuters that China is planning a further crackdown. 
HKBN said it had blocked the website, which also publishes personal information on Hong Kong police officers, in compliance with the national security law, the first such censorship in the city of its kind. 
Anti-government protests in 2019 relied heavily on social media channels like Telegram which allowed protesters to organise anonymously. Many sites also sprung up in support of the protest movement, though a number shut after the passage of the security law.
In the emails, the Hong Kong Domain Name Registration Company (HKDNR) alerted holders of .hk domains to the new ""acceptable use"" policy by its parent, Hong Kong Internet Registration Corporation Limited (HKIRC), which goes into effect on Jan. 28, according to copies shared by recipients with Reuters. 
It said it could reject applications for new .hk sites that it believes could incite criminal acts, abuse privacy or provide false or misleading information.
It was not immediately clear whether the policy will apply to existing .hk websites. The HKIRC, the HKDNR and the Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""The rollout of the acceptable use policy is quite worrying,"" said one website operator who declined to be identified, citing fear of repercussions.
""Things like providing false or misleading information, who are they to decide? Are these preventive measures for future false news regulations?""
The moves are fuelling worries that a censorship mechanism similar to China's ""Great Firewall"" is being put in place in Hong Kong.
While the internet in mainland China is heavily censored and access to many foreign platforms like news sites is blocked, residents in Hong Kong have so far enjoyed greater freedoms under the ""one country, two systems"" framework that it was promised when Britain handed it back to China in 1997.
China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and PCCW, the other major internet providers in Hong Kong, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Wong Ho Wah, who is running for Hong Kong's legislature to representing the information technology sector, said he was deeply worried that Hong Kongers' freedom to access information on the internet was starting to be affected. 
""The government has the responsibility to explain the justification and the rationale of the action,"" he said, referring to the blocking of HKChronicles' website.

The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 aircraft was seized after a court order, an airline spokesman said, and alternative arrangements were being made for passengers due to fly back to Pakistan.
""A PIA aircraft has been held back by a local court in Malaysia taking a one-sided decision pertaining to a legal dispute between PIA and another party pending in a UK court,"" a PIA spokesman said in a statement.
The national carrier in a statement described the situation as ""unacceptable"" and said it had asked for support from Pakistan's government to raise the matter diplomatically.
The company did not say where the plane was being held. The spokesman told Reuters that the matter related to an arbitration case over payments being heard in a UK court. Further details of the case were not immediately available.
Malaysian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
With more than $4 billion in accumulated losses, PIA was already struggling financially when flights were grounded last year due to the pandemic.
As it resumed operations in May, a domestic PIA flight crash in Karachi killed 97 of 99 people on board.
Pakistan’s aviation industry was then hit by a scandal in which pilots were found to hold “dubious” licences – prompting a number of countries to ban PIA from operating flights in their jurisdictions.
The airline was banned from flying to the European Union for six months over safety compliance concerns under a ban still in place.

Houthi-run Al Masirah TV said the coalition had conducted air strikes overnight on the Yemeni capital Sanaa. The strikes were also seen by a Reuters witness.
There was no immediate confirmation of the report from the Saudi-led coalition.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake killed at least 35 people and injured hundreds on Indonesia's island of Sulawesi on Friday, trapping several under rubble and unleashing dozens of aftershocks as authorities warned of more quakes that could trigger a tsunami.
Thousands of frightened residents fled their homes for higher ground when the magnitude 6.2-quake struck 6 km (3.73 miles) northeast of the town of Majene, at a depth of just 10 km, shortly before 1.30 a.m. 
The quake and aftershocks damaged more than 300 homes and two hotels, as well as flattening a hospital and the office of a regional governor, where authorities told Reuters several people have been trapped under the rubble. 
""Praise be to God, for now OK, but we just felt another aftershock,"" said Sukri Efendy, a 26-year-old resident of the area. 
As many as 35 people have been killed in Majene and in the neighbouring district of Mamuju, with more deaths likely to be confirmed as rescue workers fan out, said Darno Majid, the chief of the disaster agency in West Sulawesi. 
The heightened seismic activity set off three landslides, severed electricity supplies, and damaged bridges linking to regional hubs, such as the city of Makassar.
Initial information from the national disaster mitigation agency showed 637 injured in Majene, and two dozen in Mamuju.
No tsunami warning was issued but the head of Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), Dwikorita Karnawati, told a news conference that aftershocks could follow, with a possibility that another powerful quake could trigger a tsunami.
There had been at least 26 aftershocks, she said, with Friday's quake preceded by a quake of 5.9 magnitude the previous day.
Pictures of the aftermath appeared on social media as the head of the disaster agency and social affairs minister prepared to visit. 
Videos showed residents fleeing to higher ground on motorcycles, and a young girl trapped under rubble as people tried to shift debris with their hands.
President Joko Widodo offered condolences to the victims in a video statement, urging people to stay calm and authorities to step up search efforts.
Key tasks for officials are restoring telecoms and bridge links and ensuring delivery of tents, food and medical supplies, said West Sulawesi provincial government spokesman Safaruddin. 
About 15,000 people have fled their homes since the quake, the disaster agency has said, with the coronavirus pandemic likely to complicate aid distribution.
""It is certainly one of the most challenging, this (disaster) was one of our fears and now we are putting all of that planning and protocols into place,"" said Jan Gelfand, head of the International Federation of Red Cross in Indonesia.
Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes.
In 2018, a devastating 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.
A 9.1-magnitude quake off the north of Sumatra island triggered a tsunami on Boxing Day in 2004 that lashed coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other nations, killing more than 230,000 people.

The recorder ""has 330 parameters and all are in good conditions,"" the National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) said in a statement, referring to the available data. 
Parameters is a reference to the amount of data recorded from various aircraft systems including the flight path, speed, engine power and flaps configurations.
Flight SJ 182 crashed into the Java Sea minutes after take-off from Jakarta with 62 people on board on Jan. 9, destroying the 26-year-old Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-500.
KNKT said the FDR data confirmed that both of the plane's engines had been operating when the plane hit the water, as it had earlier stated based on the wreckage.
The maritime search for the plane's other ""black box"", the cockpit voice recorder, continued on Friday.
KNKT plans to issue a preliminary report within 30 days of the crash in line with international standards, the agency's head told Reuters on Thursday.
The Sriwijaya crash is the biggest airline disaster in Indonesia since October 2018, when 189 people were killed onboard a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX that plunged into the Java Sea soon after take-off.

But police and the lawyer for activist Chaiyapon Danothai said he did not face lese majeste charges, which have been brought against at least 40 protesters since November and can mean a 15-year jail term if found guilty. 
Protesters pushed and shoved about a dozen officers at a police station near Bangkok, where they believed Chaiyapon was going to be charged.
""There are no charges or arrest against him,"" head of Khlong Luang police station, Sethanat Timwat, told reporters. 
Chaiyapon's lawyer, Noraset Nanongtoom, confirmed that no action had been taken. 
He said Chaiyapon's name had appeared on a search warrant used during the arrest late on Wednesday of another activist, who is accused of defacing a portrait of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Chaiyapon was not in Bangkok when that incident took place, Noraset said. 
The demonstrators brought goats to the police station, which they said symbolised Chaiyapon being made a scapegoat.
Months of youth-led protests against the military-backed government subsided at the end of last year, but the movement has vowed to continue its campaign. 
The protests broke longstanding taboos by calling for reforms of the monarchy, which led to the use of the royal insult law for the first time in more than a year.
A government spokesman last week said its use was necessary. 
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had last year said that the king had asked the government not to charge anyone with lese majeste, but as protests escalated he said ""all laws"" would be used.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government will hold new talks with the leaders of tens of thousands of farmers camped on the outskirts of New Delhi for almost two months protesting for the repeal of new agricultural laws they say threaten their livelihoods.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been urging the farmers to end their protest over the laws introduced in September, but the farmers say they will not relent on their demands, as the bills are designed to benefit private buyers at the expense of growers.
The government would talk to farmers with an open mind, Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.
Previous rounds of talks have so far failed to mollify tens of thousands of farmers who have been camping out on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi for almost two months.
Protesting farmers have threatened to further intensify their agitation by marching to Delhi on Jan. 26, when India celebrated its Republic Day.
On Tuesday, India's Supreme Court ordered an indefinite stay on the implementation of new agricultural laws and appointed a four-member panel to hear farmers' objections.
Raising doubts over the panel's composition, farmer union leaders have said they would not appear before the committee.
The panel members have been in favour of the three laws, protesting farmers said.
Bhupinder Singh Mann, one of the four members, has recused himself from the Supreme Court-appointed panel.
Mann comes from the northern state of Punjab, one of India's breadbasket states, and Punjab's politically influential farmers have been at the vanguard of the agitation against the three laws.
On Friday, the main opposition Congress party will organise protests at state capitals to support farmers' agitation.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central Americans camped overnight outside the bus terminal in the city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, anxiously awaiting the departure early Friday morning of a migrant caravan hoping to reach the United States.
Local television footage showed an increasing number of families, many carrying young children, gathering throughout the evening on Thursday, despite Central American authorities deploying soldiers to regional borders to deter migrants from crossing.
This week's caravan will be the first of the year and comes less than a week before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office. Biden has promised a more humane approach to migration, in a departure from outgoing President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant policies.
As well as dealing with the coronavirus pandemic, Central America is reeling from a growing hunger crisis, high rates of violence, and the devastating fallout of two major hurricanes that battered the region in November.
Authorities in Central America and Mexico have stepped up efforts to stop the caravan well before the U.S. border, using anti-coronavirus measures as the latest tool to curtail migration.
That will likely be a relief for Biden, whose aides have privately expressed concerns about the prospect of growing numbers of migrants seeking to enter the United States in the early days of his administration.
On Thursday, Guatemala cited the pandemic in order to declare emergency powers in seven border provinces migrants frequently transit through en route to Mexico. The measures limit public demonstrations and allow authorities to disperse any public meeting, group or demonstration by force. 

Honduras and Guatemala have announced they will deploy thousands of soldiers to preemptively stop caravan members, while Mexico also deployed agents to its southern border on Thursday.

Cienfuegos, a member of former President Enrique Peña Nieto's government, was arrested in October at Los Angeles international airport and accused by U.S. prosecutors of collaborating with one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels.
In November, a federal judge granted a U.S. government request to drop drug charges against Cienfuegos and return him to Mexico, which the United States hoped would restore trust in the neighbors' severely strained security ties.
The Mexican attorney general's office said in a statement an analysis of the evidence showed Cienfuegos ""never had any encounters with members of the criminal organization investigated by U.S. authorities, nor did he maintain any communication with them, or carry out acts tending to protect or help said individuals.""
Mike Vigil, a former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration chief of international operations, expressed his dismay at the decision.
""This is a very big stain on the Mexican justice system,"" Vigil said in a television interview with Mexican broadcaster Milenio. 
Vigil said Ciefuegos' case would be a model for corruption and impunity in future.
Reuters was not able to contact Ciefuegos.
His arrest in the United States followed a multi-year investigation that used wire taps to track a military figure who traffickers called ""El Padrino"", or The Godfather.
Investigators concluded ""El Padrino"" was Cienfuegos and had helped drug traffickers move tonnes of narcotics.
However, the attorney general's office said there was no evidence Cienfuegos had ""used any equipment or electronic means, or that he had issued any order to favor the criminal group identified in this case.""
Scrutiny of Cienfuegos' wealth and tax obligations uncovered no evidence that he had received illegal income, it said.
These were among the reasons authorities had decided not to pursue criminal charges against Cienfuegos, a former general, the attorney general's office added.
Some Mexicans saw the decision as another example of long-standing impunity for the military.
""Unfortunately, we see that the army is still untouchable,"" said Nadin Reyes, whose father went missing in 2007 after last being seen at a military base.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea displayed what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) at a parade on Thursday night, state media reported, capping more than a week of political meetings with a show of military might.
Clad in a leather coat and fur hat, leader Kim Jong Un smiled and waved as he oversaw the parade in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, photos by state media showed.
The parade featured rows of marching soldiers, as well as a range of military hardware including tanks and rocket launchers.
At the end, a number of what analysts said appeared to be new variants of short-range ballistic missiles and SLBMs rolled into the square on trucks.
""The world's most powerful weapon, submarine-launch ballistic missiles, entered the square one after another, powerfully demonstrating the might of the revolutionary armed forces,"" news agency KCNA reported.
North Korea has test-fired several SLBMs from underwater, and analysts say it is seeking to develop an operational submarine to carry the missiles.
Photos released by state media showed the SLBM was labelled Pukguksong-5, potentially marking an upgrade over the Pukguksong-4 that was unveiled at a larger military parade in October.
""The new missile definitely looks longer,"" Michael Duitsman, a researcher at the California-based James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS), said on Twitter.
Unlike that October parade, Thursday's event did not showcase North Korea's largest intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which are believed to be able to deliver a nuclear warhead to anywhere in the United States.
The parade in itself was not intended to be a provocation but was a worrying sign of Pyongyang's priorities, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.
""The economy is severely strained from pandemic border closures, policy mismanagement and international sanctions,"" he said. ""Despite or perhaps because of this, Kim Jong Un feels the need to devote scarce resources to another political-military display.""
On Wednesday, Kim Yo Jong, the sister of Kim Jong Un and a member of the ruling party's Central Committee, criticised South Korea's military for saying it had detected signs of a parade in Pyongyang on Sunday.
North Korean officials have been meeting in Pyongyang for the first party congress since 2016.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An official petition to Australian lawmakers urging them to exempt international students from border closures has received nearly 3,000 signatures, citing ""bad quality"" online lessons and lack of schooling for some.
The petition, which is backed by social media campaign #bringusbacktoaus on Twitter, needs 12,000 signatures from Australian residents or citizens before Feb. 10 for it to be tabled before lawmakers for a discussion. 
""These are students from all over Asia, all over the world,"" said Phil Honeywood, Chief Executive, International Education Association of Australia. 
""Those who are not citizens have families here. The Indian and the Chinese communities, for example, have cousins or friends who are signing on their behalf."" 
Australia, which recorded a second straight day of zero coronavirus cases on Friday, has adopted a heavy-handed approach to curb the pandemic, shutting state and international borders, forcing hotel quarantine for returning Australians and making masks mandatory in regions facing a virus resurgence. 
The country's A$37 billion ($29 billion) education sector has been bleeding since early 2020 when coronavirus-induced border closures were announced.
The sector, Australia's leading export earner, contributes significantly to the nation's A$1.9 trillion economy via housing demand, retail sales and employment growth.
""We do not pay our family’s saving for video lessons or rent for house which we cannot even live in,"" the petition on Australia's parliamentary website read.
""We appeal exemptions for international students not only for students' future and human right but also for the recovery of the Australia economy.""
Australia has been considering bringing back students since last year though plans stalled following fresh coronavirus waves in Victoria and New South Wales.
With infections now under control in both the states, local media have reported states could revive their pilot schemes to bring back the students.
""We are hopeful,"" Honeywood said. ""All states have got plans but the politics of this is just incredibly frustrating.""

Merkel, who steps down after September's elections, is heading into the last months of her tenure with her conservative CDU squabbling over how to position the party following 15 years of rule marked by her instinct to compromise.
Markus Soeder, leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the CDU's Bavarian sister party, said it would be a mistake to break with her popular brand of politics, which is consensus orientated and centrist.
""Anyone who thinks they can win the Bundestag elections by breaking with Angela Merkel is fundamentally mistaken,"" Soeder told the Funke media group in comments published on Friday. Her legacy must be preserved and combined with new ideas, he said.
Friedrich Merz, a former Merkel rival who is contesting the CDU leadership, wants to shift the party to the right. 
Merz is running against Armin Laschet, premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Norbert Roettgen, a foreign policy expert. Both are more centrist than Merz.
Soeder has signalled his support for Laschet, but may take on the role of conservative candidate to succeed Merkel if the winner of Saturday's CDU vote flops.
A survey by pollster Forsa for news network RND published on Friday showed 29% of voters would back Roettgen for the CDU leadership, 21% Merz and 19% Laschet. The leader will be elected at Saturday's digital congress by 1,001 party delegates.
Roettgen has suggested that if elected CDU leader he could back Soeder, who leads among conservatives in voter opinion polls, to run as chancellor candidate for their CDU/CSU alliance, the Union.
On the chancellor candidacy, Soeder told the Funke group: ""The CDU, as the bigger sister, has the right of initiative. In the end, however, we decide together.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United by political grievances, they came in costumes, snapping selfies, calling themselves patriots. Some came armed for battle and planning for ""war.""
As authorities begin to charge the rioters in the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol, court documents paint a picture of a diverse mob that included both citizens with mainstream careers - police officers, a flower shop owner, a state lawmaker, military veterans, even an Olympic medalist - as well as Americans on the fringe. One was a member of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group. Another had a caveman costume beneath a police bulletproof vest. One served time in prison for attempted murder.
They traveled from as far as Hawaii to join the protest of Congress certifying Democrat Joe Biden’s election win, which Republican President Donald Trump has falsely claimed resulted from widespread election fraud. Some brought all manner of weapons or explosives, underscoring the grave threat from an insurrection that resulted in five deaths, including a police officer, and dozens of injuries.
Federal prosecutors have said they expect to bring charges against hundreds of people involving the riot and related threats and violence. They had charged about 80 as of Thursday, a Justice Department spokeswoman said. Their task was made much harder by that fact that overwhelmed police initially made few arrests of the hundreds of people who stormed the building - just 14 were detained that day by the U.S. Capitol Police, which guards the building. And yet many suspects made investigators’ and prosecutors’ jobs easy by mugging for news cameras and posting what authorities described as real-time confessions - including videos of themselves - in postings on social media as they pushed their way inside the Capitol, home to the U.S. Congress, according to a Reuters review of court records.
David Blair - a Trump supporter who lives in Washington’s suburbs and was charged with attacking a police officer with a stick - came to the Capitol after seeing that it had been overrun by a mob supporting the president because he wanted ""to witness history,"" he told Reuters in a text message. ""I ended up still finding a way to get in trouble because I had so much pent-up emotion,"" he wrote.
The initial round of charges do not reflect the full gravity of the siege that paralyzed Congress as members fled for their lives and hid from the mob. Authorities expect more serious charges to follow after more intensive investigations. Washington’s acting U.S. attorney, Michael Sherwin, said Tuesday that he had assembled a team to focus on building sedition and conspiracy cases related to the most ""heinous"" actions during the siege. Investigators are reviewing communications, along with travel and financial records, to track any coordination or organization among the rioters.
""People are going to be shocked with some of the egregious conduct that happened in the Capitol,"" Sherwin said.
SEALED CASES, SCANT DETAILS
Authorities have so far offered scant details about the people they charged, and some of the court filings remain sealed.
At least some of those arrested in connection with the riots have a history of mental illness. Mark Leffingwell of Seattle, who faces charges for assaulting a police officer, is an Iraq war veteran who suffers from PTSD and traumatic brain injury, his lawyer told a judge. Richard Barnett, photographed sitting in U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, told the judge he has a history of depressive disorder.
Court documents did not show whether Barnett had entered a plea. Barnett’s lawyer, Anthony Siano, declined to comment beyond confirming the details of court proceedings.
Lonnie Coffman, a 70-year-old Alabama man arrested for having explosives in his truck, takes multiple drugs for mental illness, his lawyer told the judge in a hearing this week. Coffman pleaded not guilty on Tuesday. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.
Thomas Robertson, one of two off-duty Virginia police officers charged with entering the Capitol illegally, was more explicit, praising the power of right-wing rioters: ""The right IN ONE DAY took the f------ U.S. Capitol. Keep poking us,"" Robertson wrote on social media, according to the Capitol Police. He boasted that the crowd had ""actually attacked the government.” Neither Robertson nor his lawyer could be reached. Court documents did not show whether he had entered a plea. 
Some suspects apologized after the riot.
Blair - the man charged with attacking a police officer with a stick - told an investigator he was ""being an idiot, pumped up and didn’t move back. Accept everything. I’m sorry,"" according to a court filing. Blair pleaded not guilty and said in a text message he ""would never, and have never had an intention of assaulting a police officer.” He did not directly answer what he did during the alleged attack and why.
PREPARING FOR ‘WAR’
Prosecutors say Cleveland Meredith (NYSE:MDP), whose lives in North Carolina, according to his lawyer, loaded his truck and trailer with weapons and headed to Washington, but arrived too late to join the riot. When police searched his truck the next day, they found a high-powered rifle and thousands of rounds of ammunition, including bullets the FBI described as armor-piercing.
As Meredith traveled to Washington, someone sent him a text message that Trump supporters had breached the Capitol. ""Burn DC to the FKG ground,” he replied, according to court documents. When Meredith learned that Vice President Mike Pence would count electoral votes from states Trump lost, he replied: ""War time.""
FBI agents arrested him the next day in Washington after he sent more menacing texts and head-butted a person on the street, according to court records. Prosecutors urged a judge on Wednesday to keep him locked up while the charges are pending, describing Meredith as ""a clearly disturbed, deranged, and dangerous individual that fantasizes about committing horrific acts of violence and takes countless steps to carry them out"" and said he appeared ready to act on ""extreme political and racial animus.""
Prosecutors described Meredith as an adherent of the fringe QAnon conspiracy theory, which casts Trump as a savior figure and elite Democrats as a cabal of Satanist pedophiles and cannibals. A judge on Thursday ordered Meredith detained pending trial. His lawyer did not respond to questions about the case.
Authorities arrested Coffman of Alabama near the Capitol after noticing the handle of a gun in his pickup truck while they were responding to pipe bombs left outside the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee, both of which are near the Capitol. Inside his truck, they found an AR-15-style rifle, a shotgun, a crossbow, several machetes, smoke grenades and 11 Molotov cocktails. They also found a note with the name of at least one member of Congress and a judge, alongside the notation ""bad guy.""
Prosecutors said the combination of weapons and political messages ""suggest that these weapons were intended to be used in an effort to violently attack our elected representatives.""
A Capitol Police agent said in a court filing that Coffman told the officers who arrested him that he tried to return to his parked truck several times during the day but couldn’t because police had blocked off the area while they investigated the pipe bombs.
Others were armed during the riot: A police officer said he noticed a bulge on the hip of Christopher Alberts - who was dressed in body armor and carrying a gas mask - as he filed out of the Capitol grounds, according to court records. When they stopped him, they found a loaded handgun. Alberts’ lawyer did not respond to questions about the case.
Two other men, Eric Munchel and Larry Brock, both were photographed inside the Capitol carrying zip ties, commonly used as a handcuff. Prosecutors have not said what either man intended to do with them. Brock is an Air Force veteran who once flew warplanes. Both were charged with being inside the Capitol illegally. Reuters was unable to reach their attorneys.
Michael Curzio, arrested at the front of a crowd inside the Capitol, had recently served a prison sentence in Florida for attempted murder. He was released in 2019. Curzio's mother, Vicki Prentiss, told Reuters he went to Washington because ""he was excited about going to support Trump.” Curzio was charged with violent entry and disorderly conduct, along with unlawful entry of the Capitol. Curzio’s case was sealed by the court and he could not be reached for comment.
CONFESSIONS ON CAMERA
Most of the cases filed against rioters so far were for less serious offenses involving being inside the Capitol illegally, and many defendants were released within a day.
An FBI agent said in an affidavit that he identified former Olympic swimmer Klete Keller - who has two gold medals and three other medals - inside the Capitol because he was tall, unmasked, and wearing an Olympic patch on the shoulder of his jacket. Reuters was unable to reach Keller, who is charged with unlawfully entering the Capitol. Court documents did not indicate a plea.
Nicholas Ochs, head of the Proud Boys' Hawaii chapter, was charged after the FBI said he posted a picture on Twitter of himself smoking a cigarette with the caption ""Hello from the Capital lol."" Ochs has not yet appeared in court, and court documents did not indicate he had made a plea. He could not be reached for comment.
Prosecutors charged Jenny Cudd, a Texas flower shop owner, on Wednesday with unlawfully entering the Capitol, citing a widely viewed social media video in which she laughed and said: ""We did break down the, umm, Nancy Pelosi’s office door, and somebody stole her gavel and took a picture sitting in the chair flipping off the camera.” Reuters was unable to reach her.
Afterward, the FBI said Cudd appeared in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) video in which she declared she had participated in a ""new revolution” and added: ""I am proud of my actions, I fucking charged the Capitol today with patriots.”
Also charged was Josiah Colt, who authorities said was photographed dropping from the Senate gallery into its floor, one of the riot’s most iconic images, citing a Facebook video that emerged shortly after. ""I just got in the Capitol building. I was the first one that hopped down into the chamber,” the man the FBI identified as Colt says in the video, wearing a helmet and breathing heavily. Later he adds: ""I don’t know what to do. I’m in downtown D.C. I’m all over the news.”
Colt’s lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Derrick Evans, a newly elected state delegate from West Virginia, was charged after he posted a Facebook video of himself entering the Capitol, in which he said: ""We’re in, we’re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!” In a public statement on Thursday, Evans’s lawyer, John Bryan, said he ""did nothing wrong” and was exercising First Amendment rights.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Only a few protests have been permitted for next week's inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden in Washington, D.C., as officials implement unprecedented security measures amid warnings of possible attacks by groups involved in the Jan. 6 pro-Trump siege of the Capitol. 
Only four significant First Amendment protest applications for the National Mall and nearby parklands were made to the National Park Service for next week, according to the agency. At least two of these have been canceled, organizers of the events told Reuters. Some applications for planned events were submitted more than a year ago, before coronavirus pandemic lockdowns, social distancing and mask requirements began. 
In 2017, the NPS granted https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-protests/protests-will-aim-to-disrupt-trump-inauguration-organizers-idUSKBN14W2YS permits to 27 protest groups, some of which sought to disrupt President Donald Trump's inauguration. The NPS requires a permit for demonstrations of more than 25 people on most parkland locations within its jurisdiction. 
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser on Saturday requested https://mayor.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser%E2%80%99s-letter-us-department-homeland-security-acting-secretary-chad-wolf-regarding federal officials cancel Park Service public gathering permits issued through Jan 24 altogether, as officials amp up security measures in Washington, including road closures and 20,000 National Guards. 
This year's permits include two made a year ago, in anticipation of a second Trump inauguration. Representatives for Both DC Action Lab and the Answer Coalition said that they were no longer planning events given Biden's victory.
A pro-Trump group, ""Let America Hear Us, Roar For Trump"" also applied a year ago for a motorcycle rally permit at several district parks. The group's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page refers to a 2017 rally, and organizer Mark ""Ski"" Bischof could not be reached for comment.
Black Pact is advertising a ""March for Reparations"" event https://www.blackpact.org/events for Jan. 21, the day after the inauguration, at Black Lives Matter Plaza, the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. The application expects 5,000 participants. 
No permits were being granted for marches next week on district streets where the local police have jurisdiction, a D.C. Metropolitan Police spokeswoman said. 
Some streets, like Constitution Avenue, which Trump supporters marched on to the Capitol Jan. 6, are under the jurisdiction of the NPS. 
A spokesman for the agency said a decision had yet to be made on whether to close the National Mall, which runs from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial. 
During past inaugurations, hundreds of thousands of people have watched the president take the oath of office on big screen televisions positioned on the Mall. 
Mayor Bowser's mask order for pandemic requires masks outdoors when a person is expected to come into within six feet of others. Many participants in recent pro-Trump rallies have routinely ignored the mandate.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - As the first groups from Central America headed toward the Guatemalan border on Thursday as part of a caravan aiming to reach the United States, regional governments are using coronavirus measures as the latest tool to curtail migration.
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico issued a joint declaration this week imposing coordinated health measures to deter migration, including requirements to produce negative coronavirus tests at border checkpoints.
The tightening by Mexican and Central American authorities, coupled with pandemic-linked U.S. border restrictions in place since March, represent a sweeping effort to use public health regulations to deter movement along one of the world's busiest migration routes at a time when a fierce second wave of coronavirus is sweeping the region.
In Mexico, the pandemic has killed nearly 137,000 people and the capital's hospitals are spiking with COVID-19 cases.
This week's caravan, slated to depart Honduras on Friday, would be the first of the year and comes six days before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office. 
Yet, Central American and Mexican authorities are stepping up efforts to stop migrants well before the U.S. border, which will likely be a relief for Biden, whose aides have privately expressed concerns about the prospect of a growing numbers of migrants seeking to enter the United States in the early days of his administration.
On Thursday, Guatemala cited the pandemic in order to declare emergency powers in seven Guatemalan border provinces migrants frequently transit through en route to the Mexican border. The measures limit public demonstrations and allow authorities to disperse any public meeting, group or demonstration by force. 
Honduras and Guatemala have also announced they will deploy thousands of soldiers to preemptively stop caravan members not complying with health regulations.
""We barely have food to eat, how do they think we are going to pay for these (coronavirus) tests?"" said 29-year-old Ulises Santos from El Salvador, who is hoping to join the caravan.
Central America is reeling from economic crises, high rates of violence, and the devastating fallout of two major hurricanes that battered the region in November. 
Migration experts say the public health measures are part of a broader effort by Central American and Mexican authorities, under pressure from Washington, to stop migrants before they reach U.S. territory.
""The U.S. border is moving further and further south,"" said renowned Honduran human rights activist Ismael Moreno.
""The goal (of local police) is to stop migrants, whether through repression, threats, extortion, or requirements to present a COVID-19 test.""

38,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 04:40PM ET</span>","Top U.N. officials urge U.S. to revoke blacklisting of Yemen's Houthis, warn of famine","By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three top United Nations officials all called on the United States on Thursday to revoke its decision to designate Yemen's Houthis a foreign terrorist organization, warning it would push the country into a large-scale famine and chill peace efforts. 
U.N. Yemen mediator Martin Griffiths, U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock and U.N. food chief David Beasley issued their warnings during a U.N. Security Council meeting on Yemen. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres backed the call by his officials for Washington to reverse the designation, a U.N. spokesman said. 
""We fear that there will be inevitably a chilling effect on my efforts to bring the parties together,"" Griffiths told the 15-member body. ""The decision will contribute to the prospect of famine in Yemen and should be revoked based on humanitarian grounds at the earliest opportunity.""
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the people in need of aid. Yemenis fear the U.S. decision could further isolate them from the global financial system.
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country’s suffering is also worsened by an economic and currency collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The chief Houthi negotiator told Reuters on Thursday that the group will not walk away from peace talks with the United Nations and Saudi Arabia.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the move against the Iran-aligned Houthis on Sunday. It will come into effect on Jan. 19, the last full day in office of President Donald Trump's administration.
Yemen's Foreign Minister Ahmad Awad bin Mubarak told the Security Council his government welcomed the U.S. decision. 
President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. The designation could be revoked by Biden's administration. 
""We are struggling now without the designation. With the designation, it's going to be catastrophic. It literally is going to be a death sentence to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of innocent people in Yemen,"" said Beasley, a former governor of South Carolina.
""This designation - it needs to be reassessed; it needs to be re-evaluated. And quite frankly, it needs to be reversed,"" he said.
'RIGHT STEP'
A Biden transition official said they took note of the Trump administration to designate the Houthis and that ""the transition team is reviewing each one, and the incoming administration will render a verdict based exclusively on one criterion: the national interest.""
While the United Nations and aid groups help about a third of Yemen's 28 million people, Lowcock stressed commercial imports are key to ensuring millions more have access to food. 
He said a U.S. plan to issue licenses and exemptions to allow aid agencies to continue working will not prevent a famine in Yemen, which relies almost solely on imports.
""Aid agencies cannot – they simply cannot - replace the commercial import system,"" said Lowcock, warning the U.S. decision would push Yemen into a ""famine on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40 years.""
""What would prevent it? A reversal of the (U.S.) decision,"" he said. 
Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Mills told the Security Council and the U.N. officials that Washington was listening and the concerns raised ""are informing how we approach the designation implementation.""
""But we do believe that this step is the right move forward to send the right signal if we want the political process to move forward,"" Mills said. 
Several council members raised concerns. Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia urged the United States to review its decision. 
""This risks not only seriously exacerbating the humanitarian situation in the country, but also undermining U.N. efforts whose aim is to launch negotiations between the warring sides,"" Nebenzia told the council. 
The designation freezes any U.S.-related assets of the Houthis, bans Americans from doing business with them and makes it a crime to provide support or resources to the movement.
Beasley also raised the alarm on a massive shortfall in aid funding for Yemen. He called on ""the Gulf states, the Saudis to pick up the financial tab for the needs inside Yemen because the needs in other parts of the world are so great.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged nations around the world to maintain a unified front against Chinese detentions of foreign citizens, saying every country was vulnerable.
Trudeau made his remarks as China offered more consular access to two Canadian men it arrested in December 2018 and charged with spying. Canada has repeatedly called on its partners to press Beijing for their release.
""We have a tremendous level of alignment, not just with the United States but with allies around the world, to continually bring up the question of the coercive diplomacy that China is increasingly using,"" Trudeau said in an interview at the Reuters Next summit that aired on Thursday.
""We must all stand together because who knows whose citizens might be next?""
China detained the two men after Canadian police picked up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. arrest warrant. She is under house arrest in Vancouver as she fights extradition.
Syrine Khoury, a spokeswoman for Foreign Minister Marc Garneau, said Canada had obtained agreements involving increased family and consular access to the two men in recent months but gave no details.
A person familiar with the case said that since October, consular visits had been restored to levels seen before the pandemic. The families of the two men had also spoken to them once by phone, said the person, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
Khoury also said Canadian immigration officials had allowed Meng family members to visit her. Canada has strict travel restrictions to combat the coronavirus.
A spokesperson for Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino declined to comment when asked whether the permission for Meng's family was linked to the increased consular access.

40,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 03:20PM ET</span>","Senior U.S. Justice officials pushed family separations, watchdog finds","By Mimi Dwyer
(Reuters) - Senior leadership at the U.S. Department of Justice, including former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, knew that a 2018 policy that called for prosecutions of all migrants who crossed the border unlawfully would lead to family separations, a government watchdog report found on Thursday.
The Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) spent more than two years investigating the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy. The OIG report found officials aggressively pursued the policy, despite concerns from prosecutors and judges involved in a 2017 pilot program that separated 280 families in the El Paso, Texas, area. 
The policy directed government lawyers to prosecute all illegal border crossings, including people coming as families, which led to parents being separated from their children. 
The Department of Justice adopted the criminal prosecution policy across the entire border in April 2018, despite evidence that the government was having difficulty locating family members who were separated during the pilot program, the report found. 
Gene Hamilton, a Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyer, said Sessions ""thought it was the right thing to do"" despite the effect on families, the report said. The DOJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. attorneys expected to carry out the prosecutions were ""surprised"" when Border Patrol agents began sending them family cases for prosecution and had not been informed by headquarters of the change, the OIG found. 
U.S. President Donald Trump made cracking down on immigration a centerpiece of his administration, which ends on Jan. 20. When publicized, the family separations prompted international outrage, and officials reversed the policy just months after it was announced. 
Between May 5 and June 20, 2018, more than 3,000 children - including some under 5 years old - were taken into government custody when a parent was referred for prosecution, said the OIG. Currently, attorneys are still working to reunite families and have not located the parents of more than 600 children, according to a court filing in an ongoing court case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the policy.
The OIG conducted 45 interviews for the report, though former Attorney General Sessions refused to participate.
When the OIG asked former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein whether he knew the policy would result in the separation of families he said, ""I think the answer is yes."" 

In a statement issued Thursday, Rosenstein said ""zero tolerance"" was a ""failed policy that should never have been proposed or implemented ... I wish we all had done better.""

Local security forces have been dispatched to the village in Irumu territory to investigate, provincial interior minister Adjio Gidi said by phone.
""The death toll as of this afternoon is reported to be 46,"" Gidi said.
He said the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) were behind the raid. The Ugandan armed group is believed to have carried out a string of massacres in eastern Congo, killing more than 1,000 civilians since the start of 2019, according to U.N. figures.
After being alerted to the latest violence, troops went to the village and are in the process of recovering bodies, local army spokesman Jules Ngongo said. He did not say how many had been killed.
Congo’s eastern borderlands with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi are home to a constellation of over 100 different militias, many remnants of its brutal civil wars that officially ended in 2003.
On Sunday, unidentified attackers killed at least six rangers in an ambush in eastern Congo’s Virunga National Park, a sanctuary for endangered mountain gorillas.
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for many suspected ADF attacks in the past, although U.N. experts have not been able to confirm any direct link between the two groups.

The statement, made by attorney Mark Richards in a court filing, came after prosecutors asked a court to modify bond conditions due to videos showing Rittenhouse in a bar and allegedly making gestures associated with white power groups.
""The State's bond motion is a not-so-thinly veiled attempt to interject the issue of race into a case that is about a person's right to self-defense,"" Richards wrote in a response to the allegations by prosecutors.
Rittenhouse, 18, has been charged in Kenosha County, Wisconsin with first-degree homicide and five other criminal counts related to the shootings, in which two people were killed and a third was wounded. His lawyers have indicated they plan to argue their client acted in self-defense.
On Wednesday prosecutors asked the Kenosha County Circuit Court to alter the terms of his release to ban any consumption of alcohol, the display of any ""white power"" or ""white supremacy"" signs or gestures and association with any known members of militias or white supremacist groups.
The Kenosha County District Attorney's Office said that Rittenhouse, his mother and several other adults went to Pudgy's Pub in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin on Jan. 5 where photographic and video evidence showed he drank beer and posed for a photo with two men flashing the ""OK"" sign, a gesture used as a symbol by white supremacist groups.
Prosecutors also said Rittenhouse was serenaded by men at the pub with ""Proud of Your Boy,"", a song associated with the Proud Boys, which the Southern Poverty Law Center classifies as a hate group, citing its anti-Muslim and misogynist rhetoric.
While an 18-year-old can legally consume alcohol in a bar in Wisconsin if accompanied by a parent, in Illinois the legal age is 21, prosecutors noted in their motion. Rittenhouse, who is out on a $2 million bond, is a resident of Illinois.

Richards said he did not object to modifying his bond conditions to prohibit alcohol.

44,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 02:46PM ET</span>",Michigan's former governor and health director charged in Flint water crisis,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Michigan's former governor, former health director and seven others were charged on Thursday with crimes stemming from lead contamination of the city of Flint's water supply as prosecutors detailed the findings of a yearslong investigation. 
Nick Lyon, former director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and Eden Wells, who was the state's chief medical executive, were each charged with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the deaths of nine people who caught Legionnaires’ disease.
Former Governor Rick Snyder was charged with two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty for his role in a debacle that afflicted the predominantly African-American city and became emblematic of racial inequality in the United States.
Lyon, Wells and Snyder have indicated they plan to fight the charges. They were among the nine defendants arraigned on Thursday on a total of 42 criminal counts in Genesee County courts.
The charges are the culmination of a yearslong criminal investigation that ran parallel to civil litigation. The civil proceedings last year yielded a settlement worth more than $600 million for victims of the water crisis that is awaiting court approval.
Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said she and her colleagues reviewed millions of documents and drew on the expertise of external epidemiologists.
""Pure and simple this case is about justice, truth, accountability, poisoned children, lost lives, shattered families that are still not whole and simply giving a damn about all of humanity,"" she told a news conference in Flint.
Flint's troubles began in 2014 after the city switched its water supply to the Flint River from Lake Huron to cut costs. Corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes, tainting the drinking water and causing a Legionnaires' outbreak.
The contamination also prompted several lawsuits from parents who said their children were showing dangerously high blood levels of lead, which can cause development disorders. Lead can be toxic and children are especially vulnerable.
The law firm representing Lyon, Willey & Chamberlain, said their client was innocent.
""Our hearts go out to Flint citizens who have endured the fallout from that decision. But it does not help the people of Flint – or our criminal justice system – for the State to charge innocent people with crimes,"" it said in a statement.
Snyder, a Republican who has been out of office for two years, was governor when the city of some 100,000 residents was under the control of a state-appointed manager in 2014. He was succeeded by Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. 
The date of the misdemeanor offenses in charging documents filed against Snyder and posted online was listed as April 25, 2014, the day the city switched water systems. Each of the two counts carries a maximum penalty of a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
Snyder has repeatedly apologized for the state's poor handling of the crisis. His lawyer, Brian Lennon, alleged that the prosecution of his former client was politically motivated.
""These unjustified allegations do nothing to resolve a painful chapter in the history of our state,"" Lennon said in a statement. ""We are confident Gov. Snyder will be fully exonerated if this flimsy case goes to trial.""
Prosecutor Worthy said investigators followed the facts without regard for politics.
Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud, the other lead prosecutor on the case, said their ongoing grand jury investigation could yield additional charges.

""The Flint Water Crisis is not some relic of the past. At this very moment the people of Flint continue to suffer from the categorical failure of public officials at all levels of government,"" Hammoud said.

The indictment, filed in Central Islip, New York, and unsealed on Thursday, charged the individuals with conspiracies to support terrorists, commit acts of terrorism and finance terrorism, according to the department. 
""The indictment announced today is the highest-reaching and most sweeping indictment targeting MS-13 and its command and control structure in U.S. history,"" acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen said in a statement.
The department said that Borromeo Enrique Henriquez, considered the most powerful member of Ranfla Nacional, which the U.S. government said comprises the highest level of MS-13 leadership, as well as 10 other people were in custody in El Salvador. The United States would ""explore options for their extradition,"" it said.
Three of the defendants, Fredy Ivan Jandres-Parada, Cesar Humberto Lopez-Larios and Hugo Armando Quinteros-Mineros remain at large and should be considered armed and dangerous, the department said.
The FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) have offered $20,000 in rewards for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the three, the statement said.
In July, the department said it was stepping up a crackdown on the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) gang and would seek the death penalty against an accused New York gang leader facing murder charges.

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously linked the fight against the gang with his campaign against illegal immigration. Critics of the administration's tactics argue that the crackdown has also unlawfully detained immigrant teens accused of gang affiliation.

46,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 02:45PM ET</span>",U.N. chief Guterres tries again to appoint a Libya mediator,"By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres plans to appoint veteran diplomat Jan Kubis as his envoy in Libya nearly a year after the last mediator stepped down, according to a letter to the U.N. Security Council seen by Reuters on Thursday. 
If there are no objections by any of the 15-member council by Friday evening, Kubis will succeed Ghassan Salame, who quit the role in March last year due to stress. Salame's deputy Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) has been acting Libya envoy.
Kubis, a former Slovakian foreign minister, is currently the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon. He has also served as the U.N. special envoy in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
The planned appointment of Kubis comes after the Security Council approved in December a plan by Guterres' to name Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov to the Libya role. But a week later Mladenov said he could not take up the position due to ""personal and family reasons.""
That followed months of disagreement in the Security Council over a U.S. push to split the role to have one person run the U.N. political mission and a special envoy to focus on mediation. The council eventually agreed to that proposal in September.
The proposed appointment of Mladenov - who was then the U.N. Middle East envoy - was delayed, said diplomats, because some council members wanted Guterres to first name who would succeed Mladenov as mediator between Israel and the Palestinians.
In December the council approved Norwegian Tor Wennesland to replace Mladenov. 
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. In October, the two major sides in the country's war - the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) - agreed a ceasefire. 

Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.

It said satellite imagery showed fires burning and fresh signs of destruction at the Shimelba and Hitsats camps for refugees from neighbouring Eritrea, who fled political persecution and compulsory military service before the conflict in Tigray.
""These are concrete indications of major violations of international law,"" Filippo Grandi, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement.
Reuters published satellite images on Tuesday from California-based company Planet Lab Inc that showed destruction in the two camps during the first week of January.
Aid agencies say they have been unable to reach the camps since conflict erupted in Tigray in November between Ethiopian federal forces and the party that used to govern the region.
Spokespeople for Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and the government's emergency task force for the Tigray crisis did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Reuters was unable to independently verify events in Tigray as the government is restricting access to the region.
In December, a U.N. team was shot at when it tried to reach the Shimelba camp. Two diplomatic sources told Reuters the U.N. team had encountered uniformed troops from neighbouring Eritrea.
At the time, Ethiopia and Eritrea denied there were Eritrean troops in Tigray. A senior Ethiopian general has since said they had crossed into the region uninvited.
Grandi said there had been reports of additional military incursions over the last 10 days.
""I continue to receive many reliable reports and first-hand accounts of ongoing insecurity and allegations of grave and distressing human rights abuses, including killings, targeted abductions and forced return of refugees to Eritrea,"" he said.
Eritrea's information minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Grandi also said UNHCR teams had been unable to assist thousands of Eritrean refugees who continue to flee the camps.
""Refugees arriving on foot in Shire town in Tigray are emaciated, begging for aid that is not available,"" he said.
""I have impressed upon the Ethiopian leadership the urgency of ensuring the protection of refugees, preventing forced return, and keeping refugee camps safe from attacks and other threats from armed actors,"" he said.

The Andean country signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016, ending the leftist rebel group's part in an armed conflict that has left 260,000 dead and millions displaced. 
Bearing the same FARC acronym, the rebel group turned into a political party which opposes the government of President Ivan Duque and insists that implementation of the peace deal is advancing too slowly. 
The deal permitted 13,000 former FARC members to return to civilian life. Implementation of the peace agreement has faced challenges, including the decision of several former commanders - who argued the deal was not being fulfilled - to return to arms, and the killings of over 250 former rebels across Colombia.
The government blames FARC dissidents who rejected the 2016 agreement, as well as other illegal armed groups involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining, for killing the former FARC guerrilla members. 
""We need (ex-combatants) to continue within this process so that the levels of violence... the country experienced in the past never return,"" Emilio Archila, the presidential adviser for implementing the peace deal, said at a news conference, adding that the overall level of violence had fallen across Colombia since the deal was signed. 
The government has approved 2,300 individual and group projects involving 6,045 demobilized FARC members, at a cost of $17 million, Archila said. 
Colombia's army and police force protect 24 areas where hundreds of ex-guerrillas and their families live, Archila said, adding that there are 230 personal protection schemes for former FARC leaders. 
""The objective is that there are zero deaths (of ex-FARC members) and no attacks against them,"" Archila said. ""We are working so that the process of reincorporation can never be undone.""

49,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 02:05PM ET</span>",Mexico softens rules for controversial new foreign agents law,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Thursday published rules implementing a new law on foreign agents, such as U.S. drug-enforcement officials, watering down legislation that caused major friction with the United States and raised fears it could block counter-narcotics cooperation.
Lawmakers last month amended Mexico's security law to restrict the work of foreign security officials on Mexican soil despite fierce opposition from Washington, straining ties and calling into question extensive cooperation with the United States.
The change in law, requested by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, was widely seen as retaliation against the United States following the arrest on drug charges of former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles in October.
Lopez Obrador's overhaul of the legislation was also perceived as an attempt to create leverage with the administration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, which wants to reorient its relationship with Mexico, analysts said.
The dust-up between Washington and Mexico saw some of Mexico's allies raise concerns to the government over the changes, leading to a softer final interpretation of the law, said Eduardo Guerrero, a security analyst at Lantia Consultores.
""They wanted to lower the volume and tone with these guidelines so they don't exacerbate a possible confrontation with Biden and these (U.S.) officials taking office,"" added Guerrero, a former Mexican intelligence official.
The new rules detail the mechanisms governing how foreign agents will work with Mexican government counterparts, including sending only very limited details about meetings they hold.
An earlier proposal by the presidency obligated foreign agents to share information obtained on Mexican soil and local government officials to report all interactions with foreign agents. 
According to the new guidelines, Mexican public servants must report any exchange of information up to three days after the contact. However, the report will only have basic details about people involved and not contain sensitive information.
The U.S. Embassy in Mexico did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The rules appear to guarantee the privacy of investigations, suggesting U.S. authorities will not have to share widely their findings in Mexico, a key concern for U.S. agents worried that Mexican institutions have been compromised by cash-rich drug cartels.
There are also no restrictions on electronic communication, which is the bulk of interaction between the two sides, especially during the pandemic.
Guerrero argued the new rules are likely to be loosely interpreted and enforced, while coordination will continue.

""It has to continue, because we rely a lot on American intelligence,"" he said.

50,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 01:25PM ET</span>","Yemenis fear cuts to imports, remittances after U.S. blacklists Houthis","SANAA/DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemenis fear a U.S. decision to blacklist the Houthi movement could further isolate them from the global financial system, depriving the war-battered country of vital remittances and hampering the flow of imports. 
Yemen's war and the ensuing economic collapse has left 80% of the population reliant on aid. On Thursday, the United Nations' aid chief warned that U.S. sanctions would push the country into a famine on a scale not seen for nearly 40 years.
The World Bank estimates one in 10 Yemenis rely on remittances, already down sharply due to the coronavirus pandemic. Severe inflation has put many basic goods out of reach, foreign reserves have dwindled and a divided central bank has struggled to pay public-sector salaries.
""I live in a state of fear. I heard if the American decision is implemented, my brother won't be able to send money. I will lose my family's only source of food,"" said government employee Ahmed Hassan, 43, who has not received wages for four years.
Yosra Abdullah's family, who also live in Houthi-controlled northern Yemen, rely on relatives living in Saudi Arabia and the United States to survive.
""If the decision is enacted, it will hit remittances, the family situation will deteriorate,"" she told Reuters while shopping at a supermarket in the capital Sanaa.
There was no sign of people rushing to stock up on goods at markets and shops in Sanaa visited by Reuters on Thursday ahead of the designation of the Iran-aligned Houthi group as a foreign terrorist organisation going into effect on Jan. 19.
But many fear trade and commercial operations will be paralysed in a country that imports 90% of its food.
Foreign banks were wary of dealing with Yemen before this designation, which will penalise institutions with links to the United States should they deal with Houthi entities. 
""The biggest problem since the conflict began is money transfers into Yemen ... We try to get it from some Arab countries, but from Europe it is largely banned,"" said Adnan Shiban, who runs a charity kitchen supported by foreign donations. ""It will get worse.""
Washington sees the Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sana in late 2014 and now hold Yemen's most populated areas, as an extension of Iranian influence in the region. The Houthis deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system. 
""IN THE DARK"" 
The U.N. and NGOs are lobbying Washington to reverse the designation. Neither aid groups nor importers have been informed officially about details of the sanctions or planned measures to ensure essential imports and aid flows.
""We are feeling in the dark,"" said a humanitarian worker who declined to be named.
The flow of imports is already painfully slow: once funds and ships are secured, vessels entering Houthi-run Hodeidah port must be cleared by a Djibouti-based U.N. inspection mechanism, and then by the Saudi Arabia-led military coalition that has been battling the Houthis since 2015. 
Yemen's humanitarian response plan for 2020 received half of the $3.38 billion needed and aid agencies fear the designation may further discourage donors.
The head of the World Food Programme warned on Thursday that the Houthi designation ""is going to be a death sentence to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of innocent people in Yemen"".

ISTANBUL/LONDON (Reuters) - China is stealing a march on Western drugmakers in the COVID-19 vaccine race in developing nations, with Indonesia and Turkey rolling out huge campaigns with a Chinese shot this week, Brazil due to follow soon, and even EU member Hungary signing up.
Scientists in some Western countries say China has been too slow to publish trial data. Public reports so far about how well its vaccines work have been inconsistent, which the Chinese firms attribute to variations in methodology.
Still, countries with hundreds of millions of people desperate for a vaccine think China's shots are good enough.
As Western drugmakers struggle to meet demand at home, Beijing has sent millions of doses round the world of CoronaVac, made by Sinovac Biotech, and is also marketing a separate vaccine made by another company, Sinopharm.
The exports come even as China battles its own flare-up in infections, which has put more than 28 million people in lockdown. China has administered 10 million vaccine doses at home.
Though some studies on the Sinovac shot have reported lower effectiveness rates than some Western products, the countries buying them say they appear effective at preventing the most serious, deadly form of COVID-19.
Perhaps most importantly, they are also easy to administer, allowing the quick launch of large-scale programmes to save lives and prevent health systems from being overwhelmed.
Turkey launched its programme on Thursday with the Sinovac shot, and by late afternoon said it had already vaccinated more than 200,000 people - more in a few hours than France has managed in three weeks. Health workers went first.
""We spent around 10 months in white overalls, supporting people as they struggle for life. Health workers know very well that this situation cannot be taken lightly and that the vaccine is needed,"" Surgeon General Nurettin Yiyit said.
Hungary, which has complained about the ""scandalously"" slow rollout of vaccines bought by the European Union on behalf of its 27 member states, reached a deal on Thursday to buy the Sinopharm vaccine. If approved, it would become the first EU country to authorise a Chinese vaccine.
'BREAK THE CHAIN'
While all countries are likely to need more than one type of vaccine to meet demand, China has been quick off the mark in shipping doses to countries at the back of the queue for supplies of Western shots.
Many developing countries may still have months to wait for their first vaccines.
Meanwhile, Turkey already has 3 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine in its stocks, and Brazil has 6 million doses. Brazil is expected to begin injecting them next week.
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo was the first to get a shot of the Sinovac vaccine to kick off one of the world's biggest vaccine programmes on Wednesday. It expects to have 30 million Sinovac doses by the end of March out of an order of more than 122 million in 2022.
""Vaccination is important to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission and give protection to us and safety to every Indonesian and help accelerate economic recovery,"" the president said.
The Western company competing most directly in developing countries with Sinovac so far is AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), whose vaccine developed with Oxford University is also cheap and easy to deliver. 
It will be the basis of the biggest vaccine programme of them all, which India is expected to launch on Saturday. More than 5 million doses were flown across the country this week in preparation.
India's government says it will pay less than $3 a dose for the first 100 million shots, produced under license by India's Serum Institute. 
Russia will launch a new, scaled-up version of its vaccination programme next week, using its own Sputnik V shot, which it is also heavily marketing in developing countries. It has won approval in Argentina, Belarus and Serbia, although so far it has been slow to produce doses for export at a big scale.
Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian sovereign wealth fund which backs the vaccine, said in an interview at the Reuters NEXT conference that Russia would seek EU approval for the vaccine next month and expects to win 25% of global market share.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi movement will not walk away from peace talks with the United Nations and Saudi Arabia despite the U.S. decision to designate the Iran-aligned group as a foreign terrorist organisation, the Houthi chief negotiator told Reuters.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the designation, which will trigger sanctions against the movement and three of its leaders, will come into effect on Jan. 19 at the end of the Trump administration's term.
""These (peace talks) have nothing to do with the (U.S.) decision which will not limit our movements nor our international relations,"" Mohammed Abdulsalam said on Thursday, adding this applied to both U.N. efforts and ceasefire talks with Riyadh. 
""We will not stop our efforts to reach peace in Yemen ... it is our responsibility to talk, to end the war and the blockade,"" said Abdulsalam, who is also a Houthi spokesman.
Earlier on Thursday, three top United Nations officials called on the United States to revoke its move against the Houthis, warning it would push Yemen into a large-scale famine and chill peace efforts.
U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths, who has been leading efforts to restart negotiations last held in December 2018 to end the conflict, told the Security Council the U.S. move could have ""a chilling effect"" on efforts to bring the parties together and should be revoked on humanitarian grounds.
The United Nations has warned that blacklisting the Houthis, who control the most populous areas of Yemen, could push Yemen into a famine on a scale the world has not seen for decades.
""The decision will have no political or military impact whatsoever, except that it will worsen the humanitarian sitituation in Yemen which is already under blockade,"" Abdulsalam said.
The Saudi-led military coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis after they ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital, Sanaa, has imposed stringent measures on imports into Yemen.
Saudi Arabia, which has come under attack from cross-border Houthi missiles and drones, has welcomed the U.S. move to blacklist the Houthis, saying it would ""neutralise"" the threat posed by the group by depriving it of arms and funds and would bring it back to the negotiating table.
The designation freezes any U.S.-related assets of the Houthis, bans Americans from doing business with them and makes it a crime to provide support or resources to the movement.
The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.
Riyadh launched talks with the Houthis last year as it seeks a way out of the costly and unpopular conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people and left 80% of Yemen's population reliant on aid with millions facing starvation.
Abdulsalam said any agreement on a nationwide ceasefire should include ""humanitarian solutions"" allowing fuel imports, reopening of airports and ports, and ""make room for political talks"".

53,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 01:00PM ET</span>",U.S. commission says China possibly committed 'genocide' against Xinjiang Muslims,"By David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has possibly committed ""genocide"" in its treatment of Uighurs and other minority Muslims in its western region of Xinjiang, a bipartisan commission of the U.S. Congress said in a report released on Thursday. 
The Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) said new evidence had emerged in the past year that ""crimes against humanity - and possibly genocide - are occurring."" The CECC also accused China of harassing Uighurs in the United States. 
China has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in Xinjiang that it describes as ""vocational training centers"" to stamp out extremism and give people new skills and which others have called concentration camps.
The United Nations says at least 1 million Uighurs and other Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang. Faith leaders, activist groups and others have said crimes against humanity, including genocide, are taking place there. Beijing denies abuse accusations.
The CECC report called for a formal U.S. ""determination on whether atrocities are being committed"" in Xinjiang, and such a determination is required within 90 days of U.S. legislation passed on Dec. 27.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in his final days in office before President-elect Joe Biden succeeds President Donald Trump on Jan. 20, has already been weighing a determination, although given current turmoil in Washington, officials have played down the possibility of an announcement before that.
CECC co-chair, Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, called China's actions to crush human rights in the past year ""shocking and unprecedented"" and urged Congress and the incoming Biden administration to hold Beijing accountable.
""The United States must continue to stand with the people of China in their struggle and lead the world in a united and coordinated response to the human rights abuses of the Chinese government,"" he said.
Relations between the world's two biggest economic powerhouses have plunged to the lowest level in recent years over disagreements on issues including human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, espionage and a sweeping national security law imposed on Hong Kong.
Experts say a genocide determination would be an enormous embarrassment for China, the world's second-largest economy and a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
It could also pose problems for Biden by complicating his dealings with Beijing, although his campaign had already declared, before the November election, that genocide was occurring in Xinjiang.
In October, Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said Beijing was perpetrating ""something close to"" genocide in Xinjiang and other officials have referred to concentration camps there.
Under international law, crimes against humanity are defined as widespread and systematic, whereas the burden of proof for genocide - the intent to destroy part of a population - can be more difficult to prove.
Expectations that Pompeo might declare genocide were raised in June when he labeled as ""shocking"" and ""disturbing"" reports that China was using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against Muslims.
He was referring to a report last year about the situation in Xinjiang by German researcher Adrian Zenz, which the CECC report also cited. 
Zenz said his findings represented the strongest evidence yet that Beijing's Xinjiang policies met one of the criteria cited in the U.N. genocide convention, namely ""imposing measures intended to prevent births within the (targeted) group.""
A U.S. genocide declaration would mean that countries would have to think hard about allowing companies to do business with Xinjiang, a leading global supplier of cotton. It would also raise pressure for further U.S. sanctions against China.

On Wednesday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the United States was imposing a region-wide ban on all cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations that they are made with forced labor by detained Uighurs.

Berlusconi, 84, underwent major heart surgery in 2016 and has also survived prostate cancer. Last September, he was hospitalised after contracting coronavirus, ""the most dangerous challenge"" of his life, he told reporters.
""I am in good health. Due to the prudence of my doctors I had to go to hospital for some checks,"" he said in a statement.
Berlusconi remains head of the opposition Forza Italia party. His illness comes as Italy has been hit by political chaos after a junior coalition party quit the government, depriving it of a majority in parliament.
""My activities continue as usual, in close contact with my staff at this very difficult time for the country,"" Berlusconi said.
Newspapers have speculated that some Forza Italia lawmakers might agree to desert party ranks and help prop up Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to prevent an early election.
Alberto Zangrillo, the media tycoon's personal doctor, said he saw Berlusconi on Monday and decided to transfer him to a nearby hospital because he did not think it prudent to bring him to Italy, which is some 15 km (10 miles) from the city-state.
Berlusconi has spent much of his time recuperating from coronavirus at his daughter Marina's house in Provence, southeast France.
Shares in Mediaset (OTC:MDIUY), the broadcaster controlled by the Berlusconi family, jumped as much as 2.9% on Thursday after initial reports of his latest health scare.
Traders cited speculation about potential ownership changes at the group if Berlusconi's condition worsened.

Mediaset has been at the centre of a legal battle between Berlusconi's family holding company Fininvest and its second-largest shareholder, French media giant Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY), over the past five years.

Athens has agreed to acquire advanced fighter aircraft as it moves ahead with plans to beef up its military capacity during a dispute with neighbouring Turkey over energy resources in the Mediterranean.
The agreement for six new and 12 used Rafale jets is expected to be signed by France and Greece in Athens this month and the first deliveries are expected during the first half of the year, the government has said. 
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' conservative government has said it wants to invest in the armed forces, increasing personnel, acquiring new frigates, helicopters and drones, and upgrading its existing fleet of F-16 fighters.
Parliament is also expected to vote next week on a bill extending Greece's western territorial waters in the Ionian Sea to 12 nautical miles from six, Mitsotakis told local ANT1 TV.
While that vote does not directly affect the eastern and southern Aegean, where Greece and Turkey have competing claims, Athens has said it reserves the right under international law to a 12-mile maritime limit across its whole territory.
Turkey has said it would regard staking such a claim in the Aegean as a ""casus belli"" or reason for war.

56,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 12:32PM ET</span>",Ugandans choose between long-time leader and popstar politician,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandans wearing face masks to brave the pandemic turned out in force on Thursday to vote in a election pitting long-time leader Yoweri Museveni against popular singer and lawmaker Bobi Wine.
Long lines of voters snaked out of polling stations in the capital Kampala, a stronghold for an opposition galvanized by Wine despite a campaign scarred by deadly crackdowns.
Police and soldiers patrolled the streets of Kampala during the day and the city was calm as night fell. A curfew in force since March because of COVID-19 comes in at 9 p.m. (1800 GMT).
After polls closed at 4 p.m., hundreds of Wine supporters in Kampala returned to their polling stations to heed his call to ""protect the vote"" by watching the count. At the station where Wine voted, security forces chased his supporters away.
At three polling stations Reuters visited during counting, cheers rose up from throngs of young people every time an election agent raised a ballot cast for Wine. There was silence when the president's name was read out.
""I know Museveni always rigs to stay in power. This time we are staying to watch each step of the process,"" said Sam Ndaula, 26, a roadside vendor.
Reggae artist and lawmaker Bobi Wine, 38, is channelling the anger of many young Ugandans who say former guerrilla leader Museveni, now 76, is an out-of-touch dictator failing to tackle unemployment, corruption and surging public debt. 
Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, calls Wine an upstart backed by foreign governments and homosexuals and says his administration guarantees stability and progress, including much-needed hydropower dams and roads. 
The government in the East African country of nearly 46 million people ordered an internet blackout until further notice on Wednesday, a day after it banned all social media and messaging apps.
There are 17.7 million registered voters and results are expected within 48 hours. Turnout looked robust, based on footage from polling stations broadcast by private TV channels.
Voting started late at six polling stations visited by Reuters as ballots did not arrive on time. Polling also started late in some places due to glitches with biometric voting machines, said Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Mulindwa, spokesman for the ruling National Resistance Movement party.
MILITARY BACKING
Though Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, has the momentum of energized and aggrieved supporters behind him, Museveni remains the frontrunner to win with the well-equipped army and police behind him, analysts say.
Police arrested about 30 people at the Hotel Africana in Kampala on allegations that they were creating an illegal parallel tallying centre, a police official at the scene, who declined to be named, told Reuters. 
The opposition Forum for Democratic Change party said those arrested were local observers from Citizens Watch - IT, a coalition of civil society groups. It could not immediately be reached for comment.
""We have made every effort to observe and watch this election, and we will know the answer,"" Wine said after casting his ballot. He later said his phone had been blocked and urged supporters to be vigilant as he tried to contact them.
Nearly 80% of Ugandans are under the age of 30, meaning they have never known a president other than Museveni, who says his experience makes him a good leader.
""I'm tired of Museveni because he has no new ideas,"" said Joseph Kinobe, 40, a mason waiting to cast his ballot for Wine.
There has been more campaign violence than in previous elections, with dozens killed when security forces cracked down on Wine's rallies. Opposition candidates, supporters and campaign staff have been repeatedly arrested.
""If you try to disturb peace, you will have yourself to blame. The security forces, following the law, are ready to deal with any troublemaker,"" Museveni, dressed in a military camouflage jacket, warned this week in a television broadcast.
The government says it is stopping illegal gatherings during the COVID-19 crisis. The opposition says the bans on rallies in some parts of Uganda are a smokescreen for repression.

A 31-year-old motorcycle taxi driver, Muhamad Barugahare, said Museveni was the only one who could guarantee peace. ""We don't want to gamble with this young man,"" he said about Wine.

DAKAR (Reuters) - The United Nations on Thursday called for an investigation after Reuters reported that Cameroonian soldiers opened fire on fleeing civilians during a weekend raid, killing up to nine people. 
Three witnesses told Reuters that soldiers entered the village of Mautu in the South West region - at the heart of a separatist insurgency - raided homes and shot civilians as they ran for cover under nearby cocoa bushes.
The Cameroonian military denies wrongdoing. It said it was conducting a raid on separatist positions when it came under fire and had killed what it labelled ""terrorists"". 
""Deeply concerned & saddened by the attack on Mautu ... that claimed the lives of many civilians. I call for an investigation into this attack,"" said the head of the U.N.'s Central Africa office, François Louncény Fall, on Twitter.
Britain also expressed concern.
""There must be an urgent and impartial investigation, and the perpetrators must be brought to justice,"" the British High Commission in Yaounde said on Twitter.
For four years the army has clashed with Anglophone separatist fighters among the forests and cocoa farms of western Cameroon. Over 3,000 people have died in the violence, which has intensified since the start of this year.
The witnesses said they saw nine dead people, including a child and an old woman. None of the dead was a separatist fighter, they said. 
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it was treating four people from the village, all with gunshot wounds: a young child, two elderly patients and a young woman. 
International players have long called for peace. Abuses on both sides have made talks difficult. 
Sunday's attack comes as three soldiers face trial for their alleged involvement in the killing of 21 civilians last year in a village in the North West region.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, giving a rare insight into his future plans, said he wanted to serve Canadians for a number of years to come, and shied away from saying who he thought should succeed him.
Trudeau, speaking at the Reuters Next conference, also said he was opposed to the idea of obliging people to carry digital proof that they had been vaccinated against COVID-19.
Trudeau's ruling Liberals only have a minority in the House of Commons, which means he relies on the opposition to govern and can be brought down at any time.
Senior Liberals say they expect an election some time this year, and some privately question how much longer he might want to stay in power.
Trudeau, 49, has three school-age children. He first took over as prime minister in November 2015 and has at times appeared tired amid the relentless COVID-19 crisis. He admitted dealing with the pandemic had been hard, but made clear he had no plans to quit soon.
""I've still got a lot to do in terms of serving this country, so I'm looking forward to a number of more years of serving Canadians,"" he said in an interview aired on Thursday.
The comments were the clearest signal he has given that his political ambitions are far from exhausted.
Trudeau came to power promising to focus on causes such as feminism and the environment. But he quickly found himself having to deal with issues such as how to handle U.S. President Donald Trump and then the pandemic.
He has come to rely heavily on Chrystia Freeland, a close ally, who now occupies the positions of both finance minister and deputy prime minister. Liberal insiders say this would give her an advantage in a future leadership race.
Asked whether Freeland might one day become Liberal leader, Trudeau replied: ""My responsibility is to bring around me the best possible team I can to serve Canadians ... I won't speculate on what could happen years down the road.""
The Liberal government has spent more than C$200 billion in direct aid to help people and businesses survive the pandemic and Trudeau reiterated Ottawa planned to spend another C$100 billion over the next few years to kick-start an economic recovery.
But he made clear he opposed a vaccine passport for people who had received inoculations, an idea already being developed in Denmark, saying it was fraught with challenges.
""I think the indications that the vast majority of Canadians are looking to be vaccinated will get us to a good place without having to take more extreme measures that could have real divisive impacts on community and country,"" he said.

Authorities imposed a nationwide nighttime curfew and closed all schools in November to fight a rise in daily coronavirus infection rates to about 10,000.
Romania has some of the European Union's least developed healthcare infrastructure and has had of the highest fatality rates in the bloc's eastern wing since the virus was first detected in February 2020.
""From February 8, when the second semester begins, most schools will reopen, given that the pandemic evolves approximately the same as in recent weeks,"" Iohannis said.
Those cities with infection rates exceeding 6 per thousand inhabitants over a two-week horizon will still need to resort exclusively to online tuition. Romania has about 2.8 million students.
Romanian schools stayed basically shut for most of last year, with a brief, two-month reopening in September-October. Surveys showed that a majority of students, teachers and parents saw the quality of education dropping last year from 2019.
About 3,500 new cases were confirmed in the space of the last 24 hours, raising the total number of infections to 685,000 of whom 615,000 recovered.
More than 17,000 people have died since the beginning of the outbreak in a country of 20 million people.

62,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>","Canada, allies expect Biden to re-engage U.S. on world stage - Trudeau","By Amran Abocar and Steve Scherer
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada and other U.S. allies are looking to President-elect Joe Biden to re-engage with the world on such issues as climate change and free trade, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a Reuters Next interview aired on Thursday. 
The Liberal Party prime minister also said the U.S. electoral system and its institutions had held up following last week's violent attack on the U.S. Capitol by what he called ""a small, angry mob.""
""There is a need for a re-engaged United States in global circles,"" said Trudeau, 49, who took office more than five years ago. Biden, who defeated U.S. President Donald Trump in a November election, will be sworn in on Wednesday.
""One of the things that a lot of the traditional allies and friends of the United States are looking forward to is a re-engagement on some of the big themes, whether it's freer trade, climate change, protecting democracy or coordinating against some of the rise of authoritarianism we're seeing around the world,"" he said. 
Trump often clashed with traditional allies on trade. He imposed tariffs on Canadian aluminum and steel and paralyzed the World Trade Organization's role as global arbiter on trade by blocking appointments to its appeals panel.
On climate, Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement that set up a global framework to reduce carbon emissions, and he seemed more at ease with leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin than with NATO allies, whom he berated for not spending enough on their armed forces.
""We're seeing a world that is changing rapidly. The rise of a much more assertive and sometimes problematic China, the shifts in poles of power around the world, the rise and strengthening of Asia as an economic focal point. These are things that are needing to be responded to,"" Trudeau said.
Last week Trudeau said Trump and other U.S. politicians had incited the violence on Washington's Capitol Hill.
""The democratic principles and the structures around (the U.S.) electoral process will not be stopped or disrupted by a small, angry mob, however disconcerting and alarming that can be,"" he told Reuters in reference to an FBI warning of armed protests before Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration.
""I have confidence that Americans who are concerned about defending their democracy will do what is necessary and what is right to keep themselves and their institutions safe long into the future, through this unpredictable moment.""
Trudeau said he aims to meet Biden soon after the inauguration, with climate change high on his agenda. 
Biden's ambitious climate change plan, which includes $2 trillion in investment for clean-energy infrastructure over four years, could pressure Canada to act more aggressively on its own climate policies.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A mechanical engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was arrested on U.S. charges that he failed to disclose his ties to the Chinese government when seeking federal grant money.
Federal prosecutors in Boston on Thursday charged Gang Chen, a Chinese-born mechanical engineer and nanotechnologist, with defrauding the U.S. Department of Energy when seeking grants and failing to disclose on a tax return a China-based bank account.
A representative for MIT did not respond immediately to requests for comment. An attorney for Chen also did not respond to a request for comment. 
The case is the latest to emerge from a U.S. Justice Department crackdown on Chinese influence within universities amid concerns about spying and intellectual property theft by the Chinese government.
According to a criminal complaint, Chen was involved in various efforts to promote China's technological and scientific development, including acting as an ""overseas expert"" for the Chinese government at the request of its New York consulate.
Prosecutors said that he also received money from various Chinese entities and helped review and assess grant applications for the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC), which operates similarly to U.S. grant-funding agencies.
But prosecutors said he never disclosed his work for the NNSFC or other Chinese affiliations when he applied for grants from the Energy Department or even to his employer, MIT.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow's prison service said on Thursday it would take all measures necessary to arrest Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny after he returns to Russia this weekend, a move that could be a prelude to him being jailed for three-and-a-half years. 
Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's fiercest opponents, has said he will fly back to Russia on Sunday for the first time since he was taken to Germany for treatment in August following his poisoning with a Novichok nerve agent.
The Kremlin denies involvement in his poisoning, says it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned and that he is free to return to Russia at any time.
But Navalny faces a growing list of legal threats at home, including separate criminal cases for alleged slander and fraud, both of which he says are false and politically-motivated. 
The most immediate threat is from the Moscow prison service.
FSIN, the prison service, said in a statement that Navalny, 44, was on a national wanted list because he had last year repeatedly failed to report at least twice a month to them under the terms of a suspended sentence on embezzlement charges.
It has applied to a court to convert his suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years into real jail time. 
""Taking into account the facts of malicious violations, guided by the principle of inevitability of responsibility and the demands of the law that all citizens of the Russian Federation are equal before without exception, (FSIN) is obliged to take all actions to arrest the violator,"" it said.
Navalny says the original 2014 embezzlement conviction, in which he and his brother were found guilty of stealing more than 30 million roubles ($408,000) from two companies, was trumped up.
He said he could not report in at the end of last year anyway, as he was being treated as an outpatient in Germany. The prison service says he was discharged from a Berlin hospital in September and should have returned to Moscow. 
""In theory they can detain him as soon as he arrives (in Russia) but initially only for 48 hours,"" Vadim Kobzev, one of Navalny's lawyers, told Reuters.
Kobzev said he expected a court to hear details of the case on Jan. 29, when it could order Navalny's suspended sentence to be converted into real jail time.
The Kremlin, which refers to Navalny only as ""the Berlin patient,"" says it is up to the relevant law enforcement agencies to decide how he is treated.
Navalny on Thursday published a response from Russia's investigative committee rejecting a request to investigate his poisoning at the hands of what he said was a state-hit squad. The response said investigators had found no concrete evidence of criminal activity by staff at the FSB security service.

Manama on Sunday demanded Qatari authorities release bodybuilder Sami Al Haddad, who was arrested along with a compatriot on Friday in the third such incident in recent months and which occurred after Bahrain and its Arab allies agreed to end a political row with Doha.
The Interior Ministry said in a statement that Qatari authorities had also released a Bahraini sailor arrested in December. It said their boats were still being held.
""Bahrain's embassy in Oman confirmed that the Bahraini citizens have arrived there,"" it said.
There was no immediate comment from Qatari authorities.
Manama on Sunday said it would reopen its airspace to Qatar as of Jan. 11 under a U.S.-backed deal earlier this month to end the dispute in which Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar in mid-2017.
All four nations have resumed air links with Qatar. A senior Emirati official has said that restoring diplomatic ties would take more time as parties rebuild trust.

The states imposed the boycott over accusations that Qatar supports terrorism. Doha denies that and says the embargo aims to curtail its sovereignty.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top court on Thursday issued an opinion in its first case heard in the Irish language, almost 50 years after Ireland joined the bloc, in a case relating to an Irish man wishing to see dual-language labelling on his dog's medicine.
The Court of Justice of the European Union can hear cases in any of the bloc's 24 official languages. English and Irish are Ireland's official languages but no cases had been brought in Irish since it joined the EU in 1973.
The case centred on an Irish language activist's complaint that the Irish government had failed to implement existing EU rules requiring veterinary medicines sold in Ireland to be labelled in Irish as well as English.
Ireland's High Court ruled the Irish state had flouted the EU regulations, but given that from 2022 new EU rules would mean Ireland no longer has to use both languages in such labelling, it asked the court in Luxembourg whether it was worth ordering the use of both languages for just a few months.
Michal Bobek, an advocate general of the Court of Justice, said on Thursday that the upcoming rule change did not prevent the man, Peadar Mac Fhlannchadha, bringing his claim.
The judges of the Court of Justice will make a ruling later. They follow opinions of advocate generals in the majority of cases, but are not bound to do so. 
""My client is very satisfied that he is one of the parties in the first case before the Court of Justice that has Irish as the language of the proceedings"" Sean O Cearbhaill, the applicant's solicitor, told Reuters.

The EU court said in its opinion on Thursday it was up to the Irish court to decide whether to grant the applicant's request to see dual-language labelling.

Abuses alleged by Ukraine including enforced disappearances, unlawful detention and suppression of non-Russian media had been deemed admissible and would be followed by a judgment at a later date, an ECHR statement said.
The court said there was not enough evidence for Ukrainian allegations of a pattern of killings and shootings and detentions of foreign journalists or the alleged confiscation of Ukrainian soldiers' property.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed after Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in the Donbass conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed 14,000 people since 2014. 
A statement from the Russian justice ministry focused on the allegations thrown out by the court, including the most serious, that civilians had been murdered.
The Kremlin-backed head of Crimea, Sergei Aksyonov, wrote on social media that Ukraine's allegations were false and that the court should instead investigate real human rights violations perpetrated against Crimeans by Ukraine not Russia. 
He said the European court's rulings on Russian matters were often biased and politicised.
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba called the ruling a victory for his country.
""This is an important step towards bringing Russia to legal responsibility for aggression against Ukraine,"" he said. ""And with each step the price of this responsibility will grow.""
The Strasbourg-based ECHR said the case was not concerned with whether the annexation was lawful under international law but had taken into account Russia's increased military presence in Crimea in January-March 2014 without Ukraine's consent.
The annexation has not been internationally recognised and prompted the West to impose sanctions on Russia, sending relations to their lowest level since the Cold War.
Members of the Council of Europe are supposed to abide by the judgement of the court, which can include demands for reform or compensation, but sometimes states ignore them.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday declared that the presidency was no job for a woman because of their emotional differences to men, and dismissed speculation that his daughter would succeed him next year.
""My daughter is not running. I have told Inday not to run because I pity (her) knowing she will have to go through what I am going through,"" Duterte said at the launch of a highway project, referring to his daughter Sara by her nickname.
""This is not for women. You know, the emotional set-up of a woman and a man is totally different. You will become a fool here. So... that is the sad story.""
The Philippines has had two women presidents, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo from 2001 to 2010 and Corazon Aquino from 1986 to 1992.
Duterte, 75, is notorious for comments often deemed offensive, sexist and misogynistic, but his office typically calls his remarks harmless jokes. He remains hugely popular among female voters in the Philippines. 
Daughter Sara Duterte-Carpio, 42, who succeeded him as mayor of Davao City, came top in a recent opinion poll that asked the public to choose a preferred candidate from a list of possible contenders for the 2022 elections. 
Two other women, Vice President Leni Robredo and Senator Grace Poe, were hypothetical contenders. 
Presidents in the Philippines are allowed only one, six-year term in office. Arroyo's was longer as she took over from an impeached former president. 
Responding to Duterte's remarks, Cristina Palabay of human rights group Karapatan said women are as capable as men in any job. ""What matters most especially when we talk of the presidency and public office is if the interests of the poor majority are upheld,"" she said.
Duterte-Carpio has cultivated an image as a reluctant successor as mayor of Davao, where she is hugely popular for showing the same tough, no-nonsense character as her father, who ran the city for two decades. 
She is no stranger to presidential duties, serving as first lady because of her father's annulled marriage.
Duterte-Carpio on Thursday told Reuters said had informed her father she did not intend to run and would not be a late entry as he was six years ago. 
""I am not being coy nor am I doing a 'last-minute',"" Duterte-Carpio said in a text message. ""If the whole country does not want to believe (this) then I can't do anything about it. Not everyone wants to be president. I am one of them."" 

She added: ""I thank all of them for their trust and confidence in what I can do but my refusal to run for president is not the end of the world.""

The U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said more than 550 shelters home to around 3,500 people were either totally or partially destroyed in the blaze, as well as 150 shops and a facility belonging to a non-profit organization.
Photographs and video provided to Reuters by a Rohingya refugee in Nayapara Camp showed families including children, sifting through charred corrugated iron sheets to see if they could salvage anything from their still smouldering homes. But little remained of the camp, which had stood for decades, aside from concrete poles and the husks of a few trees. 
""E block is completely burned down,"" said the refugee, Mohammed Arakani. ""There is nothing left. There was nothing saved. Everything is burned down.""
""Everyone is crying,"" he said. ""They lost all their belongings. They lost everything, completely burned down, they lost all their goods.""
UNHCR said it was providing shelter, materials, winter clothes, hot meals, and medical care for the refugees displaced from the camp in the Cox's Bazar district, a sliver of land bordering Myanmar in southeastern Bangladesh. 
""Security experts are liaising with the authorities to investigate on the cause of fire,"" the agency said, adding that no casualties were reported.
Onno van Manen, Save the Children's Country Director in Bangladesh, called the fire ""another devastating blow for the Rohingya people who have endured unspeakable hardship for years"".
Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said the fire service spent two hours putting out the blaze, but was hampered by the explosion of gas cylinders inside homes.
The Bangladesh government has moved several thousand Rohingya to a remote island in recent weeks, despite protests from human rights groups who say some of the relocations were forced, allegations denied by authorities.
More than a million Rohingya live in the mainland camps in southern Bangladesh, the vast majority having fled Myanmar in 2017 from a military-led crackdown that U.N investigators said was executed with ""genocidal intent"", charges Myanmar denies.

The fire destroyed part of a camp inhabited by Rohingya who fled Myanmar after an earlier military campaign, according to refugees.

MOSCOW/ZOLOTKOVSKY RAZEZD (Reuters) - Living in a wooden hut 300 km from Moscow, Elizaveta Mikhaylova feels trapped in the same forced exile imposed on her family during Josef Stalin's Great Terror when her father was sent to the Gulag prison camps.
The 72-year-old is one of a dwindling group of about 1,500 pensioners or ""Children of the Gulag"" who were promised housing in their families' home cities by the government after the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 but have received nothing 30 years later.
Mikhaylova was born in exile in the Soviet republic of Moldova after her father was banished from Moscow as an ""enemy of the people"". She was kept there by Soviet restrictions on freedom of movement, but later made her way back to Russia after selling the family flat. 
That was enough to buy a simple hut near a railway line five hours drive from Moscow where she lives with her two adult daughters on a monthly pension of $220. They burn wood to keep warm in winter, there's scant mobile coverage, and no hot water. 
Her older sister, Lenina, lived there until she died in 2019 during their long struggle to return to Moscow. 
""I regret so much that she didn't live to see it (a return to the Russian capital). I really regret it. It's possible her health just couldn't cope with the current conditions we live in,"" says Mikhaylova, who first met her father at the age of eight when he returned from a second stint in the camps.
As their numbers have dwindled over the years, the plight of the children of the Gulag often looked a lost cause until late 2019 when Mikhaylova and two other elderly women won appeals in Russia's Constitutional Court. 
It ruled that they were eligible for housing in Moscow, rejecting snags in their applications, and, more broadly, told the government to fast-track their and all other such housing applications.
Mikhaylova's claim had been held up by an earlier Moscow court ruling that only her father was explicitly exiled from Moscow and that her mother could have continued living there alone and given birth to Elizaveta without him. 
The fate of her and many other claims remains unclear. Online petitions signed by 80,000 Russians and more than 100 public figures have urged the government step in.
Critics say a bill drafted by the government to implement the Constitutional Court ruling fails to remove bureaucratic obstacles that could make claimants wait another 30 years for housing. 
NGOs and lawmakers have drafted rival legislation they say would expedite the claims. Lawmakers in parliament are set to discuss the two bills this month and to choose between them.
Mikhaylova said she would be watching closely. ""We're not where we want to be and not where we should be. This is exile.""

73,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 08:45AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Long-withheld Pentagon survey shows widespread racial discrimination, harassment","By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly a third of Black U.S. military servicemembers reported experiencing racial discrimination, harassment or both during a 12-month period, according to results of a long-withheld Defense Department survey that underscore concerns about racism in the ranks.
The 2017 survey, whose results have not previously been reported, also showed that U.S. troops who experienced racial discrimination or harassment had high levels of dissatisfaction with the complaint process and largely did not report it. 
The data support the findings of a 2020 Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-civilrights, which found that servicemembers feared that reporting discrimination would likely backfire and was not worth the risk. 
""Overall, results reveal much work is needed to improve the reporting process for those who experience racial/ethnic harassment and discrimination,"" the Defense Department acknowledged in a report that accompanied the survey data.
The Pentagon's release of the data followed a Reuters article last month https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-military-civilrights-exclusive/exclusive-for-years-the-pentagon-sits-on-racial-discrimination-survey-data-idUSKBN28S0YF disclosing how the Defense Department sat on the 2017 survey data during President Donald Trump's administration, even last month denying a Reuters Freedom of Information Act Request.
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a senior member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, condemned the Pentagon's failure to disclose the data sooner. A Gillibrand aide noted that the senator's office had been seeking the data for months.
""This just-released 2017 report shows that President Trump’s Department of Defense has deliberately concealed statistics exposing a racial justice crisis in the military,"" Gillibrand told Reuters.
""While Defense Department leadership paid lip service to equality, they withheld a report revealing that minority service members face rampant discrimination and harassment, and those that report it are nearly as likely to face punishment as the perpetrators.""
Concerns about racial discrimination in the military - the largest U.S. employer - have taken on new urgency over the past year, as America undergoes a nationwide reckoning on racism. 
Although the military is diverse in lower ranks, it is largely white and male at the top. Unpunished discrimination and racial harassment play a role in pushing out minorities, advocates say.
President-elect Joe Biden underscored the importance of diversity at the Pentagon when he announced his pick last month to lead it: retired Army General Lloyd Austin, who would be the first Black U.S. defense secretary, if approved by Congress. 
""More than 40% of our active-duty forces are people of color. It’s long past time that the department’s leadership reflects that diversity,"" Biden said.
RACIST JOKES AND INSULTS
The 2017 Workplace and Equal Opportunity Survey of Active Duty Members showed that 31.2% of Black servicemembers reported suffering racial discrimination, harassment or both, compared with 23.3% and 21% for Asian and Hispanic troops surveyed, respectively, figures that were still high. 
The survey is unlikely to capture all the discrimination that minority U.S. troops encounter, advocates say.
Daniele Anderson, a Navy veteran who is chief strategist of the Black Veterans Project advocacy group, noted that the survey only asked about discrimination over the previous 12-month period. 
""I would hazard a guess that there's significantly more that have experienced"" discrimination in their careers, Anderson said.
Minorities in the U.S. military reported everything from dealing with racially driven jokes and insults to hearing claims about racial superiority. Some 17.9% of Black servicemembers surveyed reported hearing someone use a racial stereotype about Black people.
""Collectively, these results suggest negative racial/ethnic experiences among active duty members are primarily comprised of racial/ethnic harassment, occur more than once, are done by someone of a different race/ethnicity, and often go uncorrected,"" the report said.
Of the U.S. troops who chose not to report an incident of racial discrimination or racial harassment, 39% thought nothing would be done and an even greater percentage thought it would make their work situation unpleasant. Of those who reported an incident, the vast majority did not know the outcome of their complaints, the survey found.
The Defense Department has not explained why the data took so long to release. The survey, conducted every four years, is already so old that the Pentagon is required to carry out a new one for the 2021 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. 
Anderson, pointing to race-related incidents over the past four years, suspected that 2021 data would show a deteriorating situation for minority servicemembers.
""If we somehow were able to get data today on the last 12 months, or the last four years, that number would probably be significantly worse,"" she said.

REHELIM, West Bank/DUBAI (Reuters) - Wine produced in an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank and labelled ""from the land of Israel"" will soon be available for sale in the United Arab Emirates, settler business leaders said.
Palestinians have condemned the export deal, saying settlements are illegal under international law, a view shared by many countries but disputed by Israel.
After forging official relations with the UAE last year under a U.S.-brokered deal that enraged Palestinians, bottles from Tura Winery in the Rehelim settlement are now in stock in the UAE, an alcohol retailer there said, although they did not appear to be on shelves yet.
The winery's owner, Vered Ben-Sa'adon, told Reuters the exports showed that new Israel-UAE ties also extended to settlements, on West Bank land captured in a 1967 war and that Palestinians seek for a state.
""It's very exciting for (people in the UAE) to feel the peace process, to be a part of it. When you sit in a hotel in Abu Dhabi, and drink a glass of Tura (wine), it's to be a part of history,"" said Ben-Sa'adon, 44.
Tura, which also produces and has sent olive oil to the UAE, places labels on its wine bottles that include the line: ""WINE FROM THE LAND OF ISRAEL"".
Tura said the term referred to an area that includes Israel and the West Bank, where settlers stake a biblical claim to land they refer to as Judea and Samaria. 
The UAE declined comment when asked for the government's position on Israel's settlements, but it has said that its relations with Israel would advance peace in the region.
The UAE has not said if it would place special labels on settler goods saying they were produced in settlements.
Such labels are required by the European Union.
But under guidelines issued by outgoing President Donald Trump's administration last year, the United States, Israel's closest ally, said its imports from settlements should be marked ""Made in Israel"" or ""Product of Israel"".
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has been critical of Israel's settlements, but has not said if he would change the Trump administration's labelling guidelines.
PALESTINIANS OBJECT
""It breaks your heart to see your Muslim brothers (in the UAE) support your enemy at your expense,"" said Nizam Abdul Razzaq, 57, a Palestinian olive and bee farmer in Yasouf, a village two km (1.2 miles) from Rehelim.
A representative of African + Eastern, an alcohol retailer in the UAE, said it had Tura wines in stock, although they were not yet available on store shelves. The retailer also sells wine imported from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Photos posted to Tura's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page show it held a signing ceremony in Dubai in December with FAM Holding, a UAE business conglomerate. A bottle of Tura wine can be seen on the table at the event. 
An FAM representative said it had import deals for wine and olive oil with Tura and for honey with Paradise Honey, a company in the West Bank settlement of Hermesh. 
FAM's Israel imports have been approved by the UAE government, the representative added, without saying if origin labels would be required.
Matan Paradise, whose family runs Paradise Honey, said they had sent a ""small, first shipment to Dubai. I hope in the next month we will send a lot more."" 
The economy ministry of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-rule in the West Bank, called the UAE's purchase of settlement goods ""a flagrant violation of international laws ... and an attempt to legitimise settlements in occupied territory.""
Israel disputes that its settlements are illegal, citing biblical, historical and political connections to the land, as well as security needs. Around 440,000 settlers live in the West Bank among some 3 million Palestinians.

Nazarbayev's Nur Otan party swept the Jan. 10 vote to retain control over the lower house. Under the constitution, parliamentary elections automatically trigger the government's resignation and a new prime minister must be nominated by the president and approved by the lower house.
Addressing his party on Thursday, Nazarbayev called for continuity in government policies.
""If President (Kassym-Jomart Tokayev) nominates Askar Mamin, I would ask the faction to support him,"" his office quoted him as saying. The president was picked by Nazarbayev.
Kazakhstan's newly-elected lower house will open its first session on Friday.
Nazarbayev served as the former Soviet republic's president for almost three decades until resigning in 2019. In addition to Nur Otan leadership, he remains head of the national security council.

His comments indicate there are likely to be few changes in the cabinet, including ministries interacting with foreign companies that have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in the Kazakh energy and mining sectors

76,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 07:45AM ET</span>",Dutch government weighs possible resignation even as it battles surging pandemic,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's Cabinet is considering collectively resigning over a report that blamed the government for mismanagement of childcare subsidies that drove thousands of families to financial ruin.
A parliamentary inquiry last month concluded that ""unprecedented injustice"" had been done to innocent families, who were often forced to repay tens of thousands of euros of granted subsidies, leading to unemployment, bankruptcy or divorce.
Rutte, in office since 2010, said late last month that the affair, spanning almost the entire past decade, was ""shameful"". Compensation of at least 30,000 euros ($36,500) is being paid to roughly 10,000 families.
The families this week filed charges against five politicians, including Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra and Economy Minister Eric Wiebes, for their role in the mismanagement.
Opinion polls show Rutte's government has the approval of two-thirds of the public. But political analysts said pressure on the government to resign grew after Lodewijk Asscher stepped down as head of the opposition Labour party and said he would not contest the March 17 parliamentary election as he felt he was partly to blame for the scandal.
Asscher, who was social affairs minister when his party was a coalition partner in a previous Rutte government, ""not only puts more pressure on the cabinet, but also on individual party leaders,"" political pundit Tom-Jan Meeus wrote on Twitter.
Crisis talks with the entire Cabinet called by Rutte were scheduled for Friday.
The subsidy scandal saw the tax office ruthlessly enforce repayments of subsidies, without giving families opportunity to show their innocence. Government ministries and even courts also failed to give the assistance needed, the parliamentary committee found.
The crisis comes just two months before the next election and as the country is in a middle of the toughest lockdown of the coronavirus pandemic. Rutte is considering even tougher curbs as infections surge.
Responding to questions about his possible resignation, Rutte said on Tuesday his Cabinet would remain fully capable of managing COVID-19, even if forced into caretaker status.
The Netherlands has recorded nearly 900,000 coronavirus cases and more than 12,000 deaths.

The centre-right politician, who served as minister from 2015 to 2019, said the aim of the action was to stamp out child marriages.
In the impeachment trial, which would be only Denmark's sixth in more than 170 years and the first since 1995, she is accused of knowingly breaking the law in 2016 by ordering the separation of underage refugee couples.
A majority in parliament on Thursday expressed support for an impeachment, including her own Liberal Party, but the decision awaits final approval.
Denmark has over the last decade gained notoriety for its hardline immigration policies, such as allowing authorities to confiscate asylum seekers' jewellery and deterring Middle Eastern refugees through newspaper adds in their countries. 
Stojberg was also behind a plan to hold foreign criminals facing deportation on a tiny island, although the plan was later abandoned by the current government.
The case started when a Syrian couple complained to the country's ombudsman in 2016 after they were placed in separate asylum centres. Stojberg has repeatedly denied giving any illegal order and said she wanted to protect the underage girls.
Under Danish and human rights law, each couple must be assessed individually, implying that the minister's order to separate all underage couples was illegal. In total, 23 couples were separated.
An investigation into the case, also known as the ""child bride case"", concluded in December the order to indiscriminately separate all underage couples was ""clearly illegal"" and in breach of human rights.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A Chinese research vessel has been identified in the waters of Indonesia with its tracking system turned off, authorities said on Thursday, amid concerns in the region about Beijing's maritime conduct.
    Colonel Wisnu Pramandita, spokesman of Indonesia's maritime security agency, known as Bakamla, in a statement said authorities suspected the vessel was conducting unauthorised activities in the Sunda Strait after its automatic identification system (AIS) had been switched off three times.
The Xiang Yang Hong 03 exited Indonesia's exclusive economic zone late on Wednesday. 
Indonesian security officials have closely watched activities of Chinese vessels around the archipelago, amid wider tensions in the region and concern about Beijing's militarisation and the conduct of its coastguard and fishing fleet.
The incident follows the recent discovery of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) by a local fisherman off Indonesia's Sulawesi island last month, sparking concern about a potential security breach.
Analysts said the AUV may have been made in China. The navy is still investigating its origins.
It was not immediately clear if there was a connection between the research vessel and the AUV, Bakalma's spokesman told Reuters. 
The Xiang Yang Hong 03 during radio communication told Indonesia authorities its AIS had malfunctioned, Bakalma said.
The vessel was spotted during operations to recover the Sriwijaya Air jet that crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday with 62 people on board. 
The Chinese embassy in Jakarta was not immediately available for comment on the vessel, while a spokesman for Indonesia's foreign ministry said he was not aware of permission being granted for any maritime research activities.
The Indonesian archipelago straddles strategically important sea lanes used for trade, with its waters also home to rich fishing grounds and important energy reserves.

When Trump leaves office, he will leave behind a nation deeply divided over his brash brand of populist politics and economic nationalism that he promised would 'Make America Great Again'.
Ten Republicans joined democrats in the House of Representatives to charge him with inciting an insurrection in last week's violent rampage in the Capitol.
""What is happening now in Washington is I think the greatest event that we have (experienced) in Western democracies,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in an interview at the Reuters Next conference.
""Having this kind of event should be a kind of alarm for all European and all Western democracies.""
France holds a presidential election in spring of 2022. President Emmanuel Macron's most likely main challenger will be Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) party.
For years, Le Pen has espoused a brand of economic nationalism that is anti-Europe, anti-immigration and anti-globalisation. 
She was soundly beaten by Macron in the 2017 presidential run-off vote, but his term in office has been mired in social unrest, and pollsters project a closer contest next year were the two to go head-to-head again.
Le Pen touted Trump's 2016 election win and Brexit as a harbinger for the rise of populism in France elsewhere in Europe, and had not recognised President-elect Joe Biden's poll victory prior to the storming of the Capitol - a scene which she described as ""extremely shocking"".
Le Maire said he trusted fully in U.S. democratic institutions and the country's ability to overcome its difficulties.
""Democracies are fragile,"" he cautioned. ""We should be aware of that.""

GAZA (Reuters) - Youssef Abu Amira, a Palestinian law school graduate, never let disabilities hold him back. Born without legs and with only partially developed arms, he has taken up a new challenge - karate.
The 24-year-old orange belt showed his stick-fighting skills as he trained with his coach at Gaza's Al-Mashtal Club for Martial Arts.
""I wanted to prove to myself and the world that disability is in the mind and is not in the body and that nothing was impossible,"" Abu Amira said.
""I wanted to do karate so I can defend myself, and I dream of taking part in international championships.""
His mastery of the stick helps him make up for his missing limbs, and he has learned how to deliver strong punches, and fend off attacks with his body and arms.
Coach Hassan Al-Raai said his pupil showed particular determination. 
""I was surprised that Youssef has different skills and can do things better than people with fewer disabilities could do,"" Al-Raai said.

Those arrested included eight men and three women, aged 18 to 72, a police statement said.
Daniel Wong, a lawyer who tried to help the 12 people detained in mainland China last August, was among those arrested according to a post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, which stated that police arrived at his apartment at 6 a.m. local time. 
Police said those arrested were being held for further questioning. 
Self-ruled Taiwan has become a popular destination for Hong Kong pro-democracy activists since China imposed a national security law in June 2020, a move critics say is aimed at stamping out dissent and curbing freedoms.
Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and assembly. Democracy activists complain that Communist Party rulers in China are now whittling away at those freedoms, a charge Beijing rejects.
Wong, a Hong Kong-based rights lawyer, is leading an initiative to set up at least 10 companies, ranging from a laundry service to a restaurant in Taiwan, to give protesters much-needed residency on the self-ruled island via work visas.
Local media said those arrested were suspected of assisting the 12 Hong Kong residents - who faced charges related to anti-government protests in the Asian financial hub in 2019 - in their attempt to flee last year. 
In late December, a Chinese court sentenced 10 of them to between seven months and three years in prison for illegally crossing the border. The case drew international attention and concern over the treatment of the activists in mainland custody. 
Two of them, who were minors at the time of arrest, have been returned to Hong Kong. 
The detainees' families said they had been denied access to independent lawyers and aired suspicions that Hong Kong authorities helped mainland authorities with the arrests.
More than 100 people have now been arrested under the seven-month-old national security law.

The United States and European Union have called for the activists to be released and allowed to return to Hong Kong.

Mitarachi said Greece had submitted a request to the European Commission and EU border agency Frontex for the immediate return of the migrants, who he said had arrived from Turkey and whose asylum applications had been rejected.
The move comes ahead of a planned resumption of talks to resolve longstanding territorial disputes between Greece and Turkey following months of tensions between the two NATO allies in the Aegean.
Migrant returns to Turkey, under a 2016 EU-Turkey agreement, largely dried up last year due to the coronavirus crisis. But Mitarachi said conditions were now in place for them to resume thanks to new technology and COVID-19 testing procedures.
""We expect Turkey to step up its efforts ... First, to prevent the passage of boats departing from its shores bound for our country and European Union. And second to accept the return of migrants,"" Mitarachi said.
He said most of the 1,450 individuals slated for return were on the island of Lesbos, where a fire last year destroyed the main camp housing irregular migrants, while others were on the islands of Kos, Samos and Chios.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees used Greece as their entry point to Europe through Turkey in 2015 and 2016, until the deal between Ankara and the EU reduced the flow across the Greek and Turkish land and sea borders.
Turkey hosts more than three million refugees and migrants, many from neighbouring Syria, while tens of thousands are waiting in Greece for asylum applications to be processed, mostly in camps where conditions have been described as dire.

Germany has so far recorded 16 cases of people with a strain of the virus first detected in Britain and four with the strain from South Africa, Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch health institute, told a news conference. All cases so far were people who had travelled abroad, he said.
These will not be the last variations to be seen, he said, also referring to a new coronavirus variant found in Brazil.
""We will have more variations ... Therefore, don't travel.""
Wieler urged people who were offered a COVID-19 vaccination to accept it to relieve the strain on hospitals and said people should stick to social distance and hygiene rules.
""At the end of the year we will have this pandemic under control,"" Wieler said. Enough vaccines would then be available to inoculate the entire population, he said.
The German cabinet on Wednesday approved stricter controls on people entering the country after a national lockdown was tightened last week and extended to the end of January.
Health minister Jens Spahn has said some curbs were likely to be extended into February. 
Wieler said restrictions were not being implemented as consistently as they were during the first wave and said more people should work from home.
Hospitals in 10 out of Germany's 16 states are facing bottlenecks as 85% of the beds in its intensive care units were used by coronavirus patients, he added.
He said wearing heavy duty respirator masks, also known as FFP2, could help protect against 94% of particles, but only if worn correctly. The state of Bavaria has made FFP2 masks on public transport and in shops compulsory from Monday.
On Thursday, the RKI reported 25,164 new coronavirus cases and 1,244 fatalities, a record, bringing Germany's total death toll since the start of the pandemic to 43,881, the tally showed.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel is revising military options for a possible clash with Iran, an Israeli newspaper reported on Thursday, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government braces for differences with the incoming U.S. administration on Iranian nuclear policy.
U.S. President Donald Trump delighted Netanyahu by quitting the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposing sanctions on it that had been lifted in return for limits on activities that could, potentially, produce nuclear weapons in the future.
Tehran responded by breaching many of those restrictions. President-elect Joe Biden wants to rejoin the deal if Tehran - which denies seeking the bomb - returns to strict compliance.
Israel, alarmed by Iranian rhetoric that it is a state that should not exist, is wary of the softer line, even though threats of U.S. military action from Trump did not curtail Iran's nuclear moves.
A front-page article in Israel's largest-circulation daily said the military is crafting three options to ""undermine Iran's nuclear efforts or, if need be, counter Iranian aggression, which will soon be presented to the government"".
The paper, Israel Hayom, did not cite any sources. But it went on to quote Defence Minister Benny Gantz as saying: ""Israel needs to have a military option on the table."" 
Israel has long had plans in place to counter Iran. The article appeared designed to signal that these were now being updated.
During the previous Democratic administration of Barack Obama, which championed diplomacy with Iran, Israel occasionally threatened preventive airstrikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
Some U.S. officials at the time doubted that Israel - whose advanced military includes a reputed nuclear arsenal - could effectively hit Iranian targets that are distant, dispersed and well-defended.
Israeli officials have voiced hope that Biden will maintain Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Tehran, involving tough sanctions, until the Iranian nuclear programme is dismantled. 
But one of them, Finance Minister Israel Katz, acknowledged on Army Radio: ""There are disputes (with Biden) regarding the perspective on Iran, and of course that will prove challenging.""
Katz sounded encouraged by Biden's intent to include Iran's ballistic missile programme in any re-negotiation of the nuclear deal. Biden's pick for U.S. national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, signalled openness, during a Jan 3 CNN interview, to consulting ""regional players"" - a possible allusion to Israel. 

Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Ynet TV the Netanyahu government was not yet in formal dialogue with the incoming administration. But asked if Israel was trying through informal channels to sway Biden on Iran, Cohen said: ""Yes. There are efforts.""

Sirichai Nathuang, 21, a student at Bangkok's Thammasat University, is one of at least 40 activists charged with ""lese majeste"" since November amid protests demanding the resignation of former junta leader Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha. 
The youth-led movement has also broken longstanding taboos by demanding reforms to the monarchy, which led to resumption of use of the lese majeste law, which had not been invoked since 2018. Breaches of the law, or section 112 of the criminal code, carry penalties of up to 15 years in prison. 
Portraits of the king are ubiquitous in city streets in Thailand, as well as most schools and businesses.
Sirichai was accused of spray-painting messages on some of those portraits earlier this week and was arrested on Wednesday night, said Noraset Nanongtoom of the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group.
""Sirichai denied all accusations and will fight the case,"" Noraset told Reuters, adding his client was released on bail. 
Defacing a royal portrait was almost unheard of during the reign of the king's father, who died in 2016 after 70 years on the throne.
Noraset said Sirichai is accused by police of spraying messages calling for the abolition of the lese majeste law. 
He said his client was the first of the protesters to be arrested under the law, while about 40 others were charged but not arrested. 
Police deputy spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen said police acted in accordance with the law. ""There are no double standards,"" he said. 
A government spokesman last week said use of the law against some of the protesters was justified.
The opposition Move Forward Party said on Thursday it would seek to amend the lese majeste law when parliament reconvenes. 

""The use of Section 112 in the current situation will only worsen the relationship between the king and the people in a democratic society,"" party secretary-general Chaithawat Tulathon said in a statement.

PARIS (Reuters) - French data privacy watchdog CNIL condemned the Interior Ministry for the unlawful use of drones to oversee demonstrations and make sure people were respecting the COVID-19 lockdown.
In a decision made public on Thursday, the authority stressed that the use of such tools by the police nationwide broke the law in the absence of any regulatory framework. 
In a statement, the interior ministry said it acknowledged the CNIL's decision, and would respect its terms.
The CNIL started investigating the use of camera drones by law enforcement last May. It found the ministry had not used mechanisms to blur the faces of people filmed by the drones in demonstrations or walking in the streets during lockdown.
This was a breach of French data privacy rules, the CNIL said, as such individuals could be easily identified in the filmed images, which were then stored by the police.
The interior ministry has since told the CNIL that blurring systems were put in place, but the authority said they could be turned off. 
""This mechanism does not necessarily prevent the identification of individuals as long as the services of the ministry of the interior are able to deactivate blurring,"" the authority said. 
At no point has the public been properly informed about the use of camera drones by the police, the CNIL said, adding it had reminded the interior ministry it should obey the law. 
Thursday's move came after a decision by the top administrative court that forbade the use of camera drones by police in the absence of a proper legal framework.
A draft security law, which triggered fierce debate in France over press freedom, would substantially increase the legal use of surveillance tools, including drones.

The official investigation concluded in 1997 that the roll-on, roll-off ferry's bow shield had failed, damaging the bow ramp and flooding the car deck.
But a recent television documentary renewed speculation about the cause of the disaster and prompted the government to accept a new investigation of the wreck was needed.
Current law protects the grave site.
""What we are thinking of is making it possible for the Accident Investigation Authority to take the measures it requires to conduct an examination,"" Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg told TT.
""It won't be divers. They will use other technical solutions and they will conduct these examinations in the most sensitive way possible in order to respect the sanctity of the grave site."" 
TT said the government expected changes to the law to be ready by summer.
The Estonia set out from Tallinn to Stockholm on the night of Sept. 28, 1994, in a storm. 
After the bow shield failed, the ferry rapidly filled with water, trapping most of the passengers and crew inside.
Over the years, a number of theories have emerged about the sinking that reject the official explanation, including a collision with a submarine and an explosion inside the ship.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte appeared in no hurry on Thursday to resolve a political crisis triggered by a junior coalition partner, which has abandoned the cabinet in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Italia Viva, a small party headed by former premier Matteo Renzi, walked out of the government on Wednesday, presenting a long list of grievances over the way Conte had handled the health emergency and accusing him of hoarding power.
However, Renzi's group has left open the door to returning to the fold so long as a new policy pact could be worked out.
""It isn't a question of who (is in charge), but of what is done,"" Elena Bonetti, one of Italia Viva's two outgoing ministers, told Radio 24.
Conte himself has said nothing in public since Renzi quit, and has given no indication that he was ready to hand in his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella.
One of the options open to him would be to try to cobble together a group of so-called ""responsible"" parliamentarians from opposition ranks who would promise to prop up his government in the absence of Italia Viva.
""Conte wants to go to parliament and see if he can't build an alternative majority there,"" said a government official, who declined to be named.
To do this, he would need to find around 25 lawmakers in the 630-seat lower house and up to 18 in the 315-seat Senate. However, such a majority would be highly fragile and make it hard to enact meaningful reform.
Failing that he will need to swallow his pride and look to forge a new alliance with Renzi, one of Italy's most ruthless politicians whose party is floundering in the polls.
Italy's often volatile markets were little changed in early trade on Thursday, thanks largely to the European Central Bank's large-scale purchases of Italian assets, which have protected investors from the hostile economic and political winds.
However, the mellow mood would change if there was any indication that the crisis would lead to an early general election, which polls says would be won by the eurosceptic bloc headed by Matteo Salvini's far-right League.
The crisis comes against the backdrop of the coronavirus contagion, which is killing hundreds of people each day and has plunged Italy into its worst recession since World War Two.
One of Renzi's main complaints about Conte is the way he has handled plans to spend up to 200 billion euros ($243 billion) of European Union funds meant to help rebuild the country, accusing him of trying to bypass parliament in the decision-making.
Renzi has also said Conte must accept up to 36 billion euros offered by the European Union in a separate bailout fund for the health system. No other EU country has tapped this mechanism amid fears the cash will come with unwelcome conditions.
European Affairs Minister Vincenzo Amendola, a member of the coalition centre-left Democratic Party (PD) warned that Italy risked missing out on funds unless it gets its act together.
""All my European colleagues are very worried,"" he told Sky Italia TV.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian divers resumed a search on Thursday for the remains of 62 victims and the cockpit voice recorder from a Sriwijaya Air plane that plunged into the Java Sea soon after takeoff last weekend, officials said.
The search at the crash site of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-500, which was traveling from Jakarta to Pontianak, had been temporarily suspended on Wednesday after bad weather whipped up high waves.
A team of divers recovered one of the plane's black boxes, the flight data recorder (FDR), from the seabed earlier this week and efforts were underway on Thursday to retrieve the cockpit voice recorder (CVR).
With the cause of the fatal crash of the nearly 27-year-old plane unclear, investigators will rely heavily on the black boxes to determine what caused it to lose control minutes after take-off. 
Indonesia National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) head Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters the FDR information was still being processed and a preliminary report would be published within 30 days of the crash in line with international standards.
Tempo newspaper on Thursday reported the plane had experienced recurring problems with the autothrottle system that automatically controls the engine power settings since returning from storage last month. Sriwijaya did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Tjahjono said if the autothrottle system was not working, the pilots could control the settings manually with their hands.
An airline pilot who was not authorised to speak publicly said it was considered acceptable for a plane to fly when the autothrottle system was not working, though it would increase the pilot workload and could prove distracting in an emergency situation.
Most air accidents are typically caused by a range of factors that can take months to establish, according to safety experts.

The Sriwijaya crash is the biggest airline disaster in Indonesia since 189 people were killed onboard a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX that plunged into the Java Sea minutes after take-off in 2018.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Among the first in the queue for coronavirus vaccines in Indonesia has been one conspicuous group - social media influencers.
Alongside President Joko Widodo as the world's fourth most populous country kicked off its vaccination drive on Wednesday was Indonesian television personality, Raffi Ahmad, who boasts almost 50 million followers on Instagram.
“Alhamdulillah [Praise be to God] a vaccine ... Don’t be afraid of vaccines,” the 33-year-old celebrity wrote under a video of him receiving the shot, next to a heart emoji and another of Indonesia's red and white flag.
Deciding who should be first in line for limited vaccine doses has been a challenge around the world, with many countries prioritising vulnerable medics and the elderly. 
Senior health ministry official, Siti Nadia Tarmizi, said the decision to include influencers alongside almost 1.5 million healthcare workers in the first round of inoculations was a deliberate government communications strategy.
Although Indonesia faces the most severe coronavirus outbreak in Southeast Asia – with more than 869,000 cases and 25,000 deaths – there has been scepticism around the safety and efficacy of any vaccine, and in the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation, whether it is halal, or allowed under Islam.
Indonesians are among the top global users of social media platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and Instagram.
The health ministry did not say how many infuencers would be first in the vaccine line, but others due to receive a shot on Thursday included musicians Ariel, of the band Noah, and Risa Saraswati.
Ahyani Raksanagara, head of Bandung’s health agency, told Reuters the artists would “hopefully convey positive influence and messages” about the vaccines, and especially to young people.
A poll last month showed just 37% of Indonesians were willing to be vaccinated while 40% would consider it, and 17% refused.
Some doctors have raised doubts over Indonesia's initial use of Chinese company Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccine - with studies from Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey showing efficacies ranging from 50-91%.
But in another possible boost for chances of acceptance, the country's top Islamic council has deemed the vaccine halal. 
However the decision to include social media influencers on the priority list backfired somewhat when photos of Raffi showed him partying hours after he was given the injection - which does not confer immediate immunity.
The images of him unmasked and flouting social distancing protocols with a group of friends drew criticism on social media, with calls for him to set a better example.
""It also shows the government is inconsistent in prioritising who gets the vaccine first,” said Irma Hidayana, cofounder of pandemic data initiative LaporCOVID-19, ""They should’ve done it with another health worker, maybe, not an influencer.""
Health ministry official Nadia noted that ""when you’re vaccinated, you still have to abide by health protocols and not be careless in enforcing them"".
Zubairi Djoerban of the Indonesian Medical Association said the strategy to hire influencers could only work if ""influencers are briefed about vaccine and COVID-19 so they can be agents of change"".

Police said they are investigating whether Raffi broke the law, while he has offered a public apology.

92,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 04:40AM ET</span>","Scottish nationalists set for record majority, boosting independence push","LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish nationalists are on course to win a record majority in elections for Scotland's devolved parliament that would start a new push for independence, an opinion poll published on Thursday showed.
Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister and head of the pro-independence Scottish National Party, will claim a mandate for another independence referendum if her party performs strongly in the elections scheduled for May 6. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who would have to agree to a new referendum, has said there is no need for a new vote after independence was rejected by Scottish voters in 2014.
The SNP is expected to win 71 of 129 seats in the Scottish parliament, eight seats more than it won in the last election in 2016, according to the poll carried out by Savanta ComRes and published in The Scotsman newspaper.
The only other time the SNP has won a majority was in 2011 when it won 69 seats under former leader Alex Salmond.
If Scotland voted for independence it would mean the United Kingdom would lose about a third of its landmass and almost a tenth of its population - just as the world's sixth-biggest economy is grappling with the impact of Brexit.
Johnson's Conservative Party may lose 14 seats in the Scottish parliament and the opposition Labour Party may lose three, the poll found, leaving the Conservatives with 17 seats and the Labour Party with 21.
Scots voted 55-45% against independence in a referendum in 2014, but Brexit and the British government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis have bolstered support for the SNP, with most polls showing a majority now favour breaking away.
The Savanta ComRes poll found 57% of people would vote for Scottish independence in a new referendum, close to a record high.

The poll was based on responses from 1,016 people in Scotland between Jan. 8 and 13.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A high-profile Japanese cabinet minister said on Thursday he was shocked at last week's assault on the U.S. Capitol, urging Washington to resume its global role as a ""champion of democratic values"" and the rule of law.
Speaking at the Reuters Next conference, Taro Kono, Japan's minister for administrative and regulatory reform, also said he hoped the United States would return to international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, both of which President Donald Trump exited.
""I must say it was quite shocking when I saw the mob going into the Capitol building,"" said the former foreign and defence minister, who was educated in Washington and worked on Capitol Hill.
As defence minister until September, Kono said he had shared concerns with counterparts around the world about the international order in the post-COVID-19 era.
""Maybe the world will be split into democracy versus authoritarian regime, free society versus Orwellian society,"" Kono, known for his outspoken views and ambition to be prime minister, said without referring specifically to Trump. 
""We need the United States to continue to take the leadership of democratic countries... (to) be the champion of democratic values, the rule of law,"" he said, adding that he was counting on the American people to ""straighten up"" U.S. politics.
""We will need the United States in - maybe not as a global policeman, but still the leader of democratic values.""
In a wide-ranging 30-minute interview in English covering topics including the Olympics, deregulation and corporate governance, Kono fondly recalled his Washington days, when Democrat and Republican lawmakers were friends outside the legislative halls.
""They may have different opinions, but once they moved out of the floor, they went out drinking or out to dinner or duck-hunting, and they had a very good friendship,"" Kono said.
""We really hope that Washington will go back to the good old days.""

Malaysia's King Al-Sultan Abdullah on Tuesday declared a national state of emergency to curb the spread of the virus and suspended parliament, which the opposition said was Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's ploy to retain control amid a power struggle.
In a letter sent to federal lawmakers seeking their support, Anwar accused Muhyiddin and the government of misleading the king when presenting their proposal for an emergency declaration, as provisions under existing laws were sufficient to contain the spread.
""The prime minister is more focused on efforts to cling to power,"" Anwar said in the letter, which was shared with media by his office.
The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a separate statement, Anwar said he hoped the king would exercise his wisdom in rescinding the emergency declaration and call for parliament to convene on Jan. 31 to discuss the emergency declaration, the pandemic and the ensuing economic fallout.
This was the first time the Southeast Asian nation has been placed under emergency rule in over 50 years, and only the second time parliament has been suspended since independence from Britain in 1957.
The emergency declaration, which could last until Aug. 1, came just a day after Muhyiddin announced a nationwide travel ban and coronavirus lockdowns in the capital and five states.
Muhyiddin has grappled with a razor-thin parliamentary majority and infighting in his ruling coalition since becoming premier in March. Two lawmakers from a coalition partner withdrew support in recent days, wiping out his majority.

NEW YORK/TAIPEI (Reuters) - The United States stands by Taiwan and always will, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said following a call with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who told her the island would continue to seek access to U.N. meetings.
Craft had planned to visit Taipei this week, in the teeth of strong objections from China which views the island as its own territory.
But the trip was cancelled by the State Department as part of a bar on all travel ahead of the transition to the incoming Biden administration.
Craft, who is due to leave the role when Joe Biden assumes the presidency next week, wrote on Twitter that it was a ""great privilege"" to speak to Tsai.
""We discussed the many ways Taiwan is a model for the world, as demonstrated by its success in fighting COVID-19 and all that Taiwan has to offer in the fields of health, technology and cutting-edge science,"" she said. 
""Unfortunately, Taiwan is unable to share those successes in UN venues, including the World Health Assembly, as a result of PRC obstruction,"" Craft added, referring to the People's Republic of China. 
""I made clear to President Tsai that the U.S. stands with Taiwan and always will, as friends and partners, standing shoulder to shoulder as pillars of democracy.""
Craft's visit would have been highly symbolic as Taiwan is not a U.N. member due to China's objections. Beijing says only it has the right to speak for Taiwan on the world stage, something Taipei's democratically elected government rejects.
Tsai told Craft that Taiwan would keep pushing for access to the United Nations and U.N.-related meetings.
""We will continue to show that Taiwan is a force for good and vital partner to the world and we are able and determined to contribute to the international community,"" Tsai said on Thursday during the video conference, according to clips provided by her office.
""Moving forward we will keep pushing for our participation in the United Nations and U.N.-affiliated meetings and events and I hope that the United States will continue to support our efforts.""
The Taiwan presidential office added that David Feith, Deputy U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs was also on the call.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the United Nations was made up of sovereign states and Taiwan had unfettered access to the World Health Oganization, which Taipei's government disputes.
""Certain U.S. politicians will pay a heavy price for their wrong words and deeds,"" Zhao told reporters. 
China has been angered by stepped-up support for Taiwan from the administration of outgoing President Donald Trump, including trips to Taipei by top U.S. officials, further straining Sino-U.S. ties.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday said he was lifting restrictions on contacts between U.S. officials and their Taiwanese counterparts.
Craft's Taiwan trip appeared to be another part of an effort by Pompeo and Trump's Republican administration to lock in a tough approach to China before Democratic President-elect Biden takes office on Jan. 20.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's top court upheld on Thursday a 20-year prison sentence for former President Park Geun-hye on graft charges that led to her downfall, bringing an end to the legal process and for the first time raising the possibility of a pardon.
Park became South Korea's first democratically elected leader to be thrown out of office when, in 2017, the Constitutional Court upheld a parliament vote to impeach her over a scandal that also landed the heads of two conglomerates in jail.
The daughter of a military dictator, Park took office in 2013 as South Korea's first woman president. She was brought down after being found guilty of colluding with a confidante to receive tens of billions of won from major conglomerates to help her family and fund non-profit foundations she owned.
Her case has been heard in different courts, including a retrial in July last year, but the Supreme Court's ruling on Thursday to uphold a 20-year jail term and fine of 18 billion won ($16.38 million) exhausts her legal avenues.
Park, 68, who has been in jail since March 31, 2017, has denied wrongdoing. She was not present in court.
The end of the legal process clears the way for a presidential pardon, which her supporters called for.
""President Park Geun-hye is innocent,"" the right-wing Our Republican Party said in a statement calling for her to be freed as soon as possible.
The chief of the ruling Democratic party, Lee Nak-yon, has floated the idea of a pardon for Park and another ex-president, Lee Myung-bak, also in jail on corruption charges, in the name of national unity.
Park is a divisive figure in a country where old Cold War fault lines between right and left can still define political rivalry.
When asked about possible pardon, an official at the presidential Blue House said that it was inappropriate to raise the issue immediately after the court ruling, and that Park's case should stand as an historical lesson.
A top aide to President Moon Jae-in, who is a liberal, had said the president would make a decision on the question of a pardon for Park that reflects the will of the people.
Society appears split down the middle.
A survey by the pollster Realmeter last week found 47.7% of respondents in favour of a pardon and 48% against.

Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co Ltd Vice Chairman Jay Y. Lee faces a final court ruling on Monday on whether he returns to jail on charges he bribed an associate of Park.

98,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: Kingmaker manoeuvres behind the men vying to succeed Germany's Merkel,"By Andreas Rinke and Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - The conservative leader favoured by German voters isn't even running in this week's contest to head up Angela Merkel's party, but he aims to play a pivotal role in determining its candidate to succeed her as chancellor, party sources say.
He may even take on that role himself if the eventual winner of the imminent party vote to replace her flops, according to the sources inside the governing conservative alliance.
    Merkel, who steps down after federal elections in September, is heading into the last months of her tenure with her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) squabbling over how to position the party following 15 years of rule marked by her instinct to compromise.
    The CDU elects a new chairman on Saturday, but none of the three contenders impresses voters, leaving the party wondering how best to replace Merkel, a proven election winner who has become Europe's predominant leader since taking office in 2005.
Centrist Armin Laschet, arch-conservative Friedrich Merz and foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen are battling it out.
Merkel said last year Laschet, 59, had ""the tools"" to lead Europe's biggest economy and most populous country, but voters find him uninspiring.
Enter Markus Soeder. The burly, confident leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), is voters' choice conservative. He senses a unique chance to assert himself as a unifier, or else as chancellor candidate.
""Soeder will either play the role of king, or of kingmaker,"" a CDU Executive Committee member told Reuters.
The three declared CDU candidates all differ from Merkel.
Roettgen, 55, the eloquent chairman of parliament's foreign affairs committee, wants Germany to take a firmer stance with Russia and China. Merz, 65, has targeted European Central Bank policy and is less diplomatic. Laschet, who has polished his international profile, complains Berlin has taken ""too long to react"" to French calls for European Union reform.
Soeder, 54, Bavaria's premier, is a political chameleon who has shifted from the right towards the moderate centre of late, though remains an unknown on foreign policy. 
He plays coy about his ambitions - ""My place is in Bavaria"" has been his repeated refrain.
But the Bavarian's lieutenants are already manoeuvring for the CDU/CSU alliance, the ""Union"", to pick the chancellor candidate most likely to win September's election, rather than simply default to the CDU party leader, as is traditional.
""A personnel decision will have to be based on this (criteria), regardless of who becomes the new CDU leader on Jan. 16,"" Alexander Dobrindt, the CSU's leader in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament), told a CSU gathering last week. 
BAVARIAN SWAGGER
Whether Soeder decides to run for chancellor, or simply plays a role in determining who will, his swagger promises to embolden conservatives tired of Merkel's centrist compromises - even if he cannot match her pedigree on foreign affairs.
After making his mark with a barnstorming speech at the CDU's 2019 congress, Soeder has cosied up to the environmentalist Greens - the Union's likely next coalition partner - and presented himself as a strong manager of the coronaries pandemic at regular news conferences alongside Merkel at which he has represented Germany's states.
He also projects charm that appeals to Germans beyond his native Bavaria.
""Soeder is a very savvy politician, but rather a novice when it comes to EU affairs and international politics,"" said Nazi Masraff, analyst at the Eurasia Group consultancy.
To be sure, no German chancellor has ever come from the CSU, although Franz Josef Strauss and Edmund Stoiber of the CSU were the Union candidates in the 1980 and 2002 federal elections, respectively, which were both won by the Social Democrats.
This time though, Soeder's hand is strengthened by deep divisions between the three CDU men - all from the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia - coveting the votes of 1,001 party delegates who will pick a winner at Saturday's digital meeting.
Laschet and Roettgen's supporters aim to stop Merz, who wants to shift the CDU to the right. Last year, Merz stoked party divisions by saying elements of the CDU establishment didn't want him to get the job.
A survey by pollster Civey for newsmagazine Der Spiegel late last month showed that if all Germans could vote, Roettgen, who is pitching himself as a moderniser, would be the CDU chairman and Soeder chancellor.
Roettgen has hinted at such a possibility. Last September, he said a CDU leader must ""be humble enough to do what is best for the party"".
The Spiegel poll showed voters favoured Roettgen for the CDU leadership, with 31.7% support, followed by Merz on 28.8% and Laschet on 11.8%. However, Laschet controls the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia, which provides 298 of the 1,001 delegates.
Ahead of the CDU congress, senior conservatives Ralph Brinkhaus and Wolfgang Schaeuble have both said the chancellor candidate does not have to be the new CDU chief - potentially opening the way for popular Health Minister Jens Spahn.
Asked on Wednesday whether he would run as a candidate for chancellor, Spahn, who is backing Laschet for party chairman, told Deutschlandfunk radio: ""As of today, I rule that out.""
Soeder has also signalled his support for Laschet, praising his experience and coalition-building abilities.
Serap Gueler, a CDU delegate and Laschet ally who plans to vote for him, called him ""a man of conviction"" but added: ""I think his weakness is maybe ... that he tries to explain certain things to the last comma, and that can make them complicated.""
Soeder wants to give the new CDU leader time to win over voters and, with his help, unite the party - or else unravel. He has called for the Union to decide on its chancellor candidate only after state elections in mid-March.
""If he feels that the CDU leader has a real chance, he will tend to play the kingmaker,"" said senior CSU lawmaker Hans Michelbach. ""But if he concludes the CDU leader doesn't cut it, then things are different.""

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said it would be ""very problematic"" for Ankara to turn back on its purchase of Russian S-400 defence systems but expressed hope that a dispute with the United States on the issue could be resolved through dialogue.
Akar also reiterated that Turkey was in talks with Russia on obtaining a second consignment of the S400 defence systems.
Washington slapped sanctions on NATO ally Turkey's Defence Industry Directorate (SSB), its chief Ismail Demir and three other employees last month following its acquisition of the S-400s.
""It is a very problematic situation to turn back from the point we have come to. We invite (the United States) to distance themselves from threatening language such as sanctions,"" Akar told journalists in Ankara. 
""We want the solution of problems through dialogue. If the U.S. side wants a solution, a solution could be found with work on the technical level,"" he said.
The sanctions were imposed at a challenging time in the fraught relationship between Ankara and Washington. President-elect Joe Biden is set to take office on Jan. 20, replacing Donald Trump. Biden has been critical of President Tayyip Erdogan's policies in the past.
Turkey has defended its acquisition of the S-400s as a necessity because it was unable to procure air defence systems from any NATO ally on satisfactory terms.
Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and to NATO's broader defence systems. Turkey rejects this and says S-400s will not be integrated into NATO.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A court in Cambodia convened on Thursday for the treason trial of scores of opposition figures, one of a series of cases seen by activists as moves by the ruling party to sideline threats to its political monopoly. 
The defendants are among 121 people affiliated with the dissolved Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) who are charged with treason and incitement. 
Sixty-one opposition figures have been summoned to appear in court, Mu Sochua, CNRP's deputy president who is in the United States, told Reuters in a text message. 
It was not immediately clear how many would show up, given many are in exile fearing they would not get a fair hearing.
The CNRP was banned and its leader Kem Sokha arrested before an election in 2018, allowing Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party to win every parliamentary seat, prompting international concern.
Theary Seng, an American-Cambodian lawyer who was among those due in court, said she had a right to express opinions, including the right to express dissent. 
""The real purpose of the charges against me is to silence me,"" she said in a statement. 
Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director Yamini Mishra said in a statement: ""These mass trials are an affront to international fair trial standards, Cambodia’s human rights commitments and the rule of law.""
Mu Sochua said in an email she would lead exiled party members and activists to Cambodia on Sunday to defend themselves in court, which she said was duty-bound to enable their return. 
Mu Sochua said the mass trials were politically motivated and that authorities were spreading fear to discourage opposition supporters from rallying behind their leaders.
The charges against party leader Kem Sokha stem from accusations he conspired with the United States to overthrow Hun Sen - accusations he and Washington reject.
The government said defendants would be allowed to return to Cambodia but must abide by the court's decision. ""We don't cause any trouble for them ... they can come freely,"" said government spokesman Phay Siphan. 
Justice ministry spokesman Chin Malin (OTC:MLLNF) said the court had ""fulfilled its duty"" but declined to say whether the defendants would be allowed entry.
The foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

SATJELIA, India (Reuters) - On a warm November afternoon, Parul Haldar balanced precariously on the bow of a small wooden dinghy, pulling in a long net flecked with fish from the swirling brown river.
Just behind her loomed the dense forest of the Sundarbans, where some 10,000 square km of tidal mangroves straddle India's northeastern coastline and western Bangladesh and open into the Bay of Bengal.
Four years ago, her husband disappeared on a fishing trip deep inside the forest. Two fishermen with him saw his body being dragged into the undergrowth - one of a rising number of humans killed by tigers as they venture into the wild.
That Haldar, a single mother of four, is taking such risks is testament to growing economic and ecological pressures on more than 14 million people living on the Indian and Bangladeshi sides of the low-lying Sundarbans.
They have led to a reduced dependence on agriculture, a rising number of migrant workers and, for those like Haldar who can't leave the delta to work elsewhere, a reliance on the forests and rivers to survive.
""When I enter a dense forest, I feel like I'm holding my life in my hands,"" said the 39-year-old, sitting outside her ramshackle three-room home on the Indian island of Satjelia after returning from a fishing expedition.
In the small yard, her father and some friends smoked wood to use it for building a new boat.
Haldar fishes in the river most days. Twice a month, she travels deeper into the forests to catch crabs, rowing six hours on a rickety boat along with her mother and staying in the undergrowth for several days.
Almost all of the 2,000 rupees ($27) she makes each month to run her household and send her youngest daughter, Papri, to school comes from fishing and crabbing. Her elderly father and other relatives look after the girl while she is gone.
""If I don't go to the jungle, I won't have enough food to eat,"" Haldar told Reuters.
It is 11-year-old Papri who keeps Haldar on the Sundarbans rather than seeking work elsewhere. If she goes, there's no one to take care of the child, she said.
""No matter how hard it is, I want to educate her.""
STORMS RAGE
Life has been getting harder in the Sundarbans. Many of the islands lie below the high-tide water level, meaning homes and farms are often protected by earthen embankments that are frequently breached.
With every rupture, rivers swallow up more land and inundate fields with saline water, wilting crops and rendering plots infertile for months.
And as climate change pushes up sea surface temperatures, the cyclonic storms that barrel in from the Bay of Bengal have become fiercer and more frequent, particularly in the last decade, researchers said.
An analysis of 1891-2010 data showed the Indian Sundarbans saw a 26% rise in tropical storms, with the frequency spiking in the last decade, according to a 2020 paper in the Environment, Development and Sustainability journal by researchers from the Jamia Millia Islamia university in New Delhi.
These more powerful cyclones bring bigger storm surges which can smash through, or rise over embankments, causing widespread damage, a phenomenon not limited to the Sundarbans.
""I think the diverse environmental assaults we're seeing in the Sundarbans are also occurring in many coastal wetlands globally,"" said William Laurance, a Distinguished Research Professor at Australia's James Cook University.
""These ecosystems appear to be caught in a vicious vice - between rising sea levels and intensifying storms on the one side and rapid land-use change and intensifying human uses on the other.""
In May, Cyclone Amphan crashed into the Sundarbans, bringing winds of 133 km (83 miles) per hour, killing dozens of people, flattening thousands of homes and destroying embankments. More damaging weather followed.
Walking over broken embankments on a southern corner of Kumirmari island, Nagin Munda stared down at his half-acre paddy field that had been flooded by saline water in October.
""I have no fish left in my pond, no vegetables in my garden, and half my paddy crop is gone,"" said the 50-year-old farmer.
Across Kumirmari, some 250 acres of farmland were flooded last year, affecting more than 1,500 families, local government official Debashis Mandal said.
In recent decades, an estimated 1,000 acres - more than 15% of Kumirmari's total area - has been eroded away, Mandal said, making farm land even scarcer.
""We are not able to stop it,"" he said, ""The river is eating away our land.""
DEATH AT DAWN
According to the Sundarban Tiger Reserve's director, Tapas Das, five people have been killed by tigers in India's Sundarbans since April.
Local media, which closely follow such attacks, have reported up to 21 deaths last year, from 13 both in 2018 and 2019. Many attacks are not recorded, as families are reluctant to report them since it is illegal to go far into the forests.
""The number of reported cases of human wildlife conflict and fatalities are certainly alarming,"" said Anamitra Anurag Danda, a Senior Visiting Fellow with the Observer Research Foundation think-tank.
A new factor behind the increase has been the coronavirus pandemic, which trapped tens of thousands of people like the Mondal family on the Sundarbans when they would normally be earning money as labourers elsewhere in India.
In late September, a group of more than 30 men left Kumirmari late in the morning and headed into the forest. Their mission was to collect the body of Haripada Mondal, 31, who had been attacked by a tiger during a fishing expedition.
Guided by the fishermen who had accompanied Mondal on his fateful trip, the men first spotted a pair of red shorts caught in the mangrove trees, two members of the party said.
Following drag marks in the soft mud, the group went deeper into the woods, wielding sticks and bursting firecrackers to scare away any tigers, they added.
""I found his head first,"" said Mondal's eldest brother, Sunil. The rest of the body lay a few feet away.
The youngest of three brothers, Haripada Mondal, like others in his area, dropped out of school early to find work.
Most years he would leave the Sundarbans to work as an agricultural labourer in southern India and on construction sites near the eastern city of Kolkata, his brother-in-law Kamalesh Mondal said.
He grew a crop of paddy on a leased plot behind his small mud house, where he lived with wife Ashtami and a 9-year-old son.
""Life was okay,"" said Ashtami, 29. ""We made ends meet.""
Mondal, the sole breadwinner, returned home from a construction job in mid-March, his family said, days before India's government announced a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The lockdown halted much of the country's economy, stalling the informal sector that supports most migrant workers and sending millions back home, including to the Sundarbans.
For months, Mondal sat at home without work as savings dwindled until, desperate for money, he decided to go fishing on the rivers encircling Kumirmari, Ashtami said.
""He said he would go nearby to fish and make 50-100 rupees to help with household expenses,"" she said. He left home before dawn, rowed into the forests and was killed.
""If there was no lockdown or no coronavirus, he would have left here to work.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un wrapped up a rare congress at a mass indoor art performance on Wednesday, state media said, but made no mention of a reported military parade.
Kim and other North Korean officials packed into an indoor stadium in Pyongyang to watch performances from military and civilian art troupes and youth groups, mostly on themes of glorifying Kim's leadership and reinforcing messaging from the congress, news agency KCNA reported on Thursday.
The congress, which ran for eight days in Pyongyang, is the first since 2016, and just the second since 1980.
The performance was the latest in a series of large gatherings this week where Kim and the other attendees did not appear to wear masks or use other social distancing measures, according to images released by state media.
North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but it has imposed strict border closures, domestic travel restrictions, and other measures to prevent an outbreak.
State media has not shown an expected parade. Such events are closely watched by international observers for signs of new military technology developed by North Korea, which is under international sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
On Wednesday Kim Yo Jong, the leader's sister and a member of the party Central Committee, criticised South Korea's military for saying it had detected signs of a parade in Pyongyang on Sunday. The move was an expression of the South's ""hostile approach"" towards the North, she said in a statement carried by KCNA.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior NASA scientist pleaded guilty on Wednesday to lying about his ties to a program that encourages researchers to develop relationships with China in exchange for grants, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday.
Meyya Meyyappan, 66, of Pacifica, California, entered his plea before U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel in Manhattan.
Prosecutors said Meyyappan participated in the Thousand Talents Program, a Chinese government program to recruit people familiar with foreign technology and intellectual property, and held professorships at universities in China, South Korea and Japan.
Meyyappan concealed this work from NASA and the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, and falsely told investigators in an Oct. 27 interview he was not a member of the Thousand Talents Program and did not hold the professorship in China, prosecutors said.
A lawyer for Meyyappan did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The defendant faces up to six months in prison under recommended federal guidelines at his scheduled June 16 sentencing, according to his plea agreement.
NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, oversees the U.S. civilian space program and space research. It had no immediate comment.
Prosecutors said Meyyappan joined NASA in 1996, and has since 2006 been chief scientist for exploration technology at its Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley.
The Justice Department has tried to clamp down on perceived Chinese influence over U.S. academia and researchers, including through alleged spying and intellectual property theft, as part of the Trump administration's broader hard line toward China.
Last January, the department charged Charles Lieber, the former chairman of Harvard University's chemistry department, with lying about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Program and research funding that China awarded him.
Lieber has pleaded not guilty.

Fire safety is an acute problem in Russia. The country reports deadly fire incidents on a regular basis, with blazes often affecting elderly people and children.
""In the fire on the second floor of a nine-storey building on the Belarus Street, five people were killed, including two children, according to the preliminary data,"" an official told RIA.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Cameroonian soldiers opened fire on villagers during a weekend raid in the country's southwest, killing up to nine people, including civilians, and injuring others, witnesses, health workers and a human rights lawyer said on Wednesday.
An army spokesman denied there were civilian casualties during the incident on Sunday in the village of Mautu in the South West region, home to a separatist insurgency. He called the accusation ""propaganda"".
For four years the army has clashed with Anglophone separatist fighters among the forests and cocoa farms of western Cameroon. Over 3,000 people have died in the violence, which has intensified since the start of this year.
Sunday's attack was described to Reuters by three villagers who said they fled into nearby cocoa plantations or cowered at home while soldiers rifled through their belongings.
They said they saw nine dead people, including a child and an old woman. None of the dead were separatist fighters, they said.
Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said it was treating four people from the village, all with gunshot wounds: a young child, two elderly patients and a young woman. 
""This incident is the latest in a significant upsurge in violence since the year began,"" said Gisa Kohler, MSF's emergency coordinator in South West Cameroon. 
Unverified videos shared by sources with knowledge of the attack showed several dead bodies with gunshot wounds, including a woman and a child laid out on a bamboo stretcher, as well as several young men. 
""This is an unconventional conflict,"" said human rights lawyer Agbor Balla, who said he had confirmed at least eight deaths in Mautu on Sunday, based on his own sources. 
""Civilians were killed. It was done by the military. We don't know if others killed were separatists.""
In a statement on Monday, the military said it was conducting a raid on separatist positions when it came under fire and had killed what it labelled ""terrorists"". It did not say how many died.
In response to Reuters questions about the incident, army spokesman Atonfack Guemo on Wednesday dismissed the witness accounts.
""Small terrorist groups and their foreign supporters have engaged in a battle of disinformation. We will not give in,"" he said.
The army has struggled to uproot the insurgency, which is made up of dozens of small armed groups and has become a thorn in the side of President Paul Biya's 40-year rule. 
BULLETS FLYING
The violence in Mautu comes as three soldiers face trial for their alleged involvement in the killing of 21 civilians last year in a village in the North West region. 
The separatists have committed their own abuses, including attacks on police and the army, and school kidnappings.
Louis, a cocoa farmer, said he was sitting outside when the soldiers opened fire in Mautu.
""Bullets were flying everywhere,"" said Louis, who like other witnesses did not want to use his last name for fear of reprisal. ""They chased me into the bushes and kept shooting.""
Fellow resident Enow said he was in a church meeting when the gunfire began. He ran into the surrounding bushes and hid. 
Not everyone got away. One 60-year-old farmer was at home when soldiers broke down his door searching for fighters and weapons. They found neither, and smashed his television, he said. 
None of the witnesses said they saw separatists that day. They all said that a woman and her young granddaughter were killed by the military. 
""They were people I knew,"" the farmer said. ""What have they done that they can be killed in this way?""

ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Renzi, who as prime minister once enthused Italians and foreign observers with his promises of reform, is now among the country's most unpopular figures, his name almost a byword for disloyalty and ruthless political manoeuvres.
On Wednesday Renzi pulled his tiny centrist party Italia Viva from the coalition, unseating Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's government and throwing Italy into political chaos in the midst of a resurgent coronavirus emergency.
His reason for doing so is hard to pinpoint. His original complaint was over Conte's plans for spending billions of euros promised by the European Union to relaunch the battered economy.
Italy's draft ""Recovery Plan"" offered too little for the health service, culture, and infrastructure, Renzi said, and it was to be overseen by a group of unelected experts which he argued was an insult to parliament.
Renzi, 46, called it ""a step forward"" on Tuesday when Conte amended the plan to address many of his demands, but by then he had plenty of new ones. 
""It seemed clear Renzi wanted to get rid of Conte and was searching for a reason to justify it,"" said Lorenzo Pregliasco, head of polling and political analysis firm YouTrend. 
""This crisis is not about policy, it is about Renzi's efforts to get a new government that gives him more political weight.""
Renzi says he has ""Italy in my heart"" and is acting for the good of the country.
Most Italians don't believe him. In an Ipsos poll on Tuesday 73% of voters said he was pursuing his own interests, compared with 13% who said he was pursuing those of the country.
PARTY COUP
At the peak of his popularity in 2014 Renzi, who had recently become prime minister in an internal party coup, led his Democratic Party (PD) to a huge victory at European parliament elections where it took 41% of the vote.
In his early months as Italy's youngest ever premier, Italians were won over in droves by his fast-talking, dynamic style as he promised ""a reform a month"" to overhaul the euro zone's most sluggish economy. Most observers forecast he would dominate Italian politics for at least a decade.
Seven years on, after bruising political defeats saw him quit first as prime minister and then as PD leader, his Italia Viva party, formed in 2019, now polls at less than 3%. 
""In all our surveys on politicians' personal approval ratings, Renzi comes bottom,"" said YouTrend's Pregliasco. 
Renzi became prime minister in 2014 by overthrowing a broad-based government led by his PD party colleague Enrico Letta, backtracking on previous pledges that he would only come to power in an election. 
Days earlier, amid rumours he was planning to unseat Letta, he pledged his support to him with the words ""stay calm Enrico,"" which have since become a popular Italian catch-phrase to signify political treachery. 
At that time, ""Renzi-frenzy"", as it was dubbed in the media, was in full swing and few Italians spared much thought for Letta, who left Italy to pursue an academic career in Paris.
Yet Renzi's honeymoon period soon began to sour, as the perception grew that behind his catchy slogans and wordplay there was more show than substance.
REFORMS
He passed reforms, most notably of the labour market and the education system, but these failed to kick-start the economy and Renzi's pro-business, free-market agenda alienated the PD's traditional voters while failing to lure conservative ones.
Renzi, always a combative character, was also making too many enemies in his own party, having ended the careers of several PD grandees during his rise to its leadership.
One of these, former Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, last week gleefully attacked Renzi for trying to undermine Conte's government, reflecting that ""you can't get rid of the country's most popular man at the will of the most unpopular"".
Renzi's downfall was triggered by his campaign to overhaul Italy's constitution in 2016 with a reform aimed at curbing the powers of the upper house senate, giving more power to the government and streamlining the lawmaking process.
The reform was thrown out in a referendum which many voters saw as an opportunity to sink Renzi, regardless of the merits of the constitutional changes.
Renzi had repeatedly promised that if he lost the referendum he would leave politics altogether, but within months he was campaigning to regain control of the PD. 
He succeeded, briefly, before resigning again after defeat at the 2018 election, which ushered in the government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and Salvini's League.
Since then, his reputation has continued to decline and 

Italia Viva has become the kind of minuscule party with the power to make of break governments, which Renzi used to say were the curse of Italy's politics when he led the PD in his heyday.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson accused caterers on Wednesday of insulting families with meagre food packages paid for by the government, to make up for meals poor children are missing in schools shut by the coronavirus.
Some of the food parcels were ""an insult to the families that have received them"", Johnson said, after images were posted on the internet showing packages that appeared to contain food worth only a fraction of the amount the companies were paid to provide them.
One Twitter user posted a photo of a parcel containing a loaf of bread, some vegetables, pasta, beans, cheese and a few snacks. The supplier, Chartwells, a unit of  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) PLC, apologised and said it would refund some money to schools.
Britain provides free lunches to poor children in primary schools, and turned to private companies to replace them with food packages after it abruptly shut all schools last week.
Manchester United soccer player Marcus Rashford, 23, who has become a prominent campaigner against child poverty, said he had discussed the meagre packages with Johnson on Wednesday.
""He has assured me that he is committed to correcting the issue with the food hampers and that a full review of the supply chain is taking place,"" Rashford tweeted.
Last year Rashford led a campaign to pressure the government into providing meals during school holidays. The government initially resisted but then agreed, and heaped praise on Rashford for his advocacy.
CCLA, Britain's largest investment manager for charities, called on Compass Group to answer questions about the provision of Chartwell food parcels.
""The company must be completely transparent, make adjustments and improvements as required and move quickly to restore faith in its business,"" said James Corah, head of ethical investment at CCLA. Compass did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has started work on uranium metal-based fuel for a research reactor, the U.N. nuclear watchdog and Tehran said on Wednesday, in the latest breach of its nuclear deal with six major powers as the country presses for a lifting of U.S. sanctions.
Iran has been accelerating its breaches of the deal in the past two months. Some of those steps were required by a law passed in response to the killing of its top nuclear scientist in November, which Tehran has blamed on its arch-foe Israel.
They are also, however, part of a process started by Tehran in 2019 of committing breaches in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the deal and his reimposition of U.S. sanctions that the deal lifted in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities.
The moves raise pressure on U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next week and has pledged to return the United States to the deal if Iran first resumes full compliance. Iran wants Washington to lift sanctions first. 
""(International Atomic Energy Agency) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi today informed IAEA Member States about recent developments regarding Iran's plans to conduct R&D activities on uranium metal production as part of its declared aim to design an improved type of fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor,"" the IAEA said in a statement.
The agency issues ad hoc reports to member states when Iran commits a new breach of the deal, though it declines to call them breaches, leaving that call to parties to the 2015 accord.
The deal specifically imposes a 15-year ban on Iran producing or acquiring uranium metal, a sensitive material that can be used in the core of a nuclear bomb. 
The IAEA's confidential report to member states, obtained by Reuters, said Iran had indicated it plans to produce uranium metal from natural uranium and then produce uranium metal enriched up to 20% for fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor. 
The deal also says that can only happen in small batches and in consultation with parties to the deal after 10 years.
Separately Iran also plans to enrich uranium to 20%, a level it last reached before the 2015 deal, at its Fordow site buried in a mountain, and it started that process last week. It had so far only gone as far as 4.5%, above the 3.67% limit imposed by the deal but still far short of the 90% that is weapons grade.
U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Iran denies ever seeking nuclear weapons and says its aims with nuclear energy are entirely peaceful.

Iran told the agency on Wednesday, however, that ""there is no limitation on (its) R&D activities"" and ""modification and installation of the relevant equipment for the mentioned R&D activities have been already started"" at its Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant in Isfahan, the IAEA report said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish fishermen have threatened to dump rotten shellfish outside the British parliament after their deliveries to the European Union were blocked by post-Brexit red tape.
The owners of two fishing companies said the introduction of health certificates, customs declarations and checks since Britain left the EU's single market at the start of this year had hit their delivery systems. 
In a video posted on Twitter, Jamie McMillan of Lochfyne Seafarms warned British Prime Minister Boris Johnson that ""if Scottish exporters can't get their product to market next week, we will be at the gates of (the Palace of) Westminster and we'll be dumping our shellfish on your doorstep, rotten."" 
""We are fighting for survival here,"" he said. ""Get it sorted and get it sorted now.""
A second owner, Santiago Buesa of SB Fish, said: ""I have plenty to dump as we can't get it sold because our markets have been shut down due to Brexit.""
French buyers have rejected trailer loads of langoustine and salmon worth tens of thousands of pounds this month because they took too long to arrive.
Logistics group DFDS suspended its groupage export service - which allows multiple exporters to ship products in a single consignment - on Jan. 8. 
It aims to resume the service on Jan. 18 after it clears a backlog, but it will take longer than before Britain left the EU. 
To get fresh produce to European markets, logistics providers now have to summarise the load, giving commodity codes, product types, gross weight, number of boxes and value, plus other details. Errors can mean longer delays and French importers have also been hit by the red tape. 
Fishermen in Scotland have stopped sending their boats out to fish. The Scottish government says the disruption has cost the industry millions of pounds in lost contracts, and meant lower prices at market.
The opposition Liberal Democrat party said the chaos was costing the industry 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) a day.

112,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 12:51PM ET</span>",Italy's government close to collapse ahead of Renzi news conference,"By Gavin Jones and Angelo Amante
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's government was hanging by a thread on Wednesday ahead of a news conference by former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi who has threatened to pull his tiny centrist party out of the ruling coalition, triggering its collapse.
Renzi will speak at 5.30 p.m. (1630 GMT). He has not revealed the reason for the encounter, but many observers believe he will use the occasion to announce the resignation of the two ministers drawn from his Italia Viva party.
Such a move would unleash political chaos on Italy as it struggles to contain the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic. Italia Viva's backing in parliament is crucial to the survival of the coalition led by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).
On Wednesday 5-Star and the PD reiterated their appeals to Renzi to preserve the unity of the government.
""I am not giving up, the PD is not giving up, (PD leader Nicola) Zingaretti is not giving up, we have to do all we can to save this coalition,"" PD Senate leader Andrea Marcucci, who is considered close to Renzi, said in a television interview.
As behind-the-scenes negotiations continued, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte went to see President Sergio Mattarella, the supreme arbiter of Italian politics, to update him on the unfolding developments.
Italia Viva, which has voter support of under 3% and is struggling to remain relevant, has been an unruly ally for Conte ever since his government was formed in 2019, and tensions have increased steadily over recent weeks.
Renzi's complaints originally focused on Conte's plans for spending billions of euros promised by the European Union to relaunch Italy's battered economy.
PRESSURE ON CONTE 
Italy's draft ""Recovery Plan"" offered too little for the health service, culture, and infrastructure projects, Renzi said, and it was to be overseen by a group of unelected experts which he argued was an insult to parliament.
The plan was finally approved by cabinet late on Tuesday and Renzi said in a television interview that the final version was ""a step forward"" and had addressed several of his demands.
However, he immediately raised other policy grievances and insisted Italy should apply for a loan from the euro zone's bailout fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to help its health service.
The 5-Star Movement, the largest ruling party, is strongly hostile to this idea and Conte has so far backed its position.
With free grants available from the EU's Recovery Fund, no country has shown any interest in taking an ESM loan, wary of pushing up their national debts and the market stigma that could be linked to taking money from a bailout fund.
Conte and 5-Star said on Tuesday that if Italia Viva withdraws its ministers a new pact with Renzi would be impossible, apparently ruling out the widely-touted option of a large-scale government reshuffle with the same majority.

Market reaction to the crisis has so far been muted, thanks largely to the European Central Bank's large-scale purchases of Italian assets. However, Italian bond yields climbed 10 basis points on Tuesday, the biggest daily rise since early November. They were little changed on Wednesday ahead of Renzi's news conference.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Climate activist Greta Thunberg is to feature on a set of stamps issued by Sweden's postal service.
She will join a hall of fame of Swedish personalities, from Zlatan Ibrahimovic to Greta Garbo, who have been depicted on the country's postage stamps.
The stamps go on sale from PostNord on Thursday and show Thunberg in her familiar yellow raincoat standing on a rocky coast looking out at a flock of birds.
""We hope that, as a big company, we can shine a light on the very important climate question, with the help of a little stamp,"" said Kristina Olofsdotter, head of PostNord's stamp division.
Several million of the stamps will be issued, Olofsdotter said, adding: ""There will be a lot of Gretas flying around.""
Thunberg rose to global fame in 2018 after she began skipping school to protest, alone with a homemade sign, outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm, demanding that her government take action on climate change.
Within months, more than 2 million students in 135 countries had set up their own picket lines, joining Thunberg's ""School strike for the climate"" campaign.
In 2019, Thunberg took a year out from school to cross the globe by car, train and boat - but not plane - to demand action on climate change, a trip that involved a brush with U.S. President Donald Trump and a speech at the United Nations climate summit.
Thunberg's movement, Fridays for Future, approved of the image on the stamp but played no part in its design, Olofsdotter said. 

Other stamps in the collection have an environmental theme, including depictions of Swedish mountains, lakes and forests.

The letter from Senators Chris Murphy, Patrick Leahy and Ben Cardin to Abiy Ahmed on Wednesday said that ""over the last few months, the Ethiopian government has increasingly engaged in a pattern of intimidation against journalists"".
They said this trend was in stark contrast to the beginning of his premiership in 2018 when his government had freed scores of detained journalists.
""We urge you to return to that path by immediately releasing all journalists in detention and taking concrete steps to protect press freedom,"" the senators said.
Abiy's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Media watchdog groups reported the arrests of at least 13 journalists in Ethiopia last year, seven of them in November when fighting erupted in Tigray between federal forces and the party governing the northern region. 
In late December, Reuters cameraman Kumerra Gemechu was arrested and detained without charge for 12 days. The arrest followed the beating of a Reuters photographer, Tiksa Negeri, by two Ethiopian federal police officers on Dec. 16.
Ethiopian police released Gemechu on Jan. 5.
The letter also referred to the shutting down of internet access in Ethiopia amid political protests and a communications blackout in Tigray during government military operations.
""These draconian tactics are a relic of Ethiopia's undemocratic past, when internet shutdowns and employing anti-terror laws to silence journalists were commonplace,"" the senators said.
Ahmed, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, has overseen sweeping reforms since taking office, including the lifting of bans on more than 250 media outlets and the release of dozens of journalists.
However, rights groups say press freedom has eroded as the government faced outbreaks of deadly violence including fighting between the military and rebellious leaders in Tigray.
Only one of the 13 detained journalists was charged, for social media posts about COVID-19 that were denounced by the health ministry as false, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists in New York and Reporters Without Borders in Paris.
The journalist, Yayesew Shimelis, was released on bail in April but his case continues in court, his lawyer Tadele Madhin, who also represents several other journalists, told Reuters. 
Overall, eight out of the 13 reporters have been released and the rest remain in custody, the two groups said. 

Reuters has not been able to independently confirm the overall tally for those released and those still in detention.

LISBON (Reuters) - Groups representing journalists and lawyers in Portugal complained of a threat to press freedom on Wednesday, after prosecutors acknowledged having spied on two reporters to try to ferret out their sources in a case against soccer club Benfica.
The prosecutor's office acknowledged late on Tuesday it had asked police to spy on the journalists in 2018, after the reporters published confidential details about an investigation into Portugal's biggest soccer team.
The head of Portugal's Bar Association, Luis Menezes Leitao, told ECO news outlet the spying on the journalists was ""extremely worrying"" as it could undermine media freedom.
The SJ journalists' union called the incident a threat to the ""exercise of free and independent journalism"".
The two journalists had both published details of an investigation into what became known as the ""electronic mole"" scandal, in which prosecutors accused Benfica of illegally accessing judicial records to get tipoffs on other investigations involving the club.
Benfica has since been cleared, although one former employee of the club and a judicial officer are still awaiting trial. 
DIAP, the investigative arm of Portugal's prosecutor's office, said the investigation into the club had been conducted under rules barring the disclosure of information to the public.
After the reporters published details, it had asked police to put the two them under surveillance, because it was of ""extreme"" importance to discover the source of the leaks, it said, describing the surveillance as legal.
According to the Portuguese constitution, journalists have the right to ""access sources of information"" and to protect them.

Waste collection, which was suspended last Friday, restarted on Tuesday and had reached 40% capacity by that evening, the city council said in a statement.
But discontent at the council's handling of the storm is rising, especially in the outskirts, according to the FRAVM federation of residents' associations.

The three Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) officials were killed, and five other party members were captured, after they refused to surrender to the military, the government's task force for the crisis in Tigray said on Twitter.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government declared victory in its conflict with the TPLF on Nov. 28 last year after nearly a month of fighting.
Fugitive leaders of the TPLF had vowed to continue to fight from the mountains of the region in northern Ethiopia, but Reuters has been unable to contact them for weeks.
The military said last week it had captured Sebhat Nega, a founding member of the TPLF. 
At the weekend, it said it had killed 15 members of the TPLF and captured eight others, according to state-run TV.
Seyoum was Ethiopia's foreign minister from 1991 to 2010. 
Air strikes and battles since early November in Tigray are believed to have killed thousands of people. Fighting is continuing in some parts and more than 2 million people need aid, the United Nations said this week.

Ex-President Felipe Calderon, who preceded Pena Nieto, launched the partial privatization of Mexican prisons during his 2006-2012 term with eight facilities.
Under Calderon's model, the contractors did not manage security or healthcare at the facilities, but instead secured the land, built the prisons and then provided services like food and laundry over 20-year contracts.
Lopez Obrador, who ran and lost against both Calderon and Pena Nieto, routinely criticizes both men on a range of policy disagreements as well as for alleged graft during their terms.

The leftist Lopez Obrador said a renegotiated deal should benefit the government's finances.

Vincent Muscat was arrested in December 2017 along with brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio, and accused of planting and setting off the bomb which killed the anti-corruption campaigner. The three are still awaiting trial.
Muscat has asked for a pardon on several occasions in return for providing evidence in the case and in other major crimes. 
The government finally announced its decision on Wednesday, saying it had rejected the request on the advice of the attorney general and the police commissioner.
Late in 2019, the government granted a pardon to the self-confessed middleman in the murder plot, Melvin Theuma. The suspected murder mastermind, businessman Yorgen Fenech, was arrested shortly afterwards and is also awaiting trial.
Fenech has denied the charge. 
In April 2018, Muscat gave police an account on how the Caruana Galizia murder was planned. His wife Pauline subsequently told Reuters she was upset he had not been given a pardon in return.
""It’s a complete injustice that Theuma should give evidence against Vince when Vince was the one that led police to him and helped solve this case. He is the one who should be pardoned, not Melvin,"" she said.
Muscat told police that the killers were paid 150,000 euros ($182,310) to murder Caruana Galizia. They used a bomb bought from Maltese gangsters and supplied by the Italian mafia, he said.

Without mentioning Trump by name, Lopez Obrador said it was not right that private companies should appoint themselves arbiters of what was acceptable for global consumption.
""I don't know if you've noticed that since they took these decisions, the Statue of Liberty in New York is turning green with anger, because it doesn't want to become an empty symbol,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular news conference.
""What we want in Mexico is that liberties are guaranteed,"" he said. ""Zero censorship. Prohibition is prohibited.""
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and YouTube are among the platforms that have at least temporarily cut off Trump due to concerns he could fan violent unrest following the storming of the U.S. Capitol building by hundreds of his supporters last week.
A combative leftist, Lopez Obrador in 2006 led massive protests in Mexico claiming he had been robbed of the presidency. He again cried foul when he was defeated in 2012, and finally won office by a landslide six years later.
A critic of Trump while in opposition, Lopez Obrador as president has regularly paid tribute to the U.S. leader, who is widely disliked in Mexico for his insults against migrants, and threats to inflict economic pain on the country.
Lopez Obrador made passing mention of Twitter, which has permanently suspended Trump's account, and Facebook.
He is not the only world leader to raise concerns about the measures taken by social media companies. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman said this week that she regarded the permanent suspension of Trump's access to Twitter as problematic.
Lopez Obrador also expressed concern about an ""invasion of privacy"" by companies, giving as an example what smartphones are able to learn about people's personal lives and tastes.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 11:35AM ET</span>",Brazil vice president trades barbs with France's Macron over Amazon deforestation,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian Vice President Hamilton Mourão on Wednesday fired back at French President Emmanuel Macron's criticisms that Brazilian soy is linked to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) deforestation, saying the European leader did not understand where most of Brazil's soy comes from.
""Mr. Macron is no good!"" Mourão told reporters, speaking briefly in French.
Mourão said the amount of soy produced in the Amazon is tiny and Brazil has the competitive advantage in agriculture, dedicating a much smaller proportion of its land to farming than France does.
On Tuesday, Macron said it was better for Europe to grow its own soy rather than importing Brazilian crops.
""To continue to depend on Brazilian soy would be to condone deforestation of the Amazon,"" Macron said on Twitter.
""We are consistent with our ecological ambitions, we are fighting to grow soy in Europe!""
While France itself does not import much Brazilian soy, the European Union is the second largest importer of Brazil's agricultural products after China. The EU imported 8.4 million tonnes of soy from Brazil in 2020, a 61% increase compared to 2019, according to Brazilian Agriculture Ministry statistics.
Brazil is seeking to expand those exports via a trade deal between the EU and the Mercosur trade bloc, which also includes Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
The details of the deal still must settled and ratified to take effect, but faces opposition from agricultural and environmental lobbies in Europe.
Macron has held up negotiations with Mercosur, saying he cannot sign a deal with any country that does not respect the Paris Agreement on climate change.
Preserving the Amazon, the world's largest rainforest, is vital to curbing climate change because of the vast amount of greenhouse gas that the forest absorbs.
Amazon deforestation rose to a 12-year high in 2020, with an area seven times the size of London destroyed, Brazil government data shows.

Hashem Abedi, 23, whose brother Salman killed 22 people at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in 2017, and Ahmed Hassan, 21, who tried to detonate a homemade bomb on a packed commuter train later that year, are accused of assaulting a prison officer at the maximum security Belmarsh Prison in east London.
A third man, Muhammed Saeed, 22, who was jailed last year after he admitted possessing articles connected to preparing for acts of terrorism, was also charged. The three have been charged with causing actual bodily harm. 
Abedi, born to Libyan parents who emigrated to Britain, was also charged with assault on a second prison officer during the incident which took place in May last year.
All three are due to appear at Bromley Magistrates' Court on April 7.
Abedi is serving at least 55 years behind bars after being found guilty of murder last year, while Hassan was jailed for 34 years for his botched attack that injured 30 people.
There has been concern about how those convicted of terrorism in prison are dealt with and the danger that they might radicalise others.
In 2016, Britain announced plans to isolate radical Islamists in high security jails to limit their ability to influence other inmates amid concerns that prisons were breeding grounds for extremists.
Last October, two inmates of a British jail who tried to murder a prison officer while wearing makeshift suicide-bomb belts, were convicted after an investigation by counter-terrorism police.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Australia's financial watchdog has drastically reduced the sum of money it says was sent from the Vatican to Australia, the Vatican said on Wednesday, after it earlier reported a huge figure which raised suspicions of money laundering.
The joint Vatican-Australian review showed only A$9.5 million ($7.35 million) transited between 2014 and 2020, a fraction of the A$2.3 billion ($1.77 billion) originally reported by the watchdog to widespread astonishment.
The Vatican contested the huge figures in December and asked the Australian financial intelligence unit, known as AUSTRAC, to review its calculations. Some media had speculated that the Vatican could have been used to launder money.
AUSTRAC's error was first reported by the Australian newspaper earlier on Wednesday, which said it was due to a computer coding mistake.
A Vatican statement called the mistake ""a huge discrepancy"". It said the A$9.5 million sent to Australia was mostly to meet ""contractual obligations"" as well as ""ordinary management"", which appeared to be a reference to its embassy in Australia.
The Vatican had said the original report of the huge amount of money and more than 47,000 individual transfers had sounded like ""science fiction"", because the Holy See's annual budget is about 330 million euros; it demanded a review. 
The Australian said AUSTRAC had told the newspaper the new calculations showed there had been only 362 transfers in that period.
Cardinal George Pell, who was the Vatican's treasurer from 2014 to 2017 told Reuters on Wednesday: ""I was relieved to hear that billions were not laundered through the Vatican while I was head of the Secretariat for the Economy.""
Pell, who is now in Rome, returned to his native Australia in 2017 to face charges of historical sexual abuse and spent 404 days in jail before his conviction was overturned last April.
Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane told Reuters last month that the Australian Church was not aware of any such transfers and that the bishops had sought clarification from the Vatican and AUSTRAC.

On Wednesday, the team vaccinated dozens of people with mental health and other conditions in Prague's Holy Family Home, giving them hope they will be able to enjoy the full range of activities after months of restrictions. 
""We are extremely happy we got in among the priority groups,"" said Jarmila Lomozova, deputy chief of the Caritas relief organisation in the Archdiocese of Prague.
She said the vaccine gave hope that some of the residents' favourite activities, such as singing and dancing with a visiting accordion player, could resume.
The home hosts about 70 people in apartments of up to 8 each. About three quarters were vaccinated on Wednesday, although some were unable to receive the shot for health reasons or because of recent COVID-19 infection.
Dr David Dolezil of the Prague Municipal Medical Centre said the mobile team of a doctor, two nurses and a driver was necessary to reach people with impaired mobility.
""We will vaccinate nine institutions in a week and serve about 350 clients,"" he said. 

The Czech Republic is proportionally among the world's worst-hit countries, with 13,656 COVID-19 deaths and hospitals creaking under the load of new admissions over the past week.

The announcement adds to a chorus of concern over the credibility of the election pitting Yoweri Museveni, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, against 10 candidates including opposition frontrunner Bobi Wine, a popular singer. 
While previous votes have been marred by crackdowns on the opposition, campaigning this time has been particularly violent. Scores of protesters have been killed and opposition candidates, supporters and campaign staff have been arrested repeatedly.
The European Union says the electoral process has been seriously tarnished by the excessive use of force and its offer to deploy a small team of electoral experts was not taken up.
A coalition representing hundreds of Ugandan civil society organisations said it had filed 1,900 accreditation requests but only 10 had been granted.
""Absent the robust participation of observers, particularly Ugandan observers who are answerable to their fellow citizens, Uganda's elections will lack the accountability, transparency and confidence that observer missions provide,"" the U.S. embassy in Uganda said in a statement.
Museveni's spokesman Don Wanyama said the African Union and East African Community would deploy observers and he couldn't remember when Uganda last sent monitors to the United States.
Museveni has dismissed interference by foreign partners saying they don't understand that Uganda's strength comes from the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party, the army and the economy.
""We therefore don't need lectures about anything from anybody. Because there's nothing we don't know,"" Museveni, wearing a military camouflage jacket, said in a television address on Tuesday evening.
Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the U.N. human rights office was deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation.
""It's a concern that we very much share,"" he said. ""There have been arrests, including limitations of rights, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly.""
SOCIAL MEDIA BAN 
Uganda is a Western ally, a prospective oil producer and is considered a stabilising force in a region where war has plagued some neighbours. It contributes the biggest contingent of an African Union force fighting Islamist insurgents in Somalia.
Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, is one the first opposition politicians to channel the grievances of young people into a viable challenge and this has rattled the NRM, analysts say.
""We are not preparing for the election. We are rushing our friends, our fellow citizens, to hospital because they are being brutalized by the military and the police,"" Wine said at the funeral of his driver, who he says was shot dead this week.
With nearly 80% of its people under 30, Uganda has one of Africa's youngest populations. That means the majority of Ugandans were born after Museveni took power in 1986 following a five-year guerrilla war.
More than a dozen European countries, Britain, Canada and the United States expressed their concern on Tuesday about media freedom and the harassment of reporters. 
Reporters covering opposition protests have been attacked by the security forces. Last week, police chief Martin Okoth Ochola said reporters would be beaten for their own good, to stop them going to places where their lives might be at risk.
""It's hard to say there wont be violence,"" said a senior EU diplomat. ""Every bit of the security apparatus will be on the streets. Theoretically that brings calm, but I think we know that just brings flashpoints.""
Uganda has also banned all social media platforms and messaging apps until further notice.
Museveni apologised for the inconvenience but said Uganda had no choice after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) took down some accounts which backed his ruling party.
""He wants to stop the use of our application, the youth vote application, which he knows functions with the internet,"" Wine told Reuters on Wednesday.
In what analysts called a display of force amounting to preventative intimidation, a convoy of armoured military vehicles rolled through predominantly opposition areas of the capital Kampala on Tuesday.

""The systematic attempt to stop free information, to intimidate voters, and to harass opposition candidates means that this is no longer a credible election,"" said Nic Cheeseman, a professor of democracy at Birmingham University.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan peace talks that resumed four days ago are effectively on hold, sources from both sides said on Wednesday, as negotiators wait for President-elect Joe Biden to signal whether he will stick to Donald Trump's aggressive schedule to pull out troops.
After a month-long break, some negotiators from both sides have yet to return to Doha, the Qatari capital that has served as venue for negotiations between the Afghan government and the insurgents to end decades of war. A diplomatic source in Kabul said expectations were low for progress before Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
The sides ""do not want to commit to anything before the 20th. They wanted to have the process going in the meantime because that was one of the requirements of the international community, so they have the process. But it is stagnant,"" he said.
In an agreement reached last year, Trump, who had long promised to end America's longest war, signed the United States up to a full withdrawal in coming months. But that depends on the Taliban meeting security conditions which the Afghan government says have not been met. Biden and his advisors have so far given few clues as to their plans.
'TOUGH DECISIONS'
""We are waiting for the new U.S. administration and their policies towards Afghanistan to see whether they would respect the peace accord,” a Taliban negotiator told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak publicly.
""If they don't honour their commitment of withdrawing their forces as promised...then we would need to make tough decisions by appointing hardliners to key positions on the ground.""
After months of little progress, the sides finally agreed ground rules for talks late last year. The talks then broke up in December, in part to allow negotiators to return home for consultations with their leadership. 
The sides announced last week they would re-start talks on Saturday. But so far only limited meetings between smaller teams called 'contact groups' have taken place, three diplomatic and Afghan government sources told Reuters.
Around four top members of the Taliban negotiating team were not yet in Qatar, the group's spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said. He said this was due to logistical issues travelling from remote areas where they were visiting family. They would arrive in the next few days and the delay would not affect the talks, he said.
Some Afghan government negotiators were also not yet in Doha. One, who has been receiving treatment for cancer, told Reuters she planned to travel there this week.
Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the Overseas Development Institute think tank, said one reason for the delay on the Taliban side could be that negotiators needed more time to confer with the group's leaders. 
""It's not yet fully clear why they are delayed, but with the growing speculation this can't go on too much longer without some sort of explanation,"" she said. The delayed return ""reflects the existing lack of momentum"".

A government-commissioned report published on Tuesday found an ""appalling"" mortality rate of around 15% among children born at the homes, reflecting brutal living conditions. Around 9,000 children died in all.
""On behalf of the government, the state and its citizens, I apologise for the profound generational wrong visited upon Irish mothers and their children who ended up in a Mother and Baby Home or a County Home,"" Martin told parliament. 
""I apologise for the shame and stigma which they were subjected to and which, for some, remains a burden to this day,"" Martin said. ""The state failed you."" 
The report detailed how many infants were taken from mothers and sent overseas to be adopted, while a number of children were vaccinated without consent.
Anonymous testimony from residents compared the institutions to prisons where they were verbally abused by nuns, while women suffered through traumatic labours without any pain relief. 
Relatives have alleged babies were mistreated because they were born to unmarried mothers who, like their children, were seen as a stain on Ireland's image as a devout Catholic nation. The inquiry said those admitted included girls as young as 12.
A coalition of survivors' groups on Tuesday said the report was ""truly shocking"", but it had mixed feelings because it did not fully account for the role the state played in running the homes and in separating single mothers from their babies.
The head of the Irish Catholic Church on Tuesday ""unreservedly"" apologised for its role.

The religious order that ran a care home for unmarried mothers in the Irish town of Tuam, where almost 800 children died, on Wednesday said the order ""did not live up to our Christianity when running the Home.""

A Chinese court last month handed down a four-year jail term to a citizen-journalist who reported from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus before it spread across the globe, while others who did the same have disappeared.
""To crack down on whistleblowers and citizen-journalists at this particular moment ... helps highlight to the rest of the world what the consequences of violations inside China can be,"" Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch (HRW), said after the release of the group's World Report 2021.
HRW Executive Director Kenneth Roth told Reuters Television in Geneva that China remained the biggest threat to global human rights and that President Xi Jinping had ""embarked on the most intense repression"" in the country since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.
China last year introduced a national security law in the former British colony of Hong Kong, under which 53 pro-democracy activists were arrested in dawn raids last week, while Beijing also faced accusations - which it denies - of persecution and forced labour of Uighurs in the restive farwestern region of Xinjiang.
Richardson, speaking at a webinar, compared the Uighurs' plight to that of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar but noted a much weaker international response. 
She also said it was problematic that the European Union, after a year in which China ""publicly shred"" its human rights commitments, agreed on an investment pact with Beijing, only setting out vague expectations that China will consider abiding by higher standards on forced labour and other issues.
But she noted more governments were coming together to criticise China. 
""Putting a dent in the Chinese government's sense of impunity for serious human rights violations is a real priority, we think, for governments and for institutions like the UN,"" she said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Donald Trump's business partner in Dubai on Wednesday said he was interested in expanding their commercial relationship despite the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week.
Trump has faced stinging criticism after encouraging supporters on Jan. 6 to march on the Capitol as Congress met to certify his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. That led to a violent invasion during which five people died. 
""Our relationship with the Trump Organisation, and especially with (Trump's son and Trump Organisation executive) Eric Trump and his team, is fabulous and we have no intention to cancel or to change that relation,"" DAMAC Properties Chairman Hussain Sajwani told Reuters.

CAIRO/KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Ahlam Hamid fled from her home in Sudan's Darfur region 17 years ago when government troops and militiamen, some on horseback, raided her village and clashed with rebels. 
Now she worries she will be at the mercy of those forces once more, as an international peacekeeping mission deployed to contain the conflict abruptly pulls out.
UNAMID, a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping force established in 2007 to protect civilians and facilitate humanitarian assistance in Darfur, stopped patrolling on Jan. 1, days after a vote by the U.N. Security Council to end its mandate.
After signing a peace deal with some rebel groups, Sudan's transitional government is starting to deploy a national force that it says will protect civilians. But thousands have protested across Darfur against UNAMID's exit in recent weeks, saying it will leave them more vulnerable.
The United Nations has reported a rise in violence across Darfur including tribal clashes, militia attacks on protesters, and renewed fighting involving rebel forces led by Abdel Wahed el-Nur, who is yet to sign onto the peace deal. 
Hamid has been living since 2003 with her family at Kalma in South Darfur, a camp that is home to some 200,000 of the estimated 1.5 million still displaced across Darfur's five regions.
Men risk being killed if they leave Kalma, so women venture out to collect firewood, work on farms or clean homes in the nearby town of Nyala, said Hamid, a 55-year-old who makes a living handweaving inside the camp.
""There's a high chance they'll assault you or rape you,"" she said by phone from the camp, referring to the militias. ""But otherwise you'll die of hunger.""
ATROCITIES
Darfur's conflict escalated from 2003, as mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against Khartoum. Government forces and mainly Arab militia that moved to repress the revolt were accused of widespread atrocities. An estimated 300,000 people were killed. 
The war subsided over the past decade and in April 2019 former president Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) under charges of genocide and war crimes in Darfur, was forced from power after an uprising. 
Darfuris say UNAMID offered a weak but necessary deterrent against militias originally armed by Bashir to fight rebels.
The peacekeeping mission has been gradually drawn down in recent years, but its full withdrawal has been delayed due to security concerns and the coronavirus pandemic. 
""UNAMID makes us feel like we're seen by the world. But now they are leaving us with the criminals,"" said Sheikh Mousa Bahar Adam, a community leader in Kalma.
As UNAMID repatriates its 7,000-strong force over the next six months, Sudan is starting to deploy its national force in Darfur. 
Half of the initial 6,000 peacekeepers will be police, with the rest coming from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the army, and the general intelligence service, according to officials. It will later absorb former rebels and civilians.
Rebel groups have agreed with the government to eventually increase the force to 20,000, said Nour Aldayim Taha, a leader in a Sudan Liberation Army faction that signed the peace deal.
""We hope that the national protection force created by the government of Sudan will be able to maintain the gains that were achieved by UNAMID in terms of protecting civilians and security,"" said Ashraf Eissa, a UNAMID spokesman. 
FEAR AND DISTRUST
Sudan's information minister Faisal Salih said it was natural for there to be a vacuum in the first phase after UNAMID's exit, but the new force would ""work together with the armed groups that have signed the peace agreement to maintain security in Darfur"".
But Western diplomats have expressed concern about the nature of UNAMID's withdrawal. They say long-standing opposition by Sudan's military to the presence of U.N. peacekeepers played into the Security Council vote. 
Britain said it regretted the resolution did not allow UNAMID to continue its activities as it draws down, in line with other recent U.N. peacekeeping missions. 
""It was the largest peacekeeping mission in the world and to have it end this way is not ideal,"" said one Western diplomat. 
Camps handed over to Sudanese authorities over the past three years with equipment worth tens of millions of dollars have been looted. Since the start of January, some Darfur residents have reported heightened insecurity, with an increase in incidents of theft.
Kalma residents remain deeply distrustful of government forces, in particular the RSF, which incorporated members of the ""janjaweed"" militias that terrorised Darfuris during the war and has cemented its role in the security forces in the transition.
The government says the targeting of civilians ended with the former regime. 
""There might be fear among the refugees towards the military as a result of what the previous regime used to do, but it is possible to rebuild trust by raising awareness that the government has changed and there is a new government whose goal is to protect civilians,"" said Salih. 
Hamid is not reassured. 
""When you go into the city and see a khaki uniform or the RSF uniform, your heart stops,"" she said.

The decision, announced by Navalny on Wednesday, signals his intention to continue his political struggle against Vladimir Putin and creates a dilemma for the authorities on how to deal with one of the Russian president's most prominent critics.
Navalny, who has been receiving treatment in Germany, accuses Putin of ordering his poisoning with the deadly nerve agent Novichok, and some supporters had urged him to stay abroad for his own safety. 
Putin has denied the authorities tried to poison Navalny and said Russian agents would have finished the job if they had wanted him dead. 
The Kremlin has said it has seen no evidence Navalny was poisoned and that he is free to return to Russia at any time.
Navalny, 44, said he had almost fully recovered his health, and that he was unfazed by the risks his return may pose.
""It was never a question of whether to return or not. Simply because I never left. I ended up in Germany after arriving in an intensive care box for one reason: they tried to kill me,"" Navalny wrote on Instagram.
""(Putin's) servants are acting as usual by fabricating new criminal cases against me. But I'm not interested in what they're doing there. Russia is my country, Moscow is my city and I miss it."" 
CONUNDRUM
Authorities have opened two criminal cases against Navalny, both of which he says are politically motivated. They have also started moves to convert a suspended sentence for a conviction he says was trumped up into a real jail term, one of various moves he says is an attempt to scare him into not coming back. 
His return poses a conundrum for the Kremlin: jail him and risk protests, punitive Western action and turning him into a political martyr. Or do nothing and risk looking weak.
Tatiana Stanovaya, head of political analysis firm R.Politik, said the Kremlin had repeatedly raised expectations that Navalny would be arrested and not doing so would risk being seen as weak by conservatives and the security forces.
""The situation with Navalny is very like two trains heading towards each other doomed unavoidably to collide,"" Stanovaya wrote on messaging app Telegram. 
Staying in Germany was a political risk for Navalny. Anti-Kremlin opposition figures have struggled in the past to retain influence from outside Russia, which holds a parliamentary election in September.

Navalny's videos accusing government officials of corruption are widely watched but opinion polls show Putin is much more popular. A poll last month by a private pollster found half of Russians believed Navalny had not been poisoned or that his poisoning was stage-managed by Western intelligence services.

138,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 09:15AM ET</span>","Trump, tech and TV have throttled press freedom, journalists say","(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump emboldened other leaders to quash press freedom, his message amplified by tech platforms and a mainstream media which did not know how to respond, three leading journalists and campaigners said.
CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Maria Ressa, who heads a Philippine news website known for its scrutiny of President Rodrigo Duterte, and Sonny Swe, CEO of Frontier Myanmar, told a Reuters Next panel that press freedom had deteriorated sharply. 
Ressa, who has faced criminal prosecutions for her reporting, likened the arrival of the major tech platforms to an atom bomb going off in the media ecosystem, with readers manipulated by algorithms towards ever more incendiary news.
Amanpour, the chief international anchor on CNN, said broadcasters and newspapers also had to look at the role they had played after they reported comments and news based on who had said them, regardless of whether they were true. 
""We should have dropped the mic a long time ago,"" she told the panel on press freedom around the world, adding that citizens also have to start taking much more responsibility for what they consume. 
Rights groups have warned that press freedom is in peril in many parts of the world, with journalists harassed by police, the judiciary, politicians and protesters on the streets. 
In 2020, the United Nations accused Trump's White House of mounting an ""onslaught"" against the media which, it said, had led to a very negative ""Trump effect"" on press freedom elsewhere.
Reacting to the report, the White House said at the time that it expected all news to be ""fair and accurate"", adding that Trump was ""not going to back down from calling out lies"". 
Platforms such as Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) had previously taken a light touch to policing posts from world leaders, arguing that people have a right to see their statements and it is in the public interest.
But the storming of the U.S. Capitol last week has prompted a rethink, with Twitter banning Trump's account, which had 88 million followers, due to the risk of further violence. 
The speakers said tech platforms needed to be regulated at a key moment in their development, although there is no easy consensus on who should lead this. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has criticized Twitter's ban on Trump and warned through a spokesman that legislators, not private companies, should decide on potential curbs to free expression. 
In Myanmar, Swe said, the government used Facebook to release news, particularly during the pandemic, which prevented journalists from scrutinising data.
Asked if they were more optimistic about press freedom in 2021, Amanpour said she was, while Ressa said it depended on how the industry handles this moment. Swe, jailed for eight years for breaching censorship rules, said he remained hopeful.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>",Romanian president approves corruption investigation against former PM,"BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian President Klaus Iohannis approved on Wednesday a request from anti-corruption prosecutors to allow a criminal investigation against former prime minister and senate speaker Calin Popescu Tariceanu for suspected bribe-taking.
Tariceanu, 68, has denied all wrongdoing.
Prosecutors have said Tariceanu received political consultancy services worth $800,000 during 2007-2008 paid by an Austrian company in exchange for government bills in its favour. 
Under Romanian law, the president must approve investigations against former cabinet ministers.
Tariceanu has said reopening the case is a way for Iohannis to take revenge and ""completely eliminate his only opposition from the Romanian political scene"".
Iohannis has so far approved all requests from prosecutors to open criminal investigations. 
Anti-corruption prosecutors first tried to investigate Tariceanu in the case in 2019 when he served as senate speaker, but lawmakers refused to lift his immunity. 
Tariceanu, who ran unsuccessfully for president and Bucharest mayor in separate elections in 2019 and 2020 respectively, also failed to get his party past the minimum required threshold in a December parliamentary election.
His ALDE party was a junior coalition partner in Social-Democrat-led cabinets during 2017-2019 which tried to decriminalise some corruption offences and shorten sentences, raising concerns in the European Union and triggering Romania's largest street protests in decades.
In 2018, a Romanian court acquitted Tariceanu in a separate case of charges of giving false testimony to assist suspects in a wider real estate corruption case. 
Investigations by anti-corruption prosecutors have exposed conflicts of interest, abuse of power, fraud and awarding of state contracts in exchange for bribes across political party lines in Romania.
Transparency International ranks Romania as one of the European Union's most corrupt member states and Brussels has kept its justice system under special monitoring since it joined the bloc in 2007.

A government-commissioned report published on Tuesday found an ""appalling"" mortality rate of around 15% among children born at a network of so-called Mother and Baby homes, reflecting brutal living conditions. Around 9,000 children died in all.
Relatives have alleged the babies were mistreated because they were born to unmarried mothers who, like their children, were seen as a stain on Ireland's image as a devout Catholic nation. 
""We did not live up to our Christianity when running the Home,"" the Sisters of Bon Secours, which ran St Mary's Mother and Baby Home in Tuam from 1925 to 1961, said in a statement.
""We failed to respect the inherent dignity of the women and children who came to the home. We failed to offer them the compassion that they so badly needed,"" the statement said. 
The government investigation was launched six years ago after evidence of an unmarked mass graveyard at Tuam was uncovered by amateur local historian Catherine Corless, who found public records showing that 796 children had died at the home.
""We acknowledge in particular that infants and children who died in the home were buried in a disrespectful and unacceptable way. For all that we are deeply sorry,"" the statement said. 
""We hope and we pray that healing will come to all those affected; those who are living and those who have died,"" it said. ""We hope that we, our church and our country can learn from this history.""

LAGOS (Reuters) - Kidnappings by pirates in the Gulf of Guinea hit a record in 2020, with well-armed and violent gangs defying regional navies and marauding further out to sea, a report from the International Maritime Bureau said on Wednesday.
Pirates in the West African region kidnapped 130 seafarers in 22 separate incidents, accounting for all but five of those seized worldwide last year. The previous record, in 2019, was 121.
The IMB's annual piracy report said that overall armed robbery and piracy incidents rose to 195 last year, up from 162 in 2019, an increase it attributed to attacks in the Gulf of Guinea and armed robbery in the Singapore Straits.
""The latest statistics confirm the increased capabilities of pirates in the Gulf of Guinea with more and more attacks taking place further from the coast,"" said IMB director Michael Howlett. 
""Despite prompt action by navies in the region, there remains an urgent need to address this crime,"" he added. 
The Gulf covers 2.3 million sq km (888,000 sq m) and borders more than a dozen countries, but experts say most of the pirates operate out of Nigeria's delta region. 

Though the region produces most of the oil from Nigeria, Africa's largest crude exporter, its economy is underdeveloped and there are limited jobs for local people.

LONDON (Reuters) - Insurers are set to raise the cost of providing cover for merchant ships through the Red Sea after a series of incidents that have hit vessels around Saudi Arabian waters, industry sources said.
The possibility of more attacks on commercial shipping carrying oil and commodities through these waterways is growing after the outgoing U.S. administration's move to designate Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement as a foreign terrorist organisation.
""We are seeing increased rates for vessels making port calls in the Red Sea due to concerns over risk of attack by militia groups, whereas previously this was of an issue of more concern in the Arabian Gulf,"" said Mike Ingham with insurance broker Gallagher. ""This will be impacting vessels travelling to Red Sea ports such as Jeddah.""
Every ship needs various forms of insurance, including annual war-risk cover as well as an additional ""breach"" premium when entering high-risk areas. These separate premiums are calculated according to the value of the ship, or hull, for a seven-day period. 
Breach rates have ticked up to around 0.015% of insurance costs from about 0.012% in late December, equating to tens of thousands of dollars for a seven-day voyage, according to market estimates.
""The real debate is on the Red Sea side after the incidents involving explosive devices. Everyone is watching what happens next,"" one war underwriter said.
Saudi Arabia said last month that a tanker anchored at Jeddah port was hit by an explosive-laden boat in what it called a terrorist attack. This followed a separate incident at another Saudi terminal on the Red Sea where a tanker was damaged by an explosion. 
The U.S. Maritime Administration warned seafarers last week that ""heightened military activity and increased political tensions in this region continue to pose serious threats to commercial vessels."" 
The Red Sea is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes leading up to the Suez Canal, with thousands of transits made annually through the Bab al-Mandab waterway at its southern tip. 
There are wider tensions after the seizure by Iran last week of a South Korean tanker further away in the Strait of Hormuz.

GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden needs to restore the country's credibility on human rights at home and abroad, the head of New-York based Human Rights Watch told Reuters on Wednesday, after what he said were four years of abuse of democratic principles.
Speaking to Reuters before the release of the activist group's annual report, Kenneth Roth said outgoing president Donald Trump had flouted human rights at home and been inconsistent in criticising other countries' rights records.
Biden, due to take office on Jan. 20, should make human rights a cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy, said Roth, HRW executive director.
""Trump has been a complete disaster for human rights, he flouted human rights at home with the fomenting of the January 6 attack on the Capitol being just the latest example of the natural culmination of four years of abuse of democratic principles,"" Roth told Reuters Television in Geneva.
With eight days remaining of Trump's term, the House will vote on Wednesday on an article of impeachment accusing him of inciting insurrection in a speech to his followers last week before a mob of them stormed the Capitol, leaving five dead.
Trump has denied responsibility for the violence and previous allegations of violating human rights. He has said his critics stole the election to block his ""Make America Great Again"" and ""America First"" policies, but produced no evidence.
Roth accused Trump of having ""cozied up to every friendly autocrat under the sun"" while reserving criticism on human rights issues for his ""perceived adversaries"" - Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, and ""sometimes China"". 
""But that kind of utterly inconsistent approach had no credibility. There was no force to his criticism when people knew that it was serving another political agenda, not a principled agenda,"" he said.
Biden should articulate human rights as a ""guiding principle of US foreign policy and then to stick with it, even when that’s difficult"", Roth said.
He urged him to call off arms sales to countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Israel and criticise Indian prime minister Modi over his policy towards Muslims, ""even though India is going to be an important ally in contesting China"".
Roth also called for Biden to re-engage with the United Nations' Human Rights Council, a Geneva forum which Trump quit in June 2018, ""even though it criticizes Israel"".

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A global team of scientists led by the World Health Organisation to investigate the origins of the novel coronavirus will spend around a month in the Chinese city of Wuhan, including two weeks in quarantine, a team member said on Wednesday.
Hung Nguyen, a Vietnamese biologist, told Reuters that he did not expect any restrictions to the 10-member team's work in China as they prepared to fly on Thursday from Singapore to Wuhan, where the first human cases were detected in late 2019. 
The United States, which has accused China of having hidden the extent of its initial outbreak, and others have called for a transparent WHO-led investigation and criticised the terms under which Chinese experts did the first phase of research.
""My understanding is in fact there is no limit in accessing information we might need for the team,"" Hung said, speaking via video-call from a Singapore airport hotel ahead of his early morning flight.
""We will see. We are not in China yet.""
Hung said the team had been having regular virtual meetings with Chinese virus researchers over the last few months ahead of the trip.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said his organisation looked forward to working with China to identify the source of the virus.
He said earlier he was ""very disappointed"" when WHO experts were denied authorisation to enter earlier this month, forcing two members of the team to turn back. China said there had been a ""misunderstanding"".
After a fortnight of serving quarantine in a Wuhan hotel, Hung said the team planned to spend two weeks interviewing people from research institutes, hospitals and the seafood market in Wuhan where the new pathogen is believed to have emerged. The team would mainly stay in the central Chinese city, he said.
Hung, who is based in Kenya, said his particular area of expertise, and the reason he was selected for the mission, was food safety risks in wet markets.
China has been pushing a narrative via state media that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, citing the presence of coronavirus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.
The WHO has said it is not looking for ""culprits"" and is willing to go ""anywhere and everywhere"" to find out how the virus emerged.
Peter Ben Embarek, WHO's top expert on animal diseases that cross the species barrier, who went to China on a preliminary mission last July, is leading the delegation. 
""What we would like to do with the international team and counterparts in China is to go back in the Wuhan environment, re-interview in-depth the initial cases, try to find other cases that were not detected at that time and try to see if we can push back the history of the first cases,"" Ben Embarek said in November.
Hung said he hoped the mission would reveal new details about the origins of a virus which has infected over 91 million and killed nearly 2 million people globally, but cautioned against finding firm answers.
""We want to find something, to find new information,"" he said. 

""But, myself, I don't expect personally after this trip everything will be clear. But that is really a necessary step forward.""

146,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 13, 2021 07:30AM ET</span>","Interpol red notices issued for ship captain, owner over Beirut blast - Lebanese state media","BEIRUT, (Reuters) - Interpol has issued red notices for the captain and owner of the ship that carried the chemicals which devastated Beirut in an explosion in August, killing 200 people, Lebanon's state media said.
Five months since one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts on record, big questions remain about the ammonium nitrate that detonated after being stored at the port for years.
The Interpol notices, which are not international arrest warrants, ask authorities worldwide to provisionally detain people pending possible extradition or other legal actions. Interpol issues them at the request of a member country.
State news agency NNA said on Tuesday that Interpol also issued a notice for a Portuguese trader who examined the cargo at Beirut port in 2014, without giving a name or futher details. 
The Interpol global police coordination agency says it does not confirm or deny red notices that are not publicly available on its website. An Interpol spokesperson said if there was a notice and it was not published online, that meant it was for law enforcement only.
Lebanese officials have faced accusations of negligence, with some port and customs employees detained in connection to the blast, which injured thousands of people. Families of the victims are still waiting for results of the investigation. 
Lebanon's public prosecution asked Interpol in October to issue arrest warrants for two people it had identified as the Russian captain and owner of the Rhosus ship which arrived in Beirut in 2013, security and judicial sources said. 
Their names did not appear on the public list of Red Notices on Interpol's website on Wednesday.
Boris Prokoshev, the captain at the time, has said the chemicals ended up in Beirut after the ship's owner told him to divert to pick up extra cargo, and that Lebanese authorities had paid little attention to the nitrate.

""I am shocked,"" he told Reuters when asked about the report of an Interpol red notice on Tuesday. ""I do not understand at all what could be the basis for my arrest.""

LAMEZIA TERME, Italy (Reuters) - One of Italy's largest-ever mafia trials kicked off on Wednesday, with more than 320 suspected mobsters and their associates facing an array of charges, including extortion, drug trafficking and theft.
The case targets the 'Ndrangheta clan, which is based in Calabria, the toe of Italy's boot, and is considered by prosecutors to be the most powerful mafia group in the country, easily eclipsing the more famous Cosa Nostra gang in Sicily.
The trial is being held in a converted call-centre in the Calabrian city of Lamezia Terme, with defendants placed in metal cages and rows of desks set up for the hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors, journalists and spectators expected to attend.
Many of the accused are white-collar workers, including lawyers, accountants, businesspeople, local politicians and policemen, who chief prosecutor Nicola Gratteri says willingly aided the 'Ndrangheta in building its crime empire.
Speaking to reporters as he entered the courthouse, Gratteri said the investigation had encouraged locals to speak out.
""In the last two years we have seen a surge in lawsuits from oppressed entrepreneurs and citizens, victims of usury, people who for years have lived under the threats of the 'Ndrangheta,"" said the prosecutor, who has spent more than 30 years fighting the mob.
The state will call on 913 witnesses and draw on 24,000 hours of intercepted conversations to support the myriad charges. Gratteri said he expected the trial would take a year to complete, with the court due to sit six days a week. 
Another 92 suspects have opted for a fast-track trial in the same case, with their hearings due to start later in January, while a much smaller group of defendants will stand trial in February over five murders -- including the killing of a mafia hitman who was shot dead because he was gay, prosecutors say.
The last time Italy tried hundreds of alleged mafiosi simultaneously was in 1986 in Palermo in a case which represented a turning point in the fight against Cosa Nostra, marking the beginning of the group's sharp decline.
That trial had a huge impact because it targeted numerous mob families. The Calabrian trial focuses primarily on just one group -- the Mancuso clan from the province of Vibo Valentia -- leaving much of the 'Ndrangheta's top hierarchy untouched.
""The road ahead is still very long, but we mustn’t give up because there are thousands of people who believe in us. We can't let them down,"" Gratteri told Reuters.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government executed convicted murderer Lisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death row, on Wednesday, after the Supreme Court cleared the last hurdle by overturning a stay.
Montgomery was the first female prisoner to be executed in by the U.S. government since 1953.
Challenges were fought across multiple federal courts on whether to allow the execution of Montgomery, 52, who was put to death by lethal injection of pentobarbital, a powerful barbiturate in the Justice Department's execution chamber at its prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.
The U.S. Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, cleared the way for her execution after overturning a stay by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Kelley Henry, Montgomery's lawyer, called the execution ""vicious, unlawful, and unnecessary exercise of authoritarian power."" 
""No one can credibly dispute Mrs. Montgomery's longstanding debilitating mental disease - diagnosed and treated for the first time by the Bureau of Prisons' own doctors,"" Henry said in a statement.
She was pronounced deceased at 1:31 a.m. EST (0631 GMT) on Wednesday, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement.
Montgomery was convicted in 2007 in Missouri of kidnapping and strangling Bobbie Jo Stinnett, then eight months pregnant. Montgomery cut Stinnett's fetus from the womb. The child survived.
Some of Stinnett's relatives traveled to witness Montgomery's execution, the Justice Department said.
As the execution process began, asked by a female executioner if she had any last words, Montgomery responded in a quiet, muffled voice, ""No,"" according to a reporter who served as a media witness.
Federal executions had been on pause for 17 years and only three men had been executed by the federal government since 1963 until the practice resumed last year under President Donald Trump, whose outspoken support for capital punishment long predates his entry into politics.
Montgomery's lawyers asked for Trump's clemency last week, saying she committed her crime after a childhood in which she was abused and repeatedly raped by her stepfather and his friends, and so should instead face life in prison. 
It was one of three executions the U.S. Department of Justice had scheduled for the final full week of Trump's administration. Two other executions scheduled for Thursday and Friday have been delayed, for now at least, by a federal judge in Washington, to allow the condemned murderers to recover from COVID-19.
The American Civil Liberties Union and some liberal lawmakers had previously opposed the government's plans to execute Montgomery, with ACLU saying her life had been ""marred by unthinkable trauma that resulted in documented brain damage and mental illness"".
Montgomery's execution was the first of 2021 by the federal government and the 11th since last year.

In 2020, the U.S. government executed 10 people and it was for the first time ever that the federal government conducted more executions than all U.S. states combined, according to a database compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center.

The search in the Java Sea had to be halted due to bad weather that whipped up waves of up to 2.5 metres (8.2 feet) in height, officials said.
Earlier on Wednesday, divers retrieved more debris and a damaged Identity card of one of the victims, Navy official Abdul Rasyid told reporters on board the Indonesian navy ship Rigel (NASDAQ:RIGL).
Divers retrieved the plane's flight data recorder (FDR) from the seabed on Tuesday and officials said they had also found the beacon that was attached to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR).
A remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROV) will be deployed to scour the seabed on Wednesday, Abdul said, adding that the search had been made more complicated because no pings were now being emitted after the beacon detached from the CVR.
""We have the ROV that will confirm the location again and tomorrow we will dive and comb that location again,"" he said. 
Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said on Tuesday he had ""high confidence"" of finding the recorder soon.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-500 jet crashed into the Java Sea on Saturday four minutes after takeoff from Jakarta's main airport. 
Investigators will rely heavily on the two black boxes to determine the cause of the crash.
Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) expects to download the FDR data within two to five days. 
The FDR contains about 25 hours of data on eight tracks and the CVR has 30 minutes of conversation, according to the final report on a similar model of a Boeing 737 which crashed in 2008.
A team from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board will be traveling to Jakarta in coming days to help with the investigation.
The KNKT's initial findings showed the plane's engine was running when it hit the water, based on the damage seen on jet parts retrieved from the sea.
Indonesia's transport ministry said on Tuesday the plane, which was grounded during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, had passed an airworthiness inspection on Dec. 14 and had returned to service shortly after.

Iran has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, regarding such weapons as an important deterrent and retaliatory force against U.S. and other adversaries in the event of war.
The West sees Iran's missiles both as a conventional military threat to regional stability and a possible delivery mechanism for nuclear weapons should Tehran develop them.
The Iranian-made warship Makran, which state media described as Iran's biggest warship with a helicopter pad, and a missile-launching ship called Zereh (armour) were taking part in the two-day exercise in the Gulf of Oman. 
Tensions between the United States and Iran have risen since 2018, when President Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal. The United States restored harsh sanctions to pressure Iran into negotiating stricter curbs on its nuclear programme, ballistic missile development and support for regional proxy forces.
In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations between Iran’s military and U.S. forces in the Gulf, where Tehran holds annual exercises to display the Islamic Republic's military might to confront ""foreign threats"". 
Last week, Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps seized a South Korean-flagged tanker in Gulf waters and detained its crew amid tensions between Tehran and Seoul over Iranian funds frozen in South Korean banks due to U.S. sanctions.
In early 2019, Iran heightened tensions in the world's busiest oil waterway by seizing British-flagged tanker Stena Impero two weeks after a British warship had intercepted an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar.

Hoang Lam Phuc, 17, for whom dozens gathered outside the court to show their support, was part of a group of 12 captured at sea in August 2020 by Chinese authorities as they tried to flee Hong Kong on a speedboat believed to be bound for Taiwan.
Hoang and another minor were returned by China to Hong Kong on Dec. 30 while the other 10 were sentenced by a court in the neighbouring mainland city of Shenzhen to between seven months and three years in jail for illegally crossing the border.
Their virtual incommunicado detention has drawn condemnation from rights groups and the West at a time of growing fears about the city's high degree of autonomy.
Authorities have denied family and lawyers access to the 12, insisting they be represented by officially appointed lawyers. China has said their ""legitimate rights"" have been protected and their case was handled according to the law.
All of the 12 had faced charges in Hong Kong linked to an anti-government protest movement, including rioting and violation of a contentious national security law that China imposed in June 2020.
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and assembly. Democracy activists complain that Communist Party rulers in Beijing are whittling away at those freedoms, a charge China rejects.
Hoang, who did not apply for bail, is remanded in custody and his case will resume on Feb. 26. Prosecutors are looking into whether to press further charges, including absconding and conspiracy to aid criminals.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court acquitted on Wednesday the leader of a Christian sect charged with obstructing efforts to stamp out one of the world's first big surges of novel coronavirus infections, the Yonhap news agency said. 
Lee Man-hee, a self-proclaimed messiah who founded and heads the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, had been accused of violating the Infectious Disease Control and Prevention Act by providing incomplete lists of church members requested by health authorities to trace suspected coronavirus infections.
The church was at the centre of the first major COVID-19 epidemic outside China early last year, with nearly 4,200 of its 310,000 followers infected after attending a service in the city of Daegu. 
Authorities at the time complained that Lee was not fully cooperating when it came to providing the names of everyone who might have attended services at the church.
Prosecutors had sought a five-year jail term and 3 million won ($2,700) in fines for Lee. 
Lee denied any wrongdoing. He apologised that some church members had caught the virus.
The Suwon District Court acquitted him of the charges, saying lists of church members did not constitute key elements of epidemiological surveys as defined in the law, Yonhap said. 
The court, however, found Lee guilty of embezzling 5.6 billion won ($5.11 million) of church funds to build a residence, and using government facilities for religious services without approval, handing him a four-year suspended prison sentence.
Court officials were not immediately available for comment.
The church welcomed Lee's acquittal of the COVID-19 accusations but expressed ""deep regret"" that he had been found guilty of the other charges.
It said it would appeal to prove his innocence.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Prime Minister Juri Ratas of European Union member Estonia announced his intention to resign early on Wednesday, his spokeswoman said, in the wake of an inquiry into a property development project in the capital.
Ratas went to Estonia's president on Wednesday morning to present his resignation, news wire BNS reported. The spokeswoman, Liisi Poll, said the president will have the task of proposing the next leader of government to the parliament.
BNS said Ratas' party was declared suspect on Tuesday in a criminal investigation over the financing of a property development project in Tallinn.
""While there definitely are other ways to go about it, only one of them seemed to be right,"" Ratas, who denies any knowledge of the financing, told reporters, according to BNS.
He took the decision after a party meeting on Tuesday to discuss the charges, which dragged into the early hours of Wednesday, BNS added.
Ratas, prime minister since late 2016, lost the 2019 general election, in which the center-right Reform Party emerged as the largest party.
He then blocked the winner from taking power by forming a surprise coalition of his left-leaning Centre, the conservative Fatherland party and the far-right EKRE that gave the three parties a majority in parliament.

Estonia's next general election is due in March 2023.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for increased military power and greater nuclear war deterrence, state news agency KCNA reported on Wednesday, as a rare ruling party congress came to a close after eight days of policy discussions.
The Eighth Party Congress occurred less than two weeks before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office and amid a prolonged gridlock in talks aimed at ending the North's nuclear and missile programmes in return for U.S. sanctions relief.
""We must do everything we can to increase nuclear war deterrence even further as we build the strongest military capability,"" KCNA quoted Kim as saying at the conclusion of the congress.
Since announcing a self-declared moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in 2018, Kim has called for continued production of nuclear weapons for his arsenal, launched a series of smaller missiles, and unveiled what would be North Korea's largest ICBM yet at a parade in October.
Separately, Kim Yo Jong, the leader's sister and a member of the party Central Committee, criticised South Korea's military for monitoring a parade in Pyongyang. The move was an expression of the South's ""hostile approach"" towards the North, she said in a separate statement carried by KCNA.
South Korea's military said on Monday it had detected signs that North Korea held a nighttime military parade on Sunday for the congress.
Kim's remarks come after South Korean President Moon Jae-in pledged to help engineer a breakthrough in stalled denuclearisation talks.
Kim Yo Jong has been serving as her brother's ""de facto second-in-command,"" and her remarks ignoring Moon’s call for dialogue is a proof of her role in the regime, said Moon Seong-mook, a former South Korean military official and head of the Unification Strategy Center in Seoul.
“She didn't mention dialogues with South Korea at all, even though the statement came a day after Moon’s New Year's speech, which hints that talks or meetings are distant,” he said.
TIGHTENING STATE CONTROL
The results of the congress highlight how Kim Jong Un is continuing to tighten state control over society as well as the economy, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a North Korean economy expert at the U.S-based Stimson Center think-tank.
“Kim’s report is abundantly clear in stating that he wants the state to be the main planner and decision-maker not just over the general direction of the economy, but on a much more detailed level than that,” he wrote in a report on Tuesday. 
Recent policies have exerted greater centralized control of consumer markets in the country, imposed limits on foreign exchange, and crackdowns on smuggling along the border with China.
The congress, which ran for eight days in Pyongyang, is the first since 2016, and just the second since 1980.
On Tuesday, Kim, cemented his power at the congress with his election as party general secretary.

A meeting of the Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA), or parliament, is scheduled on Sunday to discuss adopting a law on the five-year economic plan and state budget, KCNA said.

BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cancelled his Europe trip at the last minute on Tuesday after Luxembourg's foreign minister and top European Union officials declined to meet with him, European and U.S. diplomats familiar with the matter said.
    The extraordinary snub of the top U.S. diplomat, first reported by Reuters, came days after the storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, an unprecedented attack on American democracy that stunned many world leaders and U.S. allies.
Pompeo, a close ally of Trump, had sought to meet Jean Asselborn in Luxembourg, a small but wealthy NATO ally, before meeting EU leaders and the bloc's top diplomat in Brussels, three people close to the planning told Reuters.
But the initial plan to go to Luxembourg, which had not been officially announced, was scrapped after officials there showed reluctance to grant Pompeo appointments, a diplomatic source said. The Brussels leg was still on until the last minute.
But the thin itinerary of Pompeo's final visit to Brussels raised questions about the merit of the trip. There were no meetings on his schedule with EU officials or any public events at NATO. A third diplomatic source said allies were ""embarrassed"" by Pompeo after the violence in Washington last Wednesday that left five dead.
Trump encouraged his supporters at a rally earlier that day to march on the building that houses the Senate and the House of Representatives while lawmakers were certifying Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's Nov. 3 election victory. The Republican president claims, without evidence, that the election was stolen from him.
Pompeo condemned the violence but made no reference to the role that Trump's baseless claims played in galvanizing the march on the Capitol.
Appalled by the violence, Luxembourg's Asselborn had called Trump a ""criminal"" and a ""political pyromaniac"" on RTL Radio the next day.
Luxembourg's foreign ministry confirmed the previously planned stop there was cancelled, but declined to give further details. The EU declined to comment.
The U.S. State Department, in a statement, attributed the cancellation to transition work before Biden takes office on Jan. 20, even if Pompeo had been reluctant until recently to unequivocally recognize Biden's win. The State Department declined further comment on European officials' rejection of meetings with Pompeo.
In Brussels, Pompeo was due to have a private dinner with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg on Wednesday evening at Stoltenberg's private residence, before meeting Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes, whose country is a NATO ally.
One of the sources said the lack of any public events at NATO was another reflection of European officials questioning the point of the trip. It was not immediately clear why Pompeo sought to go to Brussels so near to the end of Trump's term.
EAGER TO BUILD TIES WITH BIDEN
The cold shoulder was a contrast with Pompeo's previous visits to Brussels, which is home to NATO and EU headquarters, over the past three years, where he has given keynote speeches on U.S. policy and met the EU's chief executive, even as Europe balked at Trump's foreign policy.
In 2018, Pompeo said in Brussels that Trump's 'America First' policy was reshaping the post-World War Two system on the basis of sovereign states, not institutions such as the EU.
EU officials, who say they were exhausted by Trump's unpredictability, are eager to build fresh ties with Biden.
One source, while explaining why Pompeo chose to remain in Washington, cited his eagerness to roll out planned foreign policy tasks until the end of the term and help keep the continuity of government. 
For nearly three years, Pompeo proved a loyal executor of Trump's unconventional style.
His tenure did not include obvious successes in such long-standing U.S. foreign policy challenges as reining in the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs, ending the U.S. war in Afghanistan or containing an increasingly assertive China.
Nevertheless on Jan. 1, Pompeo kicked off a daily Twitter thread, saying the United States was ""much safer"" today than four years ago thanks to what he saw as the foreign policy accomplishments of the Trump administration.
He said he would showcase the results. ""Over the coming days, I'm going to lay out the mission set, the huge wins, personal stories, and a lot more. Just me, Mike,"" he said.

The tweets, along with some of his foreign trips, have been largely seen as part of his bid to lay the groundwork for his much-anticipated 2024 run for the Republican nomination for president.

Police were called to the parliament building, known as the Beehive, about 5:30 a.m. after a 31-year-old man was spotted with an axe. He was arrested in about 10 minutes, the police said in a statement.
""The man caused some damage to glass panels but did not attempt to enter the building,"" the police said.
New Zealand's lawmakers are on summer break, and there were few people in the building at the time. The reason behind the attack was unclear and the police were investigating.
The man was due to appear in Wellington district court later Wednesday and has been charged with intentional damage and possession of an offensive weapon.
Attacks on the parliament and on lawmakers are rare in New Zealand, a country of 5 million people, where ministers and top officials walk freely and are often seen mixing with the public at shops and cafes in the capital, Wellington.
In another rare attack in 2019, Climate Change minister James Shaw was punched in the face while walking to work.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A cancellation of all travel by the U.S. State Department this week includes a planned visit to Taiwan by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft, a State Department spokeswoman said on Tuesday. 
Craft had been due to visit Taiwan from Wednesday to Friday, prompting China to warn that Washington was playing with fire. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that all travel this week had been canceled, including his own trip to Europe, as part of the transition to the incoming Biden administration.
But European diplomats and other people familiar with the matter said Luxembourg's foreign minister and top European Union officials had declined to meet with him during his planned European trip this week.
Craft's Taiwan trip appeared to be another part of an effort by Pompeo and President Donald Trump's Republican administration to lock in a tough approach to China before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20. 
Taiwan's government expressed ""understanding and respect"" for the decision, but also regret.
""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regrets that the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft cannot lead a delegation to visit Taiwan from Jan. 13 to 15 as scheduled, but welcomes Ambassador Craft to visit at an appropriate time in the future,"" it said in a statement.
Craft is due to leave the role when Biden assumes the presidency next week. 
China had said it was firmly opposed to the visit. A representative of China's mission to the United Nations in New York urged Washington to stop ""creating obstacles"" for the relationship between China and the United States. 
""It's time that the crazy, irrational behaviors of certain people come to a stop,"" the Chinese representative said. 
Beijing, which claims the self-governed island as its own territory, has been angered by stepped-up support for Taiwan from the Trump administration, including trips to Taipei by top U.S. officials, further straining Sino-U.S. ties. Pompeo on Saturday said he was lifting restrictions on contacts between U.S. officials and their Taiwanese counterparts.
Chinese fighter jets approached the island in August and September during the last two visits - by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach, respectively.

While the United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is the island's strongest international backer and arms supplier, being obliged to help provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.

LONDON (Reuters) - Shared images of meagre food packages supplied to children by schools during England's COVID-19 lockdown prompted an outcry on Tuesday and led the government to warn private suppliers to raise their standards.
With England in lockdown to try to control a surge in coronavirus cases, the government has asked schools to provide free lunches for eligible children stuck at home.
However, images shared online of some of the food parcels were criticized by politicians, celebrities and the public, who questioned whether they contained enough food and nutrition for the number of meals they were supposed to cover.
The outcry began when one Twitter user posted a parcel she said was expected to last 10 days of lunches containing: a loaf of bread, two potatoes, two carrots, three apples, a tomato, some dried pasta, bananas, cheese, beans and other small snacks.
""The photos being shared on social media today are completely unacceptable and do not reflect the high standard of free school meals we expect to be sent to children,"" Children and Families Minister Vicky Ford said.
Children are eligible for the programme if they are in their first three years of schooling - roughly aged 4 to 7 - or if their parents receive certain state benefits. More than 1.4 million children qualify.
Reuters spoke to the Twitter user who posted the original photo. She declined to be named, but confirmed the photograph showed everything in the package she had collected from the school for one child.
""What they're going to end up with on a typical day is one round of cheese sandwich with one quite thin slice of cheese in it and no butter on the bread - that is going to be quite hard to eat,"" she said. 
The pack was supplied by Chartwells, part of the FTSE-listed  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) PLC. Supply contracts are not negotiated by central government.
The firm said the package in question was only intended to last five days. It apologised for the quantity it offered and said it would refund schools in cases where it had not met its standards. 
""In our efforts to provide thousands of food parcels a week at extremely short notice we are very sorry the quantity has fallen short in this instance,"" a spokeswoman for Chartwells said in an emailed statement. 
Other users posted images they said showed similar food packages received from schools, which can come from a range of suppliers. Reuters could not verify all the images.

""Something is going wrong and we need to fix it, quickly!"" said Premier League soccer player Marcus Rashford, who led a publicity campaign last year to pressure the government into extending the provision of meals to include school holiday times, which it later did.

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Coronavirus-induced lockdowns caused annual traffic congestion to fall in most countries for the first time in at least 10 years, disrupting long-held traffic patterns like the dreaded morning commute to work, a report released on Tuesday showed.
Congestion declined sharply on the gridlocked roads of crowded cities, including Los Angeles, Bengaluru and Mexico City in 2020, location technology company TomTom said. The pandemic is expected to weigh again on traffic congestion this year, said Nick Cohn, TomTom's senior traffic expert.
""We're going to see continued restrictions through the first half of the year, and I think we're going to see a lot of ups and downs before we're really getting back to any normal driving patterns and traffic activity levels,"" Cohn told Reuters in an interview. 
TomTom's report is based on data from 416 cities in 57 countries. It has published its traffic index for 10 years.
The downturn in congestion in the United States was more prolonged compared with Europe last year because U.S. coronavirus cases stayed relatively high during the summer and early fall, Cohn said. 
In the United States, Los Angeles, New York and Miami were the most congested cities, though traffic in each city dropped from 2019 levels by 36%, 30% and 26%, respectively, TomTom data showed.
Overall, Moscow was the most congested city in 2020, but traffic fell 8% from 2019. Bengaluru was the most-congested city in the world in 2019, but it fell to sixth in 2020 with nearly a 30% of drop in traffic year-on-year.
Traffic in London and Paris was almost 20% lower than in 2019, and traffic in Madrid and Rome dropped 35% and 29%, respectively. Berlin experienced only a 6% traffic fall compared with 2019.
Traffic patterns like the daily morning commute to work - a mainstay for decades - could shift because of increased flexibility around remote work for employees, Cohn said.
""In the U.S., Canada and Mexico, if you look at peak travel patterns, the morning peak seems to have melted away,"" he said. ""We have never seen that before.""
Traffic congestion during rush hours last year decreased by 25% globally, said Stephanie Leonard, TomTom's head of traffic innovation and policy. 
As more people return to office following vaccine distributions, congestion levels could rise if commuters choose to avoid public transit and drive to office instead, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.

The decision follows moves by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to end a boycott in which they severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar in 2017.
The lifting of Egypt's aviation ban allowed Qatari flights to cross Egyptian airspace and national carriers from both countries to submit flight operating schedules for approval, state newspaper Al-Ahram reported. 
EgyptAir plans to run a daily flight to and from Doha, the aviation ministry said in a statement. An additional flight could be added if there was sufficient demand, it said.
EgyptAir's chairman told local TV that the carrier expected to resume flights to Qatar from Jan. 18. In addition to daily flights from Cairo, four flights a week would be operated from Alexandria to Doha, he said. 
Qatar Airways was expected to restart flights between Doha and Egypt on Friday, pending approval, sources at Cairo airport said.
Goods transport between the two countries will also become possible under agreements that are set to be activated, aviation sources said. 
Egypt and its Gulf allies imposed the embargo on Qatar over allegations it supports terrorism, allegations Doha denies.
Egypt expressed its support for regional reconciliation at a summit in Saudi Arabia last week but had stopped short of confirming concrete steps to end the boycott.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain have all announced the reopening of their airspace to Qatar.

In a letter seen by Reuters to internet service providers dated Jan. 12, Uganda's communications regulator ordered them to block all social media platforms and messaging apps until further notice.
Internet monitor NetBlocks said its data showed that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, Skype, Snapchat, Viber and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play Store were among a lengthy list of sites unavailable via Uganda's main cell network operators.
Campaigning ahead of the vote has been marred by brutal crackdowns on opposition rallies, which the authorities say break COVID-19 curbs on large gatherings. Rights groups say the restrictions are a pretext for muzzling the opposition.
At 38, Wine is half the age of President Yoweri Museveni and has attracted a large following among young people in a nation where 80% of the population are under 30, rattling the ruling National Resistance Movement party.
Wine is considered the frontrunner among 10 candidates challenging Museveni, the former guerrilla leader who seized power in 1986 and brought stability to a country after the murderous reigns of dictators Milton Obote and Idi Amin. 
While security forces have intimidated the opposition at previous elections, the run up to this year's vote has been especially violent. In November, 54 people were killed as soldiers and police quelled protests after Wine was detained.
On Tuesday, Wine said soldiers raided his home in Kampala and arrested his guards while he was giving an interview to a Kenyan radio station. He also said a team member who works mainly as a mechanic was shot dead by the military overnight.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the claims and a military spokesmen did not respond to a call seeking comment.
Patrick Onyango, police spokesman for the capital Kampala, denied Wine's home had been raided or that anyone was arrested, saying: ""We were just rearranging our security posture in the area near his home, specifically removing some checkpoints.""
'UNACCEPTABLE BREACHES'
A source in Uganda's telecom sector said the government had made clear to executives at telecoms companies that the social media ban was in retaliation for Facebook blocking some pro-government accounts.
Neither Ibrahim Bbossa, Uganda Communications Commission spokesman nor government spokesman Ofwono Opondo answered calls requesting comment. An aide to Minister of Information Judith Nabakooba said she was unable to comment at the moment.
The U.S. social media giant said on Monday it had taken down a network in Uganda linked to the country's ministry of information for using fake and duplicate accounts to post ahead of this week's election.
A Facebook spokeswoman said the company had no comment on reports users were facing difficulties accessing the platform.
""Any efforts to block online access to journalists or members of the public are unacceptable breaches of the right to information,"" the International Press Institute, a global media watchdog, said in a statement.
Wine has been using Facebook to relay live coverage of his campaigns and news conferences after he said many media outlets had declined to host him. Most radio and TV stations are owned by government allies and Uganda's leading daily is state-run. 
Museveni, 76, has won every election since the first under his presidency in 1996, though they have been tarnished by intimidation of the opposition and accusations of vote rigging.
Uganda is a Western ally, a prospective oil producer and is considered a stabilising force in a region where war has plagued some neighbours. It also contributes the biggest contingent of an African Union force fighting Islamist insurgents in Somalia.
Museveni said on Twitter that he would address the nation at 7 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Tuesday.
The European Union is not deploying election observers as advice from previous observers about how to make the polls fair went unheeded, the bloc's ambassador to Uganda has said. The African Union will deploy observers.

At a news conference on Tuesday, Wine and two other opposition candidates - Patrick Amuriat and Mugisha Muntu - urged Ugandans to turn out and ""protect their vote"" by staying at polling stations to observe counting.

(Reuters) - A swift resurgence of U.S. leadership under President-elect Joe Biden and wealthy nations fulfilling a promise of cash for poorer countries could galvanise action on climate change this year, the United Nations climate chief said on Tuesday.
In November in Glasgow, Scotland, the U.N. will stage its most important climate summit since the 2015 event that yielded the Paris Agreement, when nearly 200 countries committed to halt rising global temperatures quickly enough to avoid catastrophic change.
The November summit, which was delayed by a year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, serves as a deadline for countries to commit to make deeper emissions cuts to deliver the Paris treaty's aim.
""The U.S. played a very important role in getting the Paris Agreement together. So we certainly are hoping that we will see this kind of leadership coming back,"" Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told the Reuters Next conference.
With only 10 months until the summit, President-elect Joe Biden must reboot that leadership ""very fast"", Espinosa said. 
While President Donald Trump doubts mainstream climate science and pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement, Biden has pledged to re-join the accord on his first day in office and spend $2 trillion on clean energy. 
The U.N. will also be watching for a U.S. pledge to cut emissions faster this decade - a move major economies including China and Japan have yet to make.
Espinosa also called on wealthy countries to fulfil their promise, made in 2009, to deliver $100 billion each year by 2020 to help developing countries tackle climate change. They missed the goal by $21 billion in 2018, according to the latest tally.
""We're not there,"" said Espinosa. ""After the year where we had this COVID pandemic that prompted the richer economies to mobilise, in a matter of months, $12 trillion for COVID recovery. It just doesn't make sense."" 
Breaking that promise would give developing countries an excuse not to make climate pledges of their own, she said. That could spell trouble in a year when major emitters, including India, will face pressure to step up action.
""I see this as one of the most important elements in order to rebuild trust,"" she said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz on Tuesday denied any role in corruption or forgery linked to mining rights his company secured in Guinea, describing himself as the owner and company ambassador but not the boss.
Steinmetz was indicted in August 2019 by a Geneva prosecutor who accused him and two aides of paying, or having paid, $10 million in bribes to obtain exploration permits for some of the world's richest iron-ore deposits in the remote Simandou mountains of Guinea.
Steinmetz and his aides deny the charges. If convicted he could face up to 10 years in prison.
At his court appearance on Tuesday, Steinmetz, wearing a dark blue suit and tie, repeatedly referred to himself as a ""spokesman"" or ""ambassador"" for Beny Steinmetz Group Resources (BSGR).
Steinmetz, who made his name in diamond mining and trading, told the judges he only gave advice and had never presented himself as the boss or taken decisions on projects.
""My name was 10 on a scale of 10, seen like a white diamond,"" he said, speaking in French, when asked why the company carried his name if he was not running it.
BSGR said it could not comment on the proceedings.
Swiss prosecutors allege Steinmetz and his aides won the mining rights by bribing Mamadie Toure, who they say was one of the wives of the former Guinean President Lansana Conté, between 2006 and 2010, and that they forged documents to cover it up.
""I met Mamadie Toure, the woman or girl, once in my life for only five minutes. We have not spoken,"" Steinmetz said. His lawyer has said Toure was not married to Conte and could not be considered a public official. 
Toure, who has been summoned as a witness, lives in Florida after reaching a non-prosecution agreement with U.S. authorities, both Steinmetz's defence team and Geneva prosecutor Yves Bertossa told the court. U.S. courts have dealt with separate legal cases concerning the rights to mining in Simandou. 
Reuters has attempted to contact Toure through social media, but she could not immediately be reached for comment.
The size of the iron deposit at Simandou meant it had the potential to transform Guinea's economy but the legal wrangles, together with the difficulty and cost of access have ensured it has never been developed.
""It's really a tragedy. If the project had been carried out, it would have quadrupled the GDP of Guinea. Now 10 years later, there is nothing,"" Steinmetz told the court.
The 64-year-old, a former Geneva resident who moved back to Israel in 2016, has in the past been ranked as a billionaire and one of Israel's wealthiest men. Asked by the court to estimate his personal fortune, he said it was $50-80 million.
The trial, which opened on Monday, is expected to last two weeks.

VELIKA KLADUSA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Zeinaf Jabar, 11, learned some English while spending a year at a migrant camp in Greece and is now trying with her family, repeatedly, to cross into Croatia in what they call the 'Game', in search of a better life in western Europe.
""I stay here, don't go school,"" Zeinaf, a serene Iraqi girl with black plaited hair, told Reuters. ""I miss too much school. We just go Game and come back, go Game and come back"".
With her parents and two siblings, she has just been pushed back into Bosnia after yet another unsuccessful attempt, amid bleak, wintry conditions, to get into EU member Croatia on their way to wealthier western Europe.
Her family, which left Iraq three years ago, is among some 8,000 migrants from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa who remain stuck in Bosnia. Many live in tents in the woods or in houses and factories destroyed in the Bosnian war of the 1990s.
The Jabar family share a room in a deserted house near the border with another five-member family, from Afghanistan.
Zeinaf's father Husein Halaf Jabar, 52, said he was hit in the stomach by a Croatian police officer who he said also disrespectfully threw a copy of the Koran onto the ground.
""Look here, she's ill, he's ill, everyone's ill,"" Jabar said, pointing at his children. 
""What fault is it of ours with all these children, where are our human rights,"" he asked tearfully, showing bruises on his abdomen.
Migrants and humanitarian agencies have repeatedly accused Croatian police of using violence to push illegal migrants back over the border, accusations the police deny.
The International Organisation for Migration delivers daily food rations to the Jabbars and the Afghan family in their shared room, which they heat when there is enough firewood.
Hundreds of other migrants are scattered in the woods near the border town of Velika Kladusa in northwestern Bosnia, staying in nylon tents and cooking on improvised fires.
""We are very cold, and we are drinking canal water,"" said Sahid from Bangladesh. ""We are suffering very much.""

In a statement, the French Foreign Ministry urged Israeli authorities to drop the plan. Referring to Israel and the Palestinians, who seek a state in Israeli-occupied territory, it said: ""(We) call on the parties to avoid any unilateral measures that could jeopardise the two-state solution founded on international law and agreed parameters.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Monday that about 800 homes would be built in the settlements of Beit El and Givat Zeev, north of Jerusalem, and in Tal Menashe, Rehelim, Shavei Shomron, Barkan and Karnei Shomron in the northern West Bank. It gave no starting date for construction.
Palestinians have condemned such construction as illegal. The move appeared timed to set Israel’s blueprint in indelible ink before Joe Biden, who has been critical of its settlement policies, becomes U.S. president on Jan. 20.
The Trump administration has effectively endorsed Israel's right to build West Bank settlements by abandoning a long-held U.S. position that they break international law. Trump has also delighted Israeli leaders and angered Palestinians by recognising contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there.
Most countries view Israeli settlements as violating international law. Israel disputes this, citing historical, political and biblical links to the West Bank, where more than 440,000 Israeli settlers now live among 3 million Palestinians who have limited self-rule under Israeli occupation.

Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said had announced plans for the constitutional change on Monday, a year after the death of his predecessor, Sultan Qaboos. The new basic law was published on Tuesday in the official gazette.
Sultan Qaboos fathered no children and designated no successor publicly during his 49-year reign. 
Haitham's move to designate a crown prince could strengthen the predictability of Omani politics, following the final years of Sultan Qaboos' rule when secrecy about the succession raised concerns for stability.
Qaboos, who took power by overthrowing his father, named his cousin Haitham as his preferred successor in a sealed envelope to be opened after his death should the royal family disagree on the succession line. The family went with his choice.
Sultan Haitham has overhauled government and state entities and moved to enact long-awaited fiscal reform since taking power, appointing finance and foreign affairs ministers and a central bank chairman -- portfolios held by the late sultan. 
Dhi Yazan bin Haitham, 30, was named minister of culture, sport and youth in August in the shake-up to become Oman's youngest minister. He previously worked at the foreign ministry, according to Omani media.
The new basic law published in the Gazette stipulates maintaining a foreign policy based on friendly relations with all states. It also retains an elected advisory Shura Council, the lower house of parliament.
A separate decree on Monday had created a new law for the parliament - the bicameral Council of Oman. The published text says changes to conditions of membership and the council's terms of reference have been made, but the full decree has not yet been published. 

Oman has traditionally charted an independent foreign policy, not taking sides in a power struggle between Saudi Arabia and Iran, or in a Gulf dispute with Qatar.

That represents about 15% of all who entered the institutions, with no single explanation for such a high rate of mortality, the government-commissioned report published on Tuesday said. 

It also found that there were no statutory regulations in place for the foreign adoptions of 1,638 children - mostly to the United States. Allegations that large sums of money were given to agencies in Ireland that arranged foreign adoptions are impossible to prove and impossible to disprove, it added.

Rescue workers were unable to contact the trapped workers because the blast damaged their communication system, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
The blast occurred at 2 p.m. local time (0600 GMT) on Sunday at the Hushan mine in Qixia, under the administration of Yantai city in Shandong province. But it was not until 8 p.m. the next day - 30 hours later - that it was reported to Qixia's emergency department, Xinhua said.
Mining accidents are common in China, the world's biggest coal producer. On Monday, the National Mine Safety Administration said 573 deaths had been recorded in 2020.
Xinhua said the Hushan mine was owned by Shandong Wucailong Investment Co Ltd. That company is named by China's fourth-biggest gold miner, Zhaojin Mining, as a ""subsidiary of an associate"" in its 2019 annual report. 
Zhaojin did not answer calls seeking comment.
Xinhua described those responsible for the reporting delay as ""enemies of the people"".
The state broadcaster CCTV said late reporting of accidents was a ""taboo for safe production"" that could be tolerated.

DUBLIN/TUAM, Ireland (Reuters) - An Irish inquiry into alarming death rates among newborns at church-run homes for unwed mothers will hand down its final report on Tuesday, laying bare one of the Catholic Church's darkest chapters and leading to demands for state compensation.
The Church's reputation in Ireland has been shattered by a series of scandals over paedophile priests, abuse at workhouses, forced adoptions of babies and other painful issues.
Pope Francis begged forgiveness for the scandals during the first papal visit to the country in almost four decades in 2018.
The remains of 802 children, from newborns to three-year-olds, were buried between 1925 and 1961 in just one of the so-called Mother and Baby Homes, a 2017 interim report found.
Then-Prime Minister Enda Kenny described the burial site at Tuam, in the western county of Galway, as a ""chamber of horrors"".
The inquiry was launched six years ago after evidence of an unmarked mass graveyard at Tuam was uncovered by amateur local historian Catherine Corless, who said she had been haunted by childhood memories of skinny children from the home.
The 3,000-plus page report makes for difficult reading, Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said.
""This was an enormous societal failure and an enormous societal shame that we have a stolen generation of children who did not get the upbringing they should have,"" he told national broadcaster RTE on Monday.
Relatives have alleged the babies were mistreated because they were born to unmarried women who, like their children, were seen as a stain on Ireland's image as a devout Catholic nation.
Government records show that the mortality rate for children at the homes where tens of thousands of women, including rape victims, were sent to give birth, was often more than five times that of those born to married parents.
""My heart is breaking for every survivor,"" said Anna Corrigan, whose two brothers John and William Dolan are recorded as having died at the home for unmarried mothers in Tuam.
""We expect, as we have always expected, truth, justice, accountability resulting in prosecutions should they arise and restitution for survivors,"" she told Reuters on Tuesday ahead of the publication of the report. 
The Church ran many of Ireland's social services in the 20th century. While run by nuns, the homes received state funding and, as adoption agencies, were also regulated by the state.
While Irish voters have overwhelmingly approved abortion and gay marriage in referendums in recent years, the Mother and Baby Home scandal has revived anguish over how women and children were treated in the not-too-distant past.

The homes were the subject of the 2013 Oscar-nominated film Philomena, which charted the failed efforts of Philomena Lee to find the son she was forced to give up as an unwed teenager.

The decades-old dispute over al-Fashqa, land within Sudan's international boundaries that has long been settled by Ethiopian farmers, erupted into weeks of clashes between forces from both sides late last year.
""The Sudanese side seems to be pushing in so as to inflame the situation on the ground,"" Ethiopian foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti told reporters. ""Is Ethiopia going to start a war? Well, we are saying let's work on diplomacy.""
""How long will Ethiopia continue to resolve the issue using diplomacy? Well, there is nothing that has no limit. Everything has a limit,"" he told a briefing in Addis Ababa.
Sudan's information minister and government spokesman Feisal Mohamed Saleh said the country did not want war with Ethiopia but its forces would respond to any aggression.
""We fear that these comments contain a hostile position towards Sudan. We ask of Ethiopia to stop attacking Sudanese territory and Sudanese farmers,"" he told Reuters.
Sudan said on Dec. 31 that it had taken control of all of Sudanese territory in the area. Ethiopia says Sudan took advantage of its forces being distracted by the Tigray conflict to occupy Ethiopian land and loot properties.
The United Nations said in a report last week on the humanitarian situation in Tigray that there were reports of a military build-up on both sides of the border around the area.
The border tensions come at a time when Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt are also trying to resolve a three-way row over Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.
Ethiopia sees the dam as key to plans to become Africa's largest power exporter. Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile, fears the dam across the Blue Nile could devastate its economy.
Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan said on Sunday that they reached a new impasse in the dispute. Egypt and Ethiopia separately blamed Sudanese objections to the framework for the talks. 
On Tuesday, Ethiopia's Dina criticised both Egypt and Sudan for delaying the negotiations. ""Are the two speaking the same language? More or less. The two are speaking the same language when it comes to stalling it.""

Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Sabah must submit the resignations to the OPEC member state's ruler, Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah, for approval. Three main Kuwaiti newspapers earlier said Sheikh Sabah was expected to do so.
The resignation of the cabinet, formed on Dec. 14, had been expected after the move in parliament earlier this month that posed the first political challenge for the new emir as the country faces its worst economic crisis in decades.
The prime minister had been due to be questioned at a parliamentary session on Jan. 19. 
CGC said the government submitted its resignation ""in light of developments in the relationship between the National Assembly and the government"", but did not elaborate. 
The motion to question Sheikh Sabah, who has been premier since late 2019, was submitted by three MPs on Jan. 5 in the first regular session of a new assembly in which the opposition made gains after two thirds of lawmakers lost seats in legislative polls last year.
More than 30 other MPs supported the request to question him on issues including forming a cabinet ""not reflective"" of poll results and allegations of government ""interference"" in electing the Speaker and members of parliamentary committees, according to the motion seen by Reuters.
Kuwait has the most open political system in the Gulf region, with a parliament wielding power to pass legislation and question ministers, although senior posts are occupied by ruling family members.
Frequent rows and deadlocks between cabinet and parliament have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament, hampering investment and economic and fiscal reform.
The latest standoff complicates government efforts to tackle a severe liquidity crunch caused by low oil prices and COVID-19 by pushing through a debt law that has faced legislative gridlock.

The emir has final say in state matters and the succession of Sheikh Nawaf last September following the death of his brother had raised hopes of a detente between the ruling family and their critics in parliament.

Tunisia has come under strong pressure from European nations on opposite shores of the Mediterranean to stem the flow of migrants, especially after a deadly Islamist attack at a church in the French city of Nice by a Tunisian migrant last year.
The Tunisian Forum of Economic and Social Rights said that the number of illegal Tunisian migrants reaching Italy in 2019 was 2,654 in 2019, and 5,200 in 2018.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary has ignored complaints about its practice of escorting undocumented immigrants back across the border to Serbia without due process, a watchdog group said on Tuesday after it raised the alarm about the ongoing human rights violations.
Hungary's nationalist government has long taken a tough stance on migrants and asylum seekers entering the European Union, an issue that has contributed to a sharp souring of relations with some EU partners.
The European Court of Justice ruled in December that Hungary had broken EU laws on protecting migrants by denying them asylum and forcibly deporting them. Hungary is an EU member but Serbia is not.
Since then, police data show Hungary has ""escorted back"" 2,346 undocumented immigrants, while it detained and started proceedings against only 120 people - meaning its primary method remained swift expulsion.
The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a legal advocacy group, urged Hungary's police chief to end the practice and asked the EU's border guard agency Frontex to cease cooperation with Budapest.
""Neither the government nor Frontex replied to our letters,"" Helsinki lawyer Andras Lederer told Reuters.
A government spokesman said the EU ruling was ""devoid of purpose as the circumstances at issue in the present proceedings no longer exist. Transit zones have been closed. However, strict border control is maintained.""
Hungary closed the so-called transit zones last year. The zones had comprised shipping containers for lodging and were surrounded by heavily guarded barbed wire perimeters.
Asked about the push-back practice, the government spokesman declined to comment, but added: ""We will continue to protect the borders of Hungary and Europe, and will do everything we can to prevent the formation of international migrant corridors.""
EU AGENCY ""TURNED BLIND EYE""
Frontex is ""currently assessing the impact of the (EU court) ruling on our operational activities in Hungary,"" Frontex spokesman Chris Borowski told Reuters, without elaborating. 
The Helsinki Committee's request to Frontex to sever ties with Hungary was based on an earlier commitment by the agency to part ways with member states that breached human rights norms. 
In a separate report on the Frontex record in Hungary, the Helsinki Committee said ""the Agency turned a blind eye towards well-documented systemic human rights violations at Hungary’s Schengen borders for more than four years"".
Frontex did not immediately respond to questions seeking comment on that.

A government source said current Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne would take over from Bains. The source requested anonymity, given the sensitivity of the situation.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp and Global News both said Transport Minister Marc Garneau would replace Champagne.
Bains, 43, who has been in the job since Trudeau took power in late 2015, said he would not stand in the next election, which Liberal insiders say is likely this year.
He represents a parliamentary constituency in the Greater Toronto Area, a stronghold for Trudeau's ruling Liberal Party.

Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's leading critics, was airlifted to Germany for treatment in August after collapsing on a plane in what Germany and other Western nations say was an attempt to murder him with a Novichok nerve agent.
Russia's Federal Prison Service (FSIN) last month ordered him to immediately fly back from Germany, where he is convalescing, and report at a Moscow office or be jailed if he failed to return in time.
It accused him of flouting a suspended sentence he had been serving over a conviction dating from 2014, and of evading the supervision of Russia's criminal inspection authority. Navalny said the original conviction was politically-motivated.
On Tuesday, a court database showed authorities had requested that the suspended sentence be cancelled, raising the prospect of a custodial sentence instead. 
""Putin is so furious I survived his poisoning that he ordered the FSIN to go to court and demand that my suspended prison sentence be changed to a real one,"" Navalny tweeted. 
His spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh accused Russian authorities of trying to scare Navalny into not returning to Russia, something he has said he intends to do ahead of parliamentary elections due in September next year. 

Russia has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned and has denied trying to harm him. The Kremlin has said Navalny is free to return to Russia at any time like any other Russian citizen.

LEATHERHEAD, England (Reuters) - British authorities have had to set up a temporary morgues in some areas after local hospital mortuaries ran out of space due to a surge in deaths caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Britain has reported record levels of deaths and new infections in the last few weeks, fuelled by a new variant of the coronavirus which has caused a surge in cases, especially in London and southeast England.
In Surrey, to the south of London, the county's hospital mortuaries have reached their 600 capacity, meaning local authorities have had to start using a temporary morgue.
""To avoid patients who have sadly died being left on wards, or as we have seen overseas left in corridors ... when the mortuaries are reaching capacity, they contact the temporary mortuary to go and collect bodies,"" a spokesman for the Surrey Resilience Forum said.
There were about 170 bodies currently being kept at the Headley Court facility, a former Ministry of Defence site in Leatherhead, he said. 
The temporary mortuary, which has space for 845 bodies, was first set up in April during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Britain.
""Over a twelve-week period from April to June, they dealt with 700 bodies. In the last three weeks, we've dealt with 330,"" the spokesman said.
Similar facilities have been set up or are being set up in London and Kent, also in southeast England.
Britain has reported more than 80,000 deaths - the fifth highest death toll globally - and in excess of 3 million COVID cases. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday it was a perilous moment for the state-run National Health Service, and hospital chiefs have warned that they face being overwhelmed.

NATO members Ankara and Athens announced on Monday they had agreed to resume on Jan. 25 long-suspended exploratory talks over disputed offshore rights in the Mediterranean, which brought them close to conflict last year. 
Turkey angered Greece and the European Union last year when it deployed a seismic survey vessel to waters also claimed by Athens. The ship has returned to shore but the NATO members still disagree over continental shelves and rights to resources.
The new round of talks are set for Istanbul later this month. 
""We must stop the Mediterranean from being an area for competition and turn into waters that will serve our long-term interests,"" Erdogan told EU ambassadors in Ankara.
""We urge Greece to refrain from actions that will escalate tensions. I believe the exploratory talks with Greece that will start on Jan. 25 will herald a new era,"" he said.
Ankara and Athens held 60 rounds of talks from 2002 to 2016, but plans last year for a resumption foundered over the survey vessel and disagreements over topics to be covered. 
Last year, the EU threatened potential sanctions on Ankara over the dispute but has postponed any measures to March. Turkey has in recent weeks repeatedly called for better ties with the bloc.
Erdogan also said he would host EU Council President Charles Michel and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Turkey at the end of January, adding that he had offered to show von der Leyen the housing units built in northwest Syria's Idlib region for displaced people. 
He said the EU had offered to build a portion of the houses during clashes last year between Russia-backed Syrian government forces and Turkey, but that the bloc had not kept its promise.

Kamau Thugge, at the time the number two official at the finance ministry, and Susan Koech, an official at the tourism ministry, were among a number of officials charged in the case a year ago, including then-Finance Minister Henry Rotich.
""I have withdrawn charges against Thugge and Koech on instructions from Director of Public Prosecutions,"" said Alexander Muteti, a deputy assistant public prosecutor. ""The two former top government officials will now testify in the trial against the former finance minister and others charged.""
The case stemmed from an investigation into the misuse of funds in two dam projects planned in western Kenya, overseen by Italian construction company CMC Di Ravenna. Rotich, the other officials and the company have all denied wrongdoing.
Muteti said Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti had accepted his request to halt the case against Thugge and Koech. The case against Rotich and the other remaining officials charged will be back in court next month.

There have been a series of reports into allegations of abuse and mistreatment by priests and members of religious orders. Here are some details of their findings:
* FERNS REPORT INTO CLERICAL SEXUAL ABUSE, OCTOBER 2005
- The first official inquiry into the activities of abusive priests - in the diocese of Ferns in County Wexford - detailed the Church's handling of 100 allegations, including of rape, against 21 priests dating back to the mid-1960s. It found that for 20 years the bishop in charge of the rural diocese did not expel priests but simply transferred them to a different post.
* COMMISSION TO INQUIRE INTO CHILD ABUSE, MAY 2009
- The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse issued a five-volume report which found that priests abused children between the 1930s and the 1970s in Catholic-run institutions. It described orphanages and industrial schools in 20th century Ireland as places of fear, neglect and endemic sexual abuse.
Generations of priests, nuns and Christian Brothers - a Catholic religious order - beat, starved and, in some cases raped, children, the inquiry found. Some of the testimonies spoke of children scavenging for food from waste bins, being flogged, scalded and held under water.
* MURPHY REPORT INTO CLERICAL SEXUAL ABUSE, NOVEMBER 2009:
- The Murphy report investigated widespread child abuse by priests in the Dublin archdiocese between 1975 and 2004 that the Church ""obsessively"" concealed under a policy of ""don't ask, don't tell"" about abuse. The archdiocese was preoccupied with protecting the reputation of the Church over and above protecting children's welfare, the report said.
* CLOYNE REPORT INTO CLERICAL SEXUAL ABUSE, JULY 2011:
- The report into the handling of sex abuse claims in the County Cork diocese of Cloyne showed that senior clergy were still trying to cover up abuse allegations almost until the present day, a decade after it introduced rules to protect minors, and that the Vatican was complicit in the cover-up.
Then-Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny accused the Holy See of obstructing investigations into sexual abuse by priests. The Vatican responded by recalling its ambassador to Ireland.
* MAGDALENE LAUNDRIES REPORT, FEBRUARY 2013
- An official report compiled by an inter-departmental government committee into Ireland's notorious Magdalene Laundries found that 10,000 women and girls, some as young as nine, were put through an uncompromising regime of unpaid work from the foundation of the Irish state in 1922 until 1996.
The report found that many of the women - some of whom were subjected to the harsh discipline of the institutions for simply becoming pregnant outside wedlock - were sent there by the Irish state.
* MOTHER-AND-BABY HOME REPORT, JANUARY 2020
- Following the 2014 discovery of an unmarked grave with the remains of hundreds of babies on the grounds of a former so-called ""mother-and-baby home"", the Irish government ordered an investigation into the treatment of children at the church homes for unmarried mothers.
The report was expected to detail a level of infant mortality far higher than the average in the country at the time and accusations of physical and emotional abuse of women and children.

Over the past decades, Europe has sought to build independent access to space from U.S. and Russian pioneers to help its industry, with successes such as Ariane rockets or GPS-rival satnav Galileo.
""We must ask ourselves: will our current approach successfully get us to 2050, considering the disruptions in the sector that we all observe? I strongly doubt it, and I believe we need a more offensive and aggressive strategy,"" European Commissioner Thierry Breton, whose brief include the space sector, told a conference.
""I will therefore gather in the next months all the actors to initiate a European Launcher alliance to be able to jointly define...a common roadmap for the next generation of launchers and technologies relevant to ensure an autonomous access to space,"" Breton said.
Breton said the alliance would be made up of industry, EU governments, EU lawmakers and the European Space Agency, among others.
The recent emergence of U.S. competitor SpaceX and its reusable rockets as well as China's rapid advances, including the first ever landing on the far side of the Moon, is giving new urgency to Europe's ambitions.
After investing 12 billion euros in space activities between 2014 to 2020, the bloc aims to spend almost 15 billion euros for the 2021-2027 period, although the plans still need final approval by EU governments and the European Parliament.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 07:31AM ET</span>",Inside Israel’s social media campaign to woo the Middle East,"By Stephen Farrell, Maha El Dahan, Lisa Barrington and Zainah El-Haroun
(Reuters) - Working in close quarters, surrounded by maps of the Middle East, a small team based in Israel’s foreign ministry are focusing their sights on the Arab world.
Their mission: using social media to convince Arabs to embrace the Jewish state.
The team is spearheading an Arabic-language campaign via platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and Instagram as part of a multi-pronged diplomatic effort to win over popular acceptance in the Middle East.
But overturning decades of hostility is no easy feat, despite Israel in recent months having secured landmark Washington-brokered deals with the governments of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.
The magnitude of the task was underscored by a recent online backlash after photographs of Egyptian actor and rapper Mohamed Ramadan partying with Israeli celebrities at a Dubai bar surfaced on social media in November, along with a video showing guests partying as the Jewish song ""Hava Nagila"" played.
The Israeli Arabic-language social media team re-posted the photos from its main Facebook and Twitter accounts, including one of Ramadan hanging an arm around the neck of Israeli pop star Omer Adam with the caption ""art always brings us together.""
Israeli officials acknowledge the challenges of the task in a region where there is widespread support for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation or as refugees across the Middle East.
Yonatan Gonen, who heads the Arabic-language social media unit, said in an interview that they posted the photos of Ramadan with the Israeli celebrities to show “normalization” between Israelis and Arabs. He acknowledged that the furore was disappointing but said there were also positive responses and that “it takes time, people change their minds over generations.”
Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Israel’s prime minister, said increasing numbers of Arabs view Israel as an ally and many publicly show their support on social media. “As regional peace expands further, talking to our neighbours in their own language becomes even more important,” said Gendelman, adding that Israel plans to expand its outreach in Arabic.
Ramadan didn’t respond to requests for comment. He said on social media at the time that he did not ask people taking photographs where they came from. “I salute the brotherly Palestinian people,” he added.
Dr Ala’a Shehabi, a London-based academic researcher with dual Bahraini and British nationality, said public sentiment in Arab countries remains pro-Palestinian. Of Israel’s social-media campaign, she added: “It is not a success if it hasn’t changed popular opinion.”
DIGITAL DIPLOMACY
Israel wants to gain broader Arab support for the new deals than it has with formal peace treaties it signed with Egypt and Jordan, in 1979 and 1994, respectively. Those treaties are upheld by the countries’ leaders but are regarded with little enthusiasm by many Egyptians and Jordanians.
An October report by Israel’s Ministry of Strategic Affairs found that during August and September more than 90% of Arabic social media commentary regarding the “normalization” deals was negative.
“Israel must prepare to commence a protracted campaign online to win hearts and minds in favor of creating stronger ties with Israel,” according to a detailed summary of the report shared with Reuters by the ministry. A ministry official said that by January the level of negative commentary had fallen to 75%.
That foreign ministry’s ten-member Arabic-language team includes both Jews and Arabs.
With messages such as “Salam, Shalom” - the Arabic and Hebrew words for peace - the campaign heavily features what Gonen refers to as “soft content,” such as music, food and sport. The team also posts about Israel’s adversaries such as Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah.
Established in 2011, the Arabic-language unit has significantly ramped up activity since late summer when news of the first accord was made public. The team currently publishes up to 700 or so social media posts a month, about 15% to 20% more than before the deals, Gonen said.
During a recent visit to Dubai, team member Lorena Khateeb posted to Twitter a photo of herself outdoors with the Israeli flag draped over her back. ""Never imagined that I would raise the Israeli flag in an Arab country,"" she said in the Nov. 21 post in both Arabic and English. Days later, one Israel’s official accounts - called @IsraelintheGulf and which she operates - tweeted a similar flag-draped photo of her.
Khateeb told Reuters that responses to her posts are mostly positive but some are negative.
GAUGING SUCCESS
Gonen says the aim is to create “engagement, interactions and dialogue” with Arab audiences. He said his team reaches 100 million people monthly via its social media accounts, which is double what it was a year ago.
It’s main Twitter account, which uses the handle @IsraelArabic and posted the Ramadan photos, has more than 425,000 followers.
Still, the Jewish state still faces widespread opposition to its reconciliation efforts across the region, which is home to more than 400 million Arabic speakers.
Michael Robbins of the Arab Barometer, a non-partisan research network that studies attitudes across the Arab world, said a post-normalisation survey by his group in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Jordan and Lebanon suggested that the efforts of Israel and its regional allies “have had little if any effect on the views of ordinary citizens.”
He said they lacked data from Gulf countries, which did not permit them to ask questions that name Israel, but that attitudes in the countries they did conduct surveys had changed little from previous years.

“Overall, these results suggest that Israel’s strategy to win hearts and minds is failing. Few Arab citizens regardless of age or geography have positive views toward Israel,” Robbins said.

186,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 07:25AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why a state of emergency raises concerns in Malaysia,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to try to rein in coronavirus infections and suspended parliament in a move that helps Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin avoid an immediate challenge to his leadership.
The emergency also gives Muhyiddin and his cabinet extraordinary powers, such as introducing laws without the approval of parliament.
It was the first time in more than 50 years that a national emergency has been declared, and only the second time parliament has been suspended since independence from Britain in 1957.
Opposition parties said Muhyiddin was using the declaration to cling to power as he faces calls to step down and hold a general election. 
The emergency announcement came a day after Muhyiddin declared a nationwide travel ban and lockdowns in the capital and five states and could last until Aug. 1, or earlier, depending on whether infections have been brought under control.
Daily coronavirus cases hit a new record of 3,309 on Tuesday.
WHAT POWERS WOULD THE PM GAIN?
With parliament suspended, the prime minister and his cabinet gain powers to make laws and approve the expenditure necessary to ensure public security without a parliamentary vote.
The government can introduce temporary laws - called ordinances - that take effect over the course of the emergency. The king, who plays a largely ceremonial role, issues the ordinances on the advice of the prime minister and cabinet.
""The constitution is more or less suspended, as a substantial part of it can be overridden by emergency law,"" said Nik Ahmad Kamal Nik Mahmood, a legal expert at the International Islamic University of Malaysia.
In a televised address after the declaration, Muhyiddin said the king could issue several emergency ordinances to curb the spread of the pandemic, expand the powers of the military to help protect public health and also strengthen the police.
The government could also increase penalties for anyone who violates laws and regulations related to the pandemic, he said.
WHY THE CONCERN OVER EMERGENCY POWERS?
Constitutional provisions on lawmaking during an emergency are broad and leave a lot of room for the government to clamp down on anything from politics to personal and media freedoms, analysts said.
The opposition Pakatan Harapan said the emergency undermines checks and balances and inhibits democracy.
""Emergency powers mean granting absolute power to the prime minister to do nearly anything, at a whim,"" it said in a statement. 
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR MUHYIDDIN'S POLITICAL SURVIVAL?
Muhyiddin will serve as premier unopposed at least until Aug. 1. Elections then seem to be inevitable.
Muhyiddin became premier in March, since when he has grappled with a razor-thin parliamentary majority that relied heavily on support from the former ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).
Two UMNO lawmakers withdrew their support in recent days, which means Muhyiddin no longer commands majority support in parliament.
Some UMNO leaders have in recent months also repeatedly called for early elections, unhappy at playing second fiddle in the ruling coalition to Muhyiddin's smaller Bersatu party. 
Elections are only due in 2023 but Muhyiddin said he was committed to holding polls as soon as it was safe to do so.

Last year, Malaysia’s attorney-general filed an application to cite Malaysiakini and its editor-in-chief Steven Gan for contempt of court over five comments posted by readers on its website that it said undermined public confidence in the judiciary.
Malaysiakini and Gan, who could face a jail term as well as a fine, have maintained they could not be held responsible and the offending comments had been immediately removed after they were contacted by police.
The Federal Court is expected to return a verdict on Friday in the case, widely seen as a test for press freedom in the country.
Muhyiddin's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""We as journalists should not give up,"" Gan said, speaking at the Reuters Next conference, adding that a new generation of journalists was ""just as driven and just as determined to struggle to fight for press freedom for many years to come.""
He said in the two decades since he founded Malaysiakini, its journalists had been declared traitors, faced debilitating cyber-attacks, kicked out of press conferences, arrested, and raided by the police.
""Malaysia voted for a reformist government about two years ago but that did not last. I guess the old regime does not give up easily,"" he said.
An alliance of opposition parties won Malaysia’s general election in 2018, in a stunning defeat of the coalition that ruled the Southeast Asian country since independence from Britain six decades ago. 
Muhyiddin unexpectedly emerged as prime minister in March last year after forging an alliance with parties from the former ruling coalition to gain a parliamentary majority. The opposition have accused him of stealing power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box.
Malaysia has moved up the World Press Freedom index compiled by Reporters Without Borders in recent years. But rights groups have said freedom of speech and freedom of the press face renewed pressure under the new government.
Gan said despite the legal challenges, the situation facing journalists elsewhere in Southeast Asia was even worse.
""While you definitely face harassment from the government you don’t get to the point where journalists are being killed touch wood,"" he said. ""We are relatively better off.""

Users had complained earlier on Tuesday that they were unable to access Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp, social media platforms being widely used for campaigning ahead of Thursday's presidential election in the East African country.
""Uganda Communications Commission hereby directs you to immediately suspend any access and use, direct or otherwise, of all social media platforms and online messaging applications over your network until further notice,"" said the letter from the commission's executive director to internet providers.
The commission's spokesman Ibrahim Bbossa and government spokesman Ofwono Opondo did not answer calls requesting comment. An aide to Minister of Information Judith Nabakooba said she was unable to comment at the moment.
A source in Uganda's telecom sector said the government had made clear to executives at telecoms companies that the social media ban was in retaliation for Facebook blocking some pro-government accounts.

The U.S. social media giant said on Monday it had taken down a network in Uganda linked to the country's ministry of information for using fake and duplicate accounts to post ahead of this week's election.

189,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>","Special Report: Sheltering: Grandmother and grandson live under eviction, Covid threats","By Joshua Schneyer
WASHINGTON, D.C. (Reuters) - During the 10 months they've spent hunkered down in a military barracks turned housing project, the grandson has grown taller and the grandmother has gotten smaller.
Rochelle Woody has been the towering figure in her grandson's world since luck brought them together a decade ago when Omari Scott was 6. At age 71, Rochelle now leans over a cane after two recent spinal surgeries. Omari lifts barbells in the living room at night, and hears her praying in bed. She wants to keep a roof over their heads. Their landlord, the District of Columbia Housing Authority, has been seeking their eviction.
The pair can't imagine where they'd go. Rochelle tells Omari it's something he shouldn't worry about. She has faith in a higher authority.
""God's too good to me for that to happen,"" Rochelle says.
She's at risk for falls, so Omari doesn't leave home much. Plus, the virus is raging out there. It has already killed three in their family, cousins in New York, Georgia, Virginia.
Omari reached 6 feet tall before his 16th birthday last month. He thinks the growth spurt will help him when high school football starts up again. He's a wide receiver, reliant on speed. When he does go out, it's usually to sprint along the waterfront in their neighborhood, two miles due south of Capitol Hill.
He'll stop around Buzzard Point, endorphins pumping, and take in the view where the Potomac and Anacostia rivers meet. He phones his grandma at home. ""You OK?"" Sometimes he promises to cook pancakes for dinner.
They live two miles due south of Capitol Hill, the scene of last week's deadly insurrection by a mob intent on overturning the result of November's presidential election.
They've lived together since 2010, when a lonely Rochelle first discovered the grandson she never knew she had.
Last month, as the capital got its first winter flurries, Rochelle and Omari met a reporter at a safe distance outside their red brick building. Despite their age and height gaps, anyone could guess they're family. They have the same deep-set brown eyes, high-arched cheekbones and cautious smile.
""That's how I knew he was mine,"" says Rochelle, a grandmother of 10. ""All my grandbabies look like me.""
EVICTIONS STORM BREWS
Rochelle and Omari are just one example of a family struggling through a winter like no other in American memory.
The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has warned it could be ""the worst in the public health history of this nation.""
Vaccination campaigns could end the pandemic sometime this year, but millions of households are at risk of eviction before that, with infection rates at record highs and the economy in shambles.
This isn't the first time that Rochelle has had payment disputes with landlords, but the pair have never gone homeless.
Rochelle says she didn't receive the letter from the D.C. Superior Court ordering her to show up for an eviction hearing back in January 2020. Seen by Reuters, it was marked ""return to sender,"" showing she was not made aware of the court date. As a result, she missed the hearing, where a judge granted the Housing Authority permission to proceed.
United States Marshals were poised to execute the eviction back in April. Then the pandemic put Rochelle's case and others like it on hold. Since last spring, state and federal reprieves have allowed many renters in arrears to stay in their housing, even as thousands of new eviction cases pile up in courthouses. More than 208,000 have been filed so far in the 27 U.S. cities tracked by the Princeton University Eviction Lab.
Under Washington's current moratorium, tenants such as Rochelle could still face eviction by late May. That's a longer breathing spell than renters elsewhere can expect: A nationwide moratorium, enacted by the CDC in September, is set to expire at the end of this month. A new federal stimulus package offers U.S. renters at least some relief – a $600 check and up to $25 billion in rental and utility assistance funds to be distributed through states.
Advocates for low-income tenants are optimistic that more stimulus funds and extended moratoriums could be forthcoming once President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
Still, they warn of a potential tsunami of U.S. evictions this year. The nonprofit National Low Income Housing Coalition estimated that U.S. tenants were already $70 billion behind on rent in late 2020, and that up to 19 million Americans could face eviction in the coming months without further interventions.
In its latest Household Pulse Survey last month, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that 35% of U.S. adults lived in households where eviction or foreclosure was ""very likely"" or ""somewhat likely"" over the next two months.
Landlords, of course, have also been left reeling. A recent D.C. Superior Court ruling protects their right to access the courts, even with evictions on hold.
With the capital's shortage of affordable housing, thousands of households were already behind on rent when the pandemic hit. ""The moratoriums only delay the day of reckoning that they face,"" the December 16 ruling says.
Where evictions do proceed around the country, they could quickly fuel the virus' spread in low-income communities of color already at highest risk, according to a research article in the Journal of Urban Health last month.
Rochelle fears the virus, but says she's most worried about how an eviction could derail her grandson's progress. After childhood struggles in school punctuated by suspensions and an ADHD diagnosis, he's flourished in recent years, with better grades, triumphs on the football field and calls from college coaches to discuss potential scholarships.
Retired and disabled, Rochelle relies on a monthly $1,593 Social Security check. She and her lawyer say she made rent payments last year. A January 2020 court filing said her monthly rent was $519. It also showed she owed the Housing Authority $13,130 immediately to avoid eviction. The arrears, her lawyer says, carried over from her prior Housing Authority apartment. She says the landlord's maintenance lapses there caused a ceiling to collapse, detached cabinets and a rodent infestation.
A spokesman for the public housing landlord, Jose Sousa, said the agency can't comment on individual cases but ""always works with our families who may be in violation of their lease obligations"" to identify solutions other than eviction.
Before COVID, Rochelle made extra money by driving her compact Mitsubishi Mirage for a ride-share service, but she won't chauffeur strangers around now. ""I just don't want anyone in my car,"" she says.
The housing case against Rochelle is complicated. In essence, she's lived under the threat of eviction since 2015, when the payment dispute began over conditions in her prior apartment.
The Housing Authority eventually agreed to move her, she says, but not until she signed an agreement and payment plan for back rent. The terms meant she could face eviction if she ever missed a payment, even at her new address.
Rochelle has found a lawyer, Sebastien Monzon Rueda, who works pro-bono at nonprofit Legal Counsel for the Elderly on D.C. eviction cases.
The type of agreement Rochelle signed ""takes advantage of unrepresented tenants,"" says Monzon Rueda. Renters, especially older, disabled ones, should not be placed in jeopardy because of a dispute over a past apartment, he says. There has been no ruling yet on a motion he filed in November to seek dismissal of the eviction case.
DISCOVERING A GRANDSON
Rochelle, a self-described ""creature of Washington,"" never expected to end up in public housing, let alone facing homelessness. When she was growing up, she lived in the affluent Northwest quadrant of town, near Georgetown University.
She and Omari now live steps away from where, in the 1940s, the legendary soul singer Marvin Gaye spent his troubled childhood in a public tenement. Much has changed in southwest D.C. since then, but some things haven't. Its remaining public housing tenants are overwhelmingly Black and poor.
Their two-bedroom unit is cramped, its blinds falling apart and paint peeling along baseboards, but it has served them as a safe harbor. At times over the past year, the pair's hunkering down at home has been literal, like on the early December evening when they heard eight gunshots right outside.
The area is also home to a few of the country's most powerful tenants, hidden from view. Down the street are the blast-proof walls of Fort McNair Army Base, where U.S. military top brass live in stately historic homes.
Rochelle started working at age 14. When she was Omari's age, she passed the U.S. civil service test. She went on to get a bachelor's degree in education, a master's in criminal justice.
For the first 18 years of her career, she held government jobs, for the U.S. Navy, and the former U.S. Health, Education and Welfare Department, among other agencies. Stints in sales and as a paralegal followed, with occasional gigs as a clothing model.
Her love life was less successful. By the late 1980s, her three marriages had all ended badly. ""Marriage isn't for me,"" says Rochelle, who had her two sons with her second husband. ""But children are.""
She paused her career in 1994 when doctors found two brain aneurysms. Surgeries to remove them required her to learn how to walk and talk again, but the remarkable recovery stalled in 2010 when spinal pain made her retire from 9-to-5 work. Her savings dwindled, and she felt isolated.
Rochelle discovered Omari that same year. Her younger son, who had recently been incarcerated, was told by a friend that an ex-girlfriend had borne his son. The child, he was told, had ended up in foster care.
Rochelle and her son applied to go see Omari at a D.C. Boys and Girls club where he was playing Pee Wee football. The boy was skeptical when he first saw his relatives. ""I didn't think I had a dad,"" he told them.
As they drove away that day, Rochelle and her son cried about it. ""You think about what that does to a kid's self-esteem,"" she says.
A judge granted custody to Rochelle and her son, but problems soon arose. Her son had little patience with the hyperactive boy. ""You leave this child with me,"" she told him.
Omari didn't take to classroom learning. Rochelle had to teach him the basics, letters and counting, using rap songs as a mnemonic device.
Over the next years, Omari cycled through seven elementary schools, none of which met Rochelle's approval. Sometimes he'd be expelled for fighting. There were consultations with school psychologists, and he was sometimes placed in special education classes. Doctors prescribed him Adderall.
His acting out at school eventually subsided, and he stopped the meds years ago. ""It took time, but all he needed was to know he was loved,"" Rochelle says.
It's a mantra she says she follows with all the children who have come into her life. While she's contending with her own legal and medical issues, Rochelle has also begun coursework for a third degree, in child psychology. She wants to go into private practice. In the evenings she writes and is working on a book. Its working title: ""Help, My Child Is Broken.""
In one passage, she writes: ""I have been loved, lied to, rich, poor, happy and unhappy. I will always be rich in my heart!""
FOOTBALL DREAMS
At home since the spring, Omari has been doing virtual schooling. His favorite class is English, and he now reads voraciously. In a favorite novel, ""All American Boys,"" a teenage Black protagonist, Rashad, reels from a police beating whose aftermath has divided his high school. In the end, Rashad's injuries – sustained when he was falsely accused of shoplifting – forces his peers to grapple with racism. Omari read the book as millions joined Black Lives Matter demonstrations around the country last year.
During breaks, Omari helps with household chores. Some of Rochelle's other grandkids visit. He rarely mixes with people outside the family.
""I don't really have friends,"" he says.
Omari's high school football season has been lost to the pandemic too. Calls from college coaches have dried up. One did request a Zoom session to watch Omari drill, but Rochelle nixed that. ""What's this coach gonna see? The boy can't run in the apartment.""
Maybe next summer, they think.

""All I know is the strong survive,"" he says.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities have retrieved one of the black boxes from a Sriwijaya Air plane that crashed into the Java Sea at the weekend, a navy spokesman said on Tuesday.
The recording device was being transported to Jakarta's port, spokesman Fajar Tri Rohadi told Reuters. 
Local television footage had earlier showed a white plastic box holding the device aboard a speed boat.
It was not immediately clear if it was the plane's flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder that had been recovered.
Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi and other officials were due to hold a news conference later on Tuesday. 
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-500 plane with 62 people on board plunged into the Java Sea on Saturday, four minutes after taking off from Jakarta's main airport.
Earlier on Tuesday, more human remains were found at the crash site, as well as personal effects such as wallets containing identification cards.
The plane was headed on a domestic flight to Pontianak on Borneo island, about 740 km (460 miles) from Jakarta, before it disappeared from radar screens.
It was the second major air crash in Indonesia since 189 passengers and crew were killed in 2018 when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX also plunged into the Java Sea soon after taking off from Jakarta.
The jet that crashed on Saturday is a largely different design.
Once the flight data and cockpit voice recorders are recovered, Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) has said it expects to be able to read the information in three days.
With few immediate clues on what caused a catastrophic loss of control after take-off, investigators will rely heavily on the flight recorders to determine what went wrong.

The Sriwijaya Air plane was nearly 27 years old, much older than Boeing's problem-plagued 737 MAX model. Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the stall-prevention system implicated in the MAX safety crisis.

The agreement, expected to be signed by both countries' ministers in Athens this month, is part of Greece's plan to boost its defence capacity during an ongoing dispute with neighbouring Turkey on energy resources in the Mediterranean. 
For the purchase and maintenance of six new and 12 used Rafale jets, Greece will spend 1.5 billion euros this year, about 400 million euros annually in 2022-23, 67 million euros in 2024 and 34 million euros in 2025.
The debate in parliamentary committees will start on Tuesday with a vote planned by the end of the week. 
After a decade-long financial crisis that sapped almost a quarter of its national output, Greece was hoping for strong growth in 2020, but the coronavirus outbreak dashed its hopes. Greece projects 4.8 growth this year after an economic contraction of about 10% in 2020. 
Despite the hardship, the government has said it wants to invest in its armed forces, hire staff and acquire new frigates, helicopters and drones, and upgrade its F-16 fleet. 
Parliament will also vote on a bill extending the country's western territorial waters to 12 from six miles this month, the government has said. 
After a four-year hiatus, Greece and Turkey are expected to resume exploratory talks on the demarcation of maritime zones on Jan. 25.

Military judge Lieutenant Colonel Muwafaq al Masaeed told the court the men, in their early 20s, were involved in planning the attack in the ancient Roman city of Jerash in Nov. 2019 that wounded three Mexican tourists and one Swiss along with four local people, including a police officer.
The state security court found them guilty of ""committing terrorist acts"", sentencing the main defendant to death by hanging and handing a life prison sentence to one accomplice and a seven year jail term to another.
The convicted men had pleaded not guilty in Jan. 2020 at an earlier session of the security court, which is a form of military tribunal. Rights activists say Jordan’s military courts lack proper legal safeguards and say some confessions are extracted from detainees under duress.

Jordan had seen a surge in tourism before coronavirus hit global travel earlier last year and was considered by tour operators as one of the safest tourist destinations in the Middle East. Attacks on foreign tourists have been rare.

ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte faced a cabinet showdown on Tuesday with a small coalition partner that could bring down his government and unleash political chaos on Italy as it struggles to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.
Italia Viva, headed by former premier Matteo Renzi, has threatened to withdraw its two ministers in protest over various issues, including Conte's plans for spending billions of euros promised by the European Union to relaunch the battered economy.
The long-delayed cabinet meeting is scheduled to start at 9:30 p.m. (2030 GMT) and if Italia Viva pulls its support, Conte would no longer have a working majority in parliament.
Days of behind-the-scenes talks have failed to bridge the differences and the leaders of the main coalition parties warned of dire consequences if Renzi, anxious to give his fringe party new impetus, acted on his threat.
""I think it would be serious political error that would hurt Italy and that fellow Italians would not understand,"" Nicola Zingaretti, head of the Democratic Party (PD), told Sky Italia TV. ""I appeal for a return to common sense and to talks.""
One possible scenario if Italia Viva quits would be for all the coalition parties to renegotiate a new pact, which would almost certainly open the way for a major cabinet reshuffle, with or without Conte at the helm.
However, upping the pressure on Renzi, the head of the largest ruling party, the 5-Star Movement, rejected that idea.
""If Renzi is guilty of withdrawing his ministers, then there cannot be another government with him and Italia Viva. There is a limit to everything,"" Vito Crimi told ANSA news agency.
A source in Conte's office confirmed that the prime minister would not seek a new coalition deal with Renzi if his ministers quit the cabinet.
Zingaretti warned that events could quickly get out of control, possibly triggering early elections, which opinion polls say the opposition rightist bloc, headed by Matteo Salvini's euro-sceptic League, would win.
President Sergio Mattarella, who would have to pilot Italy through a political crisis, has said he wants both the cabinet and parliament to approve a project for utilising the EU Recovery Plan, before opening cross-party consultations.
If the coalition cannot agree on a way forward, Mattarella would almost certainly try to put together a government of national unity to deal with the health emergency, which has killed almost 80,000 Italians, and knock-on economic crisis.
If that failed, the only option would be a national vote.

""The initiation of uranium enrichment to up to 20% by Iran at the underground Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant ... is a very serious development and a matter of deep concern,"" the EU's 27 governments said in a statement released late on Monday.
""At this critical juncture, Iran's action also risks undermining efforts aimed at building upon the existing diplomatic process. We urge Iran to refrain from further escalation and reverse this course of action without delay.""
Iran started pressing ahead with plans to enrich uranium to 20% fissile strength at its underground Fordow nuclear plant last week, a level Tehran achieved before striking the deal with world powers to contain its disputed nuclear ambitions. 

The head of the global atomic watchdog told Reuters on Monday that world powers and Iran had weeks, not months to save the nuclear accord once U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.

HARSANY, Hungary (Reuters) - In a small village in eastern Hungary, more than 20,000 teddy bears are ""hibernating"" in a warehouse, waiting for the coronavirus pandemic to ease so they can bring joy to children in local nurseries.
Nicknamed ""Teddy Bear Mama"", Valeria Schmidt looks after her precious collection of bears, now packed up in plastic bags for their unusually long winter sleep as Hungary remains in partial lockdown due to a resurgence of the virus.
""I give away teddy bears to nurseries, pre-schools and poor families. I make exhibitions for (children's) institutions, a kind of therapeutic teddy bear corner with about 30-50 bears which the children can play with,"" Schmidt said. 
""Unfortunately, because of the virus situation, I cannot do these now.""
The 62-year-old Schmidt, who has four adult children, has been collecting teddy bears for 40 years and entered the Guinness Book of Records in 2019 for the world's largest collection of them.
Her passion for the bears stems from her childhood traumas. Schmidt's parents divorced when she was four, she grew up in very poor conditions and her mother drank heavily.
""Not only we did not have toys but we barely had clothes,"" she said. ""That is why I wanted a teddy bear so I could hug it and get some love from it.""
She hugs and strokes her teddies many times a day and she says they have cured her soul.
""Now these teddy bears make up for all the hunger, all the lack of love, lack of toys and everything. Especially when I see children coming to see my exhibition and I see the joy and happiness in their eyes.""

Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for relief from U.S. and other sanctions. The accord includes the option of a snapback of U.N. sanctions if Iran breaches the deal, requiring Tehran to suspend all nuclear enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, including research development.
""This (trigger) mechanism must be abandoned as an irrational principle in the event of further negotiations,"" Ali Akbar Velayati, a top adviser to Khamenei, said in an interview posted on the Supreme Leader's website.
""From the beginning, the Supreme Leader was not satisfied with the issue of the trigger mechanism and this was done against his will,"" said Velayati, a former foreign minister.
Iran has rejected Western calls for wider international talks over its nuclear and military ambitions after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.
World powers and Iran have weeks to revive the 2015 nuclear deal after Tehran began to enrich uranium at higher levels and Iran's parliament threatened to curb the access of U.N. inspectors next month, the head of the global atomic watchdog said on Monday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court ordered an indefinite stay on Tuesday over the implementation of new agricultural laws that have triggered widespread protest from farmers, saying it would set up a panel to hear their objections. 
For more than a month, tens of thousands of farmers have camped on the outskirts of New Delhi, the capital, to protest against reform measures that they say benefit large private buyers and harm growers. 
Chief Justice Sharad Bobde told a hearing the Supreme Court would establish a panel to hear the farmers' grievances. 
""We have the power to make a committee and the committee can give us the report,"" he said, ordering the stay for an undisclosed period on the laws passed in September. 
""We will protect farmers.""
There were no immediate further details.
India says the laws aim to modernise an antiquated farming system, bedevilled by wastage and bottlenecks in the supply chain.
But farm leaders demand repeal of the laws, which they say are an attempt to erode a longstanding mechanism that ensures farmers a minimum support price for their crops.

The government has said there was no question of such a rollback, and eight rounds of talks have failed to find common ground. The two sides are set to meet next on Friday.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnamese are trading fake weather reports and football scores on social media as a creative means to discuss Communist Party leadership wrangling after an official ban on speculation ahead of the Party's biggest and most important meeting in five years.
At its 13th National Congress, due to be held later this month, the Communist Party will formally select a new chief, national president, prime minister and National Assembly chair for the next five years.
The main candidates are all widely known in Hanoi's political circles, but were officially declared top secret in December to discourage potentially critical debate. The Communist Party of Vietnam retains tight control of media and tolerates little criticism. 
""Hot news about the Vietnam Super League!"" wrote Le Nguyen Huong Tra, a prominent Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) user. 
""Under Team Dong Anh's command ... the proposed senior leaders of the Football Federation for the upcoming 2021-2025 term will be as follows...,"" Tra said, presumably referring to Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, who comes from a district of Hanoi called Dong Anh, and his allies. Tra stopped short of listing names.
Trong has presided over an intensified crackdown on dissidents and activists in Vietnam since being re-elected by the Party in 2016.
The occupants of the ""Yellow House"", Tra added, could be Team Quang Nam, the home province of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who is looking to either retain his position or climb Party ranks. ""Yellow House"" refers the presidential palace, a colonial-era mansion in Hanoi, painted in bright yellow.
Vietnam's foreign ministry, which handles inquiries from foreign media, was unable to immediately confirm if such posts, if interpreted as such, would constitute a breach of official secrets.
Other posts designed to circumvent the ban have been based on weather forecasts. By predicting temperatures matching the last two numbers of vehicle registration plates from certain provinces, social media users have sought to indicate top officials from those provinces that they believe are on the rise.
In other posts, agricultural produce has been the vehicle of choice for political predictions.
""Ben Tre Coconuts will go home"", said Thuan Van Bui, an online honey salesman, in an apparent reference to the current National Assembly chair, who is from Ben Tre - a Mekong Delta province famous for its coconuts.
Bui signed off his post with a reference to honey, the word for which in Vietnamese sounds the same as the word for 'secret'.
""This information may be considered 'Top Secret', but my honey is 'Top Tasty',"" he wrote.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told a meeting of ruling party executives on Tuesday he would declare a state of emergency for the three western prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo to stem the spread of COVID-19, Kyodo news reported.
Responding to pressure from Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures in eastern Japan, Suga last week declared a one-month state of emergency for that region until Feb. 7.
But the number of coronavirus cases has also climbed in the west, prompting Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo to seek a state of emergency too. The government is finalising plans to do so on Wednesday, and could also consider adding the central prefectures of Aichi - home to  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp - and Gifu, Kyodo reported, citing government sources.
Adding those five prefectures would mean a state of emergency for about half of Japan's population of 126 million people.
Japan's top government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, did not confirm the report, saying only that the government would consider the measures for a ""swift response"" for the Osaka area.
Under Japanese law, the prime minister can declare a state of emergency, which gives local authorities the legal basis to ask residents and businesses to restrict movements and work.
Suga has been criticised for what many have called a slow, confusing and piecemeal response to the pandemic as infections hover near record highs.
About 79% of respondents in a Kyodo survey published on Sunday said his decision to declare the emergency for Tokyo came too late.
Daily virus cases hit a record 7,882 last Friday, for a tally of nearly 300,000, public broadcaster NHK said.
In a bid to help the struggling services sector, the government had offered generous subsidies to encourage citizens to travel domestically and dine out, only to pause the effort late last year as virus cases soared.
Now, it is asking residents of the Tokyo area to stay indoors as much as possible and urging bars and restaurants to close by 8 p.m.
""Please refrain from going out, not only at night, but also during the day,"" Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Twitter, adding that daytime outings over the three-day weekend had not fallen, despite the emergency.
Like many nations, Japan is struggling to balance efforts to restrain the virus against damage to its economy, which is the world's third-largest. 
With inbound tourism on hold, the hotel industry has borne the brunt of the pain. Last year, 118 hotels went under, a 1.5-fold rise from 2019 that accounted for about 47% of total bankruptcies, a Tokyo Shoko Research survey showed.
Finance Minister Taro Aso said the government would offer one-off payouts of up to 400,000 yen ($3,835) to businesses supporting restaurants and bars that shorten hours, such as suppliers of disposable chopsticks and wet towels.
Maximum compensation for the restaurants themselves will rise by 50%, Suga has said.
The latest emergency measures would not require already-compiled state budgets to be reshaped, Aso said.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 11:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: China plans further Hong Kong crackdown after mass arrest - sources,"By James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The arrest of more than 50 democrats in Hong Kong last week intensifies a drive by Beijing to stifle any return of a populist challenge to Chinese rule and more measures are likely, according to two individuals with direct knowledge of China's plans.
While stressing that plans haven't been finalised, the individuals said it was possible that Hong Kong elections - already postponed until September on coronavirus grounds - could face reforms that one person said were aimed at reducing the influence of democrats. 
Both individuals, who have extensive high-level experience in Hong Kong affairs and represent Beijing's interests, spoke on condition of anonymity.
Beijing's involvement was ""substantial"" in driving and coordinating actions with the Hong Kong government, said one of the individuals, a senior Chinese official. 
He told Reuters the latest arrests were part of a wave of ongoing actions to silence activists and to ""make sure Hong Kong doesn't slide back to what we saw 18 months ago,"" when massive demonstrations marked the boldest public revolt against China's leaders since the Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing in 1989. 
China has been ""too patient for too long, and needs to sort things out once and for all,"" he added, saying more tough moves would be rolled out for ""at least a year"". 
A spokesman for Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the implementation of a national security law last June had restored stability and reduced street violence.
""The legitimate rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong have been upheld and criminals are brought to justice through our independent judiciary,"" he said in an emailed response to Reuters, without responding to questions about Beijing's role.
Hong Kong elections were scheduled for Sept 5 and officials were working to ensure an open, fair and honest poll, he added.
The Chinese government did not respond to requests for comment. 
ELECTORAL REFORM?
The Chinese official said Beijing remained concerned the opposition could still muster a majority in the legislature should the polls go ahead, given a lingering groundswell of public support.
    Chinese officials were now discussing ways to change the electoral system to address ""deficiencies"" in the political structure, he said, and elections might be further delayed. 
The second pro-Beijing source confirmed there were advanced talks on structural changes to Hong Kong's political system, including possibly curtailing the influence of democrats on a 1,200-person election committee to select Hong Kong's next leader in 2022.
""It will likely shake up the whole political base,"" the source said of the reforms. 
Lam's spokesman said authorities were exploring using electronic polling and setting up polling and counting stations in mainland China to allow registered electors there to vote.
DEMOCRATS WORRIED 
Any changes to electoral laws to further isolate the opposition would now be procedurally guaranteed with the legislature now controlled by pro-Beijing politicians following a mass resignation of democrats from the legislature last November. 
Since the new security law was introduced, authorities have arrested 93 opposition figures under the legislation, frozen activists' assets, confiscated phones, computers and travel documents, disqualified some lawmakers and targeted media. Hundreds have fled into exile.
Six senior democratic figures interviewed by Reuters voiced fears over what they described as a grim outlook since the most recent arrests. 
Among the next steps authorities could focus on, they said, are disqualifying hundreds of democratic ""district councillors"" who dominate the grassroots political arena; entrenching loyalty to China within the civil service; squeezing businesses whose bosses explicitly support the democratic cause; and creeping censorship of the internet and media under the auspices of national security.
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the security law will only target a small minority of ""troublemakers"".
Beijing denies curbing rights and freedoms in the global financial hub and has opposed criticism of the arrests as ""grave interference in China's sovereignty and domestic affairs."" 
Hong Kong, a cosmopolitan metropolis of 7.6 million known for its freewheeling spirit, has seen many of those who challenged China's authoritarian grip targeted under the sweeping security law.
""Hong Kong has entered a harsh winter,"" said Benny Tai, a former law professor who has been a key strategist for the camp, following his arrest. ""The wind is blowing fierce and cold.""
When the city reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, China's leaders promised, in a mini-constitution, to grant the city a high degree of autonomy and wide-ranging freedoms not allowed in mainland China including free speech, assembly and eventual full democracy. 
    Yam Kai-bong, a Tai Po district councillor with the localist pro-democracy 'Neo Democrats', said the spectre of protracted legal proceedings related to the arrests could scare off, or weaken the opposition camp's chances in any upcoming election. 
    ""It's very clear that the authorities, this time, want to cast one net to capture all those who may have been planning to contest the upcoming elections - if they even take place - and to make it very difficult for them to run.""

A photo of Netanyahu sitting next to Trump at a White House meeting had long taken pride of place on the official @netanyahu account, testimony to the conservative Israeli leader's close ties with the Republican president and his popularity in Israel.
Early on Tuesday, another photo, showing Netanyahu being injected with the coronavirus vaccine, topped the page, along with the slogan for Israel's inoculation campaign: ""Citizens of Israel, we are returning to life"".
Netanyahu had kept the photo of his meeting with Trump, long in lockstep with him over a tough policy towards Iran and the Palestinians, on the site even after the Republican president's defeat by Democrat Joe Biden in the U.S. election in November.
The photo was briefly replaced with a Hanukkah holiday-themed image last month, raising media speculation that Netanyahu had decided to distance himself from Trump. 
But when the eight-day Jewish festival was over, Trump reappeared - although no longer alone with Netanyahu in a photo.
Instead, Netanyahu posted a banner image of himself with the president and the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signing an agreement at the White House in September on formalising ties with Israel.
No explanation was given on Netanyahu's site for Trump's disappearance, a day before the U.S. House of Representatives was expected to begin considering his second impeachment on after last week's storming of the Capitol.
Trump's own account was permanently suspended by Twitter on Friday due to what the social media giant described as the risk of further incitement to violence.

In televised remarks on Thursday, Netanyahu called the events at the Capitol a ""rampage"" and said he was certain American democracy would prevail.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the change on Saturday, which scraps curbs on meetings with Taiwan officials, in the waning days of the Republican Trump administration before Democrat Joe Biden assumes the presidency on Jan. 20.
China condemned the move, saying nobody could prevent China's ""reunification"". Beijing views the democratic island as its own territory, with no right to state-to-state ties.
The U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, Pete Hoekstra, said on Twitter that Taiwan's representative to the country, Chen Hsing-hsing, had met with him at the embassy on Monday. 
""Made some history today: Welcomed Taiwan Representative Chen to our Embassy,"" he wrote, including pictures of the two of them in the embassy building. 
""Glad that our @StateDept colleagues around the world will now be able to host our friends from this vibrant democracy on our Embassy grounds.""
Chen tweeted she was extremely pleased and honoured to visit the embassy, saying it was ""the very first time in my diplomatic career"".
The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, and previous interactions between officials from both sides were limited to non-official venues such as hotels.
China has been angered by stepped-up U.S. support for Taiwan under the Trump administration, including arms sales and visits to Taipei by senior U.S. officials.
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, is due to arrive in Taiwan on Wednesday for a three-day visit, which has also angered Beijing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to use newly declassified U.S. intelligence on Tuesday to publicly accuse Iran of ties to al Qaeda, two people familiar with the matter said, as part of his last-minute offensive against Tehran before handing over to the incoming Biden administration.
With just eight days left in office for President Donald Trump, Pompeo is expected to offer details on allegations that Iran has given safe haven to al Qaeda leaders and support for the group, the sources said, despite some skepticism within the intelligence community and Congress.
It was not immediately clear how much Pompeo intends to reveal in his speech to the National Press Club in Washington on Tuesday. He could cite declassified information on the killing of al Qaeda's suspected second-in-command in Tehran in August, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The New York Times reported in November that Abu Muhammad al-Masri, accused of helping to mastermind the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, was gunned down by Israeli operatives in Iran. Iran denied the report, saying there were no al Qaeda ""terrorists"" on its soil.
Iran has been a target throughout the Trump administration and Pompeo has sought to further ratchet up pressure on Iran in recent weeks with more sanctions and heated rhetoric.
Advisers to President-elect Joe Biden believe the Trump administration is trying to make it harder for him to re-engage with Iran and seek to rejoin an international deal on Iran's nuclear program.
MORE SANCTIONS
Pompeo has accused Iran of links to al Qaeda in the past but has not provided concrete evidence.
""There have been times the Iranians have worked alongside al Qaeda,"" then CIA director Pompeo said in October 2017. 
Earlier accusations by the George W. Bush administration of Iranian links to al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States have been discredited. But reports have surfaced over the years of al Qaeda operatives hiding out in Iran.
A former senior U.S. intelligence official with direct knowledge of the issue said the Iranians were never friendly with al Qaeda before or after the Sept. 11 attacks and any claims of current cooperation should be viewed warily.
Shi'ite Iran and al Qaeda, a Sunni Muslim militant organization, have long been sectarian foes.
Relations between Tehran and Washington have deteriorated since 2018 when Trump abandoned Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, which imposed strict curbs on its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions. 
Since the beginning of his administration, Trump has imposed sanctions on Iranian officials, politicians and companies in an effort to force Tehran to negotiate a broader deal that further limits its nuclear work.
And more sanctions are expected before Trump leaves office, U.S. officials say.
While sanctions have sharply lowered Tehran's oil exports and increased the economic hardship of ordinary Iranians, it has failed to bring Iran back to the negotiating table.
Biden has said the United States will rejoin the nuclear deal ""if Iran resumes strict compliance.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday laid out plans to restructure the country's freedom of information institute, along with other autonomous watchdogs and regulators, a move critics say would weaken checks on government power.
Lopez Obrador has long criticized government watchdogs and regulators as a waste of budget better used for education and welfare. The government itself could handle public information requests without the need for a separate institution, he said on Monday.
""Why have a very expensive transparency apparatus if the government is (already) obliged to report and make everything it does transparent?"" Lopez Obrador said at his regular news conference, adding that the freedom of information institute known as INAI costs about $50 million a year.
""Transparency is a golden rule of democracy,"" he said, citing laws that oblige the government to make information available to the public. ""We've got nothing to hide.""
The government was drawing up a formal proposal regarding INAI, Lopez Obrador said, part of a wider administrative reform bill he wants to present to Congress by February.
It was not clear if INAI would be absorbed by government offices, or if it would be restructured. 
Lopez Obrador said his goal was to avoid duplication of work by different agencies. On Friday, he targeted the telecoms regulator and said it could be merged with the communications ministry.
Critics, however, see the planned reform as an attempt to consolidate power, removing checks and balances and leaving the government to police itself.
""You become a player and a referee on the same field if you absorb those functions,"" said Ernesto Piedras, head of Latin American market consultancy The CIU. ""It would be centralizing too much.""
Article 19, a freedom of expression observatory, said eliminating the groups would be ""a serious setback in human rights.""

209,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 05:25PM ET</span>",Trump returns Cuba to U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism,"By Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday announced it was returning Cuba to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that could complicate any efforts by the incoming Biden administration to revive Obama-era detente with Havana.
Just nine days before Republican President Donald Trump leaves office, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Cuba was being listed for ""repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism"" by harboring U.S. fugitives and Colombian rebel leaders.
Pompeo also cited Communist-ruled Cuba's security support for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, which he said had allowed the socialist leader to maintain his grip on power and create ""a permissive environment for international terrorists to live and thrive within Venezuela.""
""With this action, we will once again hold Cuba’s government accountable and send a clear message: the Castro regime must end its support for international terrorism and subversion of U.S. justice,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
Returning Cuba to the list is a further rollback of the detente that Democratic former President Barack Obama orchestrated between the old Cold War foes. Obama's decision to formally remove Cuba from the terrorism list in 2015 was an important step toward restoring diplomatic ties that year.
The terrorism list decision followed months of legal review, with some administration experts questioning whether it was justified, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It would require further lengthy legal deliberations for Democratic President-elect Joe Biden to reverse the designation.
Trump has clamped down on Cuba since coming to power in 2017, tightening restrictions on U.S. travel and remittances to Cuba, and imposing sanctions on shipments of Venezuelan oil to the island.
Trump's policy was popular among the large Cuban-American population in South Florida, helping him win the state in November though he lost the election to Biden, who was Obama's vice president.
Biden said during the election campaign he would promptly reverse Trump policies on Cuba that “have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights.”
But Trump's move could make it more difficult for Biden to resume rapprochement when he takes office. Syria, Iran and North Korea are other countries on the list.
""We condemn the US announced hypocritical and cynical designation of #Cuba as a State sponsoring terrorism,"" Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said on Twitter. ""The US political opportunism is recognized by those who are honestly concerned about the scourge of terrorism and its victims.""
Trump has kept up a steady stream of 11th-hour sanctions announcements and other actions against targets including Cuba, Venezuela and Iran, and Biden aides have said some appear designed to tie his hands when he is sworn in on Jan. 20.
""We’ve taken note of these last-minute maneuvers,"" a Biden official said. ""The transition team is reviewing each one.""
Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, a staunch supporter of Obama's rapprochement, condemned Pompeo for a ""blatantly politicized designation,"" saying ""domestic terrorism in the United States poses a far greater threat to Americans.""
A re-listing of Cuba has heavy symbolic meaning for Havana, which had chafed for decades under the U.S. designation, though it is unclear how much practical impact there will be.
The designation carries a prohibition on U.S. economic aid, a ban on U.S. arms exports, controls on ""dual-use"" items with military and civilian applications, and a requirement that the United States oppose loans to Cuba by institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
But many of those restrictions are already in place - or have even been tightened by Trump - and a decades-old U.S. economic embargo remains and can only be lifted by Congress.
In Monday's announcement, Pompeo singled out, among others, the case of the most prominent U.S. fugitive in Cuba: Joanne Chesimard, who fled there after escaping a New Jersey prison following her conviction for killing a New Jersey State trooper in 1973 and who changed her name to Assata Shakur.
Pompeo also condemned Cuba's refusal of Colombia's request to extradite leaders of the ELN rebel group after it claimed responsibility for an attack at a Bogota police academy in January 2019 that killed 22 people.
The leaders of the National Liberation Army (ELN), the largest active guerrilla group in Colombia, traveled to Havana as part of peace negotiations that collapsed after the attack.

Cuba has received plaudits in the past for hosting the successful peace talks between the Colombian government and the former FARC rebel army.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will make a statement on Tuesday in the House of Commons on the government's response to allegations of forced labour in China's Xinjiang province, home to about 12 million Uighur Muslims, the report https:// added. 
Among the measures expected to be unveiled by the government include expansion of the Modern Slavery Act, reacting to concerns that items manufactured under duress by the Uighur Muslim minority may be entering the UK, the Telegraph reported. 
Britain said last year there was credible, growing and troubling evidence of forced labour among Uighur Muslims.
China has come under scrutiny over its treatment of Uighur Muslims and allegations of forced-labour abuses in Xinjiang, where the United Nations cites credible reports that 1 million Muslims held in camps have been put to work.
Beijing has repeatedly denied mistreating Uighurs and says the camps are vocational training centres that are needed to tackle extremism, accusing what it calls anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy. 
According to the Telegraph report, the government is considering imposing heavier fines on companies that breach the terms of the legislation, along with new due diligence criteria that oblige firms to ensure that no one in their supply chain has been part of a forced-labour transfer scheme. 
Among other measures, British ministers are looking to impose tougher export controls on goods and technology to China that could be used for repression, the report added.

GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - A line of Congolese park rangers raised their guns in salute on Monday as the coffin bearing their colleague Burhani Abdou Surumwe, a 30-year-old father of four, was buried in the black volcanic soil of a Muslim cemetery outside Goma.
Abdou was one of six rangers killed on Sunday in an ambush in Democratic Republic of Congo’s Virunga National Park, a sanctuary for endangered mountain gorillas that is also home to dozens of armed groups.
The rangers, heavily armed and well-trained, are frequently attacked. In April, a dozen of their number from the Congo Institute for Nature Conservation (ICCN) were killed by suspected Hutu militiamen. 
Park director Emmanuel de Merode, who was himself shot and injured in 2014, said his team were unbowed, despite the dangers.
""We are facing a situation that is extremely difficult, but which in no way erodes the conviction of all ICCN staff to continue our efforts.""
Abdou Surumwe's older brother Maliki, his eyes wet with tears, said he had been ""a good advisor, a hard worker, someone who loved to live with people"".
The United Nations says more than a hundred armed groups operate in eastern Congo, many of them remnants of groups that fought in civil wars around the turn of the century that resulted in millions of deaths from conflict, hunger and disease.
Virunga sits on the forest-covered volcanoes of central Africa and is home to over half the global population of mountain gorillas.

It is Africa’s oldest national park and largest tropical rainforest reserve, covering 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles).

CARACAS (Reuters) - Women's activists in Venezuela have largely halted unofficial abortion services after the arrest of a university professor who helped a 13-year-old girl to end a pregnancy, according to 10 women's rights advocates interviewed by Reuters.
Police in October raided the home of Vannesa Rosales in the northwestern state of Merida and arrested her. Her lawyer says she will likely be charged with inducing an abortion and conspiring to commit a crime for her role in helping the girl terminate a pregnancy after being raped.
Rosales was held behind bars for more than three months without being formally charged, but was released from prison on Monday and is now under house arrest, according to her lawyer, Venus Faddull. Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab tweeted Sunday night that a man had been indicted for raping the teenager.
Venezuela has one of the strictest abortion laws in South America, allowing the practice only to save the mother's life - but a number of individuals, organizations and informal networks around the country nevertheless counsel women on terminations.
In addition to providing emotional and physical support, they may connect the women with doctors or with people who sell abortion-inducing drugs such as misoprostol, or even sometimes provide the drug themselves.
The penalty for terminating a pregnancy ranges from six months to two years for the woman and from one to three years for the practitioner.
Local media in the past few years have reported a handful of cases of women being imprisoned for terminations, but the issue has not been at the center of Venezuela's women's rights movement. 
""I don't remember in the last 10 years an activist like Vannesa being arrested,"" Faddull said.
Venezuela does not publish statistics about abortion or the availability of contraceptives, but activists say more women have sought abortion services since the start of an ongoing economic crisis.
Contraception has for years been unaffordable for most women or simply unavailable, and many cannot afford the cost of bringing up a child, the groups say. 
Last month, Argentina became the third Latin American country to permit elective abortions when its parliament passed a bill allowing terminations in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy.

Venezuela's information ministry and prosecutor's office did not respond to requests for comment.

Vice President Delcy Rodriguez told a news conference that the manoeuvres were an attempt by the outgoing Trump administration to ""create provocations, threats.""
The Pentagon did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The World Court in December ruled that it has jurisdiction to hear a dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over the course of their land border, which may ultimately determine which has rights to certain offshore oil and gas fields.
Venezuela does not recognize the court's authority, and insists on a bilateral negotiated solution.
Offshore oil discoveries in recent years have given Guyana, which has no history of oil production, the potential to become one of the largest producers in Latin America.

The U.S. oil company  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) is in a consortium with  Hess Corp  (NYSE:HES) and CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) Ltd of China that produces crude in Guyana's offshore Stabroek block, part of which is located in waters claimed by Venezuela.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 03:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Pentagon presses ahead with Afghanistan troop drawdown despite law barring it,"By Jonathan Landay and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military has not halted a U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Department of Defense told Reuters on Monday, despite a new law prohibiting further reductions without the Pentagon sending Congress an assessment of the risks. 
""Currently, no new orders have been issued which impact the progression of the conditions-based drawdown expected to reach 2,500 (troops) by Jan. 15, 2021,"" it said in a statement.
The Pentagon's action will likely anger Republican and Democratic lawmakers opposed to further troop cuts and renew concerns about the outgoing Trump administration's disdain for Congress, even in its waning days. 
""If they are continuing the drawdown, that would be a violation of the law,"" said a congressional aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The White House declined to comment. 
Halting the drawdown could jeopardize the U.S.-backed Afghanistan peace process as a February 2019 agreement with the Taliban calls for a complete U.S. troop withdrawal by May in return for the insurgents fulfilling security guarantees.
In November, the Pentagon said it would reduce the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January. 
But this month Congress enacted a defense policy bill - overriding a veto by President Donald Trump - that bars using funds appropriated for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 to pay for a drawdown below 4,000 U.S. troops until acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller submits to Congress a ""comprehensive, interagency assessment of the risks and impacts.""
It is unclear how many troops have been moved out of Afghanistan since the law passed. 
One defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. troop level already is close to 3,000.
The legislation also requires a risk assessment before the number of U.S. troops can be reduced below 2,000.
The Pentagon said it was ""evaluating"" the impact the legislation would have on U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan. 
The legislation gave Trump emergency waiver power to continue the drawdown. But it said that he must tell Congress why a waiver is ""important"" to the national interest and provide a detailed explanation as to why. 
The congressional aide said the White House has provided no such waiver communication.
Some U.S. military officials urged Trump not to cut the force amid a surge in violence in Afghanistan and what they said was the Taliban's failure to end cooperation with al Qaeda as required by the February 2020 agreement with the insurgents. 
Another U.S. official said the drawdown was already under way when the law went into effect, and it was not something that could be changed ""at a drop of a hat.""
The official did not rule out the law slowing down the withdrawal before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20, when he is succeeded by Democrat Joe Biden, the winner of the Nov. 3 presidential election.

In Mexico, a majority Roman Catholic nation, elective abortion is allowed only in the capital and the state of Oaxaca, but a growing pro-choice movement has been calling for a loosening of restrictions.
At the end of November, support for abortion stood at 48% in a survey, published by the news organizations El Financiero and Nación321 - a steep rise from the 29% recorded in March. 
The poll, based on telephone interviews with 410 participants, asked if respondents agreed that ""the law should permit a woman the right to abortion.""
Although Latin America has some of the world's most restrictive abortion laws, Argentina legalized the procedure last month.
The move was a triumph for the women's rights movement in a region where the Catholic Church has held cultural and political sway for centuries.
Several nations in Latin American ban abortion outright, including El Salvador, which has sentenced some women to up to 40 years in prison. 
Until recently, only Communist Cuba and tiny Uruguay permitted elective abortions.

In most of Mexico, abortion is banned except under certain circumstances, such as rape. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has declined to take a position, saying wider legalization should be a matter for public consultation.

KABUL/HERAT (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani on Monday expressed grief over the deaths of civilians in an airstrike by the country's military, a move that came a day after government officials said only Taliban fighters had been killed. 
Locals in the southern province of Nimroz on Sunday said the airstrike by the Afghan air force had resulted in the deaths of 14 civilians, but government officials denied the claim. Residents later brought the bodies of the deceased to the provincial capital in protest.
In a statement, Ghani said he was ""deeply saddened"" over the civilian casualties from the airstrike in the Khashrod district of Nimroz province.
He said he had instructed authorities to reach out to the families of the victims.
Residents of the affected area, angered by the Nimroz governor's statement that those killed were Taliban fighters, said they would launch protests if the official did not apologise.
The death toll from the incident has risen to 18, according to locals. Eight children and seven women are among the dead, said Nematullah Siddiqi, a Nimroz provincial council member. 
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) also expressed concerns about the incident.
""UN urges open investigation, accountability & using findings to protect civilians,"" UNAMA said on Twitter.
The airstrike was carried out during clashes between Taliban fighters and government forces, even as the two sides were beginning a second round of peace negotiations in the Qatari capital of Doha. 
The negotiations are meant to discuss contentious issues, including a ceasefire to stop the escalating violence in Afghanistan. 

Nearly 6,000 Afghan civilians were killed or wounded in the first three quarters of last year as fighting between government forces and Taliban insurgents raged despite efforts to find peace, according to a UN report.

The new all-day curfew starts at 5 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Thursday and ends at 5 a.m. on Jan. 25, a statement by the Supreme Defense Council said. 
Lebanon last week ordered a three-week lockdown until Feb. 2 that included a nighttime curfew from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m. 
But tighter measures were now necessary as hospitals run out of capacity to treat critically ill patients, President Michel Aoun said in the statement.
""We have seen dreadful scenes of citizens waiting in front of hospitals for a chair or a bed,"" he said. 
The new measures also include stricter procedures at the airport for passengers arriving from Cairo, Addis Ababa, Baghdad, Istanbul and Adana. 
Travellers arriving from these destinations will have to quarantine for seven days at a hotel while all others will quarantine up to 72 hours. 
Overall air traffic at the airport will also be cut to 20% from normal operating levels and supermarkets will be limited to delivery services. 
Anticipation of stricter measures on Monday had driven many Lebanese to wait in long queues in front of supermarkets and empty shelves. 
Lebanon registered 3,743 new infections on Sunday, bringing
its total to 219,296 cases and 1,606 deaths since Feb. 21.
Adherence to social distancing and other preventive measures
has been lax prompting government fears of a significant rise in cases after the Christmas and New Year holidays. 
Daily infections reached an all time high of 5,440 on Friday. 
""Sadly we are being faced with a frightening health situation,"" Caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab said. 
""The corona pandemic is out of control because of the stubbornness of people and their rebellion against measures we take to protect them from its dangers.""
The lockdown faces resistance amid concerns over soaring unemployment, inflation and poverty. 
Lebanon is still dealing with a devastating financial crisis that has crashed the currency, paralysed banks, and frozen savers out of their deposits. 
Medical supplies have dwindled as dollars have grown scarce.

RIYADH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The outgoing U.S. administration is to designate Yemen's Houthi movement as a foreign terrorist organization, a move the United Nations warned could have serious repercussions for peace talks and efforts to combat the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
A leader of the Iranian-aligned group, which has been battling a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen since 2015 in a war widely seen as a proxy conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia, said it reserved the right to respond.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the move, which will include sanctions against the movement and three of its leaders, in a statement late on Sunday, hours after Reuters reported it. It will come into effect on Jan. 19, the Trump administration's last day in office.
""It's clear that the decision is likely to have serious humanitarian and political repercussions,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Monday, urging Washington to swiftly grant exemptions to ensure aid is not disrupted. 
Dujarric also said the United Nations was ""concerned that the designation may have a detrimental impact on efforts to resume the political process in Yemen, as well as to polarize even more the positions of the parties to the conflict."" 
The U.S. administration has been piling on sanctions related to Iran in recent weeks, suggesting to some that Republican President Donald Trump wants to make it harder for Democrat Joe Biden's administration to re-engage with Iran and rejoin an international agreement on Iran's nuclear programme after he becomes president on Jan. 20.
For Biden to undo the designation would require a lengthy legal review, and he could also face political obstacles from Iran hardliners in Congress.
Yemen's Saudi-backed government called for more further pressure on the Houthis, who seized the capital Sanaa in late 2014 and control much of northern Yemen.
Saudi Arabia, which has been attacked by missiles and drones launched from Yemen by the Houthis, said the designation would ""neutralise"" the Houthi threat by preventing it securing arms and funds.
""It ... will force the leaders of the Houthi militia backed by Iran to seriously return to the negotiating table,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
'BANKRUPT U.S. GOVERNMENT'
The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system and deny being controlled by Iran. Houthi official Mohammed Ali al-Houthi said it was the Trump administration's behaviour that was ""terrorist"", tweeting: ""We reserve the right to respond to any designation...""
An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman told a weekly news conference that a ""bankrupt U.S. government"" was poisoning its legacy and tarnishing the United States' image.
The United Nations is trying to revive talks to end Yemen's conflict, which has driven the poorest state on the Arabian peninsula into an economic and humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had warned against a possible designation, saying Yemen was in imminent danger of entering the worst famine the world has seen for decades.
Oxfam America's humanitarian policy lead Scott Paul called Pompeo's move ""counter-productive and dangerous"".
The Norwegian Refugee Council called for guarantees to ensure sanctions did not prevent deliveries of food, fuel and medicines - which 80% of the population rely on.
He said the U.S. Treasury Department would provide licences for some humanitarian activities conducted by non-governmental organizations in Yemen and for some transactions related to exports of critical commodities such as food and medicine.
International relief officials have said such licences often fail to reassure banks and insurance firms that they will not fall foul of sanctions.
The designation has been the subject of weeks of fierce debate within the administration, and disagreements over how to carve out exceptions for aid shipments held up a final decision, multiple sources said.

""The Houthis are an integral part of Yemeni society,"" said Ryan Crocker, a retired U.S. ambassador who served in the Middle East. ""This is making a strategic enemy out of a local force that has been part of Yemen for generations.""

219,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 11, 2021 01:46PM ET</span>","In Trump's final days, Netanyahu orders more settler homes built","By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered construction plans advanced on Monday for some 800 Jewish settler homes in the occupied West Bank, anchoring the projects in the final days of the pro-settlement Trump administration.
Palestinians condemned such construction as illegal. The timing of the move appeared to be an attempt to set Israel's blueprint in indelible ink before Joe Biden, who has been critical of its settlement policies, becomes U.S. president on Jan. 20.
Moving ahead with the projects could help shore up support for Netanyahu from settlers and their backers in a March 23 election, Israel's fourth in two years, in which the conservative leader faces new challenges from the right.
An announcement by Netanyahu's office said about 800 homes would be built in the settlements of Beit El and Givat Zeev, north of Jerusalem, and in Tal Menashe, Rehelim, Shavei Shomron, Barkan and Karnei Shomron in the northern West Bank. It gave no starting date for construction.
""It is an attempt to race against time and benefit from the last days of the current U.S. administration,"" Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, told Reuters.
The Donald Trump administration has effectively backed Israel's right to build West Bank settlements by abandoning a long-held U.S. position that they break international law. Trump has also delighted Israeli leaders and angered Palestinians by recognising contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there.
Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, said Netanyahu wants the settlement move ""to be set in stone before the Biden administration comes into office, and maybe changes Israeli-American tacit understandings on settlements that existed under Trump."" 
Netanyahu also wants to tell voters he is ""the only leader who can stand up to Biden and make sure he doesn't dictate our policy in the (Palestinian) territories,"" Talshir said. 
Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, all land captured by Israel in a 1967 war.
Most countries view Israeli settlements as violating international law. Israel disputes this, citing historical, political and biblical links to the West Bank, where more than 440,000 Israeli settlers now live among 3 million Palestinians who have limited self rule under Israeli occupation.

As vice president under Barack Obama, Biden was put in an uncomfortable position during a visit to Israel in 2010 when Israel announced plans for a settlement in a West Bank area annexed to Jerusalem. Arriving 90 minutes late for dinner with Netanyahu, Biden condemned the decision as undermining U.S.-Israeli trust.

BIHAC, Bosnia (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrants are taking shelter in abandoned buildings in and around the northwestern Bosnian town of Bihac, wrapping up as best they can against the snow and freezing weather and hoping eventually to reach EU member Croatia across the border.
Bosnia has since early 2018 become part of a transit route for thousands of migrants from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa aiming to reach Europe's wealthier countries. 
But it has become increasingly difficult to cross EU borders and impoverished Bosnia has become a cul de sac with its ethnically divided government unable to cope, leaving hundreds of people without proper shelter.
Ali, 16, from Afghanistan, has been sleeping in an abandoned bus for almost six months after he left a Bihac camp.
""I'm in really a bad way, there's no one to look after us here and the conditions are not safe here,"" Ali told Reuters. 
""People who are supposed to support us have been coming and taking things from us and then selling those things inside the camp or in other places. We have nothing here... Please help us.""
There are currently about 8,000 migrants in Bosnia, some 6,500 in camps around the capital Sarajevo and in the northwestern corner of the country bordering Croatia.
The International Organisation for Migration (IOM), which is running the Bosnian camps, says its mobile teams are helping around 1,000 people squatting in houses that were deserted or destroyed during the Bosnian war in the 1990s.
""They don't have the possibility of regular food distribution,"" said IOM camp manager and coordinator Natasa Omerovic. ""They can't seek medical assistance.""
Until last week, an additional 900 people were left without shelter after the Lipa summer camp, some 26 km away, was set on fire just as the IOM decided to withdraw because it was not warm enough for winter.
Bosnian authorities, who for months ignored requests from the European Union to find an alternative location, have now provided heated military tents and beds. 
On Sunday evening, a group which found shelter in an abandoned house in Bihac, ate a modest dinner cooked under torchlight on an improvised fire. They slept on the dirty concrete floor without water. Some wore only plastic slippers in the snow.
""Too hard life here,"" said Shabaz Kan from Afghanistan.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal does not have the capacity to store COVID-19 vaccines at ultra-low temperatures and would prefer to receive vials that can be kept for longer under ordinary refrigeration, the head of the country's vaccination programme said on Monday. 
A lack of cold storage means Senegal would only be able to keep vaccines developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University, by China or Russia in the long term, as they do not require a deep freeze, Ousseynou Badiane told Reuters. 
Those being distributed by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which require storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 F), and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech, which need to be kept at -70 degrees Celsius, are less desirable. Senegal could store the Moderna vaccine for 30 days and the Pfizer one for seven days but after that they would be spoiled, Badiane added.
The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines ""are not our first choice. Our first choice is the vaccine that fits easily into the system that exists, that doesn't require major investment,"" Badiane told Reuters. 
""If the vaccines are not used (in the right time frame) that would be an enormous waste.""
The situation in Senegal highlights the problems that poorer countries with hot climates face in storing and distributing vaccines, often in rural areas with unreliable power supplies. [L4N2II2PB] 
It also shows how far behind some African countries are in preparing to receive vaccines even as COVID-19 cases surge to record levels. 
Millions have already received inoculations in Western countries and China, while Senegal is awaiting vaccines through the World Health Organization-backed global COVAX scheme. This programme is helping to finance deliveries to 92 developing nations with limited or no means to buy vaccines on their own. 
Senegal is no stranger to vaccination campaigns.
In four walk-in cold rooms in the capital Dakar, authorities keep thousands of vials of yellow fever and hepatitis B vaccines at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. It has one room that keeps oral polio vaccines up to minus 25 degrees Celsius. 
At the Fann hospital in Dakar, technicians are installing seven new such rooms. But for now the lack of deep refrigeration limits the country's options.

""If the option now is to take the (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccines we... would have to redo all our logistics,"" Badiane said.

KYIV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya led calls on Monday for Belarus to be stripped of hosting this year's ice hockey world championship as President Alexander Lukashenko gave a warm welcome to the sport's governing body. 
Lukashenko hugged Rene Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), as they met in Minsk to discuss the May-June event.
In power since 1994, Lukashenko launched a violent crackdown against protests following an election last August that opponents say was rigged. 
He denies fraud and has remained in power with help from ally Russia while Western countries imposed sanctions. 
Denying hosting rights would deprive Lukashenko, an avid hockey fan and player, of staging the biggest international event in Belarus since the election.
""Fasel is shaking hands and hugging the dictator,"" Tsikhanouskaya tweeted. ""A few miles away from them, people are imprisoned in inhumane conditions as political prisoners.""
Lukashenko assured Fasel that Belarus could safely host the tournament. ""Protesters and other dissatisfied people do not storm government offices and capitols here,"" he said, in an apparent jibe at last week's assault on the U.S. Capitol. 
The Belta state news agency quoted Fasel as saying: ""We do not want to mix sport and politics. Sport should unite nations not divide them."" 
'IMMORAL'
On its website, the IIHF quoted Fasel as saying the organization was engaged in a careful evaluation of Minsk's capability to co-host the event and would be talking with various different groups.
Neighbour and co-host Latvia wants Belarus out. 
""Repressions against peaceful demonstrators, including athletes, makes such event immoral & contrary to the principles of sportsmanship,"" tweeted its Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics.
Several prominent Belarusian athletes were jailed for taking part in protests. Others lost state jobs or were kicked off national teams.
The Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation (BSSF), which helps athletes, expressed ""disbelief"" at the Lukashenko-Fasel meeting. 
""The cordiality and warmth with which Mr. Fasel talked to Mr. Lukashenko gave the impression that the meeting was not taking place in the country where more than 30,000 people have been imprisoned during the past four months,"" it said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, in another step towards greater equality for women in the Roman Catholic Church, on Monday changed its law to allow them to serve as readers at liturgies, altar servers and distributors of communion.
In a decree, the pope formalised what already has been happening in many countries for years. But with the change in the Code of Canon Law, conservative bishops will not be able to block women in their diocese from those roles.
But the Vatican stressed that the roles were ""essentially distinct from the ordained ministry"", and were not an automatic precursor to women one day being allowed to be ordained priests.
In the decree, called ""Spiritus Domini"" (The Spirit of the Lord), Francis said he had acted after theological reflection.
In an accompanying letter, the pope said he wanted to bring ""stability, public recognition"" to women already serving in the roles.
""This shift bring the institutional Church in alignment with the pastoral realities around the world,"" said Kate McElwee, executive director of the Women's Ordination Conference, which promotes a female priesthood.
In a big shift last August the pope appointed six women, including the former treasurer for Britain's Prince Charles, to senior roles in the council that oversees Vatican finances.
Francis has already appointed women as deputy foreign minister, director of the Vatican Museums, and deputy head of the Vatican Press Office, as well as four women as councillors to the Synod of Bishops, which prepares major meetings.
He has also set up commissions to study the history of women deacons in the early centuries of the Catholic Church, responding to calls by women that they be allowed to take up the role today. Advocates of a female deaconate hope it could lead to women priests. 

Deacons, like priests, are ordained ministers, and as in the priesthood, must be men in today's Church. They may not celebrate Mass, but they may preach, teach in the name of the Church, baptise and conduct wedding, wake and funeral services and even run a parish with the permission of a bishop.

A mass vaccination programme is being run across the United Kingdom by the state-owned National Health Service (NHS), which provides all care including vaccines free of charge.
""There are a number of scams involving COVID, including a particularly nasty one in which people have been tricked into paying for a COVID vaccine and then jabbed in the arm,"" said Vaughan Gething, Minister for Health in Wales, at a briefing.
""I want to be clear, our NHS will never ask anyone to pay for a COVID vaccine. These are free. The NHS will never ask for your bank details and vaccines are not being delivered to your front door by people who have not been identified as NHS staff.""
The minister's warning came after the National Crime Agency (NCA) last week urged the public to be vigilant, reporting that scammers were asking elderly and vulnerable people for payment in return for access to vaccines that were fake or non-existent.
""The current level of reported fraud in relation to the vaccine remains very low but is increasing,"" said Graeme Biggar, Director General of the National Economic Crime Centre at the NCA.
The City of London police reported on Friday that a scammer had obtained 160 pounds from a 92-year-old woman and had jabbed her in the arm with what she described as a ""dart-like implement"" after he turned up unannounced at her home.

Britain is in the grip of a devastating surge in infections which has pushed the total UK COVID-19 death toll above 81,000 and led to the imposition of national lockdowns in England and Scotland and tight restrictions in Wales and Northern Ireland.

A new basic law issued by Sultan Haitham bin Tariq al-Said also emphasises the role of the state in guaranteeing more rights and freedoms for citizens, state news agency ONA said. 
Sultan Haitham came to power a year ago after the death of his predecessor Sultan Qaboos. Qaboos did not have a crown prince and named his preferred successor in a sealed envelope opened after his death. 
The basic law sets out mechanisms for the appointment of a crown prince and his duties. The report did not say who would become the new crown prince or provide other details.
It also sets the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary as the basis for governance in Oman, ONA said.

With Britain suffering from one of the highest rates of COVID deaths in the world and struggling to reduce a spiralling increase in the number of cases, Starmer renewed his criticism of Johnson by saying he ""simply isn't up to the job"".
The British government has warned that hospitals could soon struggle to treat the rising number of cases if people do not follow the restrictions, a message Starmer also took up by calling on everyone ""to come together"".
""The indecision and delays of the prime minister cost lives and they cost people's jobs,"" Starmer said in a speech.
""The British people will forgive many things. They know the pandemic is difficult. But they also know serial incompetence when they see it – and they know when a prime minister simply isn't up to the job.""
A spokesman for Johnson rejected the criticism, saying the prime minister had taken ""quick and decisive"" action.
Johnson has been castigated from all sides over the spread of coronavirus, with even some in his governing Conservative Party taking aim at his seeming reluctance to introduce tougher measures quickly to curb a surge in infections.
Starmer also said he wanted the government to protect more people's money as a new lockdown bites by stopping council tax rises, preventing any cut to welfare payments, extending a ban on evictions and by handing key workers a pay rise.
But he backed the government's vaccine programme, which ministers want to offer people in the four highest risk levels, including those over 70, the most clinically vulnerable and frontline health workers, the shots by Feb. 15.

""I hope they do. Let's hold them to that, and let's help them with that,"" Starmer said. ""But then we must deliver even more and double that target in February.""

Italian schools reopened in mid-September after a six-month stop - the longest in Europe - but face-to-face lessons in high schools across the country were gradually suspended again a month later due to a new surge in cases.
""School is crucial. We are asking for a safe return to face-to-face activities,"" student Emanuele Santori said during a demonstration in Rome outside his Cavour school under the shadow of the Colosseum.
Fellow pupil Ilaria Rinattieri added: ""It is true we are young, but it is also true we will be the next electoral voters, workers and the citizens of tomorrow.""
Last week the government said high schools could restart at 50% capacity as of Jan. 11 but only 4 regions have re-opened. Most regional heads said it was too early and ordered that the return to classes be postponed by several weeks.
Italy's powerful regional heads can overturn the central government's orders on certain issues, including education. 
""I have done everything I could do, the schools are ready to start but the regions have the ability to reopen them or not,"" Education Minister Lucia Azzolina told state broadcaster RAI. ""Distance learning is not working any more.""
Italy, the first Western country to be hit by COVID-19, has reported over 78,700 coronavirus-related fatalities since discovering the pandemic in February, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the sixth-highest in the world.
After the Christmas holidays, Italy returned to a three-tier system which allows for different measures to be applied to different regions according to infection levels.
""Linking schools reopening to the zones system or to the whim of regional governors makes every decision unstable,"" parents committee 'A Scuola!' (To School!) wrote in a letter to newspaper Corriere della Sera. ""As parents, teachers and citizens, we are tired.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday brought together the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan for the first time since a war last year over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, an effort to resolve problems that risk undermining the deal that ended the conflict. 
A Russian-brokered ceasefire agreement in November halted the six-week conflict between Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces over the mountainous enclave and surrounding areas, locking in territorial gains for Azerbaijan.
But tensions persist, with sporadic fighting, prisoners of war continuing to be held by both sides, and disagreements over how a prospective new transport corridor cutting through the region will work. 
The enclave is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but both ethnic Armenians and Azeris regard it as part of their historic homelands and fought a much bigger war in the 1990s over it that left tens of thousands dead.
In opening remarks in the Kremlin, Putin said the November ceasefire deal, which saw Moscow deploy peacekeepers to the region, was being implemented. 
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azeri President Ilham Aliyev did not shake hands, only exchanging curt greetings as they sat down at an oval table opposite Putin.
The ceasefire deal sparked protests in Yerevan against Pashinyan whom protesters accused of bungling the war. He has since faced pressure from opponents to step down, something he has resisted.
Aliyev has cast the war victory at home as an historic righting of wrongs, something Armenia rejects, and held a victory parade last month with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. 
For Russia, the conflict highlighted the rising influence of Azeri ally Turkey in the South Caucasus, part of the former Soviet Union that Moscow has traditionally seen as its own sphere of influence.
But by brokering the deal and getting Russian peacekeepers on the ground, Putin has thwarted a stronger Turkish presence for now while expanding Moscow's own military footprint. 
Dmitry Trenin, a political analyst for the Moscow Carnegie Center, said the Kremlin hoped that Monday's talks would allow it to reaffirm its influence in the region. 

""(The) peacekeeping function is Moscow's advantage in its competitive relationship with Ankara,"" Trenin wrote on Twitter.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz went on trial in a Geneva court on Monday on corruption and forgery charges linked to mining concessions in the West African nation of Guinea.
Steinmetz was indicted in August 2019 by a Geneva prosecutor who accused him and two aides of paying or having $10 million in bribes paid to obtain exploration permits for some of the world's richest iron-ore deposits.
Steinmetz and his aides deny the charges. If convicted he could face up to 10 years in prison.
Steinmetz's lawyer, Marc Bonnant, told the three-judge panel that his client should not face charges.
The 64-year-old, a former Geneva resident who moved back to Israel in 2016, is attending the two-week trial in person.
Swiss prosecutors allege Steinmetz and his aides won the rights to mine the lucrative iron-ore vein in Guinea's remote Simandou mountain range by bribing Mamadie Toure, one of the wives of the former Guinean President Lansana Conté, between 2006 and 2010, and that they forged documents to cover it up.
Mamadie Toure, believed to reside in the United States, is called as a witness this week, ahead of the verdict due on Jan. 22. Reuters attempted to contact Toure through social media, but she could not immediately be reached for comment. 
""Beny Steinmetz never paid a cent to Mme. Mamadie Toure. Mamadie Toure was not the wife of the president (Lansana Conte) and she is not a public agent and therefore cannot be corrupted,"" Bonnant told Reuters last month.
Development of Simandou has been hindered by years of legal wrangling involving several big mining companies.
As part of international efforts to improve transparency, Guinea's government under President Alpha Conde, elected in 2010, launched a review of mining contracts signed before 2011.
The review panel investigated how BSGR had obtained rights to the Simandou deposit in 2008 and, after levelling corruption allegations, the government stripped the company of its rights to Simandou and a smaller deposit.
BSGR has always maintained it did nothing wrong. It walked away from the Simandou project as part of a settlement announced in February 2019 with the Guinean government, in which both parties agreed to drop outstanding legal action.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A hammer-wielding Russian man who tried to beat to death a well-known blogger and critic of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov in Sweden last year was sentenced on Monday to 10 years in prison by a Swedish court. 
Tumso Abdurakhmanov survived the Feb. 26 attack in the town of Gavle. The court did not give the convicted defendant's name, in keeping with Swedish practice.
A woman who helped the assailant by letting him into Abdurachmanov's apartment, was given an 8-year term. Both will be expelled from Sweden, Swedish news agency TT said. Foreign convicts are normally expelled after serving their sentence.
Prominent critics of Kadyrov have been the victims of a number of attacks in recent years. 
In February 2020, Chechen blogger Imran Aliyev was found stabbed to death in a hotel in Lille, France. The same month, a Russian investigative journalist who had alleged that gay men in Chechnya were subject to mass arrest and torture was beaten up in the Chechen capital Grozny.
In 2006, Anna Politkovskaya, a journalist who covered Chechnya for the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, was shot dead as she returned to her Moscow apartment.
Human rights workers have accused Kadyrov of widespread abuses, allegations he denies. 
Supporters credit him with restoring relative calm to a region dogged for years by a simmering insurgency following two wars between Moscow and separatists after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, said he expects U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to extend the last major nuclear arms control treaty between Moscow and Washington when it expires next month, but that the two countries have much more to do. 
In an interview with Russia's RIA news agency published on Monday, Gorbachev, 89, said he was counting on Biden, whom he said he had met many times, to extend the New START treaty.
The pact limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads, deployed missiles and heavy bombers the world’s two biggest nuclear powers can have and is widely regarded as the cornerstone of global arms control. 
""During the election campaign, he (Biden) said that the treaty must be extended,"" said Gorbachev. ""But I think that is just the first step. We need to agree on further cuts. We need to discuss and adjust military doctrines.""
Gorbachev, whose 1980s arms control push and democracy-oriented reforms helped end the Cold War, is still listened to by some in the Kremlin because of his vast experience managing relations with Washington.
Biden, who will succeed Donald Trump as U.S. president on Jan. 20, said he favours extending New START, which lapses on Feb. 5, though it remains unclear how long any extension might be.
Russia has offered to roll New Start over by anything from one to five years without new conditions, something Washington has been keen to attach.
Under Trump, Washington formally pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 2019, accusing Moscow of violating it, something Moscow denied.
Washington also withdrew from the Open Skies Treaty in November last year, an arms control and verification agreement.
Gorbachev, who called for political will and dialogue, said he hoped the Biden administration would endorse a commitment the two sides had made at a Soviet-era summit in 1985.
That declaration said nuclear war was unacceptable, could have no winner, and that neither side would try to gain military superiority.
""Russia recently proposed that the Americans confirm this formula,"" said Gorbachev. ""Now a new administration will come and it would be good to renew our proposal.""

Gorbachev also said the United States and Russia should in time try to get other nuclear-armed countries involved in arms control talks.

While many in Madrid enjoyed the rare snow fall, skiing right at the heart of the city and holding mass snowball fights, a cold spell was set to turn the snow into slippery ice this week, and authorities rushed to clear more streets.
The snowstorm complicated Spain's efforts to increase the pace of its coronavirus vaccination programme amid rising infections. A new batch of vaccines meant to land in Madrid diverted on Monday to Vitoria, in northern Spain.
     Renfe train operator said all fast train lines were operating except for Madrid-Barcelona connections, which are likely to resume in early afternoon. Most Madrid suburban lines were working on Monday, but with fewer trains than usual. 
Two runways at one terminal of Madrid's Barajas main international airport re-opened and the airport operator said that of around 400 flights scheduled to fly in and out on Monday, 117 had been cancelled. 
With most streets still covered in snow, many workers stayed home. A Reuters reporter saw a number of empty shelves at several central Madrid supermarkets. The city's main wholesale food market, Mercamadrid, was closed because of the snow and set to start operating again on Tuesday. 
Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said the situation on the roads was improving but was still ""extraordinary"" and many remained closed. 
Ministers declined to say if the capital city would be declared a disaster zone, saying they first needed to evaluate the damages. 
The cold wave, with temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius in central Spain, will last until Thursday, the Aemet meteorological agency said.

CHAMONIX, France (Reuters) - Business owners at France's Chamonix ski resort, their earnings slashed because of the COVID-19 lockdown, are worried they might not be able to welcome back skiers at all before the snows melt and the season ends.
French ski resorts were prevented from opening their cable cars and ski lifts at the start of the season, driving away the large portion of their visitors who come for downhill skiing.
The French government had discussed the possibility of re-opening the ski lifts of Jan. 7, but last week it said that with virus cases still high, that would be premature. A decision is now due on Jan. 20, leaving little time before the season ends.
""If we have to close to the end of season, that's going to cost us several billion euros,"" said Mathieu Dechavanne, Chairman and CEO of Compagnie du Mont-Blanc, which operates cable cars in the region. ""The economic impact will be catastrophic.""
At the weekend on the slopes above Chamonix, a few winter sports enthusiasts did their best to enjoy the mountains. Some hiked using snow shoes, others tobogganed, or walked up the slopes before skiing down.
But the streets of Chamonix were unusually quiet.
The ""Le Serac"" restaurant was shut, except for take out orders, and owner Francois Montorcier said he was taking just 10 percent of normal revenues.
""It's a catastrophe,"" he said. ""We don't see things getting better.""
The French government provides financial assistance, but it does not cover all losses. At his ski equipment rental shop, co-owner David Pot said he and his partners had lost half their revenue since the pandemic began.
He was angry, he said, because skiing did not expose people to a high risk of infection, yet government ministers still cracked down on ski resorts.
""There's no logic in the way they take decisions,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Monday criticised the government for failing to break a deadlock with farmers protesting against reforms of the agricultural sector.
Tens of thousands of farmers have been camped on the outskirts of the capital, New Delhi, for more than a month, and have promised to march during Republic Day celebrations on Jan. 26, against what they see as laws benefiting large private buyers at the expense of producers.
Chief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde said in a hearing on Monday the drawn-out confrontation was causing distress to farmers. 
""We are extremely disappointed at the way government is handling all this,"" Bobde said.
""We don't know what consultative process you followed before the laws. Many states are up in rebellion.""
He repeated a suggestion that the government pause the legislation while farmers' concerns are heard and said the court would pass orders if the two sides remained at an impasse.
The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi says the legislation is aimed at modernising an antiquated agricultural system, which suffers from colossal wastage and bottlenecks in the supply chain. 
But farm leaders say the laws are an attempt to erode a longstanding minimum support price for their crops and they want a full repeal of the laws. 
The government has said there was ""no question"" of this happening, and eight rounds of talks have failed to find common ground. The two sides are set to next meet on Friday.

Andrew Cheung made his remarks hours after he was sworn in to replace Geoffrey Ma, 65, who is retiring after a decade as chief justice in the former British colony.
Cheung, 59, takes office at a pivotal moment for the city's judges - long seen as the pillars of support for its broad rights and freedoms - amid rising political pressures and a new national security regime imposed by Beijing.
The first prosecutions under the security law are now moving through the courts while some pro-Beijing figures are demanding reviews of the way sentences are meted out and judges appointed.
""An independent judiciary is essential to the rule of law of in Hong Kong and the due administration of justice,"" Cheung said.
""It is equally crucial to public and business confidence - whether local or overseas - in our judicial system, as well as to the international reputation of Hong Kong."" 
That independence, he said, meant in part that the courts ""must not be subject to improper extraneous pressure or influence.""
The law makes anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.
It also allows the city's chief executive to decide which judges can hear national security cases and allows for suspects to be taken across the border for trial in courts in mainland China, where the ruling Communist Party ultimately controls the legal system.
The independence of Hong Kong's judiciary is outlined in the city's Basic Law, the mini-constitution that enshrines its extensive autonomy and freedoms following its handover from British colonial rule to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Cheung said those freedoms – including of assembly, speech and due process - were ""fundamental"" under the Basic Law.
""Society expects the courts and our judges to generously interpret and jealously protect these rights when they are threatened or otherwise interfered with,"" he said in remarks to formally open the legal year.

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China condemned the United States on Monday for scrapping curbs on interactions with Taiwan officials, saying nobody could prevent the country's ""re-unification"", while Taiwan's foreign minister hailed the U.S. move as a sign of ""global partnership"".
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the change on Saturday, in the waning days of the Republican Trump administration before Democrat Joe Biden assumes the presidency on Jan. 20.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, said it was ""resolutely opposed"" to the decision and strongly condemned it.
""The Chinese people's resolve to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity is unshakable and we will not permit any person or force to stop the process of China's re-unification,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.
""Any actions which harm China's core interests will be met with a firm counterattack and will not succeed,"" he added.
Taiwan welcomed Pompeo's decision, with Foreign Minister Joseph Wu telling reporters it was a ""big thing for the elevation of Taiwan-U.S. relations"".
He added, ""Taiwan-U.S. relations have been elevated to a global partnership. The foreign ministry will not let our guard down and hopes to continue to boost the development of Taiwan-U.S. ties.""
Like most countries, the United States has no official ties with Taiwan, though it is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. Under President Donald Trump it has ramped up arms sales and sent senior officials to Taipei.
But Pompeo's decision means, for example, that Taiwan officials will be able to hold meetings at the State Department or White House rather than in non-official locations elsewhere, such as hotels.
Chinese state media lambasted the decision.
The widely-read Global Times tabloid, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, said China must send a ""stern warning"" to Taiwan.
""Those on the island of Taiwan must not take for granted that they can seek secession with the help of the last-ditch madness of an administration abandoned by the Americans,"" the paper added.
""On the contrary, such madness is very likely to bring them annihilation.""
On Wednesday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, will arrive in Taipei for a three-day visit that China has denounced.
Wu said both he and President Tsai Ing-wen would meet Craft on Thursday, adding that discussing ways to promote Taiwan's international participation would a topic during the visit.
Craft's visit is highly symbolic, as Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, or most global bodies, because of China's objections. Beijing says only it has the right to speak for Taiwan on the international stage.
Taiwan says only its democratically elected government has this right.
Trump is a popular figure in Taiwan because of his backing for the island, though the government has reassured people that strong ties will not change under Biden, pointing to vigorous bipartisan support for it.
Still, Pompeo's move and Craft's visit have prompted concern in some circles in Taiwan, where there is a broad cross-party consensus on maintaining strong U.S. ties and there have long been worries Trump may sacrifice Taiwan for a deal with China.
On Saturday, former President Ma Ying-jeou told media that Craft's trip was only designed to needle Beijing, and simply a show of surface friendship with no practical use.
Late on Sunday, Johnny Chiang, the chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang party, which traditionally favours close China ties, said a key test would be whether Biden's government maintained Pompeo's changes.

""Let's not become a bargaining chip in the game between the United States and mainland China,"" he said.

""We are discussing with the Public Health Ministry and the country's coronavirus taskforce to offer hotel and golf quarantine for tourists with medical certificates,"" Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn told reporters. 
Foreign tourists would be able to spend the two-week quarantine period at a specified resort and move around in the hotel area and also play golf, he said, rather than just isolating in their rooms. 
The plan, which is subject to the approval of the cabinet, comes as the Southeast Asian country grapples with a second wave of coronavirus infections after managing to largely contain community spread for months.
Thailand has reported a relatively low 10,547 COVID-19 infections and 67 deaths, though since several clusters emerged in December the country has been recording several hundred new cases a day. 
Thailand attracted 40 million tourists in 2019 who spent 1.91 trillion baht ($63.4 billion), but the number of visitors dived during the pandemic after its borders were sealed, devastating hotels, restaurants and tourist spots that relied on foreigner visitors. 
A special visa scheme that was started last year for long stay visitors has attracted about 1,000 visitors, Phiphat said.

Existing Taiwanese passports have ""Republic of China"", its formal name, written in large English font at the top, with ""Taiwan"" printed at the bottom, creating confusion internationally according to the government.
During the early days of the pandemic Taiwan says some of its citizens were confused with Chinese nationals and on occasion unfairly subject to the same COVID-19-related entry bans when the disease was well under control in Taiwan though not in China. The new passport enlarges the word ""Taiwan"" in English and removes ""Republic of China"", though that name in Chinese and in small English font around the national emblem remains.
Bureau of Consular Affairs Director General Phoebe Yeh told Reuters that as of mid-morning Monday, they had received more than 700 applications for the new passport, compared with a daily average of 1,000 typically. 
""The purpose is to increase the visibility of Taiwan so that our people will not be mistakenly identified as coming from China when they travel abroad,"" she said.
Chen Li-ting, one of the first to apply for the new passport, said the change was ""fantastic"".
""I thought it would happen sooner or later. That is, sooner or later the word Taiwan would appear more and more. And in the future Republic of China will perhaps disappear,"" he said.

China, referring to the new passports, has said it does not matter what ""petty moves"" Taiwan made, it would not change the fact that Taiwan was an inseparable part of China. China claims democratic Taiwan as its sovereign territory, and says only it has the right to speak for the island internationally, a position it has pushed strongly during the pandemic, especially at the World Health Organization (WHO).

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian navy divers scouring the sea bed were closing in on data recorders from a Sriwijaya Air jet that plunged into the sea two days ago with 62 people on board minutes after take off from Jakarta's main airport.
With little prospect now of finding survivors, authorities also said that there would be a focus on recovering the bodies of victims.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-500 jet was headed on a domestic flight to Pontianak on Borneo island, about 740 km (460 miles) from Jakarta, before it disappeared from radar screens four minutes after take-off and crashed into the Java sea.
The incident is the first major air crash in Indonesia since 189 passengers and crew were killed in 2018 when a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX in 2018 also plunged into the Java Sea soon after taking off from Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.
Divers had further narrowed down the search area strongly suspected to be the location of the black boxes, a Navy spokesman, Fajar Tri Rohadi said.
Bayu Wardoyo, a rescue diver, told Kompas TV more human remains had been found on Monday and that underwater visibility was some 5-6 metres.
A police hospital receiving the remains had taken 40 DNA samples from the relatives of victims and other medical records to help with identification, officials said.
""The quicker we can find victims, the better,"" search and rescue operation director Rasman MS told an earlier briefing, adding that the operation involved 2,600 personnel, 53 ships and aerial surveillance. 
Nurcahyo Utomo, an investigator at Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), told Reuters the jet may have been intact before it hit the water, given the debris appeared to have scattered in a relatively tight area underwater.
He said KNKT had yet to speak to Sriwijaya Air's management, but was collecting data on the plane and the pilots.
Rescuers have so far found one of the jet's turbines, pieces of the plane's tail, the rim of a wheel and an emergency chute, as well as clothing and personal belongings from passengers.
Flight SJ 182 had 12 crew and 50 passengers on board, all Indonesians and including 10 children.

The KNKT has previously said the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing would be involved in the investigation. 
In a statement at the weekend, Boeing said: ""We are in contact with our airline customer and stand ready to support them during this difficult time.""
Tracking service Flightradar24 said the aircraft took off at 2:36 p.m. local time (0736 GMT) and climbed to 10,900 feet within four minutes. It then began a steep descent and stopped transmitting data 21 seconds later.
The Sriwijaya Air plane was nearly 27 years old, much older than Boeing's problem-plagued 737 MAX model. Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the stall-prevention system implicated in the MAX safety crisis.
With few immediate clues on what caused a catastrophic loss of control after take-off, investigators will rely heavily on retrieving flight recorders intact from the seabed.
They will also study maintenance and engine records, pilot rosters and training, air traffic recordings and other data.
Newer jets and their engines emit streams of data to help airlines plan maintenance. But neither the 737-500 nor its engines leave such a digital trace, industry experts say. 

The crash comes at a sensitive time and place for Boeing after poor software contributed to crashes of the newer 737 MAX in Indonesia and Ethiopia. But the long service history of the model involved in Saturday's crash, and its lack of similar software, mean design is seen less likely to be a key factor.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Monday he remains committed to engaging with North Korea, and that cooperation on issues such as anti-epidemic work could help lead to a breakthrough in stalled talks in the last years of his term.
Seoul will make efforts to jumpstart talks between the United States and North Korea as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office, Moon said during his annual New Year's speech.
""Dialogue and co-prosperity are key drivers of the peace process on the Korean Peninsula,"" he said. ""Our will to meet anytime, anywhere, and willingness to talk...remains unchanged.""
Moon, whose term ends in 2022, has made engagement with North Korea one of his signature goals, and he said he would liaise closely with Biden's administration.
Talks aimed at convincing North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and improve relations with the United States and South Korea have been stalled, with Pyongyang accusing Seoul and Washington of maintaining hostile policies.
""We will strengthen the alliance with the United States in line with the inauguration of the Biden administration, while making last-ditch efforts for a grand breakthrough in stalemated North Korea-U.S. and inter-Korean talks,"" Moon said.
North Korea has been holding an ongoing party congress, where leader Kim Jong Un discussed called for developing more advanced nuclear weapons and revitalising the country's economy.
Over the weekend Kim blasted South Korea for offering cooperation on ""inessential issues"" such as the coronavirus, humanitarian aid, and tourism.
Kim said inter-Korean relations could be restored if the South changes its attitudes and stops actions such as buying new weapons and conducting military drills with the United States.
In October, however, Kim said that he hoped the two Koreas could reconcile after the end of the pandemic.

246,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2021 11:46PM ET</span>",Mixed signals for N.Korean leader's sister as Kim seeks to cement power,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - The name of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister was missing from a new list of the ruling Workers' Party's politburo, according to state media on Monday, raising questions about her status after several years of increasing influence.
The party held elections on Sunday for its Central Committee at a congress, which maps out diplomatic, military and economic policy goals over the next five years. 
Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un's sister, remained a member of the Central Committee but was not included in its politburo, lists released by the North Korean state news agency, KCNA, showed.
In 2017, Kim became only the second woman in patriarchal North Korea to join the exclusive politburo after her aunt Kim Kyong Hui. South Korea's intelligence agency said in August she was serving as her brother's ""de facto second-in-command"".
But the signals were mixed for observers of the reclusive regime. Her absence from the politburo list comes days after she took the leadership podium for the first time alongside 38 other party executives as the congress began.
""It is too early to draw any conclusion about her status, as she is still a Central Committee member and there's a possibility that she has taken up other important posts,"" said Lim Eul-chul, a professor of North Korean studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul. 
Kim Yo Jong's influence has grown dramatically in recent years. 
As she emerged as a political figure, she appeared to be her brother's personal secretary. She later acted as his special envoy to South Korea and a deputy director of a party department overseeing personnel and organisational affairs.
Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the U.S.-based Stimson Center, said Kim Yo Jong enjoyed the highest degree of influence on policy deliberations and decisions regardless of whether she was on the politburo or not.
""We have become accustomed to seeing her in a more public role, but Kim Yo Jong's political roots and her formative career experience are behind the scenes, not sitting on a platform listening to speeches,"" he said.
'ONE-MAN RULE'
Leader Kim Jong Un cemented his power at the congress with his election as party general secretary, taking the title from his late father, Kim Jong Il.
Kim has wielded almost absolute power in North Korea's dynastic system since taking over following the death of his father in 2011. 
In 2012, the party named the late Kim Jong Il ""eternal general secretary"" and Kim Jong Un ""the first secretary"".
KCNA said the congress ""fully approved"" a proposal to promote Kim to the position, which it called ""the top brain of the revolution"" and ""the centre of the leadership and the unity"". 
""Kim's takeover shows his confidence, that he has now officially joined the ranks of his father and grandfather,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.
""It also indicates his strategic intention to centralise the party system around him and reinforce his one-man rule."" 
The reforms to the party leadership announced over the weekend may seem cosmetic to outside observers but they are arcane changes to how policies are decided and implemented, Madden said. 
""These changes are intended to give (Kim) a great degree of flexibility in how he makes decisions while also streamlining the processes through which decisions reach his desk,"" he said.
One figure who appeared to be rising quickly was Jo Yong Won, newly named to the politburo's five-strong presidium and the party's formidable Central Military Commission.
Choe Son Hui, a vice foreign minister who was instrumental in preparing for a second, failed summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019, was demoted.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in pledged efforts to help engineer a breakthrough in stalled denuclearisation talks as U.S. President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office.
Kim has said he would expand diplomacy, but vowed on Friday to develop weapons including a ""multi-warhead"" intercontinental ballistic missiles, calling the United States ""our biggest enemy"".

South Korea's military said it has detected signs North Korea held a military parade on Sunday night to mark the congress.

The move comes after Riyadh announced a breakthrough at a summit on Tuesday to end the bitter political row in which Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a diplomatic, trade and travel boycott on Qatar in mid-2017. 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have already announced reopening air, land and sea entry points to Qatar.
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister had said at the summit that the four states agreed to restore all ties with Qatar which were severed over accusations that Doha supports terrorism. Qatar denies this and says the embargo aimed to curb its sovereignty.
However a senior UAE official said last week that while trade and travel links could be resumed within a week, restoring diplomatic ties would take more time as parties rebuild trust.
In a sign of continued tension, Bahrain's foreign ministry earlier on Sunday said Qatar's coast guard arrested Bahraini bodybuilding champion Sami Al Haddad while on a fishing cruise and called on Doha ""to stop attacking Bahraini fishermen at sea and unfairly arresting them"".
The director of Bahrain's coast guard operations said in a separate statement that Haddad and another Bahraini were arrested on Friday over allegations of entering Qatari territorial waters in the third such incident since November.
There was no immediate comment from Qatari authorities.
In December, Qatar's interior ministry said its coastguard stopped a Bahraini cruiser catching fish in Qatari territorial waters and arrested three people.

The previous month, Bahrain's interior ministry accused Qatari coastguard vessels of violating regional and international agreements after they stopped two Bahraini boats inside Qatari waters.

The British-run region has struggled with persistently high coronavirus infection rates despite being in and out of some form of lockdown since October. Cases soared to by far their highest level since the pandemic began after the Christmas holidays.
The Western Health and Social Care Trust, one of the five regional groups that run Northern Ireland's hospitals, made the call to workers near the South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in the town Enniskillen, close to the border with Ireland.
""Attention all off-duty staff in the vicinity of SWAH. Due to increasing pressures this evening on the NI (Northern Irish) Healthcare System we are appealing to you to contact or go directly to the hospital. Thank You,"" the Trust said on Twitter.
Patients were being diverted to Enniskillen due to pressure on hospitals elsewhere, it added.
A Sinn Fein lawmaker, Liz Kimmins, whose party jointly leads the devolved regional government, also posted a message she said was sent to nurses at another hospital in the town of Craigavon calling on off duty staff to help on Sunday night.
Health Minister Robin Swann shared a statement from the chief executives of the hospital groups urging people to only go to emergency rooms if they need emergency care, and that patients will need to leave the hospital as soon as they are medically fit to do so.
That might mean families ""having to go the extra mile"" to provide temporary support for relatives, they said. They warned that those arriving by ambulance may have to wait hours before space is available in already stretched emergency departments.
The statement added that despite hospitals already being at 94% capacity, modelling projections indicate they will be contending with double the number of COVID-19 patients in the third week in January.
""Our health service is under pressure, like never before, please play your part, follow guidance, you know what to do!"" Swann said on Twitter.

The bloodshed began on Friday afternoon with an operation by two police units - the Special Action Forces, known as FAES, and the Special Tactical Operations Units, known as UOTE - in the gang-ridden neighborhood of La Vega. It continued into Saturday, activist Marino Alvarado wrote on Twitter.
""It is, as far as I recall, the 'citizen security' operation with the largest quantity of victims,"" said Alvarado, who is affiliated with the PROVEA rights group. 
There did not appear to be any police deaths from the confrontations, according to Alvarado, other activists and a report in Ultimas Noticias, a newspaper seen as close to the ruling socialist party. 
A United Nations fact-finding mission, which found that President Nicolas Maduro's government had committed systematic human rights violations amounting to crimes against humanity, last year called for FAES to be disbanded due to its role in extrajudicial killings.
Neither Venezuela's information ministry nor the chief prosecutor's office immediately replied to requests for comment on Sunday. The government has said the U.N. fact-finding mission's report was ""plagued with falsehoods."" 
Venezuela is among the world's most violent countries, with a murder rate of some 45.6 per 100,000 residents in 2020, according to the nonprofit Venezuelan Observatory of Violence.

South Korea's vice foreign minister, Choi Jong-kun, arrived in Tehran on Sunday to discuss the release of the South Korean-flagged MT Hankuk Chemi, which was seized by the Guards on Monday near the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
Iran has denied allegations that the seizure of the tanker and its 20-member crew amounted to hostage taking, and said it was Seoul that was holding Iran's funds ""hostage"".
Iran's deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told South Korea's Choi that Seoul ""should refrain from politicising the issue and fruitless propaganda and allow the legal proceedings to proceed"", Iran's state TV reported. 
Iran's government spokesman said on Tuesday the vessel was seized based on an Iranian court order for ""environmental pollution"".
However, the ship's Busan-based operator, Taikun Shipping Co. Ltd., told Reuters there was nothing to indicate before the seizure of the vessel that Iranian authorities were probing possible violations of environmental rules.
""For about two and a half years, South Korean banks have frozen Iran's funds ... it is not acceptable ... In our view, this is more because of Seoul's lack of political will (to resolve the issue) than the U.S. sanctions,"" the semi-official Fars news agency quoted Araqchi as saying. 
The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 after President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers. Under that deal, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear work in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
Iran has retaliated by bypassing the restrictions of the deal step by step. In a move that could complicate efforts by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal, Tehran said on Monday it had resumed 20% uranium enrichment at its underground Fordow nuclear facility.

Citing a brigadier-general from Ethiopia's National Defence Force, the state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation said that those captured included the region's former president Abay Weldu, who was also a former chairman of the region's ruling party. Those killed included the region's former deputy police commissioner, it said.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government declared victory in its conflict with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party that previously governed the province, on Nov. 28 after nearly a month of fighting.
Fugitive leaders of the TPLF had vowed to continue to fight from the mountains, but Reuters has been unable to contact them for weeks.
The latest announcement about those killed and captured comes after the military said on Friday that it had captured Sebhat Nega, a founding member of the TPLF. On Saturday, he was transported to the capital Addis Ababa, state TV reported. 
The captured former TPLF president, Abay, was president of the region from 2010 to 2018, replaced by the group's current leader, Debretsion Gebremichael. Abay was chairman of the party from 2012 to 2017, and was also succeeded by Debretsion in that position.
The whereabouts of Debretsion, other members of the party's central committee and many high-ranking former military officers remains unknown.
Air strikes and battles since early November in Tigray are believed to have killed thousands of people. Fighting is continuing in some parts and more than 2 million people need aid, the United Nations said this week.

""We cannot continue this vicious cycle of circular talks indefinitely,"" Sudanese irrigation minister Yasir Abbas said in a statement. 
However, Egypt and Ethopia, in separate statements, blamed Sudanese objections to the framework for the talks for the new impasse. 
Ethiopia sees the dam as key to plans to become Africa's largest power exporter. Egypt, which gets more than 90% of its scarce fresh water from the Nile, fears the dam could devastate its economy.
Sudan said on Sunday it was concerned the dam could overwhelm its nearby Roseires dam if an agreement is not reached that would allow the countries to share data.
Ethiopia said in a foreign ministry statement that despite previously insisting on meetings with the African Union experts, Sudan objected to their terms of reference and refused to include the experts in the meeting, effectively halting the talks.
The prolonged dispute between the three countries has continued even after the reservoir behind the $4 billion dam began filling in July.
""Sudan insisted on the assigning of African Union experts to offer solutions to contentious issues ... a proposal which Egypt and Ethiopia have reservations about,"" Egypt's foreign ministry said in a statement posted to social media.
In its own statement on state news agency SUNA, Sudan said it objected to what it said was a Jan. 8 letter from Ethiopia to the African Union stating that Ethiopia was determined to fill the reservoir for the second year in July with 13.5 million cubic meters of water, whether an agreement is reached or not.
In its own statement posted on the social media of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ethiopia said it ""took the initiative immediately to establish an effective and reciprocal data exchange mechanism.""

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greeks headed to beaches and public parks on Sunday as a rare January heat wave offered a respite from the coronavirus lockdown that has thrown life across Europe into disarray.
With temperatures in Athens set to reach 23 Celsius (73.4 Fahrenheit), people lounged on the sand, swam in the sea, and strolled on the promenade on the Athens coast, while police patrolled to control the crowds.
In the last 50 years, such high temperatures for January have been seen only twice: in 1987 and 2010, the National Observatory of Athens said.
""It is not normal. This time last year it was cold,"" said 65-year old Kyriakos Pitoulis. ""On the other hand, it helps because people are cooped up at home and they want to go somewhere to let off steam. They cannot stay home all the time.""
Greece has been in partial lockdown since early November with people forced to wear masks in public. On Friday authorities extended restrictions, including bans on public gatherings, until at least Jan. 18 as it strives to slow a spike in infections, mainly in the north.
Following one of the hottest years on record globally last year, hot air masses and dust arriving from the African continent smothered the central Athens skyline, with one temperature gauge on Sunday showing 31C in the sun.
That compared with average January temperatures for January across Greece ranging from below zero to 5C, or 10C at the most in coastal regions, the National Meteorological Service (EMY) said.
Meteorologists said the warm front, which came in on Saturday, is expected to recede in the next few days.

GAZA (Reuters) - The Palestinian Authority said on Sunday it expects to receive its first COVID-19 vaccine doses in March under a deal with drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), and accused Israel of shirking a duty to ensure vaccines are available in occupied territory.
While Israel has already become the world leader in vaccinations per capita, Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip have yet to secure their first supplies.
Yasser Bozyeh, the Palestinian general director of public health, told Reuters that in addition to reaching an agreement in principle with AstraZeneca, the Palestinians had also sought supplies from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Russia, which has developed the Sputnik V vaccine.
Supplies would also come through a World Health Organization vaccine programme for poor and middle income countries.
There was no immediate response from AstraZeneca to an emailed request from Reuters for comment.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement Israel had been ""ignoring its duties as an occupation power and committing racial discrimination against the Palestinian people, depriving them of their right to healthcare."" 
""The search by the Palestinian leadership to secure the vaccines from various sources doesn't exempt Israel from its responsibilities towards the Palestinian people in providing the vaccines,"" it said.
Under interim peace accords with Israel, the Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank. Hamas Islamists run the Gaza Strip.
Israel's vaccination programme covers the country's Arab citizens and Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem.
On the West Bank, it has given vaccines to Israeli settlers, but not to Palestinian residents, who receive health services from the Palestinian Authority.
Human rights groups including Amnesty International say Israel has a legal obligation to provide vaccines for Palestinians under occupation. Israeli officials say they could share vaccines with the Palestinians once Israel's own needs are met.

A WHO official said on Sunday the organisation had held ""informal discussions"" with Israel over allocating some supplies to the Palestinians to inoculate health workers. The official, Gerald Rockenschaub, head of the WHO office in the Palestinian territories, said Israel indicated it would explore the option.

Dozens of armed groups operate in eastern Congo, many remnants of militias that fought in civil wars around the turn of the century that resulted in millions of deaths from conflict, hunger and disease. 
Virunga sits on the forest-covered volcanoes of central Africa and is home to over half the global population of mountain gorillas.

Father Francesco Patton, the custodian of the Holy Land for the Roman Catholic church, led Franciscan friars towards a shrine in what was once a war zone between Israel and Jordan.
Although the two countries have been at peace since 1994, seven churches laid abandoned for more than 50 years in the area of de-mining operations. The area lies about a kilometre from the Qasr al-Yahud baptism site in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which is a major draw for Christian pilgrims.
""Today, we are back to pray,"" Father Ibrahim Faltas, one of the clergymen at the ceremony, said. Attendance at the procession, which commemorates the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist, was capped at 50 due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
Israeli de-mining efforts began in 2018 and included support from the Halo Trust, a Scottish-based mine clearance group, an Israeli official said. 
As of 2021, ""the danger has been completely removed,"" a branch of Israel's defence ministry said.
After visiting the shrine, the friars passed fading signs reading ""DANGER - MINES!"" in English, Arabic and Hebrew as they went down to the river to pray.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top diplomat said on Sunday that last week's siege of the U.S. Capitol exposed the dangers of allowing the degradation of democratic values to go unchecked and disinformation to spread on social media.
""What we saw on Wednesday was only the climax of very worrying developments happening globally in recent years. It must be a wake-up call for all democracy advocates,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a blog post.
""Everybody needs to understand that if we accept setbacks after setbacks, even if they seem minor, democracy and its values and institutions can eventually and irreversibly perish,"" said Borrell, who speaks on behalf of the 27 EU member states. 
President Donald Trump is facing a renewed drive by Democrats to remove him from office after he incited supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol, based on the unsubstantiated claim that he lost the Nov. 3 election due to widespread voter fraud.
The resulting assault by rioters left five people dead.
""In case anyone had any doubts, the events in Washington also show that disinformation constitutes a real threat for democracies,"" Borrell said. ""If some people believe that an election was fraudulent, because their leader has been once and again telling them, they will behave accordingly.""
Borrell called for better regulation on social networks, and said this could not be carried out by the companies themselves. 
Twitter permanently cut off Trump's personal account and access to his nearly 90 million followers late on Friday, citing the risk of further incitement of violence. Trump has repeatedly used Twitter and other platforms to claim the election result was fraudulent and to share other conspiracy theories.

The EU's executive Commission last month proposed rules to clamp down on fake news on social media. These would force large online platforms to tackle illegal content and intentional manipulation of platforms to influence elections and public health, or face fines up to 6% of global turnover.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A new draft constitution for Belarus, which President Alexander Lukashenko has touted as a solution to a political crisis but the opposition rejects as a sham, will be drawn up this year, Lukashenko said in an interview to be broadcast on Sunday.
Belarus has seen protests since an Aug. 9 presidential election which Lukashenko says he won but the opposition says was stolen. Thousands of protesters have been rounded up and nearly all opposition political figures have been driven into exile or jailed.
Though demonstrations have ebbed over the past five months, social media videos showed hundreds of protesters on Sunday carrying red and white opposition flags at small rallies in Minsk, chanting for Lukashenko to resign. 
From early in the crisis, Lukashenko has promised unspecified constitutional reforms. At one point he even suggested he would step down once a new constitution is adopted. The opposition has consistently rejected the proposal as a stunt to keep him in power.
In excerpts from an interview with Russian television taped in December but not previously broadcast, RIA news agency quoted Lukashenko as saying he believed the new draft constitution would be finished by the end of 2021.
""And then the people will determine at a referendum if there should be a new constitution or not,"" he said. It was his firmest statement so far about the timing of the reform.
The date of the referendum would be announced when parliament convenes on Feb. 11-12, he was quoted as saying.
Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said a new election should be held this year, and a new constitution drawn up with no input from Lukashenko. 
""A person who has lowered themselves to using terror against Belarusians has nothing to do with the main law of the country,"" she said in a social media statement. ""He will continue to promote his manipulative (plan) to deceive us once again and to buy time for himself.""

Israelis over the age of 60, those with health problems and medical personnel have been receiving first injections of  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) vaccines since Dec 19. As three weeks have passed, they are beginning to be due for follow-up, final doses. 
""It changes everything,"" said Guy Choshen, a director of the COVID-19 ward at Tel Aviv's Ichilov Hospital, who got his second injection. ""I'm really happy that I'm over that (and) looking forward for all this epidemic to be finished.""
The Health Ministry said 19.5% of the population have been vaccinated, including more than 72% of the over-60s. Latecomer elderly will be admitted for first shots, officials say, but otherwise vaccines will be reserved for boosters.
By mid-March roughly 5 million of the country's 9 million citizens are expected to receive the vaccine. 
Israel's vaccination rate is by far the fastest compared to the rest of the world, according to the Our World in Data website, which is run by research organisation Oxford Martin School.
In second place is the United Arab Emirates, which as of Sunday had inoculated 10% of its population, followed by Bahrain and the United States at 5% and 2%, respectively.
At Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu watched as crates of Pfizer vaccines were unloaded from a plane that arrived from Belgium. One official said the shipment contained 700,000-800,000 doses.
Netanyahu, who is up for re-election in March, said another large consignment would arrive a week later and that in the meantime Israel would accelerate its vaccination rate to 170,000 a day from the current 150,000.
He says the vaccination campaign will allow Israel to emerge from the pandemic in February.

Israel has in parallel tightened a lockdown to rein in a surge in coronavirus cases. Officials say public over-confidence in the vaccines may have led to laxity in other precautions and stoked fresh contagions.

Politicians have been at loggerheads over the shape of a new administration since the last one quit in the aftermath of the Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion, leaving Lebanon rudderless as it sinks deeper into economic crisis.
Veteran Sunni Muslim politician Hariri was named premier for a fourth time in October promising to form a cabinet of specialists to enact reforms necessary to unlock foreign aid.
But Gebran Bassil, leader of the Free Patriotic Movement, the biggest Christian bloc, and son-in-law of President Michel Aoun, said in a televised speech his movement would not join the cabinet as long as Hariri insisted on choosing all ministers.
""We don't entrust Hariri alone with reform in Lebanon,"" Bassil said. ""In short we don't want to take part in this government.""
After Bassil's speech, Hariri's Future party said it did not want to be dragged into political bickering and that the government line-up was ready and waiting to shoulder its duties. 
""It will be a government that will take up the necessary reforms according to the French initiative and not according to sectarian and racist 'Bassil-like' considerations,"" a statement by the party said. 
Lebanon's governing system requires officials to be chosen from across the religious spectrum, typically giving sectarian parties an effective veto over forming a cabinet.
Bassil was placed under sanctions in November by the United States over corruption allegations, which he denies, and ties with the Iran-backed Shi'ite Muslim paramilitary group Hezbollah, Lebanon's most powerful party.
He said Hariri did not appear to be serious about forming a government: ""Every time he meets the president he takes a different line-up with him,"" Bassil said. ""Someone who does that is serious and wants to form a government? Or is wasting time?"" 

Lebanon is grappling with a deep economic and financial crisis, its worst since the 1975-1990 civil war, that has hammered the currency, spread poverty and prompted a sovereign debt default.

KABUL/HERAT (Reuters) - The Afghan government is investigating an air strike by its military in the southern province of Nimroz that local officials say resulted in the deaths of 14 civilians, as local residents brought their bodies to the provincial capital in protest.
Government officials confirmed the Saturday night strike, but said on Sunday that initial information showed the deaths were all of Taliban insurgents fighting Afghan security forces.
The clashes came just as representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban kicked off the second round of peace talks in the Qatari capital Doha on Saturday.
""An air strike in Khashrod district has resulted in heavy casualties for the Taliban, and investigations into allegations that civilians have been killed are ongoing,"" the Afghan Ministry of Defence said in a statement on Sunday.
A local government official told Reuters, on condition of anonymity, that the Afghan air force targeted a residential house where it suspected Taliban were present.
The official said the 14 killed were all from one family.
Local residents told Reuters by phone that people from the area where the strike took place had brought the bodies to the centre of Nimroz's capital, Zaranj, to prove that the deceased were not Taliban fighters. 
Taliban spokesman Qari Muhammad Yousuf Ahmadi also denied those killed were its own combatants, saying they were civilians, all members of one family, and included women and children.
Continued violence has hastened international calls for a ceasefire between the Afghan government and the Taliban, whose representatives met on Saturday for a first session in a second round of peace talks, where contentious issues such as a ceasefire and power-sharing are expected to be discussed. 
Both sides, in separate statements on Saturday, said they discussed the agenda and that the meeting took place in a positive and amicable atmosphere.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged Americans on Sunday to shun violence, seek reconciliation and protect democratic values, following the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol building by supporters of President Donald Trump that left five people dead.
""I repeat that violence is self-destructive, always. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,"" the pope said in his Sunday address.
It was the second time in as many days that the pope, who visited the United States in 2015 when Barrack Obama was president, spoke out on the violence in the Washington, D.C.
Dozens of people have been charged following the storming of the Capitol on Wednesday, with the FBI asking the public to help identify participants, given the proliferation of images of the riots on the internet. The five people who died included a police officer.
""I appeal to the authorities of the country and to the entire population to maintain a lofty sense of responsibility in order to calm things down, promote national reconciliation and protect democratic values that are rooted in American society,"" Francis said.
He said he wanted to send ""an affectionate greeting"" to all Americans whose country had been ""shaken by the recent siege on Congress"".
Francis also said he was praying for those who died and that all Americans would ""keep alive a culture of encounter, a culture of caring, as the master way to build together the common good"".
In advance excerpts on Saturday of a television interview to be aired on Sunday night, Francis said it was important to understand what had gone wrong and to learn from it.
""(Fringe) groups that are not well inserted into society sooner or later will commit this sort of violence,"" he said in the television interview.

Francis has had a rocky relationship with Trump, who visited the Vatican in 2017, disagreeing with him on a spate of issues, including immigration and climate change.

In the Madrid area, rescuers reached 1,500 people trapped in cars, while police broke up a large snowball fight after authorities appealed for citizens to stay at home for risk of accidents or spreading coronavirus. 
Forecasters warned of dangerous conditions in the coming days, with temperatures expected to fall to up to minus 10 Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) next week and the prospect of snow turning to ice and damaged trees falling.
In Madrid, police cordoned off buildings with heavy loads of snow on the roof in case of accidents, but residents took to the streets in droves to enjoy the rare sight of their city blanketed in white. 
About 100 workers and shoppers have spent two nights sleeping at a shopping centre in Majahaonda, a town north of Madrid, after they were trapped by the blizzard on Friday. 
""There are people sleeping on the ground on cardboard,"" Ivan Alcala, a restaurant worker, told TVE television.
Madrid's international airport suspended flights until Sunday night. 
About 20,000 km of roads across central Spain were affected by the storm and the government would send convoys transporting the vaccine and food supplies to those in need, transport minister Jose Luis Abalos said on Saturday.
One man and a woman in a car drowned after a river burst near Malaga in the south, while two homeless people froze to death in Madrid and Calatayud in the east, officials said.

The State Metereological Agency (Aemet) said up to 20-30 cm (7-8 inches) of snow fell in Madrid on Saturday, the most since 1971.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Scarce doses and empty vaccination centres: Germany's vaccine rollout headache,"By Caroline Copley and Annkathrin Weis
BERLIN/DILLENBURG, Germany (Reuters) - Proud of their national reputation for efficiency, Germans are growing increasingly frustrated by the slow rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine its scientists helped develop.
Scarce vaccine supply, cumbersome paperwork, a lack of healthcare staff and an aged and immobile population are hampering efforts to get early doses of a vaccine made by U.S.-based  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech into the arms of the people.
Germany has set up hundreds of vaccination centres in sports halls and concert arenas and has the infrastructure to administer up to 300,000 shots a day, Health Minister Jens Spahn said.
But the majority are standing empty, with most states not planning to open centres until mid-January as they prioritise sending mobile teams into care homes.
A day spent with a vaccination team in the small town of Dillenburg, 100 km (60 miles) to the north of Germany's financial capital Frankfurt, shows just how painstaking the task is.
The team starts out by loading a cool-box containing 84 doses of the Pfizer vaccine defrosted overnight into a waiting ambulance, and setting out for the Elisabeth residential care home.
There they are met by manager Peter Bittermann, who has already dealt with the forms needed to vaccinate residents and staff, and provided space for the shots to be administered and recipients monitored post-vaccination.
The four-member immunisation team, plus two trainees, has just a few hours to dispense the temperature-sensitive Pfizer vaccine before it is no longer fit for use.
The German Red Cross needs an extra 350 people to run its local vaccination campaign, said Nicole Fey, spokeswoman of the local district administration. 
""We've been able to recruit some, but there can never be enough,"" she told Reuters TV.
GERMANY LAGS
In the first two weeks of its vaccination drive Germany has given 533,000 shots, just two-fifths of the 1.3 million doses received. Britain, by contrast, has reached the 2 million mark.
Israel, the world leader in terms of the share of population covered, is inoculating 150,000 people daily, with its universal and digitally enabled healthcare system making it easier to schedule appointments.
Germany's larger size and federal set-up are complicating operations, a problem also faced in the United States.
Elsewhere in Europe, the decentralisation of Spain's vaccination operation has exposed differences between regions and led to tensions with the central government.
(Graphic - COVID-19 vaccine doses administered: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/xegpbbernpq/chart.png) 
Germany's 16 states blame the federal government for not securing enough doses. Doctors in some centres say shifts have been cancelled. In Berlin, one vaccination centre was opened, only to be closed over New Year due to a lack of shots.
Spahn says manufacturing problems rather than too few orders are to blame for the limited supply, after Pfizer and BioNTech in December halved their production forecast to 50 million doses by year-end. Each recipient requires two shots.. 
The government is working with BioNTech to open a new production site in the western town of Marburg, he said. BioNTech's chief executive said last week the Marburg plant may enter service in February, ahead of schedule.
""With the capacity we have already created in Germany, we will be able to carry out between 250,000 and 300,000 vaccinations per day - when we have the vaccine doses,"" Spahn said this week.
Germany expects to receive 5.3 million shots from Pfizer/BioNTech by mid-February and another 2 million doses of a second vaccine from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), just approved by the European Union, by the end of March.
Yet this will barely be enough to cover the 5.7 million people, or 6.8% of the population, aged over 80.
THE LAST MILE
As in Spain, state-by-state performance in Germany varies widely. Top of the class is Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in the north, with 15.6 vaccinations per 1,000 residents, while Saxony has a rate of just 4.4.
In Thuringia, another laggard, state premier Bodo Ramelow said on Tuesday that many doses sent to hospitals had been returned. ""If the brakes come on at a vaccination rate of 30 or 33%, we have a real problem,"" he told Deutschlandfunk radio.
In Saxony, the social affairs ministry said missing consent forms, challenges with route planning, COVID outbreaks in homes and last-minute cancellations had slowed its rollout.
Shots in Saxony were stored centrally until recently, meaning mobile teams had to drive long distances before heading to care homes.
In contrast to Dillenburg, Saxony has been overrun by people volunteering for its vaccination drive, said Lars Werthmann, regional logistics chief at the German Red Cross.
""The next mammoth task is to coordinate all these people,” Werthmann said.
Doctors meanwhile express frustration at appointment booking systems that vary from state to state, saying they cause confusion and erode trust.
To speed up the rollout of COVID-19 shots, Germany should distribute them through its network of family doctors' practices as soon as there is a vaccine that can be easily stored in a fridge, said Berlin paediatrician Burkhard Ruppert.
Germany is hoping to administer shots at doctors’ practices in a second phase.
""Our strength in Germany is this outpatient care system,"" said Ruppert, who heads a local doctors' association. ""We're not a country of large-scale managed systems like the United Kingdom or Israel might be.""
""We are in a race against a virus,"" he added. ""We will only win if we vaccinate as much and as fast as possible.""

269,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2021 06:21AM ET</span>",Sriwijaya Air crash places Indonesia's aviation safety under fresh spotlight,"By Jamie Freed and Stanley Widianto
SYDNEY/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's chequered air safety record is again in the spotlight after a Sriwijaya Air jet carrying 62 people crashed into the Java Sea minutes after take-off on Saturday, marking the country's third major airline crash in just over six years.
Before the crash there had been 697 fatalities in Indonesia over the last decade including military and private planes, making it the deadliest aviation market in the world - ahead of Russia, Iran and Pakistan - according to Aviation Safety Network's database.
The Sriwijaya crash of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-500 follows the loss of a Lion Air 737 MAX in October 2018 that contributed to a global grounding of the model and the crash of an AirAsia Indonesia Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY) A320 in December 2014.
The Lion Air crash, which killed 189 people, was an outlier in that it mainly revealed fundamental issues with the plane model and triggered a worldwide safety crisis for Boeing. Even excluding the deaths from that crash, Indonesia would rank above Russia if there are no survivors from Saturday's crash.
Indonesia, an archipelago of thousands of islands, is highly dependent on air travel and its safety issues illustrate the challenge relatively new carriers face as they try to keep pace with unstoppable demand for air travel in developing nations while striving for standards that mature markets took decades to reach.
From 2007 to 2018, the European Union banned Indonesian airlines following a series of crashes and reports of deteriorating oversight and maintenance. The United States lowered its Indonesia safety evaluation to Category 2, meaning its regulatory system was inadequate, between 2007 and 2016.
Indonesia's air safety record has improved in recent years, receiving a favourable evaluation by the United Nations aviation agency in 2018. But in a country with a large death toll from vehicle and ferry accidents, the safety culture is battling against a mindset that makes it inevitable for some crashes to occur, experts said.
Saturday's ""crash has nothing to do with the MAX, but Boeing would do well to guide Indonesia - which has a chequered air safety record - to restore confidence in its aviation industry,"" said Shukor Yusof, the head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics.
Authorities located the Sriwijaya jet's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder on Sunday but experts said it was too early to determine the factors responsible for the crash of the nearly 27-year-old plane.
The flight took off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, the same airport from which the Lion Air jet took off and soon crashed into the sea. The Sriwijaya jet climbed to 10,900 feet within four minutes but then began a steep descent and stopped transmitting data 21 seconds later, according to tracking website FlightRadar24.
""There has been a lot of noise made about the speed of its final descent,"" said Geoff Dell, an air accident investigation expert based in Australia. ""It is indicative of what happened but why it happened is still in many ways a guess really. There are multiple ways you can get an aeroplane to go down at that pace.""
He said investigators would look into factors including mechanical failure, pilot actions, maintenance records, weather conditions and whether there was any unlawful interference with the plane. Most air accidents are caused by a combination of factors that can take months to establish.
VARIOUS FACTORS UNDER SCRUTINY
Sriwijaya's operating record will also be placed under scrutiny.
""Its safety record has been mixed,"" said Greg Waldron, Asia managing editor at industry publication FlightGlobal. He said the airline had written off three 737s between 2008 and 2012 due to bad landings that resulted in runway overruns, with the 2008 accident resulting in one death and 14 injuries.
The airline in late 2019 ended a year-long partnership with national carrier Garuda Indonesia and had been operating independently. 
Just before ending the pact, more than half of Sriwijaya's fleet had been grounded by the Transportation Ministry due to airworthiness concerns, according to media reports at the time.
Sriwijaya did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The airline's chief executive said on Saturday the plane that crashed was in good condition.
Like other Indonesian carriers, Sriwijaya had slashed its flight schedule during the COVID-19 pandemic, which experts said will be examined as part of the investigation.

""The challenges that the pandemic brings impacts aviation safety,"" said Chappy Hakim, an Indonesian aviation analyst and former air force official. ""For instance, pilots/technicians were downsized, salaries not paid in full, planes are grounded.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Men wearing traditional loin clothes and women dressed in white robes clapped and chanted before going into an ice water bath during a Shinto ritual at a Tokyo shrine on Sunday to purify the soul and pray for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Only a dozen people took part in the annual event at Teppou-zu Inari Shrine, scaled down this year due to the health crisis, compared to over a hundred in early 2020. Spectators were not allowed at the event.
After doing warming-up exercises and chanting under a clear sky with outside temperatures at 5.1 degree Celsius (41.18 Fahrenheit), the nine male and three female participants went into a bath filled with cold water and large ice blocks.    ""I prayed that the coronavirus comes to an end as soon as possible,"" said 65-year-old participant Shinji Ooi, who heads the Shrine's 'Yayoikai' parishioner group, after the ritual.
Japan has struggled to contain a recent surge in coronavirus infections, with Tokyo reporting 1,494 new cases on Sunday. The government declared a limited state of emergency for Tokyo and three neighbouring prefectures on Thursday, covering about 30% of the country's population, in a bid to stem the spread.
Fewer participants at the Shinto ritual made the water extra cold, participant Naoaki Yamaguchi told Reuters.
""Normally we have more participants and it makes the water temperature a little bit warmer. But this year, there were just twelve people, so it (the cold) was crazy,"" the 47-year-old said.

The shrine added the theme of ""warding off epidemics"" to the annual event, which is held on the second Sunday of each year and is now in its 66th year.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2021 03:22AM ET</span>",Nationalist politician likely to win Kyrgyz presidential vote,"BISHKEK (Reuters) - Nationalist politician Sadyr Japarov appears poised to win Kyrgyzstan's presidential election on Sunday, a snap vote triggered by the collapse of the previous government in the Central Asian nation closely allied with Russia.
Violent protests which erupted last October sprung Japarov, 52, from a prison cell to the prime minister's chair and culminated in him assuming the interim presidency, although he later gave it up to run for a full-time role.
Japarov, who had been sentenced to a lengthy prison term for kidnapping a provincial governor as part of a protest, had his verdict quashed amid the October unrest and has outspent his 16 competitors by a wide margin during the campaign.
Despite his nationalist stance - Japarov's first act as prime minister was to add ethnicity information to national ID cards - he has repeatedly pledged to maintain a close relationship with former Soviet overlord Moscow.
""Russia is our strategic partner,"" Japarov said after casting his ballot in a suburb of capital Bishkek.
Russia operates a military airbase in the mountainous nation and is also the main destination for hundreds of thousands of Kyrgyz migrant labourers.
Neighbouring China is another key trade partner and investor in the impoverished and predominantly Muslim nation which, in addition to electing a president, votes on Sunday on whether to give greater presidential powers at parliament's expense.
Japarov's prison sentence stems from his campaign in the early 2010s to nationalise the giant Kumtor gold mine operated by Canada's Centerra Gold. After coming to power last year, however, he said that was no longer a goal and he would only seek to ensure profits from the mine are split fairly.
Japarov's campaign which combined references to traditional symbols and values with promises such as doubling healthcare spending appears to have struck a chord with voters across the country, especially in rural areas.
According to local pollsters, he enjoys a comfortable lead over competitors and could potentially win more than 50% of the vote, thus avoiding a runoff.
At the polling station, Japarov declined to speculate about the outcome of the vote, but urged all groups to accept it in order to preserve stability.
Kyrgyzstan has a history of political volatility. Before toppling the government of President Sooronbai Jeenbekov last October, similar violent protests deposed presidents in 2010 and 2005. Another former head of state, Almazbek Atambayev, is under arrest on corruption charges.

""I voted against everyone because it makes no difference for ordinary people who is in charge, everyone lies to us,"" said Bakyt, a 52-year-old power engineer who only gave his first name.

The website, HKChronicles, said it began receiving reports from Hong Kong-based users saying they could no longer access the site since Wednesday evening. 
""After discussing and investigating with our supporters, we found that some ISPs of Hong Kong have deliberately dropped any connection to our servers, so that the user could not receive replies from our servers, resulting in an inability to access our content,"" chief editor Naomi Chan said in a statement.
The South China Morning Post, citing unnamed sources, said on Sunday that Hong Kong police had invoked the city's national security law for the first time to block HKChronicles.
The police force had started asking ISPs to halt access, citing Article 43 of the law, the newspaper reported. 
The Hong Kong police said they could not comment on individual cases. The city’s government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Under the controversial legislation imposed on the Chinese-ruled city in June, the police can request service providers to restrict access to electronic platforms or messages that could pose a threat to national security. 
HKChronicles said that based on reports from users, the ISPs suspected of being involved in the blocking included Smartone, China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) Hong Kong, PCCW ""and others"". It did not elaborate. 
China Mobile, Smartone, and PCCW did not respond to requests for comment. 
The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.
The Hong Kong and Beijing governments say it is vital to plug holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub in 2019.
Hong Kong police arrested 53 people in dawn raids on democracy activists on Wednesday, in the biggest crackdown since China imposed the security law. The arrests have raised alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn.

""I think right now many users are being affected, but few websites are being affected. It seems like it's a technology test, to test the influence of blocking websites to the entire Hong Kong network,"" Chan told Reuters via the social media platform Telegram.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday said he was lifting restrictions on contacts between U.S. officials and their Taiwanese counterparts, a move likely to anger China and increase tensions between Beijing and Washington in the waning days of President Donald Trump's presidency. 
China claims democratic and separately ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and regularly describes Taiwan as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States.
While the United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, the Trump administration has ramped up backing for the island country, with arms sales and laws to help Taiwan deal with pressure from China.
In a statement, Pompeo said that for several decades the State Department had created complex internal restrictions on interactions with Taiwanese counterparts by American diplomats, service members and other officials. 
""The United States government took these actions unilaterally, in an attempt to appease the Communist regime in Beijing,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
""Today I am announcing that I am lifting all of these self-imposed restrictions,"" he added.
The move appeared to be another part of an effort by Pompeo and Trump's Republican administration to lock in a tough approach to China before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said examples of the restrictions included Taiwanese officials not being able to enter the State Department, but instead having to meet at hotels. 
""The Biden administration will rightly be unhappy that a policy decision like this was made in the final days of the Trump administration,"" Glaser said. 
An official with Biden's transition said that once Biden was in office he would continue to support ""a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan.""
""DECADE OF DISCRIMINATION, REMOVED""
Taiwan's government welcomed the move.
""Decades of discrimination, removed. A huge day in our bilateral relationship. I will cherish every opportunity,"" Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan's de facto ambassador in Washington, tweeted.
A senior Taiwanese official familiar with the island's security planning told Reuters this was the largest adjustment by the United States in its policy toward the island in recent years, saying both main U.S. political parties have always strongly supported exchanges between the United States and Taiwan.
""It reflects the current situation of closer cooperation between the United States and Taiwan on regional and global issues,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Pompeo, who has taken an increasingly hard-line stance toward China and identified it as the principal long-term threat faced by the United States, has repeatedly used the red-button Taiwan issue to push back against Beijing.
In November, he appeared to call into question the long-standing U.S. ""one-China policy"" by stating in a radio interview that Taiwan ""has not been a part of China,"" causing Beijing to warn that behavior that undermined ""China's core interests and interferes with China's domestic affairs will be met with a resolute counterattack.""
The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, will visit Taiwan next week for meetings with senior Taiwanese leaders, prompting China to warn on Thursday they were playing with fire.
Chinese fighter jets approached the island in August and September during the last two visits: by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach, respectively.
The United States is Taiwan's strongest international backer and arms supplier, and is obliged to help provide it with the means to defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.

""The United States government maintains relationships with unofficial partners around the world, and Taiwan is no exception. ... Today’s statement recognizes that the U.S.-Taiwan relationship need not, and should not, be shackled by self-imposed restrictions of our permanent bureaucracy,"" Pompeo said.

TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - Guatemalan and Honduran soldiers will be deployed to prevent new U.S.-bound migrant caravans from advancing, military officials said, amid growing desperation among those seeking to cross and signs that some groups will depart later this month. 
Two devastating hurricanes late last year along with severe economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic have pushed millions of people in the already-poor region closer to hunger, leading to a steady rise in U.S.-bound migration through Mexico.
In the Mexican border town of Tapachula, which sits just north of Guatemala, frustrated groups of migrants who had already succeeded in crossing the border pleaded with officials to provide them with humanitarian visas to let them cross.
""We just want them to give us an answer,"" shouted one distraught migrant, Suset Palmares, a Cuban who wore a face mask like most others around her.
Mexican soldiers decked out in riot gear stood nearby as migration officials with bullhorns ordered migrants gathered on a street and blocking traffic to disperse. 
In online forums, many Honduras have indicated they plan to leave next weekend in a new caravan, which has caught the attention of U.S. officials who have called on the region's governments to stop them. Many migrants in recent years have chosen to travel by caravan because being part of a large group offers protection from criminals who might prey on them, even though traveling alone is often faster.
Guatemalan military spokesman Ruben Tellez said on Friday that up to 4,000 soldiers would be deployed to stop the migrants from entering en masse.
""We are going to reinforce our borders,"" he said, referring to the country's land-crossings with Honduras, El Salvador, Belize and Mexico. He said the Guatemalan air force will also take part in the anti-caravan efforts.
General Tito Livio Moreno, Honduras' senior military officer, said earlier this week that soldiers would also be deployed in his country in a bid to preemptively stop any caravans. 
Beyond the security measures, Guatemala's migration authority announced on Friday that it would allow only Hondurans carrying a valid passport and proof of a negative coronavirus test to enter.
In the past, similar efforts have proved successful in stopping would-be migrants, but they have raised concerns from rights groups of unreasonable limitations on freedom of movement being slapped on desperate people seeking to flee rampant violence and poverty in their home countries.
Last year, Mexico authorized its military-style National Guard police force to ""regulate"" undocumented migration on its northern and southern borders under intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who now has less than two weeks left in office.

President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, handpicked by Nazarbayev as his successor in 2019, is also a senior member of the Nur Otan political party which controls 84 of 107 seats in Kazakhstan's lower house.
None of the party's four competitors in the race has openly criticised Nazarbayev or Tokayev, focusing their fire on lower-level officials and their policies instead.
The Nationwide Social Democratic Party, the main opposition party in the oil-rich Central Asian nation, is boycotting the vote. Another opposition party has failed to secure official registration ahead of the vote.
The absence of competition will dampen hopes of political reform encouraged by Kazakhstan's Western partners. But it will help to ensure stability which has helped the country of 19 million attract hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign investment, primarily into the oil, gas and mining sectors.
Also, in an attempt to modernise the system without relinquishing his party's tight grip on power, Tokayev has overseen the introduction of quotas for women and under-29s in political parties' candidate lists.
One notable female candidate running on the Nur Otan ticket is Dariga Nazarbayeva, the former president's eldest daughter who vanished from politics and public view last May when Tokayev removed her from the post of upper house speaker.

Nazarbayeva's return to politics has revived speculation that she might eventually run for presidency. Despite stepping down nearly two years ago, her 80-year-old father remains hugely influential. In addition to leading the ruling party, he chairs the powerful national security council.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A Sriwijaya Air plane crashed into the sea on Saturday minutes after taking off from Indonesia's capital Jakarta on a domestic flight with 62 people on board, and their fate was not known.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-500, en route to Pontianak in West Kalimantan, disappeared from radar screens after taking off just after 2.30 p.m. (0730 GMT) - 30 minutes after the scheduled time because of heavy rain.
Indonesian Transport Minister Budi Karya told a news conference that 62 people had been aboard Flight SJ 182, including 12 crew. The detik.com website quoted him as saying the plane crashed near Laki Island, some 20 km (12 miles) from the airport.
Rescue agency Basarnas said in a statement it would send a team to the Thousand Islands area to help in the search for victims ""after the crash of Sriwijaya Air SJ 182"".
(Map showing flight path: https://graphics.reuters.com/INDONESIA-CRASH/PONTIANAK/jznpnqwqwvl/INDONESIA-CRASH-PONTIANAK.jpg)
All those on board were Indonesian, Indonesia's transport safety committee said.
Indonesia's Navy had pinpointed the site of the missing aircraft and ships had been sent there, a Navy official said. Authorities did not say whether they believed there were survivors.
Indonesian airline Sriwijaya Air's chief executive, Jefferson Irwin Jauwena, told a news conference that the plane had been in good condition before the flight.
The nearly 27-year-old Boeing 737-500 was much older than Boeing's problem-plagued 737 MAX model, one of which crashed off Jakarta in late 2018, killing all 189 people aboard the Lion Air flight. Older 737 models are widely flown and do not have the system implicated in the MAX safety crisis.
A Boeing spokeswoman said, ""We are aware of media reports from Jakarta, and are closely monitoring the situation. We are working to gather more information"".
Reliable tracking service Flightradar24 said the Boeing jet took off at 2:36 p.m. local time (0736 GMT) and climbed to reach 10,900 feet within four minutes. It then began a steep descent and stopped transmitting data 21 seconds later.
A transport ministry spokeswoman said air traffic control at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport had asked the pilot why the plane was heading northwest instead of on its expected flight path just seconds before it disappeared.
There were no immediate clues on what may have caused the sudden descent and safety experts stress most air accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors that can take months to establish.
DISTRAUGHT RELATIVES
Indonesian television channels showed pictures of suspected wreckage.
""We found some cables, a piece of jeans, and pieces of metal on the water,"" Zulkifli, a security official, told CNNIndonesia.com.
Distraught relatives waited at Pontianak, around 740 km (460 miles) from Jakarta.
Yaman Zai, a father of three children who were aboard the plane with their mother, said that he was at the airport in Pontianak waiting for them, when he heard the news.
""I will never meet her again,"" he said, holding up a photo of his oldest daughter. 
Indonesia's KNKT safety agency was expected to launch an immediate investigation. The U.S. National Safety Transportation Board will automatically be part of the probe, since the plane was designed and built in the United States. 
Founded in 2003, Jakarta-based Sriwijaya Air group flies largely within Indonesia. The airline has a solid safety record until now, with no onboard casualties in four incidents recorded on the Aviation Safety Network database.
INDONESIA'S PATCHY SAFETY RECORD
The Boeing 737 is the world's most-sold family of aircraft and has undergone several makeovers since it entered service in 1968.
The 737-500 is two generations of development before the most recent 737 MAX, which has been embroiled in a worldwide safety crisis following crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. It does not use the software system implicated in those crashes.
Nonetheless, experts say planes such as Sriwijaya's leased 737-500 are being phased out for newer fuel-saving models. Civil jets typically have an economic life of 25 years, meaning they become too expensive to keep flying beyond that compared to younger models, but they are built to last longer.
Indonesia itself has a patchy air safety record.
In 2007, the European Union banned all Indonesian airlines following a series of crashes and reports of deteriorating oversight and maintenance since deregulation in the late 1990s. The restrictions were fully lifted in 2018.
Between 2007 and 2016, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration lowered its Indonesia safety evaluation to Category 2, meaning its regulatory system was inadequate.
Indonesian officials say they have worked hard to bring safety up to international standards.

Washington imposed sanctions on Friday on Faleh al-Fayyad, head of Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF).
The U.S. Treasury accused him of leading militia that killed hundreds of protesters with live ammunition during a crackdown on anti-government demonstrations in 2019. It said he had coordinated with Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
""We confirm that the decision was an unacceptable surprise,"" the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a statement, adding that ""it will carefully follow up with the current and the new administration in Washington on all decisions issued by the U.S. Treasury Department against Iraqis.""
Iraq is a close military ally of both the United States and Iran, which have battled for influence there since a U.S.-led invasion in 2003 toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.
Both countries supplied military support to Baghdad to fight against Islamic State forces from 2014-2017. The United States still has thousands of troops in Iraq, while Iran still supports the PMF.
The United States killed Fayyad's predecessor as PMF leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a year ago in a drone strike at Baghdad airport, along with Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general leading operations among Tehran's allies in the region.
The PMF congratulated Fayyad for his blacklisting in a statement late on Friday, saying that he had joined ""the honourable ones whom the U.S. administration regards as enemies"". He was also praised by the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah.
On Thursday an Iraqi court issued an arrest warrant for U.S. President Donald Trump, as part of an investigation into the killing of Soleimani and Muhandis. Tens of thousands of supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups took to the streets this week to mark the anniversary of the killing.

A royal source said the vaccines were administered by a household doctor at the queen's Windsor Castle residence, adding that she made the news public to counter any speculation.
With a highly transmissible new variant of the virus surging across Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shuttered the economy and is rushing out vaccines in a bid to stem the spread of the pandemic.
The government plans to vaccinate the elderly, the vulnerable and frontline workers - around 15 million people - by mid-February, to ease a new strict lockdown imposed after a spike in cases to daily records.

Britain has the world's fifth-highest official death toll from COVID-19 at nearly 80,000, and the 1,325 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test on Friday surpassed the previous daily record toll from last April.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani mourners buried on Saturday the bodies of 11 slain coalminers that had been put on a highway in the city of Quetta for six days in an anti-government protest. 
The miners, from the minority Shi'ite Hazara sect, were killed last Sunday by Islamic State militants in their shared residential room, after which mourners refused to bury them to demand better protection from sectarian attacks.
Tens of thousands attended the funeral in a cemetery of the southwestern city, where more than 500 other Hazaras have also been buried in more than a decade of attacks, Reuters journalists said.
The Quetta sit-in, which continued through freezing nights, sparked protests in other cities demanding that Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan visit the mourners. 
On Friday, Khan called that ""blackmail"", drawing widespread criticism by activists, opposition parties and others on social media. 
But the countrywide sit-ins began to disperse after the government and protesters reached an agreement late on Friday. It included security guarantees for the Hazaras and that mourners bury the bodies before the prime minister visited them. 
After the burial, Khan travelled to Quetta where he met families close to the protest site. He told them the attack on the miners was meant to stoke conflict between the two major sects of Islam, Sunnis and Shi'ites, to destabilise Pakistan.
He also thanked the families for accepting the government's request to bury the bodies.
Most of the miners were impoverished seasonal migrants. Seven were from neighbouring Afghanistan, its consulate said.

Despite Afghanistan's desire to repatriate some of the bodies, Pakistani police said all had been buried in Quetta.

Macron's office said the flight took place at the request of President Faustin-Archange Touadera and with permission of a U.N. peacekeeper mission in the country.
The French president had condemned recent acts of violence during a phone call with Touadera, his office said, an apparent reference to a rebel advance which Touadera and the United Nations say has been mounted by former President Francois Bozize to thwart the election. 
Touadera was declared the winner of the Dec. 27 election with more than 50% of votes cast in a single round, avoiding a run-off against any of 16 challengers. Many of the opposition candidates have demanded the election be annulled and for the vote to be repeated, citing irregularities and low turnout following violent clashes.
French warplanes also flew over the Central African Republic four days before the vote. 
France has a history of repeated military interventions in the Central African Republic, most recently from 2013-2016. The United Nations now maintains nearly 13,000 peacekeepers there.
The electoral commission declared Touadera the winner with voter turnout of more than 76% despite. However, only half the country's 1.8 million eligible voters were able to register to vote due to the rebel offensive.
A disputed election could further destabilise a country whose population of 4.7 million has endured waves of militia violence since 2013 that has killed thousands of people and forced more than a million from their homes.
Rebels, which the United Nations and Touadera say are led by former President Bozize, seized the country's fourth largest city briefly before the vote. Macron reiterated condemnation of former President Bozize on Saturday.

Parliament passed a law in November that obliges the government to halt inspections of its nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency and to step up uranium enrichment beyond the limit set under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal if sanctions are not eased.
Iran's Guardian Council watchdog body approved the law on Dec. 2 and the government has said it will implement it. 
""According to the law, if the Americans do not lift financial, banking and oil sanctions by Feb. 21, we will definitely expel the IAEA inspectors from the country and will definitely end the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol,"" said parliamentarian Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani.
The comments, referring to texts governing the IAEA's mission and activities, were carried by several Iranian media outlets.
Iran said on Monday it had resumed 20% uranium enrichment at an underground nuclear facility, breaching the nuclear pact with major powers and possibly complicating efforts by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal.
It began violating the accord in 2019 in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from it in 2018 and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions lifted under the deal.
Tehran often says it can quickly reverse its breaches if Washington's sanctions are removed.

The bill, submitted late on Friday, would extend its western territorial waters from six nautical miles currently. It would not affect waters in the Aegean, off Greece's southern and eastern coasts where Athens has been in dispute with its NATO ally Turkey over maritime boundaries. 
Greece and Italy have already signed an agreement on maritime boundaries establishing an exclusive economic zone in the Ionian Sea, while Athens and Tirana have yet to agree all details of their maritime boundary and have referred the issue to the International Court of Justice. 
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met his Albanian counterpart Edi Rama in Athens on Friday.
""This draft legislation confirms Greece's strategy of seeking agreements with neighbouring countries, based always on international law and promoting security and prosperity in the region,"" Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said on Saturday
In the bill, which is expected to be voted on later this month, Greece says that under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea it retains the right to exercise its rights in other parts of its territory. 
Dendias said that this was a historic moment for Greece. 
To the east of Greece, Turkey has warned that a similar move by Athens would be a ""casus belli"", or cause for war.
Tensions have escalated since last year over energy resources in the eastern Mediterranean. 
The two countries agreed a few months ago to resume exploratory talks over contested maritime claims in the area after a four-year hiatus, but no date was set. Hopes had revived for a restart this year.

The blaze began in a grain store at a deepwater berth used for freight services, the port authority said shortly after 0930 GMT, urging local residents to keep all doors and windows shut and remain indoors.
It said just over an hour later that the fire was under control. 
""Emergency services remain on site to monitor the area. Ship operations in Ringaskiddy (Deepwater Berth) have been suspended,"" the port authority said on Twitter. 
Images posted on social media by local residents showed a large cloud of black smoke coming from the port. 

Ferry companies have increased direct freight services between Ireland and France in response to demand for an alternative route to the British ""land-bridge"" used by around 3,000 lorries each week to ship goods to and from mainland Europe.

The bodies of two adults and a young child were found as part of a search and rescue mission involving 242 people and 29 vehicles, the ministry said in a statement on Saturday. A 14-year-old boy was also hospitalized with frostbite.
Video footage showed emergency services staff and volunteers battling high winds and freezing conditions throughout the night to dig out buildings buried under snow and ice. 
Adverse weather conditions, including snowstorms and strong winds, had complicated the work of rescuers, the emergency services said in a statement. 
Russia's Investigative Committee said it had despatched officers to the scene in Norilsk, a remote city of 180,000 situated 300 km (190 miles) inside the Arctic Circle. 
It has opened a criminal investigation, it said, to determine whether the buildings' owners had adequate safety measures in place. It was still seeking to determine who owned the four buildings that were engulfed. 

The avalanche covered a total area of 300 square meters, the management of the Gora Otdelnaya resort complex was cited as saying by the TASS news agency.

MANILA (Reuters) - Thousands of Catholic devotees observed physical distancing as they queued for Saturday morning masses in the Philippine capital to celebrate a centuries-old black wooden statue of Jesus Christ believed to bring miracles to the faithful.
With the coronavirus pandemic afflicting the country, authorities cancelled an annual procession of the life-sized image of the ""Black Nazarene"", the country's largest religious event that draws millions of devotees in an annual ritual observed for 200 years.
Instead, church leaders organised 15 masses at Manila's Quiapo church, which houses the life-sized statue, and livestreamed the worship services, pleading for devotees not to flock into the basilica.
""I am not afraid to go here even with the risk of COVID-19 because I have faith in Jesus the Nazarene. Every year, every week I go to church,"" Arjay Echon, 29, a supermarket employee and a devotee for seven years, told Reuters.
Echon, wearing face mask and shield while carrying a small replica of the ""Black Nazarene"", said he is praying for the pandemic to end.
Police estimated a crowd of nearly 23,000 as of Saturday morning.
People in the queue, reminded by volunteers to practice one-metre (one-yard) physical distancing, were required to fill out contact tracing forms. Inside the church, devotees were disinfected before receiving communion.
About 80% of the country's 108 million people identify as Roman Catholic, a legacy of hundreds of years as a Spanish colony.
""People were patiently in queue, waiting for their turn to get inside the church,"" Father Douglas Badong, parochial vicar, told DZBB radio station.
In contrast, the cancelled annual procession of the statue depicting Jesus shouldering a heavy cross usually draws millions of devotees, many barefoot and jostling to get close and touch the image. Two people were killed and more than 1,200 people suffered minor injuries in the dusk-to-dawn procession in 2016.
It is not known why the statue, which was carved in Mexico and brought to the Philippines in the early 17th century, turned black.
With more than 483,000 cases and 9,300 deaths, the Philippines has the second-highest COVID-19 cases and casualties in Southeast Asia, behind Indonesia.

""My personal prayer is good health for my family...I pray for a better Philippines this 2021 and for COVID-19 to end,"" Prubancio Sarasin, 56, a security guard and devotee for 15 years, told Reuters.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - The United States, its Central American allies and Mexico will not allow a group of migrants that is readying a trip north from Honduras to travel to the U.S. border, a senior U.S. border official said on Friday.
Hondurans have taken to WhatsApp and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) groups, some of which have thousands of subscribers, to organize another caravan scheduled to leave from the country's northern city San Pedro Sula on Jan. 15, despite the coronavirus pandemic.
""Do not waste your time and money, and do not risk your safety and health,"" Mark Morgan, acting commissioner at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said in a statement. 
""Migrant caravan groups will not be allowed to make their way north in violation of the sovereignty, standing public health orders, and immigration laws of the respective nations throughout the region.""
Many Hondurans still live on the streets after their homes were devastated by hurricanes Eta and Iota.
Restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic in the poor Central American country are making it even more difficult for many to get back on their feet.
In one Facebook group that boasts more than 5,500 members, people exchange advice on how to reach ""paradise"", how to protect themselves against fraudsters and the coronavirus on their trip north, and share prayers. 
It would be the second such caravan leaving Honduras since the hurricanes. In December, a caravan got to Guatemala but was dispersed by authorities before reaching Mexico.
Border arrests reached the highest level in nearly two years in December.

On Dec. 19, the team of President-elect Joe Biden said he and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed in a phone call to hone a ""new approach"" to migration issues that ""offers alternatives to undertaking the dangerous journey to the United States.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for more advanced nuclear weapons and said the United States is ""our biggest enemy,"" state media said on Saturday, presenting a stark challenge to President-elect Joe Biden just days before he takes office.
Washington's hostile policies would not change regardless of who occupies the White House but dropping those policies would be key to North Korea-U.S. relations, Kim said, according to state news agency KCNA.
""Our foreign political activities should be focused and redirected on subduing the U.S., our biggest enemy and main obstacle to our innovated development,"" Kim said during nine hours of remarks over several days at a rare party congress in Pyongyang.
""No matter who is in power in the U.S., the true nature of the U.S. and its fundamental policies towards North Korea never change,"" Kim said, vowing to expand ties with ""anti-imperialist, independent forces.""
North Korea would not ""misuse"" its nuclear weapons, Kim said but the country is expanding its nuclear arsenal, including ""preemptive"" and ""retaliatory"" strike capabilities and warheads of varying sizes.
Kim called for developing equipment including hypersonic weapons, solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), spy satellites, and drones.
North Korea is preparing for the test and production of various new weapons, including a ""multi-warhead rocket"" and ""supersonic gliding flight warheads for new type ballistic rockets,"" while research on a nuclear submarine is nearly complete, he said.
""Kim pretty much showed what's on his mind – submarine missiles, better ICBMs and other advanced arms,"" said Yoo Ho-yeol, professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul. ""He is saying that’s basically what Washington will see going forward, which could escalate tension or open doors for talks.”
Kim's remarks were one of the most ambitious outlines of North Korean national defence and nuclear matters in some time, said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
""It could presage a return to nuclear testing, which is now on the table given that Kim renounced his April 2018 moratorium,"" he said. 
U.S. TALKS STALLED
There was no immediate comment from the U.S. State Department. A spokesman for the Biden campaign declined to comment.
Kim criticised South Korea for offering cooperation in ""non-fundamental"" areas such as coronavirus aid and tourism, and said Seoul should stop buying arms from and conducting military drills with the United States.
South Korea's Unification Ministry said it still hopes for a better North Korea-U.S. relations, and will continue to pursue the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.
""The inauguration of the new U.S. administration can be a good opportunity to improve U.S.-North Korea relations, and we expect relations to swiftly resume,"" the ministry said in a statement after Kim's comments were released. 
Biden, who was vice president under President Barack Obama, called Kim a ""thug"" during the election campaign. In 2019 North Korea called Biden a ""rabid dog"" that needed to be ""beaten to death with a stick.""
Kim had three unprecedented meetings with President Donald Trump and the two corresponded in a series of letters, but those efforts failed to lead to a denuclearisation deal or official change in the countries' relations.
""North Korea is declaring the window for cooperation is much, much smaller for the Biden administration,"" Yoo said. 
Biden said in October that he would meet Kim only on the condition that North Korea agreed to draw down its nuclear capacity.
Last month Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia under Obama and considered a contender for a top Asia policy position under Biden, said the incoming U.S. administration would have to make an early decision on what approach it will take with North Korea and not repeat the delay of the Obama era.
'SELF-RELIANCE'
Besides U.S. and defence policy, Kim spoke at greater length on proposals for a five-year economic plan due to be announced at the congress, which he said would continue a focus on building an independent economy.
""The basic seeds and themes of the new five-year economic development plan are still self-reliance and self-sufficiency,"" he said.
Among the plans are building energy-saving steel plants, significantly increasing chemical goods, boosting electricity production, and securing more coal mines, Kim said.
The congress took steps toward ""strengthening the united guidance and strategic management of the state over the economic work."" 
North Korea faces growing crises caused by international sanctions over its nuclear programme, as well as self-imposed lockdowns to prevent a coronavirus outbreak.

""In practical terms, there's a disconnect between North Korea's dire internal economic situation and this ambitious nuclear and military modernisation agenda,"" Panda said.

(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge in California on Friday blocked the Trump administration from implementing a new rule that would have dramatically reshaped the U.S. asylum system and restricted asylum eligibility for immigrants seeking refuge in the United States. 
The injunction undermines the Trump administration's last-minute efforts to solidify its hardline immigration policies before U.S. president-elect Joe Biden takes office later this month.
U.S. District Judge James Donato of the Northern District of California granted an injunction sought by immigrant advocacy groups seeking to block the rule, which the Trump administration published on Dec. 11 and was set to take effect on Monday.
Pangea Legal Services and Immigration Equality sought to block the rule on the grounds that the Acting U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, who authorized it, was not lawfully appointed to office. A Brooklyn judge in November blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects certain migrants from deportation, on the same grounds. 
""The government has recycled exactly the same legal and factual claims made in the prior cases, as if they had not been soundly rejected in well-reasoned opinions by several courts,"" Donato wrote in his opinion on the asylum rule.
U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Wolf's nomination on Thursday after Wolf condemned Trump's supporters rioting inside the U.S. capitol in Washington D.C. and said he would support an orderly transition of power to president-elect Joe Biden.
The final rule would have cut off asylum access for most migrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border through a series of changes to eligibility criteria, according to experts and advocates. It also directed immigration judges and asylum officers to deny broad types of asylum claims, such as those based on domestic abuse and gang violence, with some exceptions.

An ethics committee within the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) has ordered an investigation into the allegations against Felix Salgado, who is running to become governor of the southwestern state of Guerrero in June.
Asked whether Salgado should stand down as a candidate, Lopez Obrador said he believed the allegations related to the election campaign season, noting that he himself had been the victim of false accusations earlier in his political career.
""This all stirs up controversy and accusations, that's why I say it's a product of the season,"" he told a news conference.
The president said he did not want to comment further and that the relevant authorities should resolve the matter.
A representative for Salgado did not reply to a request for comment. Salgado has not recently addressed the matter, which is based on a case a woman filed against him with prosecutors in Guerrero at the end of 2016, according to magazine Proceso.
On Thursday, a group of female MORENA lawmakers, party members and supporters published a letter urging the party leadership to reconsider Salgado's candidacy.
The Guerrero vote is part of a raft of elections taking place in June which will determine whether MORENA and its allies can retain control of the lower house of Congress.

Lopez Obrador has faced criticism from some advocacy groups for failing to do more to reduce violence against women in Mexico, though his approval rating remains robust.

DENVER (Reuters) - Colorado's attorney general on Friday convened a grand jury probe into the death of Elijah McClain, a young unarmed Black man placed in a chokehold and injected with the powerful sedative ketamine while under arrest.
McClain, 23, was walking on a street alone in the Denver suburb of Aurora in August 2019 when he was stopped and subdued by three police officers responding to a report that he had been seen acting suspiciously.
He went into cardiac arrest after the encounter, during which police restrained him using a carotid hold around his neck, and paramedics attending to him administered a dose of ketamine. McClain died days later at a hospital.
Local prosecutors declined to file charges in the case, citing an autopsy listing the cause of death as undetermined.
But Colorado's governor later ordered the state attorney general's office to conduct an independent investigation. The attorney general, Phil Weiser, said in a statement on Friday he has opened a grand jury probe as part of that inquiry.
Weiser's office has also opened a broad investigation of the Aurora police department to determine whether its practices and patterns of conduct might pose civil rights violations.
The case drew renewed scrutiny and public ire in June of this year as protesters against racial injustice and police brutality took to the streets across the United States after George Floyd, a Black man, died in Minneapolis when a police officer knelt on his neck.

McClain's family, which says he had committed no crime, filed a civil rights lawsuit against the city of Aurora and its police in August 2020, alleging murder and excessive use of force against Black people.

Dupond-Moretti's office declined to comment.
Dupond-Moretti was a celebrity lawyer and household name before he was named minister by President Emmanuel Macron in July with a brief to reform the justice system.
However, the biggest magistrates' unions said he was biased against some judges after decades of work as a lawyer and unfit to preside over a revamp of the judiciary.
Weeks before his ministerial appointment, Dupond-Moretti alleged prosecutors at the financial crimes unit (PNF) had abused their powers by accessing his phone records, and those of other lawyers, as part of an investigation into alleged corruption by former President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Dupond-Moretti sued members of the PNF but withdrew the lawsuit when weeks later he was appointed to run the judiciary.
Tensions between the minister and his judges intensified in the months that followed. In October an anti-corruption group filed a complaint to the Cour de la Justice de la Republique, a special court dealing with allegations against sitting ministers. 
Soon after, three magistrates' unions filed similar claims. 
""It falls therefore on the prosecutor general (of the Cour de Cassation) ... to open a judicial investigation against Mr Eric Dupond-Moretti,"" Prosecutor General Francois Molins said in a statement.
Dupond-Moretti has said the unions were using the allegations of conflicts of interest to block his reform plans, including a move to film court proceedings and re-write the training book for judges.

The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement it was blacklisting Falih al-Fayyadh, chairman of the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Committee (PMC).
The Treasury accused him of being part of a crisis cell formed in late 2019 to suppress protests with the support of Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, which is blacklisted by the United States.
Washington said al-Fayyadh was the head of the PMC when forces under its command fired live ammunition at peaceful protesters in 2019, resulting in hundreds of deaths.
Iraq’s biggest anti-government protests in decades broke out in October 2019 and continued for several months, with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis demanding jobs, services and the removal of the ruling elite, which they said was corrupt.
Nearly 500 people were killed. The protests caused the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.
""By directing and supervising the murder of peaceful Iraqi demonstrators, Iran-aligned militants and politicians such as Falih al-Fayyadh have been waging a violent campaign against Iraqi democracy and civil society,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.

The 118 bags of cocaine were discovered on Thursday during a search of a container shipped from the port of Guayaquil in Ecuador and through Algeciras in Spain, said Ousman Saidybah, a spokesman for Gambia's drug enforcement agency. 
It was not clear where the cocaine was ultimately headed. Drug smugglers generally use West Africa as a transshipment point for cocaine en route from South America to Europe, and Saidybah said the drugs were not intended for local consumption. 
""This seizure is yet another confirmation that the Gambia, like other West African states, continues to be a storage and transit route for cocaine by international organised criminal groups,"" he told reporters. 
Record quantities of cocaine were seized in West Africa in 2019, including 9.5 tonnes from a ship that docked in Cape Verde. 
The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted the illegal narcotics trade but drug kingpins have responded by packing larger loads of cocaine into the fewer container ships and commercial airplanes in circulation, officials say. 
Saidybah said initial findings suggested that the container holding the cocaine belonged to a Gambian resident with a French passport, who is being sought by the police.

Trudeau's Liberal Party only controls a minority of seats in the House of Commons, which means he needs the support of opposition parties to govern and can be brought down if they unite against him.
Trudeau, who says his priority is tackling the coronavirus epidemic, has previously sidestepped questions about an election, saying merely that one was theoretically possible. 
""Obviously, we are in a minority government, and that could well happen,"" he told Montreal's CHOU 1450 AM radio station when asked about the chances of a vote in the coming months.
""Our priority as a government is going to be helping people get through this pandemic ... it's not in our interests to have an election,"" he added. The last election was in October 2019.
Asked about the prime minister's comments, a government official said Trudeau had made clear many times that he ""doesn't necessarily get to chose when an election is going to come. Canadians want to see their government there for them and that's what we're focused on"".
The official requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the situation. 
A string of recent opinion polls suggests that the Liberals, while ahead of their Conservative rivals, would most likely fall short of winning a majority.

Campaigning ahead of the Jan. 14 election, which pits President Yoweri Museveni against 10 other candidates including popstar-turned-lawmaker Bobi Wine, has been marked by brutal crackdowns on opposition rallies.
Wine has been arrested multiple times and security personnel routinely break up his rallies. In November, 54 people were killed as security forces quelled protests after Wine was detained. Reporters have also been attacked by police.
At a pre-election news conference with senior security officials, Uganda's police chief Martin Okoth Ochola refused to apologise, saying reporters would be stopped from trying to go to areas where their lives could be at risk.
""You are insisting you must go where there is danger. Yes, we shall beat you for your own sake to help you understand that you do not go there. Yes, we shall use reasonable force to ensure that you don't go where there is a risk. Actually, I have no apology,"" he said.
The authorities say Wine's rallies break laws governing public order and COVID-19 restrictions on large gatherings.
In November, the International Press Institute called on Uganda to investigate police attacks on reporters. Human Rights Watch, a watchdog based in New York, also said in November that Museveni's government was using COVID-19 rules as a pretext to violate rights and crack down on the opposition and the media.
COURT MARTIAL
Johnson Byabashaija, Uganda's commissioner general of prisons, told the news conference at police headquarters in the capital Kampala that his service was ready to handle any increase in detainees.
""There's always an upsurge of the prison population, especially after the elections. I can assure you that we can accommodate whatever number of people are, or will be, thrown at us,"" Byabashaija said.
Dozens of campaign staff working for Wine are being held in a military barracks after authorities defied court orders to release them, Wine's lawyer George Musisi said on Friday.
He said 118 Wine supporters and staff were arrested on Dec. 30 on Bugala Island in Lake Victoria, where they had travelled to campaign. A court ordered their release on Monday but the prisons service did not comply, Musisi said.
On Thursday, 46 were freed and 72 were taken to Makindye military barracks on the outskirts of Kampala, he said.
Military spokeswoman Flavia Byekwaso told Reuters she needed time to study the situation before responding. Prisons service spokesman Frank Baine did not answer a call to request comment.
On Friday, 49 of those held in the barracks were arraigned before a court martial in Kampala and charged with the unlawful possession of ammunition, Musisi said. They included Wine's singing partner known as Nubian Li and his bodyguard.

Uganda's anti-terrorism laws allow for civilians who commit crimes using weapons that are generally only used by the defence forces to be charged in military courts.

""Today, the government has not decided on the closure of businesses, but the government is ready to make that kind of decision as well,"" Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told a news conference.
""This is not something that we take lightly, but people's lives and health are at stake.""
From Sunday, gyms, sports centres, shopping malls and public pools will have to set a maximum number of visitors based on their size.
In addition, private gatherings will also be limited to 8 people, a rule which until now has only affected public events. 
Sweden registered 7,187 new coronavirus cases on Friday, according to statistics from the public health agency. 
Deaths now total 9,433 - a rate per capita several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours', but lower than in many European countries that opted for lockdowns.
The high death toll - particularly among residents of care homes for the elderly - has led to heavy criticism of Lofven for not acting sooner and more decisively.
But the government has in part, been hamstrung by a lack of legal tools to impose the kind of far-reaching measures adopted by other countries in Europe.
""The Swedish corona strategy has always been a combination of tougher rules, prohibitions and, not the least, that people themselves assume great responsibility,"" Lofven said. 
""At the same time it has been obvious that Sweden needs legislation that better hits the mark to handle COVID-19 and limit contagion.""

Even after parliament voted for the new, temporary law, the government will not be able to impose curfews or a domestic travel ban.

316,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 11:25AM ET</span>","Snowstorm hits Spain, Madrid braces for heaviest snowfall in decades","MADRID (Reuters) - Heavy snowfall brought by Storm Filomena put parts of Spain including the capital Madrid on high alert on Friday, causing traffic congestion and forcing authorities in some regions to deploy the military to clear access to villages.
With up to 20 cm (nearly 8 inches) of snow forecast in 24 hours and temperatures expected to hover around zero centigrade for much of the day, the south of the Madrid region, including the capital, is on its highest level of alert for the first time since the system was created in 2007.
Such events are rare in the region and tend to be disruptive to daily life and mobility, coming at a time when people are returning home after Christmas and New Year holidays. This year, however, there is less traffic than usual due to restrictions to curb the coronavirus pandemic. 
Large parks in Madrid, including the famous Retiro next to the Prado museum, were closed as a precaution.
Ruben del Campo, a spokesman for the State Meteorological Agency, said the city was probably facing the heaviest snowfall at least so far in the 21st century.
""Perhaps we would have to go back to the snowfall of February 1984 or to that of March 1971 to find similar precedents if the forecasts we are expecting are correct,"" he added.
Castilla-La Mancha, one of the three regions put on high alert on Friday along with Madrid and eastern Valencia, closed schools, and troops were called in to clear access to some villages. 
With hundreds of roads affected by the snow, trucks were banned from several important highways and authorities asked citizens to avoid non-essential travel. 
Airport operator Aena urged passengers to use the subway to get to Madrid airport, and train operator Renfe cancelled some routes. 
On Wednesday Spain registered the lowest temperature ever recorded on the Iberian peninsula, of -34.1C, in the Pyrenees in the north.
The storm first hit the Canary Islands with strong winds and rain. In Gran Canaria, a ferry with 59 passengers and 17 crew ran aground on Thursday night due to the strong winds when entering the port of Agaete.

On Friday the coastguard rescued the passengers, who were unharmed, but the ferry remained stranded.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Russia and China have opposed a candidate from Fiji seen as a staunch human rights defender to lead the top U.N. rights body, diplomats and observers say, creating a deadlock just as Washington may seek to rejoin the forum it quit in 2018.
The Human Rights Council presidency rotates annually between regions and is usually agreed by consensus, with any contests typically resolved quickly and cordially, diplomats say. 
The impasse means the council, the only intergovernmental global body to promote and protect human rights worldwide, is set to resume work in Geneva next week with no leader for the first time in its 15-year history.
While its decisions are not legally binding, they carry political weight and can authorise probes into violations.
The infighting points to a high-stakes game where powers are seeking to pre-emptively counter future influence of the United States, which could rejoin the body under President-elect Joe Biden, Marc Limon of the Universal Rights Group think-tank said.
""Neither China nor Russia want a human rights-friendly country to hold the presidency in a year where the U.S. will probably re-engage with the council,"" he said.
Russia, China and Saudi Arabia -- sometimes acting through proxies -- have opposed the selection of Fiji's ambassador, Nazhat Shameem Khan, or thrown their weight behind other last-minute candidates, observers and two diplomats said.
""It's understood that Saudi Arabia, China and Russia were all supportive of a Bahraini candidacy and opposed to a Fijian candidacy,"" said Phil Lynch, director of the International Service for Human Rights, citing Fiji's record, with Khan backing probes into abuses in Belarus and Yemen last year.
The NGO is accredited to the council and takes part in debates.
A Chinese diplomat said on Friday he would be ""happy to see any of these candidates as president"".
The diplomatic missions for Fiji, Russia and Saudi Arabia did not respond to requests for comment. 
Khan has not stepped aside and alternative candidates from Bahrain and Uzbekistan put forward since December have also faced opposition, diplomats said.
""This mess potentially strengthens those voices that argue HRC is anti-democratic, dysfunctional etc, and U.S. should not re-engage (or insist on big reforms as price for doing so),"" said the International Crisis Group's Richard Gowan.
A review that could prompt reforms of the forum is pending. 
Currently, members have to be elected onto the 47-member council to vote in it - but that may be one of the subjects considered in any reform. China and Russia both return to the council this year.
The council president has limited powers although some say the role has become increasingly political. 
The president does however appoint independent experts, such as the one who led an inquiry into the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Attempts by Oman, last year's Asia-Pacific group coordinator, to resolve the matter via secret ballot hit Qatari opposition, creating a deadlock one diplomat called ""a mess"".

One way to resolve the impasse might be a vote at the council next week, diplomats say.

318,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",Almost 2.3 million people need aid in Ethiopia's Tigray: U.N. report,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Fighting is still going on in several parts of Ethiopia's northern Tigray region and almost 2.3 million people, or nearly half of the population, need aid, a U.N. report said.
The report, the most comprehensive public assessment of the humanitarian situation in Tigray since conflict erupted there on Nov. 4, was posted online late on Thursday.
It said food supplies were very limited, looting was widespread and insecurity remained high. 
Federal government troops are fighting the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party that was governing the province. The government declared victory in late November though the TPLF vowed to fight on.
Ethiopia's National Defence Force said late on Thursday that four senior TPLF members had been killed and nine arrested.
The state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation said on Friday that Sebhat Nega, a founding member of the TPLF, had also been captured. The TPLF could not be reached for comment.
The whereabouts of TPFL leader Debretsion Gebremichael, other members of the party's central committee and many high-ranking former military officers remains unknown.
The findings in the humanitarian report stem from two missions conducted at the end of December by U.N. and government agencies. They said the humanitarian situation was dire and two out of four refugee camps in Tigray remained inaccessible.
The report said fighting was reported in rural areas as well as on the periphery of regional capital Mekelle and the towns of Shire and Sheraro, among other locations.
COVID CONCERNS 
The fact-finding teams also said schools, hospitals and administrative offices had been looted and damaged. They said only five out of 40 hospitals in Tigray were physically accessible, with another four reachable by mobile networks.
They said the health facilities in the major cities that were partially functioning had ""limited to no stock of supplies and absence of health workers"".
The disruption might also coincide with a massive spike in COVID-19 cases, the report said. 
""The interruption of COVID-19 surveillance and control activities for over a month in the region, coupled with mass displacements and overcrowded conditions in displacement settings, is feared to have facilitated massive community transmission of the pandemic,"" it said. 
The report said regional and local bureaucratic hurdles were preventing some agencies getting into Tigray, despite clearance from the federal government. It also said humanitarian supplies and equipment were being looted in some areas. 
Ethiopia's own estimates of people in need of aid are even higher than U.N. figures. The U.N. said 950,000 needed aid before the conflict and another 1.3 million would now need help.
However, the report said the government-run Tigray Emergency Coordination Center estimated that more than 4.5 million people needed emergency food assistance, including 2.2 million people who had been forced to flee their homes within Tigray. 

Reuters could not immediately reach the center for comment and other government officials were unavailable.

Chin'ono, who has a large social media following, has been critical of President Emmerson Mnangagwa's rule, accusing his government of corruption and mismanagement. His comments have been unusually outspoken for a journalist in Zimbabwe, where critics are often dealt with harshly.
The United States embassy in Harare said it was concerned for Chin'ono's welfare. 
Police spokesman Andrew Phiri said he could not comment on Chin'ono's latest arrest, which the journalist himself tweeted about, saying: ""The police have come to arrest me! Let everyone know!""
Lawyer Doug Coltart told Reuters the latest charges stemmed from a Twitter post by Chin'ono this week saying a police officer had beaten and killed a child strapped to its mother's back using a baton after a video of the alleged incident went viral.
Police said on Thursday investigations showed the baby was alive. 
Chin'ono was first arrested in July on charges of inciting violent anti-government protests. He was arrested again in November on charges of obstructing justice. 
Freelancer Chin'ono, who works for mostly British and South African broadcasters and makes documentaries, was free on bail awaiting trial for both cases.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government and representatives of protesting farmers failed to reach an agreement on contentious new agriculture laws on Friday and said they will meet again in a week's time.
Tens of thousands of farmers have been camped on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi for over a month, calling for the repeal of laws introduced by the federal government, which says the legislation is aimed at modernising the country's antiquated agricultural sector.
Farm leaders say the laws are an attempt to erode a longstanding minimum support price for their produce and want a full repeal of the laws.
""The government has constantly said that if the unions give any other option besides repeal, then the government will consider them,"" agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters after the eighth round of talks between the two sides. 
""But despite long discussions, no options were presented today, and that's why the discussions have ended here.""
The two sides will meet again on Jan. 15, he said.
""There was a heated discussion. We said we don't want anything other than repeal of (the) laws,"" Hannan Mollah, one of the farm leaders who met with the government, told reporters. ""We won't go to any court, this (repeal) will either be done or we'll continue to fight.""
Mollah added that the protesters would proceed with a rally during India's Republic Day celebration on Jan. 26 if their demands have still not been met.
The majority of India's farmers sell their produce largely to small retailers at a much lower price than the government guaranteed price - offered to only a fraction of farmers.
They fear that with the introduction of the new laws, big retailers like Reliance Industries will enter the market to buy their produce at a lower price, while the government may slowly dismantle the current system of procurement at the guaranteed price.

Earlier this week, Reliance asked authorities to help stop attacks on its telecommunication masts by protesting farmers, who say the conglomerate has profited from the reforms at their expense.

324,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 09:20AM ET</span>",EU gives go ahead to extract more shots from each Pfizer vaccine vial,"(Reuters) - Europe's medicines regulator gave the go-ahead on Friday for an extra sixth dose to be extracted from Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine vials, increasing the number of available shots at a time when supplies are short.
EU countries started inoculating people with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine two weeks ago, after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the shot's conditional approval under the brand name Comirnaty with an authorisation that allows five doses to be extracted from each vial. 
""EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has recommended updating the product information for Comirnaty to clarify that each vial contains six doses of the vaccine,"" EMA said.
Final approvals are up to the European Commission (EC), which typically follows recommendations from the EMA.
""Once endorsed by the EC, the label would state that after dilution, vials of Comirnaty contain six doses of 0.3 ml of vaccine,""  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) said in a statement.
Reuters had reported on Wednesday that the regulator was close to approving such a move.
This change in authorisation could allow 20% more doses to be available in the EU under an existing contract with Pfizer, EU lawmaker Peter Liese had said.
The European Union reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech for 300 million additional doses of the vaccine, the head of the European Commission said on Friday, in a move that would give the EU nearly half of the firms' global output for 2021. 
The move would allow EU governments to double their orders from Pfizer to 600 million doses, commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, as the 27-nation bloc races to ramp up the vaccination of its 450 million people. Each recipient of the Pfizer vaccine need two doses to develop maximum protection.

To extract the sixth dose from a single vial, low dead volume syringes or needles, which only retain a low amount of solution after an injection, should be used, EMA said, adding that there should be no pooling from multiple vials to make up a full dose.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States' stark racial inequality was on display after a mob of predominantly white supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol with ease on Wednesday then left with few immediate consequences, according to Washington residents, activists and politicians, including President-elect Joe Biden. 
The rioters broke through barricades, smashed windows, snatched souvenirs and entered Congressional offices and chambers, some taking photographs with police. 
Some carried trophies with them as they walked out. 
The lack of security and limited police response, despite weeks of promotion of the pro-Trump protest that sparked the riot, was in sharp contrast to the largely peaceful Black Lives Matter protests in Washington six months ago. 
""My mom said if you did this you'd be shot,"" Beatrice Mando, who works for the district and attended BLM protests last year. ""She is right. There would be hundreds dead, if not more, had this group been Black."" 
In a speech on Thursday, Biden agreed there was a sharp contrast.
""No one can tell me that if it had been a group of Black Lives Matter protesting yesterday, they wouldn't have been treated very, very differently from the mob of thugs that stormed the Capitol,"" he said. 
The United States saw a summer of widespread demonstrations against racial injustice that began in May following the killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died as a Minneapolis police office knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. 
In Washington, participants in those protests said their reception was very different. 
""There were cops at every intersection in DC. There were cops at all the monuments, at the Capitol, in front of the White House,"" said Abby Conejo, 29, who works at a small business in Washington. 
The Black Lives Matter protesters in Washington had been faced with rows of masked National Guard troops at the Lincoln Memorial in June, as Trump vowed to crack down on what he called lawlessness by ""hoodlums"" and ""thugs.""
One evening, baton-swinging police fired smoke canisters, flashbang grenades and rubber bullets to drive peaceful protesters away from the White House, so that Trump could walk to a nearby church and be photographed holding a Bible.
""They treated us like the enemy,"" Conejo said. ""Where was that anger and rage yesterday? Why were these people treated like friends?""
WORRIED ABOUT A REPEAT 
The D.C. Police Department said on Thursday it had arrested 68 people in connection with the Capitol unrest. In comparison, nearly 300 were arrested https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/may-2020-january-2021-unrest-related-arrests-and-persons-interest the evening that police cleared Black Lives Matter protesters from near the White House. 
Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund praised his officers, saying they ""responded valiantly"" when demonstrators attacked them with ""metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants and took up other weapons"" and also faced two pipe bombs. 
Sund later said he would resign effective Jan. 16, according to a letter cited by news outlets. 
Local residents said they worried that the police response was so muted there may be a repeat. 
Charles Allen, a D.C. council member who represents the area, said he and his neighbors are used to First Amendment demonstrations and large gatherings.     
""That was not what this was. This was an insurrection. This was domestic terrorists coming into our city and trying to overtake the Capitol,"" Allen said, adding it was traumatic for the neighborhood. 
""I think that people will feel emboldened that they can do this and I think on top of it, they feel emboldened because they left with souvenirs,"" he said. 
Among the mob who stormed the Capitol were individuals who waved Confederates flags and wore clothing carrying insignia and slogans espousing white supremacist beliefs. 
""It felt like abuse to see not just white privilege but white supremacy in action,"" said Makia Green, a Black Lives Matter organizer in Washington. ""To see the bias from the government, from the police.""
White supremacist groups have posed ""the most persistent and lethal threat"" of violent extremism in the United States in recent years, Trump's acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told a congressional hearing in September. 
KIPP DC Public Schools, a group of local charter schools, canceled classes on Thursday, citing the feelings of its mostly Black student body after the riot.
""We are disgusted when we think about the contrast between how our country is responding to this act of domestic terrorism vs the peaceful protests of this past summer,"" it said in a statement. Charles McKinney, associate professor of history at Rhodes College in Tennessee, said Wednesday's events in Washington were a reminder of the ""gross disparities"" in how Black people and white people are treated by law enforcement. 

""The response from law enforcement was a blatant display of systemic racism. It was a display of white privilege, the disparities in policing in this country,"" he said.

Khan warned that the number of hospital beds will run out in the next few weeks unless urgent action was taken to drastically stop the spread of the disease.
""The situation in London is now critical with the spread of the virus out of control,"" Khan said. ""One in 30 Londoners now has COVID-19. If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS (National Health Service) could be overwhelmed and more people will die.""
The number of COVID-19 cases in London is now more than 1,000 per 100,000 people, and between Dec. 30 and Jan. 6, the total number of hospital patients in the capital rose by 27%. In the last three days there were 477 deaths of patients who had tested positive for the virus.
The number of people in hospital is 35% higher than during the peak of the pandemic on April, and there are concerns admissions will continue to rise.
""We are declaring a major incident because the threat this virus poses to our city is at crisis point,"" Khan said. ""Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave.""
A major incident is defined as being ""beyond the scope of business-as-usual operations, and is likely to involve serious harm, damage, disruption or risk to human life or welfare, essential services, the environment or national security"".

The last major incident in London was declared following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 when 72 people died in Britain’s worst blaze in a residential building since World War Two.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union reached a deal with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech for 300 million additional doses of their COVID-19 vaccine, the head of the European Commission said on Friday, in a move that would give the EU nearly half of the firms' global output for 2021.
Pfizer has said it can produce up to 1.3 billion doses around the world this year. The new agreement with the EU comes on top of another order for 300 million doses that the bloc agreed with Pfizer and German partner BioNTech in November. 
""We now have agreed with BioNTech and Pfizer to extend this contract. With the new agreement we could purchase a total of up to an additional 300 million doses of the BioNTech vaccine,"" Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference on Friday.
Pfizer was more cautious. ""We are in talks with the European Commission about an amendment to our existing supply agreement for COMIRNATY, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,"" it said in a statement. 
The move would allow EU governments to double their orders from Pfizer to 600 million doses, von der Leyen said, as the 27-nation bloc races to ramp up the vaccination of its 450 million people. Each recipient of the Pfizer vaccine need two doses to develop maximum protection.
In a separate announcement, the EU drug regulator changed its recommendation for the use of the Pfizer vaccine, allowing the extraction of six doses from a vial instead of five, confirming an earlier Reuters story. 
That would increase available doses by 20%, although it was not clear whether Pfizer would charge more for the extra doses. The company did not immediately respond to this question. 
Von der Leyen said 75 million of the additional doses under the new deal would be delivered in the second quarter of this year, and the rest by the end of 2021. Pfizer said that in total 500 million doses would be available to the EU by the end of this year, and an option for another 100 million could be taken up.
PRODUCTION CAPACITY
The large EU order is likely to require an expansion of Pfizer-BioNTech production capacity this year, as the companies have already deals with other wealthy nations for large supplies in 2021.
They cut by half to 50 million doses their production in 2020 after facing some snags in securing supplies of vaccine ingredients.
European officials said the companies were working to expand production capacity in Europe.
Pfizer has agreed to sell the U.S. up to 600 million doses, of which 200 million have been already ordered. Another 120 million doses are reserved for Japan this year, and 40 million for Britain, among disclosed deals.
Germany said on Monday it had agreed with BioNtech to supply 30 million additional doses in a side deal, although the timing of the delivery is unclear.
The German move, agreed in September but revealed only this week as the government faced pressures at home, appears to be in contrast with EU agreements that forbid members to negotiate parallel deals with vaccine makers.
""No member state on this legal binding basis is allowed to negotiate in parallel or to have a contract in parallel,"" von der Leyen said. But a Commission spokesman declined to comment on whether the German deal was legal under EU agreements.
The new EU agreement includes a possible immediate order for 200 million doses and an additional option to buy another 100 million, the Commission said.

Doses are usually shared among EU states in proportion to their population, but it is unclear whether all governments will make orders based on the new contract.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine called on Iran to deliver justice and pay full compensation to the families of those who died when a Ukrainian airliner was shot down by Iranian Revolutionary Guards one year ago. 
On the first anniversary of the crash, Ukraine and other countries jointly called for ""a complete and thorough explanation ... including concrete measures to ensure that it will never happen again,"" according to a statement. 
""Our countries will hold Iran to account to deliver justice and make sure Iran makes full reparations to the families of the victims and affected countries,"" said the statement, made jointly with Afghanistan, Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 
Iran last week allocated $150,000 for the families of each of the 176 victims of the Ukraine International Airlines plane shot down in Iranian airspace on Jan 8, 2020. Many victims were Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada.
""No one doubts that the lives of 176 civilians aboard a peaceful plane were criminally taken by two missiles,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a statement. 
""It was impossible not to know then that it was a passenger plane in the air."" 
Describing Iran's handling of the situation as ""unacceptable"", Ukraine had earlier said the amount of compensation should be negotiated.
A Canadian adviser said on Thursday it was premature to discuss how much compensation to pay to relatives.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards have said they accidentally shot down the aircraft shortly after takeoff, mistaking it for a missile when tensions with the United States were high.

Authorities have also requested a supplementary amount of vaccines from neighbour and close ally Israel, Cypriot President Nicos Anastassiades told the daily Politis in an interview due to be published in two parts from Sunday, the newspaper said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the request would be considered in consultation with experts, Politis quoted Anastasiades as saying.

Israel has the highest vaccination rates for COVID-19 worldwide.

LONDON (Reuters) - People entering England and Scotland will have to show a negative COVID-19 test result starting next week as authorities try to ramp up protection against new, more infectious strains of the coronavirus from other countries.
Passengers arriving by boat, plane or train will have to take a test a maximum of 72 hours before departure, mirroring measures taken last year by other countries around the world.
""We already have significant measures in place to prevent imported cases of COVID-19, but with new strains of the virus developing internationally we must take further precautions,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said.
He said there were concerns that vaccines might not work properly against the highly transmissible variant of the coronavirus discovered in South Africa, echoing recent comments from other government officials.
On Thursday, Britain said it would extend a ban on travellers entering England from South Africa to include other southern African countries, and non-essential travel in and out of the United Kingdom is restricted. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a new lockdown for England this week after a surge in cases linked to another variant of the virus believed to have originated in the country.
Scotland, which like the rest of the United Kingdom has tight COVID-19 restrictions in place, said it too would require travellers to show negative tests and the rule is also expected to be applied by Wales and Northern Ireland.
Passengers from many countries are currently required to self-isolate for 10 days, or five if they pay for a private test and test negative. Those requirements will remain in place after the new pre-departure testing rule comes into effect.
Britain's airlines industry recognised the need to introduce pre-departure testing but said it should be only a short-term, emergency measure.
""Once the roll-out of the vaccine accelerates, the focus must be on returning travel to normal as quickly as possible in order to support the UK's economic recovery,"" said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, an industry group. 
""What we'd like to see is that testing before you take off becomes the standard as an alternative to quarantine,"" said John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of Britain's biggest airport Heathrow.
Travel to and from Britain has been almost wiped out by COVID-19 and the quarantine requirements, leaving many airlines and airports fighting for survival.
Exemptions to the new testing requirement rule in England would be offered to hauliers, children under 11, crews and people travelling from countries where tests are not available.
Passengers will be subject to a fine of 500 pounds ($678.30) if they fail to comply with the new regulations.

334,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 06:30AM ET</span>",Tokyo angered after South Korea court orders Japan to compensate 'comfort women',"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court for the first time on Friday ordered Japan to compensate 12 women who were forced to work in its wartime brothels, a ruling that drew a rebuke from Tokyo and threatened to rekindle a diplomatic feud between the two countries. 
Reminders of Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula are contentious for both sides, with many surviving ""comfort women"" - a Japanese euphemism for the sex abuse victims - demanding Tokyo's formal apology and compensation.
Japan says the issue was settled under a 1965 treaty that normalised diplomatic ties, and the two countries agreed to ""irreversibly"" end the dispute in a 2015 deal.
But the Seoul Central District Court, a lower tier court, ordered Japan pay each of the women 100 million won ($91,000), saying neither of the pacts can cover their right to seek compensation.
Amnesty International said it was the first time a domestic court had recognised that Japan's government was accountable for the wartime brothels.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said Japan could not accept the court ruling and said the lawsuit should be dropped.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato called the verdict ""unacceptable,"" urging Seoul to take ""appropriate measures"". Vice Foreign Minister Takeo Akiba summoned South Korean Ambassador Nam Gwan-pyo to lodge an ""extremely strong protest"".
Ambassador Nam said that he would strive to prevent the ruling from having an ""undesirable impact"" on ties. 
South Korea's foreign ministry said it respects the court ruling, though it acknowledges the 2015 pact was a formal agreement. It will also make efforts to ensure the two countries will continue constructive cooperation as it reviews the impact of the ruling on diplomatic relations, the ministry said in a statement.
""I emphasised that it was most important for both sides to respond in a calm, restrained manner in order to resolve the issue,"" Nam told reporters after being called in. 
'NOT FOR MONEY'
After taking office in 2017, South Korean President Moon Jae-in effectively nullified the 2015 settlement, in which Japan issued an official apology and provided 1 billion yen ($9.6 million) to a fund to help comfort women victims.
Some historians estimate up to 200,000 Korean girls and women were forced to provide sex to Japanese troops during the colonial era, sometimes under the pretext of employment or to pay off a relative's debt.
""It was a crime against humanity that was systematically, deliberately and extensively committed by Japan in breach of international norms,"" Justice Kim Jeong-gon said in the ruling. 
""Even if it was a country's sovereign act, state immunity cannot be applied as it was committed against our citizens on the Korean peninsula that was illegally occupied by Japan."" 
Only 16 registered Korean survivors are still alive, and six of the 12 victims have died since they initiated the lawsuit in 2016. 
The women's lawyer, Kim Kang-won, said he was ""deeply moved"" as the ruling acknowledged the Japanese government was accountable for the atrocity.
Kim Dae-wol at the House of Sharing, a shelter for the women, said two of five plaintiffs who live there were healthy enough to remotely monitor the trial and they welcomed the ruling. 
""They said it's never enough even if Japan pays tens of times more, but they don't put much meaning on compensation,"" he told reporters. ""They just want Japan to apologise and let more of its people know, so that there will no longer be such war crimes."" 
South Korea and Japan, both staunch U.S. allies, are key trade partners and share other common interests, including fending off North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threats.
But relations have deteriorated as historical rows flared in recent years, affecting trade and security arrangements, especially after South Korea's Supreme Court ordered two Japanese firms to compensate some wartime forced labourers.
The former labourers have sought to seize and sell some of the Japanese companies' assets in South Korea as compensation, which Tokyo had warned would bring a ""serious situation."" 

Kim, the comfort women's lawyer, said he will look into ways to enforce the court order.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistan court on Friday sentenced Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi, a senior official of militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), to five years in jail for terrorism financing.
Lakhvi and the group are accused by India and the United States of being behind the 2008 Mumbai attacks - though the charges or sentence are not related to any specific incident. 
He was sentenced to five years concurrently on three counts, with a fine of 100,000 rupees on each count, an order from the court seen by Reuters said.
India has long called on Pakistan to try Lakhvi for the Mumbai attack, in which over 160 people were killed, but Islamabad has said that Delhi has not given it concrete evidence that it can use in a court to try the LeT leader, which it had initially arrested in 2008 but was later released on bail. 
He was arrested again on charges of terrorism financing on Saturday.
The United States welcomed his arrest but called for him to be tried for the Mumbai attacks, too.
""We will follow his prosecution & sentencing closely & urge that he be held accountable for his involvement in the Mumbai attacks,"" the U.S. State Department said on Twitter.
According to Delhi, the lone surviving gunman of the attack, who was executed in 2012 after sentencing by an Indian court, told interrogators that the assailants were in touch with Pakistan-born Lakhvi, who is said to be LeT's chief of operations
A U.N. Security Council sanctions committee says Lakhvi is involved in militant activity in a number of other regions and countries, including Chechnya, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan. .
Lakhvi's lawyer did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
A spokesman for the Counter Terrorism Department said in a statement that Lakhvi had been sent to prison to serve the sentences. 
Another man that India says was the mastermind of the Mumbai siege, Hafiz Saeed, was convicted by a Pakistani court on two charges of terrorism financing last year. 

Saeed denies involvement in the Mumbai attacks.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 05:46AM ET</span>",Democrats inch toward second Trump impeachment after Capitol siege,"By Richard Cowan and Joseph Ax
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Congressional Democrats on Friday weighed impeaching President Donald Trump for a second time, two days after his false claims of election fraud helped encourage a mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol.
Democratic leaders including House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for immediate impeachment proceedings if Vice President Mike Pence and Trump's cabinet refused to take steps to remove Trump from power.
""The president's dangerous and seditious acts necessitate his immediate removal from office,"" they said in a statement on Thursday evening, accusing Trump of inciting an ""insurrection.""
As calls for his ouster mounted on Thursday, Trump released a video in which he denounced the violence that left five people dead.
The Republican president came the closest yet to conceding his loss in the Nov. 3 presidential election, promising to ensure a smooth transition to a ""new administration"". President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, is set to be sworn in on Jan. 20.
Trump's words were in stark contrast to his speech on Wednesday, when he exhorted a crowd of thousands to descend on the Capitol as Congress met to certify Biden's election victory.
Rioters stormed the building, overwhelming police and forcing authorities to transport lawmakers to secure locations for their own safety.
A Capitol police officer died from injuries sustained in the assault, the force said late on Thursday. A woman protester was fatally shot by the authorities, and three people died from medical emergencies.
The FBI offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information on people responsible for placing pipe bombs in the headquarters of the two main U.S. political parties. The agency released a picture of a suspect wearing gloves and a hoodie, carrying an object.
RUNNING OUT OF TIME? 
With less than two weeks left in Trump's term, it was not clear whether enough time remained to complete the impeachment process.
Pelosi has not announced a decision, though she made clear at a news conference that rank-and-file Democrats in her caucus wanted action following Wednesday's siege.
If impeached in the House, Trump would theoretically face trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, which is scheduled to be in recess until Jan. 19. Aides to Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, have not said what he would do if the House approved articles of impeachment.
The Democratic-led House impeached Trump in December 2019 for pressuring the president of Ukraine to investigate Biden, but the Republican-held Senate acquitted him in February 2020. Only two other presidents in history have been impeached, and none has ever been impeached twice.
Democrats will control the Senate after sweeping two runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday, but the new senators, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, will not be sworn in until the state certifies the results. The state deadline to do so is Jan. 22, though it could come sooner.
In Thursday's video, a flat-toned Trump struck a conciliatory note seldom seen from him during his presidency, calling for ""healing."" As recently as Thursday morning, however, Trump was still claiming the election had been stolen, and he stopped short of acknowledging his loss.
Since November, Trump has baselessly denounced the election results as ""rigged"" due to widespread fraud.
The Trump campaign and its allies filed dozens of lawsuits challenging the vote counts but almost all were rejected in state and federal courts. Election officials have said there is no evidence to back Trump's claims.
Pelosi and Schumer called on Pence and Trump's Cabinet to invoke the U.S. Constitution's 25th Amendment, which allows them to strip the president of his powers if he cannot discharge the duties of his office. Pence opposes the idea, according to an adviser.
At least two Republicans, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger, said Trump must go. The Wall Street Journal editorial page, seen as a leading voice of the Republican establishment, on Thursday evening called on Trump to resign.
Several high-ranking Trump administration officials have resigned in protest over the invasion of the Capitol, including two Cabinet members: Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary and McConnell's wife, and Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.
At a news conference to introduce his pick for attorney general, Biden blamed Trump for instigating the attack but did not comment on his possible removal.
Congress certified Biden's election victory early on Thursday, after authorities cleared the Capitol. More than half of House Republicans and eight Republican senators voted to challenge some states' election results, backing Trump.

The president has isolated himself among a small circle of diehard advisers and lashed out at those he perceives as disloyal, including Pence - whom Trump wanted to try to block Congress from certifying Biden's win - according to sources.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors have indicted a North Korean defector who wants to return home on charges of violating a national security law, her lawyer told Reuters. 
Kim Ryen Hi, 51, drew international attention in 2015 when she pleaded for deportation, saying she had been tricked by a broker and never intended to leave her homeland. She even reported herself to police as a spy and tried to forge a passport, which brought a suspended prison sentence. 
After South Korean authorities repeatedly rejected her demand, she launched an online campaign, writing open letters to her family and U.N. officials and sharing her interviews on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and YouTube. 
Kim also unsuccessfully sought to take asylum at the Vietnamese Embassy in 2016. 
But last week, prosecutors indicted Kim on charges of breaching the National Security Act on several counts, including plotting to escape to North Korea, which the law stipulates as an ""anti-government organisation that threatens the existence and security"" of the nation or its free democratic order.
A copy of the indictment, which was not made public, was seen by Reuters. 
Kim was also accused of possessing and distributing material that praised the North by posting its state media articles and letters from her family on social media.
""The charges made me speechless as I mostly shared what others wrote or talked about my story or hometown, and yet prosecutors have never even bothered to call me in for questioning through all those years,"" Kim told Reuters. 
The prosecutors' office in the southeastern city of Daegu which led the indictment was unreachable for comment. 
The National Security Act, enacted in 1948, has rarely been used in recent years. It was used to persecute thousands of political foes and dissenters under military dictatorships in South Korea in the 1960-80s. 
President Moon Jae-in has called for revising the law and his administration has loosened its enforcement amid efforts to improve inter-Korean relations.
Kim's lawyer, Jang Kyung-wook, said the charges against her were not only groundless but also a violation of human rights. 
""It would invite international ridicule if you charge someone who is only fighting to go back home with threatening national security for sharing her daughter's letters on Facebook,"" Jang said.

Britain's departure from the EU's orbit introduces reams of paperwork and costs that must be completed to move goods across the new customs border. For Irish firms, it means a 12-fold rise in the number of import and export declarations, the tax authority warned ahead of the changes.
Ireland's Revenue Commissioners said a significant number of firms are correctly submitting new customs declarations but it was aware that trucks had been denied boarding at Holyhead port in Wales and introduced a temporary fix late on Thursday.
Struggling firms can use an override code to complete safety and security Entry Summary Declarations (ESD) - a key customs formality - which will in turn make Revenue aware of which firms need help in adapting to the new customs formalities.
""It is clear that many were not as prepared as they thought or significantly underestimated what was involved in being Brexit-ready,"" a spokeswoman for the agency responsible for customs checks said in a statement.
Irish consumers are already experiencing difficulties with some British retailers pausing deliveries to Ireland, while Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) said Britain's withdrawal from EU trade rules was responsible for near-empty fresh-food aisles at some of its stores in Ireland this week.
Ferry firm Stena Line cancelled 12 sailings from Dublin to Holyhead and the southern Irish port of Rosslare to Fishguard in Wales over the next five days, citing a ""significant drop"" in freight volumes due to supply chain problems at a time when COVID-19 travel restrictions have hammered passenger demand.
One recent service from Rosslare had just four freight units, a spokesman for Stena told Reuters.
Stena recently doubled its direct Ireland to France freight service in response to demand for an alternative route to the British ""land-bridge"" used by around 3,000 lorries each week pre-Brexit to ship goods to and from mainland Europe.

SUKOHARJO, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian Islamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, the suspected mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people, walked free from prison on Friday after serving 10 years for setting up a militant training camp.
Authorities said Bashir, 82, who was never convicted of a direct role in the bombings, would enter a deradicalisation programme amid concerns over his continued influence in extremist circles.
Photographs showed him dressed in white and wearing a mask as he left the prison in Bogor, south of the capital Jakarta, before being driven to his home at an Islamic boarding school near the city of Solo in Central Java. 
""Abu Bakar Bashir was released from Gunung Sindur prison at 5.30 a.m.,"" Rika Aprianti, a spokeswoman for the corrections department, told reporters.
Bashir, 82, who is regarded as the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah (JI), a jihadist network with ties to al Qaeda, was imprisoned in 2011 for 15 years for his links to a militant training camp in Aceh province.
After periodic cuts in his jail term, he served 10 years. 
Although Indonesian police and intelligence agencies say Bashir was linked to the 2002 Bali attacks and a 2003 attack on the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta, he was never convicted of direct involvement and denied any ties.
A conviction for being part of a conspiracy to carry out the Bali bombings was later overturned. 
The Bali bombings killed 88 Australians, and the country has pressed Indonesia to ensure Bashir does not incite more violence.
On Friday, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Bashir's release was ""very distressing to the friends and families of the Australians, the 88 Australians, who were killed in the Bali bombings"".
Thiolina Marpaung, an Indonesian wounded in the 2002 attacks, said she wanted authorities to keep supervising Bashir.
""We don't know what he was doing in prison,"" she said by telephone. 
Bashir pledged allegiance to the militant group Islamic State in 2014 while in jail.
A spokesman for the Coogee Dolphins rugby club in Sydney, which lost its president and five members in the Bali attacks, said Bashir's release would be difficult. 
""Some will never forgive, there will be others who will be just angry today,"" said Albert Talarico. 
""Others will stay silent because they don't wish to have the old wounds opened again.""
DERADICALISATION PROGRAMME
Some Indonesians defended the release of the cleric, saying he had served his time and was a practising Muslim. 
""There are many people who discredit Muslims, thinking that we are related to terrorism, but...we are not,"" said Asqar Kustiwa, 63, a resident of Depok, near Jakarta.
Bashir will undergo a deradicalisation programme, Eddy Hartono of Indonesia's anti-terrorism agency said in a statement, adding that he hoped the cleric, after his release, ""can give peaceful, soothing preachings"".
In the wake of the Bali attacks, Indonesia set up an elite anti-terrorist unit that weakened JI and resulted in scores of suspected militants being arrested or killed.
But other extremist groups have since formed and conducted attacks in the world's biggest Muslim majority country while only last month police arrested 23 militants.
Ahead of the release, Abdul Rohim, Bashir's son, told Reuters his father would return to the Al Mukmin Islamic boarding school, which Bashir founded in the 1970s and whose graduates have been linked to militant networks and attacks.
""He has completed his term,"" Rohim said. ""This is purely over.""
JI's prominence is fading, say analysts, to be replaced by other Islamic State-inspired groups blamed for new attacks.
They say Bashir does not wield as much power over JI or other groups, but could still influence other militants.

""Bashir is an ideologue, his words will be followed and made examples of,"" said analyst Stanislaus Riyanta.

Tensions have grown between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump exited the deal between Iran and six world powers - which sought to limit Tehran’s nuclear programme and prevent it developing atomic weapons - and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.
In retaliation, Tehran started gradually violating the accord.

Beijing, which claims the self-governed island as its own territory, has been angered by stepped-up support for Taiwan from the outgoing Trump administration, including trips to Taipei by top U.S. officials, further straining Sino-U.S. ties.
Chinese fighter jets approached the island in August and September during the last two visits - by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment Keith Krach, respectively.
""During her trip, the Ambassador will reinforce the U.S. government's strong and ongoing support for Taiwan's international space in accord with the U.S. one-China policy that is guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the three U.S.-PRC joint communiques, and the Six Assurances to Taiwan,"" the U.S. mission to the United Nations said in a statement on Thursday.
She will be in Taiwan from Jan. 13 to 15, it added. 
While the United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is the island's strongest international backer and arms supplier, being obliged to help provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.
China said it was firmly opposed to the visit.
""We wish to remind the United States that whoever plays with fire will burn himself. The United States will pay a heavy price for its wrong action,"" China's U.N. mission said. 
""China strongly urges the United States to stop its crazy provocation, stop creating new difficulties for China-U.S. relations and the two countries' cooperation in the United Nations, and stop going further on the wrong path.""
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Friday that Craft, whom it called a ""staunch friend"", would meet President Tsai Ing-wen and Foreign Minister Joseph Wu.
The visit is highly symbolic as Taiwan is not a U.N. member, because of objections by China, which views the island as one of its provinces and not a country, and that only Beijing has a right to speak for Taiwan on the international stage.
Taiwan says that right belongs to its democratically elected government, not China, and has complained of Chinese pressure preventing it from getting real-time information from the World Health Organization during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Craft will likely bring up that issue.
The U.S. mission said that while in Taipei she would give a speech on ""Taiwan's impressive contributions to the global community and the importance of Taiwan's meaningful and expanded participation in international organisations"". 

In a September post on Twitter, she called for Taiwan's ""full participation at the UN"", following a meeting with Taiwan's de facto consul general in New York.

SEOUL (Reuters) - With South Korea's ski resorts closed in recent weeks to help combat COVID-19, heavy snowfalls have led to a surge in sales of sledges as winter sports lovers look for family friendly snow slopes close to home.
Major retailers have run out of stocks of plastic sledges, with E-Mart, the country's biggest supermarket chain, selling nearly 2,200 sledges in six days, more than three times its total 2020 sales.
Competitor Lotte Mart said sales of sledges in the first six days of January were up more than six-fold from the same period last year and is also completely out of stock.
One family that visited the Olympic Park in Seoul said they had to bring picnic mats for their children the slide on.
""We tried to buy sledges yesterday but couldn't find one, so we brought these mats as substitutes. It's still great that our kids can enjoy sledding and that we have a place near home where it can replace the sledding parks,"" said Joe Choong-hyun, a father of two boys.
After heavy snowfalls earlier in the week, children played outdoors even as the temperature in Seoul plummeted to -18.6 Celsius (-1.5 Fahrenheit) on Friday, the coldest in 35 years.
""I'm happy that the snow is still piled up so I can make more snowmen and have snowball fights,"" said 11-year-old Kim Ha-jin, who was sledding on a small slope.
A photo of a person snowboarding on a snow covered road in the middle of Seoul went viral on Twitter, while a Youtuber who posted a video of himself skiing around his town scored nearly 43,000 views.

Ski resorts, meanwhile, resumed business earlier this week, but only with limited capacity and operating hours, following a cluster of infections at a resort in Pyeongchang county, site of the 2018 Winter Olympics.

349,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>",North Korea's Kim vows to comprehensively expand diplomacy at party congress,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un explored ways to renew inter-Korean ties and vowed to expand diplomatic relations, state media said on Friday, as he hosted a rare party congress less than two weeks before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
The eighth congress of the ruling Workers' Party came amid a prolonged gridlock in negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes in return for U.S. sanction relief.
On its third day on Thursday, Kim raised the issue of reshaping South Korean affairs ""as required by the prevailing situation and the changed times"" and discussed foreign policy, the official KCNA news agency reported, without elaborating. 
He ""declared the general orientation and the policy stand of our party for comprehensively expanding and developing the external relations,"" KCNA said. 
Biden will come into office facing the thorny task of engineering a breakthrough in the stalemate, after a second summit between Kim and outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019 failed to reach agreement.
Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said Kim was likely seeking to play a more proactive role in South Korea and U.S. ties, emboldened by his country's elevated standing after successful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests in 2017 and summits with Trump. 
""He appears to be gauging how to set relations with the Biden administration based on what they see as a self-defensive nuclear deterrent,"" Yang said. 
'WHOLESOME AND REVOLUTIONARY LIFESTYLE'
Despite a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and ICBM testing in 2018, North Korea continued to beef up its weapons programmes, unveiling what was deemed its largest ICBM yet at a parade in October. 
Kim on Wednesday vowed to boost military capabilities to a ""much higher level."" 
Inter-Korean relations made some headway around 2018 summits but have soured as the nuclear talks stalled. 
An official at Seoul's Unification Ministry said it was the first time North Korea used the phrase ""South Korea affairs,"" which it would usually refer to by ""North-South relations,"" and the government is closely monitoring developments.
Kim also discussed ways to open ""a fresh golden age"" in its campaign for socialist culture. Pyongyang has intensified its crackdown on outside information, enacting a new law last month banning foreign materials that could instigate ""reactionary thought.""
Kim called for ""establishing our own wholesome and revolutionary lifestyle in all spheres of social life and thoroughly eliminating non-socialist elements,"" KCNA said. 
The gathering is aimed at reviewing the party's work since its last meeting in 2016 and outlining a new five-year economic plan, and diplomatic and military blueprints.
KCNA said the congress will continue on Friday, the young leader's birthday, which North Korea was seen preparing to celebrate with a military parade and other events. 
Kim is expected to give a public message about his new plans once the meeting is over. It lasted four days in 2016, but the longest congress was in 1970 which took 12 days.

Canadian Pound, the longest-serving member of the International Olympics Committee (IOC), told Sky News in the UK that the Games could still go ahead with mass athlete participation, but only if they were vaccinated.
""In Canada where we might have 300 or 400 athletes - to take 300 or 400 vaccines out of several million in order to have Canada represented at an international event of this stature, character and level - I don't think there would be any kind of a public outcry about that,"" Pound told Sky News.
""It's a decision for each country to make and there will be people saying they are jumping the queue but I think that is the most realistic way of it going ahead.""
During his visit to Tokyo in November, IOC President Thomas Bach said athletes would be encouraged to get the vaccine but it would not be mandatory for their participation in the Games.
Separately, Pound told the BBC the ever-changing nature of the coronavirus pandemic meant nobody could be sure whether the Games would go ahead in less than 200 days. 
""I can't be certain because the ongoing elephant in the room would be the surges in the virus,"" Pound said, according to the BBC.
Over 15,000 athletes from almost every country in the world are expected to descend on Tokyo for the Olympics, which start on July 23, and the subsequent Paralympics.
Fears over whether the Games can be held in Tokyo have increased in the last few weeks as COVID-19 cases surge in Japan and around the world.

Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga reiterated on Thursday his intention to hold the Games, even as he declared a state of emergency in the capital and surrounding prefectures [M1L4N2JI042].

352,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 09:20PM ET</span>","Factbox: Bombings, shootings, beatings - U.S. Capitol's history of violence","By Steve Gorman
(Reuters) - The storming of the halls of Congress by a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters marks the latest episode of violence to darken the U.S. Capitol in a history dating back to a British arson attack in Washington during the War of 1812.
With four lives lost on the Capitol grounds - one woman shot by police and three fatalities attributed by authorities to medical emergencies - Wednesday's turmoil appeared to rank as the deadliest incident of violence to unfold in and around the citadel of American democracy in 200 years.
But this week's upheaval also stood out in one other notable respect, its White House origins, said David Meyer, a sociology professor at the University of California, Irvine.
""The Capitol is a magnet for protest, and sometimes it's violent,"" Meyer, author of ""The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America,"" told Reuters. ""What’s really unusual this time is a president of the United States explicitly encouraging people to take up violent means against his political opponents.""
The following chronology recounts some of the most notorious acts of violence to flare at the Capitol - shootings, bombings, a knife attack, a beating by cane and even an assassination attempt.
1814 - Invading British forces torched the original Capitol building while it was still under construction, setting bonfires of furniture in the House of Representatives and the original Supreme Court chamber.
1835 - In the first known attempt on a U.S. president's life, a disgruntled house painter tried to shoot Andrew Jackson as he emerged from a funeral in the House chamber. The assailant's two flintlock derringers both misfired, and an enraged Jackson clubbed the would-be assassin with his walking stick before the man was subdued. The suspect was found not guilty by reason of insanity and confined to a mental institution.
1856 - An abolitionist senator, Charles Sumner of Massachusetts, was savagely beaten with a cane by his South Carolina colleague, Preston Brooks, on the Senate floor after delivering a speech criticizing slavery.
1915 - A former Harvard University German language professor used a timing device to detonate three sticks of dynamite in an empty Senate reception room during a holiday recess. The professor, angry that American financiers were aiding the British against Germany during World War One, then fled to New York, where he shot and slightly injured banker J.P. Morgan. He was subsequently captured and later took his own life in jail.
1954 - A group of four armed Puerto Rican nationalists indiscriminately opened fire on the House floor from the visitors' gallery and unfurled a Puerto Rican flag. Five members of Congress were wounded. The four assailants - three men and a woman - were apprehended and sentenced to lengthy prison terms, which President Jimmy Carter commuted in 1979.
1971 - A bomb planted by the radical antiwar group Weather Underground to protest the U.S.-backed invasion of Laos was detonated in a restroom on the Senate side of the Capitol, causing extensive damage but no casualties.
1983 - A bomb concealed under a bench outside the Senate chamber exploded, blowing the hinges off the door to the office of then-Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd and damaging a portrait of renowned lawyer-statesman Daniel Webster. No one was hurt. A militant leftist group said it carried out the bombing in retaliation for U.S. military involvement in Lebanon and Grenada.
1998 - An armed man stormed through a U.S. Capitol security checkpoint and opened fire, fatally wounding two police officers, and made his way to the Republican Whip's office of Representative Tom DeLay. A tourist also was injured. The two slain officers became the first private citizens to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda.
2001 - United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a Pennsylvania field after passengers stormed the cockpit to overpower suicide hijackers, whose likely intended target was later determined by investigators to have been the U.S. Capitol.
2013 - A woman who tried to drive through a White House security checkpoint was chased by authorities to the Capitol, where she was shot dead. Her baby daughter was found unharmed in the vehicle.

2021 - Hundreds of pro-Trump supporters stormed the Capitol and occupied the building for hours, ransacking offices, forcing an evacuation of lawmakers and interrupting their certification of the November presidential election. One woman in the mob was shot to death by police in a corridor of the building. Three other people died of medical emergencies on the Capitol grounds during the tumult.

353,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 08:50PM ET</span>",China state media says U.S. Capitol storm reflects leadership failures,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) -The storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump reflects a failure of leadership as well as the deep divide running through American society, editorials in China's state media said on Friday.
Hundreds of supporters of President Trump besieged the Capitol on Wednesday in what House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi described as ""an armed insurrection against America"".
Chinese government-run newspapers used the events to step up its war of words against the United States, with bilateral relations already at a low ebb amid tensions over trade, human rights and the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The Global Times, a tabloid owned by the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party newspaper, described the riots as a sign of ""internal collapse"" in the U.S. political system that could not easily be reversed.
""The unprecedented mob in the Capitol, a symbol of the U.S. system, is the result of the U.S. society's severe division and the country's failure to control such division,"" it said. 
""As time goes by and with abuses of resources by generations of politicians, the U.S. political system has degraded,"" the paper added.
It also lashed out at what it described as ""double standards"" among U.S. politicians, taking aim at Pelosi's description of the Hong Kong protests in 2019 as ""a beautiful sight to behold"". 
""In Hong Kong, violent actions are described as a 'beautiful sight,' in the U.S., people involved in this chaos are called 'mobs',"" the Global Times said.
Pelosi's comments have been widely mocked on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) service, with the Communist Party Youth League also using the words ""beautiful sight"" to describe the unrest in Washington.
Other netizens described the riots as ""karma"", and one joked that this was the first attempted coup in the Americas that happened ""without the involvement of U.S. embassies"", according to the Global Times. 
State broadcaster CCTV used the crisis to lambast the U.S. political system, saying ""the figleaf of so-called American democracy has been torn clean off"".
""The United States, which has always promoted democracy and human rights, is now the country of riots, conflicts and curfews,"" it said. 
The official China Daily newspaper said the ""narrow nationalism"" of President Trump had taken a toll on the United States. 

""The violence and chaos that have erupted in the U.S. over the past year show what happens when a country's leaders lose touch with reality,"" it added.

354,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 07:15PM ET</span>",Ethiopian general says Eritrean troops entered Tigray: video clip,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - A senior Ethiopian general said in a video clip posted on social media this week that Eritrean troops had entered the country uninvited while his soldiers were battling a rebellious force in the northern region of Tigray.
The video, whose authenticity Reuters could not independently verify, shows Major General Belay Seyoum addressing a meeting in the Tigrayan capital Mekelle in late December. 
""An army that we don't want has entered. Are we the one that invited them? No,"" he said. ""They just entered by themselves, and this has to be made clear.""
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's spokeswoman, the head of Ethiopia's emergency taskforce on Tigray and a military spokesman did not respond to questions about the footage. Neither did Eritrea's information minister, Yemane Meskel.
Belay's comments could alarm Western allies concerned that such an incursion might aggravate a conflict in Tigray that has already killed thousands.
Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a peace pact ending two decades of hostilities in 2018 and now regard the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) as a mutual foe. 
Both nations have denied any involvement by Eritrean troops inside Tigray, but the U.S. State Department said last month it believed reports of their presence were credible. 
A clip of Belay talking about other issues at a meeting in Mekelle was posted on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page run by the administration of Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa on Dec. 25. The backdrop and position of eight microphones in that clip of Belay matched the video of the general circulating on social media this week.
""My conscience doesn't allow me to ask the Eritrean army to help us,"" Belay said in the new clip. ""We should solve our internal problems by ourselves.""
'WORKING TO MAKE THEM LEAVE'
The TPLF, the former ruling party in Tigray, has accused Eritrea of deploying troops in support of Abiy's military campaign in the region. It has fired rockets into Eritrea at least four times since the conflict erupted on Nov. 4. 
The conflicting accounts are difficult to verify as most communications to Tigray went down on Nov. 4. Some phone lines have been restored in recent weeks, but the government still tightly controls access to the region.
In another video posted on social media this week, Ataklti Haileselassie, the new government-appointed mayor of Mekelle, appears to discuss Eritrean troops entering Tigray.
""They entered because the military command that was most capable of protecting the area was attacked from behind,"" Ataklti said in the video broadcast by state-run Tigray TV. ""The government is working to make them leave this area quickly.""
Ataklti confirmed to Reuters that he was speaking in the video but declined to say whether the troops he referred to were Eritrean. He said General Belay had already addressed that question. 
Mulu Nega, interim head of Tigray appointed by the federal government, declined to comment. 
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous nation and a diplomatic heavyweight that hosts the African Union. Eritrea has never held elections, has no independent media and forces its citizens into indefinite government service.

The war in Tigray is believed to have killed thousands of people and sent more than 56,000 fleeing to Sudan. Abiy declared victory at the end of November but the TPLF vowed to fight on.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some of the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol were fired from their jobs on Thursday after internet sleuths publicized their identities. 
The District of Columbia police department released https://mpdc.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/mpdc/publication/attachments/POIs%20of%20Interest_1.7.21.pdf photos of people in Wednesday's melee and potential charges against them. Some 68 people were arrested after angry protesters stormed the building, breaking windows, damaging fixtures and stealing furnishings. 
The FBI also asked the public to help it identify rioters, a call that drew ribbing on social media in light of the prolific coverage of the event. This included selfies posted by participants and videos https://twitter.com/WilliamTurton/status/1346980282243678209 of President Donald Trump's supporters at area hotels before the attack.

Online detectives focused their efforts on others. 
""Let's name and shame them!,"" read one Twitter thread https://twitter.com/Gagladla/status/1347165155092799491 devoted to outing participants. 
One of the people shown in the D.C. police photos wore his work identification badge inside the capitol and was identified and fired by his employer, Navistar (NYSE:NAV) Direct Marketing of Fredrick, Maryland.
""While we support all employees' right to peaceful, lawful exercise of free speech, any employee demonstrating dangerous conduct that endangers the health and safety of others will no longer have an employment opportunity with Navistar Direct Marketing,"" the company said in a statement, without naming the man. 
Libby Andrews, a real estate agent from Chicago, was fired by @properties and removed from its website, even though she had done nothing wrong and had not entered the capitol, she said in an interview. 
""I'm a 56-year-old woman, petite. I was not there causing trouble. I was there to support my president,"" said Andrews. 
Andrews said she had climbed the steps of the Capitol without encountering security, posted selfies from the scene on Instagram, sang the national anthem and then moved on. Online critics were quick to post negative reviews of her real estate work on a ratings site. 
Rick Saccone, an adjunct professor at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, resigned after the college reviewed a video he posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) from the scene. ""As a result of that investigation, Dr. Saccone has submitted and we have accepted his letter of resignation, effective immediately,"" the college said in a statement. 
Saccone, reached by phone, confirmed his resignation and said he did not see acts of violence and never crossed the threshold of the capitol. Saccone said he deleted the video, which could not be viewed on Thursday. 
Paul Davis, a lawyer at Westlake, Texas-based Goosehead Insurance, used a social media account to broadcast his participation at the capitol, saying that he had been teargassed. 
A Goosehead spokesperson confirmed Davis had been fired.

Merkel has said she will not run for a fifth term in the election and her Christian Democrats (CDU) are to pick a new leader next week. The winner would be a favourite to stand as chancellor but someone else could stand, not least because the CDU's Bavarian sister party has to back the candidate.
Citing party sources, Bild said Spahn, who has been in the spotlight during the coronavirus pandemic, had discussed his future role with various influential CDU politicians in the last few weeks.
A chairman of a CDU state association told the paper that Spahn was ""very openly thinking about running and is saying so quite clearly in talks"". 
In addition, a CDU state parliamentary party leader told Bild: ""Jens Spahn has made it clear to me that he is open to running for chancellor if his poll ratings in March are much better than (Armin) Laschet's.""
Laschet is one of the candidates vying for the CDU leadership, to be decided at a Jan. 15-16 conference. Spahn, 40, has backed Laschet for that job. He faces long-time Merkel rival Friedrich Merz and foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen. 

Spahn was a fierce critic of Merkel's 2015 open-door migrant policy and lost a CDU leadership election in 2018. He won respect for Germany's handing of the first coronavirus wave but is now facing some criticism for a slow vaccine rollout.

Many of the victims were Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada. Last month Iran's cabinet allocated $150,000 for each family of the 176 people who died when Revolutionary Guards downed the Ukraine International Airlines plane near Tehran on Jan. 8, 2020.
Former Canadian cabinet minister Ralph Goodale, charged with helping the victims' families, said the amount of compensation could only be agreed at special talks between Iran and the five nations whose citizens had died.

Goodale declined to say what the appropriate amount should be, noting legal experts had speculated it could significantly exceed $150,000.
""There is enormous work yet to be done on how much"" Iran should pay, he said.
Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Iran had yet to answer ""many legitimate questions"" about how and why the plane had been shot down.

Iran has been supplying gasoline to ease fuel shortages in Venezuela caused by decay of the South American nation's refineries and worsened by sanctions. It has also shipped food to help the government of President Nicolas Maduro.

Venezuela's information ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Iran's embassy in Venezuela did not answer calls.
The Golsan in July brought food to supply Venezuela's first Iranian supermarket. The vessel later returned to Iran carrying a cargo of alumina, a powder refined from bauxite that is used for manufacturing aluminum.

""Turkey is not categorically against France, but France has been against Turkey categorically since Operation Peace Spring,"" Cavusoglu said. Ankara views the YPG as a terrorist organisation linked to Kurdish militants on its own soil.
""In the end, we had a very constructive phone conversation with my French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian and we agreed that we should work on a roadmap to normalise relations,"" he said. 
""We have been working on an action plan, or roadmap, to normalise relations and it has been going well... If France is sincere, Turkey is ready to normalise ties with France as well."" 
Last month, the EU prepared punitive measures over Turkey's dispute with members Greece and Cyprus over rights to offshore resources in the eastern Mediterranean, but decided to postpone the measures until March despite an earlier push by France to sanction Ankara.

After months of tensions, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed their differences in a phone call in September, agreeing to improve ties. But, the two presidents later traded accusations over a host of issues as tensions flared again.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Mexico's president on Thursday blasted social media companies for blocking the accounts of President Donald Trump for his part in chaotic scenes in Washington on Wednesday, again appearing to cleave to his U.S. counterpart in a contentious dispute.
Four people died during the havoc that erupted after pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to force Congress to block the appointment of President-elect Joe Biden, whose Nov. 3 election victory Trump has cast as fraudulent.
Many U.S. allies condemned the events at the Capitol, which Biden said bordered on ""sedition.""
However, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was reluctant to comment on what occurred at the Capitol, reiterating a position that his government does not meddle in the affairs of other nations.
 Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR),  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and  Snap Inc  (NYSE:SNAP) temporarily blocked Trump's accounts as they scrambled to contain his baseless claims about the presidential election amid the riots. 
That decision, said Lopez Obrador, was not acceptable.
""I don't like censorship,"" he told a news conference. ""I don't like anyone to be censored and for them to have their right taken away to send a message on Twitter or on Facebook.""
Lopez Obrador, who waited weeks to congratulate Biden on his election victory, arguing that disputes over the process needed to be resolved first, did not mention Trump by name. But he brought up the social media intervention without prompting.
By then some critics of the Mexican president were complaining on social media that he had not been forceful enough in rejecting the storming of the Capitol.
""We're not going to intervene in these matters, which are up to the Americans to resolve, to deal with. That's our policy, that's what I can say,"" Lopez Obrador said earlier in the news briefing when asked to comment on what happened in Congress.
His government was less hesitant to raise concerns about events abroad in 2019 when it called the ousting of Bolivia's leader Evo Morales a coup and gave him political asylum.
Lopez Obrador this week offered asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on the day a British court rejected a bid by the United States to secure his extradition for alleged offenses committed during the Obama administration, when Biden was vice-president. That offer upset some Biden supporters.
A combative leftist, Lopez Obrador in 2006 led massive protests in Mexico claiming he had been robbed of the presidency. He again cried foul when he was defeated in 2012, and finally won office by a landslide six years later.
A critic of Trump while in opposition, Lopez Obrador as president has regularly paid tribute to the U.S. leader, who is widely disliked in Mexico for his insults against migrants, and threats to inflict economic pain on the country.
Lopez Obrador expressed regret that lives had been lost in Washington on Wednesday and said he had always believed that conflicts should be resolved ""via dialogue and peaceful means"".

Facebook said Thursday it was extending the suspension on Trump's accounts at least until his term ends.

The precise circumstances of the raid on Sunday in central Mali's remote Douentza area remain unclear. The incident comes at a moment of rising anti-French sentiment in Mali regarding the former colonial power's seven-year military intervention.
Jeunesse Tabital Pulaaku, an advocacy group for Fulani herders, published a list on Thursday of 19 people it said were killed, including the father of the groom, and seven more it said were wounded in the strike while attending a wedding.
""Those who were killed were civilians,"" Hamadoun Dicko, the group's president told Reuters. ""Whether there were jihadists around at the moment of the raid or not, I don't know."" 
A health worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Tuesday that civilians had been mistakenly hit in the strike.
The French government has not made an official statement on the strike. A French army source said on Tuesday that the targets were Islamist fighters whose identities were confirmed by drone before the attack and on the ground afterwards.
In its first public comment on the matter, Mali's defence ministry said on Thursday that the strike took place during a joint operation with French forces and killed about 30 militants, according to surveillance images.
""There was no sign of a marriage, women or children,"" it said in a statement. 
France has more than 5,100 military personnel based in Mali and other former colonies in West Africa to help counter militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
But its intervention has come at a cost. Five French soldiers were killed in Mali in recent days and Malian citizens have increasingly taken to the streets and social media to voice opposition to France's military presence.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's capital will enter a strict quarantine until Tuesday due to rising coronavirus infection numbers and suspicions a new variant of the virus is circulating, Mayor of Bogota Claudia Lopez said on Thursday.
Strict quarantines have already been imposed on three Bogota neighborhoods this week to try and control rising coronavirus infections, which Lopez said could be caused by a new variant of the virus first identified in the United Kingdom.
People throughout the capital will be largely confined to their homes from midnight on Thursday until four o'clock in the morning on Tuesday, said Lopez, declaring a red alert in the city. Non-essential shops and businesses will be closed and one person per household will be allowed to buy food or medicine.
Curfews lasting from eight at night until four in the morning will then run until Jan. 17. 
""We are confronting a new strain of COVID which is very possibly already circulating in Bogota,"" Lopez told a news conference. ""We can't see any other reason for the viral load we are finding in patients.""
U.K. case numbers have risen sharply, driven in part by a new variant of the virus that is up to 70% more transmissible than the original. But Colombia's health ministry said there was no proof the variant had reached the country.
""Right now there's no scientific evidence that accelerating COVID-19 transmission in Colombia can be attributed to the new British strain,"" Ministry of Health director for epidemiology and demography, said in a statement.
Colombia has reported more than 1.7 million coronavirus infections and 44,723 deaths from COVID-19, the disease it causes. 
In Bogota, which counts for over a quarter of national cases, occupancy of intensive care units for coronavirus stands at 83.9%, according to local government figures. 
The neighborhoods of Usaquen, Suba, and Engativa will remain in strict quarantine as planned until Jan. 18 and strict quarantines will be extended in the neighborhoods of Kennedy, Fontibon, and Teusaquillo until Jan. 22, Lopez said.

368,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",Uganda's Bobi Wine asks ICC to investigate rights abuses,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Uganda's main opposition leader asked the International Criminal Court on Thursday to investigate President Yoweri Museveni and senior officials for sanctioning human rights abuses in the run-up to next week's presidential election.
Popstar-turned-lawmaker Robert Kyagulanyi, who goes by the name Bobi Wine, told reporters during a Zoom news conference from his car on the campaign trail that his lawyer had submitted the filing to The Hague court on Thursday.
The ICC has the authority to hear cases of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity committed in the 123 countries, including Uganda, that have signed up to it.
Uganda has in the past sought the ICC's help in bringing leaders of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army to justice though it has more recently accused The Hague court of targeting Africans, a common sentiment on the continent.
The 41-page brief filed by Wine requests the ICC investigate Museveni, Security Minister Elly Tumwine and eight senior security officials. It asks the ICC to consider incidents dating back to 2018, saying the police and military have deployed, ""widespread use of shoot to kill, beatings and other violence"". 
""As we do with all such communications, we will analyse the materials submitted, as appropriate, in accordance with the Rome Statute and with full independence and impartiality,"" the office of the ICC prosecutor said.
The ICC receives hundreds of briefs a year and a filing does not automatically lead to any investigation.
""That is sheer desperation,"" Okello Oryem, Uganda's state minister for foreign affairs, told Reuters. 
""(The opposition) have tried everything under the sun, they have failed. Now they are resorting to the ICC. We are a law abiding country, we are a peace loving country,"" he said.
MORE ARRESTS
During the Zoom call, Wine, who was wearing a helmet and flak jacket, could be seen being dragged from his car by men in police uniforms demanding he move his vehicle from the roadside. 
The news conference resumed several minutes later.
""I expect a live bullet targeted at me any time. The biggest safety we get is from having cameras around us. If I was not on camera maybe something worse would have happened,"" he said.
Wine, 38, has been arrested multiple times while campaigning for breaking laws governing public order and COVID-19 restrictions on large gatherings.
Security forces routinely disperse his rallies with tear gas, rubber bullets, beatings and detentions. At least 54 people died in protests that erupted when Wine was detained in November. 
Previous presidential campaigns have been marked by the intimidation of opposition candidates though rights groups say crackdowns have been more brutal and widespread this time.
Watchdogs Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have said in recent statements that the authorities have violently repressed the opposition and its supporters during campaigning.

Earlier on Thursday, 23 members of Wine's campaign staff were arrested, he told reporters on the Zoom call. The police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The far-right leader repeated claims of widespread fraud in the Nov. 3 vote and said Brazil's electronic voting system, internationally praised for its efficiency and speed in counting ballots, can be manipulated.
Hundreds of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in a harrowing assault on American democracy. A shaken Congress early on Thursday formally certified Democrat Joe Biden's election victory.
Bolsonaro, an admirer of Trump and whose anti-establishment style of politics he has mimicked, advocates a return to printed ballots for the 2022 presidential election, in which he plans to seek a second term.
""What happened in the American elections? Basically, what was ... the cause of the whole crisis? The lack of confidence in the vote,"" he told supporters outside his residence.
Bolsonaro said, without giving any evidence, that there were people who voted three or four times, and dead people had voted.
""Here, in Brazil, if you have electronic voting, it will be the same. Fraud exists,"" he said. ""If we don't have the ballot printed in 2022, a way to audit the votes, we're going to have bigger problems than the United States,"" he said.

    The chief of Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) told parliament on Monday that he could confirm the arrest of people from a ""Chinese network"" but said he could not provide details due to the sensitivity of the case.
India's Hindustan Times newspaper said at least 10 Chinese nationals linked to Beijing's spy agency had been detained in December in Kabul and later pardoned and deported.
   Three high-ranking sources in Afghanistan told Reuters that 13 Chinese nationals, working as construction workers, carpenters and even running a clinic and bakery, were deported. 
    ""I'm unaware of what you mentioned,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a media briefing in Beijing on Wednesday when asked about the Hindustan Times report.
""But I want to tell you that China and Afghanistan's relations have always been very friendly, and our cooperation is very friendly in every field and is proceeding normally.""
China has looked to increase its influence and connectivity in the region through financing development projects under its Belt and Road Initiative. Beijing has expressed interest in extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to neighbouring Afghanistan.
Chinese investment would be critical for Kabul as Western funding falls and becomes increasingly conditions-based. 
    On Monday, Afghan NDS chief Ahmad Zia Saraj told parliament: “Regarding the Chinese network, I can confirm for you that, yes, they have been arrested; however, I can't go into the details because of the sensitivity of the case.” 
    The high-ranking Afghan sources, at senior posts in the government, told Reuters that documents and materials the arrested Chinese nationals possessed showed they were working with an ""unknown"" Pakistani man believed to be a go-between Taliban insurgents, fighting the U.S.-backed government in Kabul, and Islamabad.
A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabihullah Mujahid, rejected any connection. 
""It is nothing but mere propaganda,"" Mujahid told Reuters in a message.
    Pakistan's foreign office and the Afghan Presidential Palace did not respond to requests for comment.
    The high-ranking officials added that a special envoy of the Chinese government flew to Kabul and demanded the release of the detained people - and Afghan officials, including President Ashraf Ghani, asked for a formal apology. 
    The envoy, the officials said, told the Afghan officials that his government was unaware of the activities of the 13 men and women, and would investigate, following which the 13 flew back to China towards the end of last year.

The indictment is the second against Demirtas, a former co-leader of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and presidential candidate, related to October 2014 protests in the mainly Kurdish southeast.
Thirty seven people died in clashes during the protests, which began over accusations that the army stood by as Islamic State militants besieged the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani, in plain view just across the Turkish border.
An indictment calling for 38 counts of life sentences without parole against 108 defendants, including Demirtas, was accepted by an Ankara court on Thursday, state-owned Anadolu agency said.
It reported last week that the charges included 37 cases of homicide and disrupting the unity and territorial integrity of the state.
Of the defendants, 27 are jailed pending trial, 75 have arrest warrants against them and six were detained then released with judicial measures, state broadcaster TRT Haber said.
Last month the ECHR called for Demirtas' release, saying the justification for holding him for more than four years in prison was a cover for limiting pluralism and debate and the evidence did not back up the terrorism-charges directed at him.
While ECHR decisions are binding, Turkey has ignored several recent rulings. President Tayyip Erdogan accused the ECHR of hypocrisy after the ruling, saying Demirtas was a terrorist responsible for the deaths of tens of people.
Demirtas has faced several trials on different charges.
In 2019 a court lifted an arrest warrant in the first case related to the Kobani protests, while another agreed to release Demirtas given time already served from a previous sentence. But a new arrest warrant related to the same events in 2014 kept him in jail.
The ECHR said his continued detention on such similar grounds would amount to a ""prolongation of the violation of his rights.""
Turkish authorities said the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) - designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union - incited the protests and that the HDP supported them. The HDP, Turkey's third largest party, denies links to terrorism.

The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - A gay Indonesian policeman dismissed from the force because of his sexual orientation has lost his legal fight to be reinstated, after a Central Java court rejected his lawsuit, his lawyers said on Thursday. 
Tri Teguh Pujianto, a 31-year-old former police brigadier, was fired in 2018 after 10 years in the job, after police from a different town apprehended he and his partner on Valentine's Day when they were saying their goodbyes at his partner's workplace.
Teguh's lawyers from the non-governmental group Community Legal Aid Institute in a statement said the local administrative court had rejected his suit.
The court's website confirmed that a decision had been made but did not state the outcome. A court official contacted by Reuters did not immediately respond to a request for comment
Aisya Humaida, one of Teguh's lawyers, said they were still considering their options, including an appeal.
She expressed disappointment at the court's decision not to proceed with a case during which the legal team had sought to prove that discrimination had occurred. 
A spokesman for Central Java police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Deemed a landmark case by rights groups, it was initially thrown out in 2019 because a judge told Teguh that an internal police appeals process had yet to be completed. He resubmitted his lawsuit last August.
Apart from the sharia-ruled province of Aceh where same-sex relations are banned, homosexuality is not illegal in Indonesia although it is widely seen as taboo.
Central Java police had accused Teguh of violating police ethical codes ""by the deviant act of having same-sex intercourse"", according to a court document. 
Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International Indonesia, said the ruling ""could create a bad and dangerous precedent for other members of the police"".
Teguh told Reuters in an interview last month that his most current suit was his ""last-ditch effort.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Australia's financial watchdog is reviewing its calculation that transfers worth US$1.8 billion had been sent to the country from the Vatican since 2014, after Vatican and Australian Church calls for clarification.
A senior Vatican official and an Australian bishop told Reuters last week they had no knowledge of the transfers and would be seeking clarification.
The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) cited the amount in response to a parliamentary question by Australian Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells. AUSTRAC said about 47,000 separate transfers were involved.
After the Vatican said it was ""stunned"" by the figures, the Australian financial watchdog said on Thursday:
""AUSTRAC is currently undertaking a detailed review of the figures and is working with the Holy See and Vatican City State Financial Intelligence Unit on this matter.""
A source familiar with recent exchanges said AUSTRAC had contacted the Vatican's financial watchdog and was looking into ""the integrity of the data"" it used to calculate its figures.
AUSTRAC said in response to Fierravanti-Wells' question that the transfers ranged from yearly totals of A$71.6 million (US$55.2 million) in 2014 to A$581.3 million in 2017.
""That amount of money and that number of transfers did not leave the Vatican City,"" a senior Vatican official with knowledge of the city-state's finances told Reuters last week.
Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane said the Australian Church was not aware of any such transfers, that the money did not go to a diocese or Church entity in the country, and that the bishops would be seeking clarification from the Vatican and AUSTRAC.
Fierravanti-Wells had asked what funds had been transferred to Australia ""from the Vatican or any of its entities, or individuals associated with the Vatican or Vatican entities"" since 2014.
The Vatican has more than 100 legal entities, including hospitals and other bodies, in Italy and elsewhere.
An outside financial expert with experience in direct dealing with Vatican finances said the question posed by the senator was so broad that only a comprehensive review could shed light on where the money came from and where it wound up.
The expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that it was surprising red flags had not come up before for such large yearly amounts and that much depended on the methodology used to track the transfers.

The clash underscored the deep tensions following the Dec. 7 election that has led to rare unrest in Ghana, a major cocoa and gold producer seen as a bastion of democracy in West Africa. 
It started when one member of parliament from the president's NPP party snatched some paper ballots during an overnight vote to determine the house speaker, according to a source who was present. 
It was not immediately clear why the lawmaker was angry. Last month's elections left a hung parliament, without a dominant party to push through the appointment of speaker and other key posts.
Footage on local television showed politicians, many of them unmasked, pushing and shoving before about 20 soldiers entered the chamber. Ranks of MPs then faced each other and chanted over a dividing line of masked soldiers and police.
Eventually, Alban Bagbin, the candidate from Ghana's other main party, the NDC, was voted in as speaker.
""The attempt to snatch ballot papers ... and the invasion of the Chamber by armed military personnel are images one had never expected to see in our 4th Republican Parliament,"" said losing presidential candidate John Mahama in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post congratulating Bagbin. 
The incident occurred as preparations were underway for the swearing in of Akufo-Addo for his second term at a ceremony on the parliament grounds. Dignitaries from across Africa are expected to attend. 
Akufo-Addo was declared the winner of last month's election with 51.59%, ahead of former President Mahama, who got 47.37%. 
Mahama's party has said it will contest the results in court, alleging fraud though it has not published evidence.

Babis had professed support for Trump and told him on a 2019 White House visit he had ""a similar plan to make the Czech Republic great again"".
But Babis, like Trump a businessman-turned-politician, has joined a chorus of European leaders expressing shock after Trump supporters stormed the building housing the U.S. Congress on Wednesday in a stunning bid to overturn his election defeat. 
Early on Thursday Babis changed his longtime Twitter profile photo from an image showing him wearing his red cap to one with him wearing a respirator mask with the Czech flag on it, in an allusion to efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. 
Babis said in a statement, sent via a spokesman, that the red cap had been inspired by Trump and had been his ANO party's symbol going into 2019 European Parliament elections.
""After the unprecedented attack on democracy in the United States, which I have unequivocally condemned, I deemed it fit to express my stance also by changing my profile photo,"" he said in the statement, which echoed comments against the assault that he had posted earlier on Twitter.
In an earlier social media post, Babis said the assault on the U.S. Capitol was unacceptable.

""I have always condemned violence and chaos like this. Transition of power needs to be smooth and peaceful,"" he posted.

DUBAI (Reuters) -Arab states boycotting Qatar could resume travel and trade links with Doha within a week under a U.S.-backed deal, but restoring diplomatic ties requires more time as parties work to rebuild trust, a United Arab Emirates official said on Thursday.
Gulf powerhouse Saudi Arabia announced the breakthrough in ending a bitter dispute at a summit on Tuesday, with its foreign minister saying Riyadh and its allies would restore all ties with Doha severed in mid-2017. 
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash told a virtual news conference that measures to be implemented within a week of the agreement ""include practical measures of airlines, shipping and trade"".
However, he said, other issues such as restoring full diplomatic relations would take time given geopolitical issues such as Iran, Turkey and political Islamist groups regarded by traditional Arab autocrats as an existential threat.
""Some issues are easier to fix and some others will take a longer time,"" Gargash said, adding that bilateral working groups would try to move those forward. ""We have a very good start ... but we have issues with rebuilding trust.""
Restored air links to the UAE's regional aviation hub will be important for Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup.
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed the embargo on Qatar over allegations that it supports terrorism and is cosying up to foe Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty.
Kuwait and the United States have been mediating in the dispute that Washington says hampers efforts to contain Iran, a key issue for Saudi Arabia especially after attacks on its energy installations last year.
The Gulf feud also complicated efforts to stabilise countries reeling from years of turmoil as the parties and their respective allies vied for influence from Libya to Yemen and Sudan.
Since the 2011 ""Arab Spring"" protests, which aspired to democratic reform but in several countries collapsed into warfare, Egypt and especially the UAE emerged as main foes of the Muslim Brotherhood backed by Qatar and Turkey.
REBUILDING TRUST
Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that the Trump administration and Riyadh had pressed the other boycotting states to sign the deal and that Saudi Arabia would move faster than its allies to restore ties.
Discussions continued even after the deal was signed at the summit in the kingdom on Tuesday to offer reassurances, a source familiar with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
""The only thing worse for the UAE than this agreement was to be isolated in rejecting it, revealing a split with Saudi Arabia,"" said Kristin Smith Diwan, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
""I don't expect this will alter their (UAE) ideological and strategic rivalry with Qatar,"" she said, adding that the UAE's business hub Dubai would benefit from restoring commercial ties.
The four nations had set Doha 13 conditions to end the boycott, including closing al Jazeera TV, shuttering a Turkish military base, cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran.
Qatar Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told the Financial Times that Doha had agreed to suspend legal cases related to the boycott, including at the World Trade Organisation and the International Court of Justice.
He said Qatar would also cooperate on counter-terrorism and ""transnational security"" but that the deal would not affect Qatar's relationship with Iran and Turkey.

Gargash said the main issue with Turkey and Iran was interference in Arab sovereignty and interests and that mending the Gulf rift would foster more ""collective agreement on geostrategic issues"" despite differences in approaches.

Zoltan Maruzsa told an online briefing on Thursday that Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government would make a decision about the extension on Friday, adding however that classroom teaching in secondary schools was unlikely to resume next week.
""We decided to be cautious, the safety of human lives is the most important thing now,"" Maruzsa said.
""The government will decide tomorrow, but I am asking schools to prepare for in-person teaching not to start again on Jan. 11.""
Since Nov. 11 all secondary schools have been closed as have hotels and restaurants except for takeaway meals, a 1900 GMT curfew has been in place, and all gatherings have been banned.
These measures had been due to expire on Monday. The government will decide on Friday whether to extend them.
As of Thursday, Hungary had reported 334,836 COVID-19 cases and 10,325 deaths. More than 5,000 people are in hospital, down from earlier peaks, but fresh data shows new infections rising again.

""With every relaxation now, the likelihood of even longer necessary restrictions is greater and greater,"" Helge Braun, head of Merkel's office, told Reuters in an interview.
Like many other European countries, Germany is struggling to contain a second wave of the virus.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rose by 26,391 in a day to 1.84 million, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Thursday. The overall death toll rose by 1,070 to 37,607.
In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, Merkel and the leaders of Germany's 16 federal states on Tuesday agreed to extend a nationwide lockdown until the end of the month and introduce tougher restrictions.
Braun alluded to the fact that several states, such as Lower Saxony and Baden-Wuerttemberg, want to partially reopen primary schools as early as the middle of this month rather than keeping them shut until the end of the month as agreed. 
Braun also warned against a complete loss of control due to the spread of a contagious new variant of the virus that has spread rapidly in Britain and which could mean that Germany has to agree even tougher restrictions at the end of January.

""Before the mutation can spread in Germany, we must get the overall infection situation under control,"" he said.

QUETTA/KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Protests over the killing of 11 Shi'ite Hazara minority coal miners by Islamic State militants on Sunday have spread to other cities in Pakistan, including the economic powerhouse of Karachi.
Police said on Thursday there were sit-ins in at least 19 locations in the sprawling southern metropolis.
Flights were delayed because access to the airport had been affected.
Hundreds of Hazara have been killed in Pakistan over the last decade in attacks by Pakistani Sunni Muslim militant groups who see Shi'ites as apostates, and by Islamic State militants. Attacks have included bombings in schools and crowded markets and brazen ambushes of buses along Pakistani roads. 
The protesters have asked Prime Minister Imran Khan to visit Quetta, where demonstrators have kept up a five-day long vigil alongside coffins carrying the victims' bodies, blocking a major highway.
Demands also include the dissolution of the provincial government there, and a serious effort by Islamabad to find and punish the culprits. 
Most of the victims were seasonal migrant workers from an impoverished area of neighbouring Afghanistan.
Their gruesome killings, near the coal fields they worked, were filmed and later posted online by Islamic State. 
The Afghanistan consulate in the city of Quetta said seven of the victims were Afghan, and asked Pakistani authorities to repatriate three of the bodies on Tuesday. 
Khan has dispatched three cabinet ministers to persuade the protesters in Quetta to disperse, to no avail.
""I share your pain & have come to you before also to stand with you in your time of suffering,"" Khan tweeted on Wednesday.
""I will come again very soon to offer prayers and console with all the families personally.""
Leaders of Pakistan's two largest opposition parties, Maryam Nawaz and Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, were scheduled to visit the Quetta sit-in on Thursday. 

After nearly 100 Hazaras were killed in a 2013 bombing in Quetta, sit-ins were held across Pakistan that only ended after the then prime minister met with the mourners.

At least 39 protesters have since November been hit with criminal lese majeste cases, according to a tally by the Thailand Lawyers for Human Rights, marking the resumption of the use of a law that had not been invoked since late 2018.
It coincides with pro-democracy protesters expanding their demands, from seeking the resignation of the military-backed government to calls for the curbing of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's powers. 
Patsaravalee ""Mind"" Tanakitvibulpon was among 13 activists who reported to police on Thursday, after being summoned under Article 112 of the country's criminal code, which makes insulting or defaming the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
Patsaravalee, 25, told Reuters that police delayed sending the case to prosecutors pending a review of evidence. They remain free during the investigation.
Their cases relate to an Oct. 26 march to the German embassy in Bangkok when a letter was read asking Germany - where King Vajiralongkorn has spent much of the past year - to investigate allegations of wrongdoing by the monarch.
""The increased usage of article 112 by the government ... has reduced its sanctity and it is not as scary as before,"" Patsaravalee said, adding that hitting protesters with lese majeste would only cause others to question the law. 
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said protesters had ""stirred up hatred"" with divisive proposals that contained inaccurate information.
Various laws were being used to ensure peace and order, not only Article 112, although its use was justified, he said. 
""In the past, discussion on the monarchy may have been done on an individual level or in small seminars,"" Anucha told Reuters.
""But this time it is being done at a large level that incites others and it reaches not only a few people but thousands through social media. This means the law needs to be enforced.""
The palace has said it will not address any questions about the protests.
The youth-led demonstrations have demolished Thailand's decades-standing taboo on discussing the monarchy, and some have even called for Article 112 to be scrapped.

Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said last June the king had told him not to use 112, but in November, Prayuth said all laws will be used against protesters.

LONDON (Reuters) - A field hospital in London will be used if necessary to relieve pressure on other hospitals in the city, the British health minister said on Thursday after leaked official documents suggested London risked running out of beds within two weeks.
Projections leaked to the Health Service Journal showed that even if the number of COVID-19 patients increased at the lowest rate considered likely, London hospitals would be short of nearly 2,000 acute and intensive beds by Jan. 19.
Asked about the projections, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was concerned about the pressures on the National Health Service (NHS) and the government was putting extra resources into the parts of the country under the most significant strain.
""For instance in London, (we're) making sure that the Nightingale hospital is on standby and there, if needed. And if it is needed, of course, then it will be used,"" he said, referring to a field hospital that was set up at the start of the pandemic.
England began a new national lockdown on Tuesday, with schools closed and citizens under orders to stay at home, as the government sought to contain a surge in infections, partly driven by a highly contagious new coronavirus variant.
On Wednesday, the daily number of deaths from COVID-19 across the United Kingdom surpassed 1,000 for the first time since April. The country's total COVID-19 death toll since the start of the pandemic is over 77,300, the highest in Europe.
London and the southeast of England have been the areas worst-hit by the new variant.
The Nightingale hospital, based at the ExCel conference centre in east London, was originally set up for COVID-19 critical care, but only 51 patients were treated there before it was mothballed in May.

The British Medical Journal reported that it was being repurposed to take non-COVID patients recovering from operations and procedures, in order to relieve the unprecedented demand for beds elsewhere.

The fraud scheme, known as 'cum-ex' trading, involved submitting more than 3,000 applications to the Danish Treasury on behalf of investors and companies from several countries around the world in order to receive dividend tax refunds, the prosecutor said.
State prosecutor Per Fiig said the two defendants ""committed cynical and meticulously planned fraud"" and described the case as ""extremely serious"".
One of the charged resides in Dubai and the other in the United Kingdom. All measures would be employed to bring the defendants in front of a Danish court, where both face a maximum penalty of up to 12 years imprisonment, the prosecutor said. 
""We are not so naive, that we think they will appear in Denmark on their own in a trial where they risk many years in prison,"" Fiig told Reuters.
The case cannot proceed without the accused being physically present in the court, he added. 
The prosecutor has investigated the case, in which the Danish state was defrauded of more than 12,7 billion crowns, since 2016 in cooperation with counterparties in Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom.
The prosecutor has already seized more than 3 billion crowns from various persons and companies, but says retrieving the remaining funds could be difficult.
""The proceeds originating from crime are often paid out to organized criminal networks which distribute the money globally through clever systems. This generally means that it is very difficult or almost impossible to get to the money again,"" Fiig said. 
In March last year, two British bankers were handed suspended jail terms and a large penalty in Germany's biggest post-war fraud trial of a scam involving large trades to get bogus tax reclaims.

383,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 04:30AM ET</span>",Jailed HK activist Joshua Wong suspected of violating city's new security law,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong's most prominent democracy activists who is serving a 13-1/2-month jail sentence for illegal assembly, is suspected of violating the city's national security law, according to a notice on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account.
Wong, 24, gave a police statement on Thursday, the post said, without elaborating.
Police arrested 53 people in dawn raids on democracy activists on Wednesday in the biggest crackdown since China last year imposed a security law that opponents say is aimed at quashing dissent in the former British colony.
The arrests were related to an unofficial vote to pick opposition candidates for an election last year, which authorities said was part of a ""subversive"" plan to ""overthrow"" the government.
Democratic politicians held an unprecedented, unofficial and non-binding primary in July in which more than 600,000 people voted to pick who should run for a seat in the Legislative Council. 
Wong, who won the primary vote, has been repeatedly detained for his role in organising pro-democracy rallies. He was also among 12 opposition candidates disqualified from running in the legislative election, which has since been postponed with the government citing the coronavirus.
Of Wednesday's arrests, authorities cited the opposition's campaign to win a majority in the legislative election with the view to pressure the government to enact democratic reforms by blocking its proposals in the city's assembly.
The arrests have raised alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn following the imposition of the new law, which targets what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was considering sanctions and other restrictions on those involved in the arrests.
In response, China said the United States will pay a ""heavy price"" for its wrongdoing.
Critics say the security law crushes wide-ranging freedoms unavailable elsewhere in China which were promised on the territory's return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
Supporters say it has restored order following months of often violent anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.
Since its imposition, leading activists such as media tycoon Jimmy Lai have been arrested, some democratic lawmakers have been disqualified, activists have fled into exile and protest slogans and songs have been declared illegal.

It was unclear who could run for the opposition in any future polls following the mass arrests. Those arrested on Wednesday have yet to be charged and were expected to leave police stations on Thursday or Friday.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Washington may sanction those involved in the arrest of over 50 people in Hong Kong and will send the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations to visit Taiwan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, drawing anger and the threat of retaliation from Beijing.
Pompeo said he was also ""appalled"" by the arrest of an American citizen as part of Wednesday's crackdown and added: ""The United States will not tolerate the arbitrary detention or harassment of U.S. citizens.""
Hong Kong police arrested 53 people in dawn raids on democracy activists on Wednesday in the biggest crackdown since China last year imposed a security law, which opponents say is aimed at quashing dissent in the former British colony.
Among those detained was American lawyer John Clancey, a source at his firm said.
Pompeo called the arrests an ""outrage and a reminder of the Chinese Communist Party's contempt for its own people and the rule of law.""
""The United States will consider sanctions and other restrictions on any and all individuals and entities involved in executing this assault on the Hong Kong people,"" Pompeo said.
He said it would also ""explore restrictions against the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the United States, and take additional immediate actions against officials who have undermined Hong Kong's democratic processes.""
Further riling Beijing, Pompeo announced in the same statement Kelly Craft, Washington's U.N. ambassador, would visit Chinese-claimed and democratically run Taiwan, a highly symbolic trip as the island is not a U.N. member due to the objections of Beijing, which views Taiwan as a wayward province.
""Taiwan shows what a free China could achieve,"" he said.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Pompeo's comments represented a serious interference in the country's internal affairs, which China strongly condemned.
""China will take all necessary steps to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and security interests,"" Hua told reporters. ""The United States must pay a heavy price for its mistakes.""
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed Craft's visit, which will be the first of a sitting U.S. ambassador at the U.N. to the island, saying it demonstrates the strong U.S. support for Taiwan's international participation.
DAY OF TURMOIL
Pompeo's statement came after a day of turmoil in Washington that saw supporters of President Donald Trump storm the Capitol in a bid to overturn his November election defeat.
Lawmakers on both sides denounced the gravest assault on the two houses of Congress in more than 200 years, calling it an embarrassment to American democracy that would play into the hands of rivals like China.
""I think they're high-fiving in Beijing, and the Chinese look at this and are very happy about it,"" Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a China hawk, told Tucker Carlson on the Fox News channel. ""It kind of bolsters their claim that we're falling apart and they're the country of the future.""
On Wednesday, the Chinese embassy in Washington issued an advisory on its website, warning Chinese citizens to strengthen safety precautions in light of the ""large-scale demonstration"" in Washington and the curfew announced by the local government.
Trump has pursued hardline policies towards China on issues from trade to espionage and the coronavirus. His administration has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for crushing Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and other alleged rights abuses.
Tensions have escalated within Washington on China policy in the final days of the Trump administration before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.

The New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday it would delist three Chinese telecoms companies, while the administration is also considering adding tech giants  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent to a blacklist of firms allegedly owned or controlled by the Chinese military.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2021 04:15AM ET</span>","China draws comparison between storming of U.S. Capitol, HK protests","BEIJING (Reuters) - China drew a comparison on Thursday between the storming of the U.S. Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump and last year's often-violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, but noted that no one had died when demonstrators took over the legislature of the China-ruled city.
Clips of the chaotic scenes from Washington aired repeatedly on Chinese state television. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a daily briefing said that while events in Hong Kong in 2019, when the city's legislature was stormed, were more ""severe"" than those in Washington, ""not one demonstrator died"".
Relations between Beijing and Washington are at their worst in decades over a range of disputes, including China's heavy clampdown on Hong Kong, and Chinese diplomats and state media often draw attention to news of violence or chaos in the United States. 
Months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong in 2019 included the July 1 storming of the city's legislature, in a campaign for democratic reforms that Beijing ultimately quashed with new national security legislation. One man died after falling from a parking lot during one protest in the city. 
Police in Washington said four people died and 52 were arrested after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden's election victory.
""We also wish that U.S. people can enjoy peace, stability and security as soon as possible,"" Hua said.
Hua also condemned U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's comments in which he said Washington may sanction those involved in the arrest of over 50 people in Hong Kong and will send the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations to visit Taiwan.
A comment with thousands of favourable votes on China’s Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) said the Washington protests were “over 90%” the same as those in Hong Kong. European leaders were showing “double standards” in condemning one but not the other, it said.
""The response and words used by some in the U.S. to what happened in Hong Kong in 2019 were completely different to what they used for today's ongoing events in the U.S.,"" Hua said.
Around the world, leaders expressed shock and concern, condemning the attempted subversion of democracy.
""What happened today in Washington DC is not American, definitely,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said in a video message on Twitter.
Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy likened the images to protests in Ukraine that toppled Russian-backed President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovich in 2014.
""Some of my friends ask whether someone will distribute crackers to the protesters to echo the Victoria Nuland stunt,"" he tweeted, citing a 2013 visit to Ukraine when then-U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland offered food to protesters.

(Reuters) - One of the U.S. police officers who shot Black emergency medical technician Breonna Taylor in Louisville and the officer who prepared the warrant for the botched raid during which she was killed in her apartment have been dismissed, their union said.
Taylor was fatally shot when police entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky on March 13, one of a string of killings of African Americans that fueled mass protests across the United States in 2020.
Detective Myles Cosgrove, one of the officers who shot Taylor, and Detective Joshua Jaynes, who prepared the search warrant, had been told in December that the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) aimed to fire them.
Their union, the River City Fraternal Order of Police, said the two had been dismissed and described the terminations as ""unjustified"".
The LMPD did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside normal working hours.
Taylor's boyfriend, who was with her when police burst into the home, fired once at what he said he believed were intruders. Three police officers responded with 32 shots, six of which struck Taylor, killing her.
""There is certainly no evidence in this case that policies and procedures of the LMPD were violated to the extent that warranted termination,"" the union said late on Wednesday.
""Interim Chief Gentry not only made the wrong decision but also sent an ominous message to every sworn officer of the Louisville Metro Police Department,"" the River City FOP said.
Cosgrove was fired for use of deadly force for firing 16 rounds into Taylor's home and failing to activate his body camera, CNN reported, citing a copy of his termination letter.
Jaynes, who had written the search warrant for the raid on Taylor's home, was fired on Tuesday for ""failing to complete a Search Warrant Operations Plan form"", CNN reported.
On Wednesday, Erika Shields, the former police chief of Atlanta who resigned in June after the fatal shooting of an African-American man by an Atlanta police officer, was appointed head of the Louisville Metro Police Department.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A woman in New Zealand died on Thursday following a suspected shark attack in the country's northern island, police said in a statement.
She was pulled from the waters at Waihi Beach, located about a two-hour drive south-east of Auckland, with wounds on at least one leg, local media reported. Emergency services were called to the beach but the woman died at the scene a short time later, police officials said.
Shark attacks are rare in New Zealand, where water sports and beach holidays are popular during the current summer season. More than 60 shark species are known to swim in the country's waters.
The last shark attack in New Zealand was in 2018 at Baylys Beach, north west of Auckland, although it was not fatal, according to the New Zealand police website. 
The last fatal shark attack in the country was in 2013, the Shark Attack Data website shows.
The police could not confirm the woman died from a shark attack and have referred the case to the coroner, a police spokeswoman said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has held several rounds of talks with the farmers to placate them, offering concessions on the three laws it passed last year to bring private investment into the country's antiquated agriculture markets.
But the farmers have resisted the overtures and been camped at an interstate border near the village of Kundli outside Delhi for more than 40 days demanding the government withdraw the laws.
On Thursday, the protesters mostly from the Sikh-dominated northern state of Punjab, which is one of the country's leading producers of wheat and rice, took to the highway. 
Turbaned young men and elderly farmers with flowing beards rode a convoy of tractors numbering in the thousands, some with loud music blaring.
There was no sign of any police presence.
""We want Modi to repeal the three laws,” said Rajvinder Singh, 35, a farmer from Punjab’s Gurdaspur district.
He said the rally was a way to build pressure on the government in the lead-up to India's Republic Day on Jan. 26 when the farm unions have threatened to march on to the centre of the capital if the laws are not revoked by then.
Farmers fear that the deregulation under which food processors and big retailers can directly buy produce from them will eventually replace government-regulated wholesale markets where they are guaranteed a minimum price for their produce.
The government says the state-regulated market yards will continue alongside the new ones and has offered to give written assurances to the farmers they will continue to get a minimum price.
On Friday, the two sides will sit down for another round of talks.

Hebei, which entered a ""wartime mode"" on Tuesday, accounted for 51 of the 52 local cases reported by the National Health Commission on Thursday. This compared with 20 cases reported in the province, which surrounds Beijing, a day earlier.
Authorities in Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital, have launched mass testing drives and banned gatherings to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
Chinese state television reported that the city has now banned passengers from entering its main railway station. The city previously required travellers to present a negative nucleic acid COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours before boarding a train or an airplane in the province.
Total new COVID-19 cases for all of mainland China stood at 63, compared with 32 reported a day earlier, marking the biggest rise in daily cases since 127 cases were reported on July 30. 
The number of asymptomatic patients, who have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease but have yet to develop any symptoms, also rose to 79 from 64 a day earlier. 
The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China since the outbreak first started in the city of Wuhan in late 2019 now stands at 87,278 cases, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. 
In the city of Dalian in Liaoning province, which has reported local infections in recent days, residents in medium or high-risk areas have been barred from leaving the city. Residents in other areas were told to refrain from unnecessary trips out of Dalian. 
Authorities in Guangdong province late on Wednesday reported a patient infected with a more transmissible variant of the coronavirus discovered in South Africa.

CANBERRA/SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia is on course to begin administering the first COVID-19 vaccines in February, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday, as the country moves to accelerate its inoculation programme as two states try to contain outbreaks.
Morrison said Australia's pharmaceutical regulator is expected to approve the use of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine by the end of January, with the first doses issued within weeks.
""We are now in a position where believe we will be able to commence vaccinations in mid-to-late February,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. 
Australia earlier this week said it expected to begin COVID-19 vaccinations in March.
Australia has reported a total of just over 28,500 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began, with border closures and speedy tracking systems helping keep numbers relatively low. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi) 
Authorities are trying to contain new virus clusters in its largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne.
The most populous state New South Wales, the epicentre of the country's latest outbreak, on Thursday said it recorded zero local COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours.
Australia has ordered 10 million doses of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine. It has also struck a deal with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC that sees the vaccine produced locally.
Morrison said regulatory approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine is expected in February.
Once both are approved, Morrison said Australia aims to vaccinate 80,000 people each week. This would then be expanded in the following four to six weeks, and by the end of March 4 million people could be vaccinated.
The acceleration in the COVID-19 vaccination programme comes amid heightened concern about the spread of the virus globally.
Australia's national cabinet will meet a month earlier than scheduled on Friday, Morrison said, as authorities seek to stop the spread of a more contagious variant of COVID-19 that emerged in Britain. A handful of international arrivals in Australia have tested positive to the UK-strain.
The cabinet meeting will consider a proposals to strengthen travel rules for its citizens and residents returning from overseas, Morrison wrote in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post late Wednesday. 
Australian media reported the government has plans to introduce mandatory COVID-19 testing for all international travelers before they board their flights to the country.
Since March, the country has shut its borders to all non-citizens and permanent residents.

Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and Jake Sullivan, Biden's pick for national security adviser, agreed during a video meeting that both governments will prioritize the structural causes of migration, the Mexican statement said. 
Sullivan discussed border issues with Ebrard, a Biden aide said. Democrat Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has promised voters a more humane and multilateral approach to immigration policy than Republican President Donald Trump, who took a harder line than previous administrations.
""Attention to the structural causes of migration is a priority shared by the government of Mexico and by the next administration ..."" the ministry said in the statement.
""The vision focuses on the protection of the human rights of migrants and refugees, as well as on a regional response focused on economic development.""
On Dec. 19, Biden's team said that he and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed in a phone call to hone a “new approach” to migration issues that “offers alternatives to undertaking the dangerous journey to the United States.”
Border arrests reached the highest level in nearly two years in December, driven by coronavirus lockdowns and devastating hurricanes in Central America.
Mexican officials have signaled they will not relax tough enforcement measures aimed at stopping caravans of migrants making their way to the U.S. border. One such caravan is planned to leave Honduras next week.
The latest call was designed to start efforts to build a joint migration policy soon after inauguration day, according to two Biden aides.

The U.S.-Mexico relationship frayed during the last four years over Trump’s demands that the Mexican government do more to reduce the flow of U.S.-bound migrants.

The Eighth Party Congress, which began on Tuesday, comes as North Korea faces increasing economic crises caused by a self-imposed border lockdown to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, a series of natural disasters, and international sanctions over its nuclear weapons programme.
The gathering also comes just days before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden is due to take office, after unprecedented personal meetings between Kim and outgoing President Donald Trump failed to lead to a breakthrough in denuclearisation talks or a loosening of sanctions.
In sessions on Wednesday, Kim discussed policies to make a ""tangible turn in improving the people's living standard,"" a day after he admitted that previous economic goals had fallen short, state media reported.
To secure a ""peaceful environment"" for the people and country, Kim called for ""placing state defence capabilities on a much higher level, and put forth goals for realizing it.""
The party congress being held in Pyongyang is the first since 2016, which was in turn the first since 1980.
Since announcing a self-declared moratorium on nuclear testing and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches from 2018, Kim has called for continued production of nuclear weapons for his arsenal, launched a series of smaller missiles, and unveiled what would be North Korea's largest ICBM yet at a parade in October.
North Korea has not officially confirmed any coronavirus infections, although it has reported thousands of ""suspected cases"" to the World Health Organization and imposed strident measures to prevent an outbreak.
Photos of the congress released by state media show delegates sitting close together without wearing protective face masks.

MANILA (Reuters) - Since the pandemic forced him into remote learning, 10-year-old Jhay Ar Calma has often had to climb on to the corrugated iron roof of his home in a poor neighbourhood of Manila to get an internet signal.
Up on the roof, he sits on a broken plastic basin and hopes there'll be a signal strong enough for his government-issued device.
""Sometimes we change the SIM card to a different provider so he doesn't have to study on the roof, but there's rarely enough money to spare for that,"" Calma's mother Jonalyn Parulan told Reuters.
(Click https://reut.rs/2XjmWOE to see a picture package of Philippine students overcoming obstacles for online learning.)
Hopes for a return to classrooms this month have been dashed after President Rodrigo Duterte reversed a plan to trial in-person classes in low-risk areas, postponing any reopening indefinitely as the Philippines battles over 480,000 coronavirus infections, the second-highest number in Southeast Asia.
The shift to online classes, self-learning modules and television and radio programmes has proven extremely challenging in a country of 108 million where less than a fifth of households have internet access and many lack mobile devices.
Already, there has been a surge in students dropping out of school, according to the education ministry.
STUDYING ON A MOUNTAIN, IN A GRAVEYARD
In Laguna province, south of Manila, students trek up a mountain to get internet access, and have even built a hut to provide shelter when it rains and to sleep when they work late into the nights on assignments.
This situation is a far cry from the university life Rosemine Gonzaga, 19, had anticipated.
""I was really excited for college because all my life I've been here in the mountains,"" Gonzaga said, explaining how the pandemic had thwarted her plans for an independent life in the town. 
Like many students in her community, she relies on a scholarship and fears she may lose it if she is unable to keep up with lessons. Still, Gonzaga is resolved to continue online classes rather than risk infection attending university. 
""The pandemic is no reason for me to stop learning,"" she said. 
Mark Joseph Andal, 18, who lives in San Juan, Batangas province, has taken a part-time job in construction to purchase a smartphone for virtual classes and has also built a forest shelter to capture an internet signal.
When the signal fades, Andal picks up his plastic chair to move to another spot, and if it rains, he holds the phone in one hand and an umbrella in the other.
Andal says he has no choice. ""We're not rich, and finishing school is my only way to repay my parents for raising me.""
Andal admits he was both relieved and scared when he heard schools might reopen. The trying circumstances have made him more determined to succeed. 
""I want to be more active in class, I want to persevere more, to improve myself despite the situation I'm in,"" he said. 
Many families also struggle with home tutoring.
Lovely Joy de Castro, 11, who lives at a makeshift home in a Manila cemetery, sometimes studies sitting on gravestones to avoid getting under the feet of her family cooking chicken to sell to visitors. 
""I know we haven't given her enough guidance with school,"" said Castro's grandmother Angeline Delos Santos, ""but if we don't take care of our business, we would have nothing to feed the kids.""

""I just hope that she finishes school, gets a good job, and ultimately finds a life outside this cemetery,"" said Santos.

A military spokesman said missiles flying over the Golan Heights targeted several locations and air defences downed several missiles. Live coverage showed a multi-storey building on fire.
""Our air defences responded to an aerial Israeli aggression ... on some targets in the southern region,"" state media quoted a Syrian army spokesman as saying.
Two military defectors said the strikes hit the Kisswa area in the southern outskirts of the capital Damascus and military bases used by Lebanon's pro-Iranian Hezbollah group. 
There was no immediate comment from an Israeli military spokesman but Israel's Defence Force Chief of Staff Aviv Kochavi said last month the missile strikes had ""slowed down Iran's entrenchment in Syria"".
“We have struck over 500 targets this year, on all fronts, in addition to multiple clandestine missions,” Kochavi said in comments published in Israeli media.
The bases in eastern, central and southern Syria which Israel had hit in recent months are believed to have a strong presence of Iranian-backed militias, according to intelligence sources and military defectors familiar with the locations.
Western intelligence sources say Israel’s stepped up strikes on Syria in the last few months are part of a shadow war approved by the United States and part of the anti-Iran policy that has undermined in the last two years Iran’s extensive military power without triggering a major increase in hostilities.
They say that the past year has seen an expansion in the targets hit by Israel across Syria where thousands of Iranian-backed militias have been involved in regaining much of the territory lost by Syrian President Bashar al Assad to insurgents in a nearly decade old civil war.

On Dec. 19, Biden's team said that he and Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed in a phone call to hone a “new approach” to migration issues that “offers alternatives to undertaking the dangerous journey to the United States.”

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president said on Wednesday he was ready to provide coronavirus vaccines to undocumented migrants in the United States, after the governor of the U.S. state of Nebraska said they would likely not get vaccinated due to immigration status.
""It's a universal right. We would do it,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a regular government news conference when asked if Mexico would vaccinate undocumented migrants in the United States, many of which are Mexican nationals.
He did not elaborate on how his government would execute such a plan, or which migrants would qualify.
The comments on Tuesday about workers at Nebraska's meat-packing plants by state governor Pete Ricketts, a member of President Donald Trump's Republican party, had provoked criticism from public health and migrant advocates.
""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine with that program,"" Ricketts told a coronavirus briefing. 
The Washington-based Migration Policy Institute estimates 11% of Nebraska's meat-packing workers - and 10% of the workers nationwide - lack legal immigration status.
Widespread COVID-19 outbreaks occurred at meat-packing plants in the United States in the spring, helping spread the virus around rural America where plants are concentrated.
Roberto Velasco, a senior Mexican diplomat for North America, responded to Ricketts on Tuesday night.
""To deprive undocumented essential workers of #covid19 vaccination goes against basic human rights,"" he wrote on Twitter, including Ricketts' Twitter handle and citing text from the U.N.'s declaration of human rights. 
Among critics of Ricketts' statement was U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a leader of pro-migrant progressives in the Democratic party of President-elect Joe Biden.
""Imagine being so racist that you go out of your way to ensure that the people who prepare *your* food are unvaccinated,"" she wrote on Twitter.
The question of access to vaccines based on citizenship has become contentious in some parts of the world.
For instance, rights groups have expressed outrage that Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip face a long wait for vaccines.

While Sudan and Israel announced they would normalize ties in October, Khartoum's government had said a final decision would rest with a transitional parliament, which is yet to be formed.
The UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco have already signed the accords, hailing the prospect of more immediate economic and diplomatic ties with Israel as groundbreaking.
U.S. officials say they hope they will encourage the Palestinian Authority to return to negotiations with Israel but Palestinians say there can be no resolution of the core Israeli-Palestinian conflict unless they are involved.
Senior U.S. officials had told Reuters in October that a signing ceremony was expected to be held at the White House. Just over two months later, the accords were signed quietly in Khartoum on Wednesday by Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdelbari and visiting U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin.
""The declaration stipulates the necessity to consolidate the meanings of tolerance, dialogue and coexistence between different peoples and religions in the Middle East region and the world, in a way that serves the promotion of a culture of peace,"" the Sudanese cabinet said.
As part of the initial agreement in October, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would remove Sudan from a U.S. government list of countries promoting terrorism, a process that was completed last month.
Mnuchin also signed a memorandum of understanding to provide Sudan with a previously announced bridge loan to help Sudan clear its arrears to the World Bank and access $1 billion in annual funding, Sudan's finance ministry said.

CLAMART, France (Reuters) - Worried about wasting shots and public resistance in a country where scepticism of vaccines is common, France introduced a series of bureaucratic hurdles that must be cleared before rolling out COVID-19 inoculations in nursing homes.
The result, some health experts said, has been a vaccine deployment so tangled in red tape that it delivered just 7,000 shots by late Tuesday having started on Dec. 27.
Government guidelines running to 45 pages were issued shortly before the first vials of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in France late last month.
To comply with national rules, nursing home managers have set up teams to oversee the campaign, drawn up lists of equipment needed and organised consultations between each resident and their personal doctor at least five days before the injection is due in order to obtain their consent.
Xavier de la Cochetiere works as a medical coordinator at the Maison Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) care home in Clamart, on the southern edge of Paris. A practising medic, he has had to call some 20 general practitioners (GPs) to ask when they would conduct the consultations or if they were happy to nominate him. 
It has not been simple. Many doctors were on leave during the festive period or returning to overflowing inboxes. De la Cochetiere questioned the need to bring GPs into the process.
""It would have been easier if I had been the only one involved,"" he said. ""The more you involve GPs ... the more the process risks dragging out.""
Doctors like de la Cochetiere and care homes also have to complete consent forms, fill out prescriptions and file a request for a precise number of doses with the local health authority before the vaccinations can be booked in.
""It's a rather heavy process,"" Louis Matias, manager of the Maison Ferrari, said.
The health ministry did not respond to emailed questions about whether bureaucracy was impeding the vaccination campaign in care homes or if the process would be made easier.
'WHY SO MANY PRECAUTIONS?'
Government officials say the rollout was expected to get off to a slow start in nursing homes because of logistical complexities and the delicate health of many residents.
However, it has angered President Emmanuel Macron and left the government playing catch-up with other European nations where procedures are simpler.
France, like many European countries, is struggling to contain the pandemic which has claimed more than 65,000 lives there, the world's seventh highest toll.
In Germany, mobile teams are vaccinating the elderly in care homes. Residents have a consultation with a doctor on the risks and must sign a consent form. The jab can be given straight after. Germany had conducted 317,000 COVID-19 injections by late Tuesday, of which 132,000 were administered in care homes.
In Britain, where more than 1 million people have been inoculated, nursing home residents can receive a COVID-19 shot immediately after giving their consent. The same is true in Spain and Italy.
The bureaucratic hurdles have left some French doctors feeling overwhelmed.
""I get a call to see 30 patients in one home before the week's end. At another it's 20. It's just not possible,"" said Romain Beddok, who splits his working time between a hospital in northeastern Paris and local nursing homes.
He said such bureaucracy did not apply to other vaccine campaigns in France. Health experts said that for the flu, the consent process was simpler, and more people, including pharmacists, were allowed to give the injection.
Macron has ordered his government to accelerate the vaccine rollout.
Ministers promise procedures will be made simpler, and the first phase target group has been widened to include hospital staff and paramedics aged over 50.
Didier Sapy, head of the FNAQPA federation of care homes, said local health authorities were making demands on care homes that could not be met.
""They're in panic mode,"" he said.

The king, 68, returned to Thailand in October amid mass student-led protests demanding curbs to new powers he has taken, plus the resignation of the ultra-royalist prime minister, who first seized power in a military coup.
It is unclear whether the king plans to return to Bavaria - where he spent much of 2020, drawing criticism as he and his entourage stayed in a hotel during the first coronavirus lockdown even though hotels were supposed to shut.
In an answer to a parliamentary question from the opposition Linke (Left) party, the foreign ministry said the king has not needed a visa to visit Germany since he became head of state.
Sevim Dagdelen, a member of parliament for the opposition Linke party, said if the king needed no visa then the German government could not influence how long he stayed, but as a last resort could declare him persona non grata (undesirable person).
In response, a Foreign Ministry source said on Wednesday: ""Even if a foreign head of state does not need a visa to enter the country, Germany is free to tolerate the stay or not due to its territorial sovereignty."" 
The German government has said it would be unacceptable for the king to conduct politics from Germany and Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in October it was monitoring his behaviour.
The source at the foreign ministry said it has no evidence that the king has conducted state business during his previous stays in Germany.
The Thai palace has a policy of not commenting to media and has never said anything about the king's time in Europe.
Thai protesters have complained about the cost of the king’s stays in Europe as well as his absence from the Southeast Asian kingdom.
In late October protesters marched to the German Embassy in Bangkok to present a letter asking Berlin to look into whether the king had conducted state business while on German soil.
The role of the monarchy in Thai politics has become a central issue for many protesters, who argue that accusations of disloyalty to the king have been used repeatedly to put down pro-democracy movements.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Portugal will use its six-month presidency of the European Union to finalise a landmark law containing the bloc's emissions-cutting targets, the country's environment minister said on Wednesday.
The bill would make the EU's climate targets irreversible, including its plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, and speed up emissions reductions this decade.
Joao Pedro Matos Fernandes told Reuters in an interview he hoped the law could be agreed by early April.
""Our main goal is to approve the climate law,"" Matos Fernandes said. ""This is definitely our top priority.""
However, ""tough"" negotiations are ahead, since EU institutions still do not see eye to eye, he said. 
EU countries and the Commission want the law to include a target to cut net emissions at least 55% by 2030 from 1990 levels, and say countries should collectively deliver the EU's 2050 goal. 
The European Parliament says tougher action is needed to address the climate emergency. It wants a 60% emissions cut this decade and a requirement for every EU country to become climate neutral by mid-century.
Brussels hopes the legal framework will help investors and businesses plan their transition and make much-needed green investments.
Portugal holds the rotating EU presidency from January-June, meaning it will represent EU countries in negotiations with the European Commission and European Parliament on new legislation, and chair meetings of EU ministers.
With climate change already stoking harsher heatwaves, drought and record-high temperatures in Europe, Matos Fernandes said he would also push for an agreement among member states by June on an EU plan to adapt to worsening climate impacts. 
""In a country like Portugal, you can feel it, you can see it. We have to talk about adaptation,"" he said.
The next six months will also see EU countries try to agree plans to renovate Europe's buildings to save energy, and EU standards for green electric vehicle batteries. 

Those are of key interest for Portugal, which has 60,000 tonnes of known reserves of the battery metal lithium.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will move faster than its allies to reconcile with Qatar, sources familiar with the matter said, aiming to impress the incoming Biden administration by ending what the West sees as a parochial dispute that benefits only mutual foe Iran.
The rapprochement reduces potential points of friction between Riyadh and a U.S. government sure to be less forgiving than outgoing President Donald Trump, who has consistently protected the kingdom from criticism of its human rights record.
In a move that cast the kingdom as a force for stability in a turbulent region, Saudi de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman chaired a summit on Tuesday that declared an end to the bitter rift in which Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have boycotted Qatar since mid-2017.
The kingdom said at the gathering that all four states had agreed to restore diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Doha under a U.S.-backed deal, but the three sources said the other three nations had been pressed to sign a general declaration and were likely to move more slowly, as deep divisions remain.
""Saudi Arabia is way ahead of the others, who could drag their feet,"" said one source familiar with the matter. ""The declaration was kept general to ensure all parties signed it.""
The UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have yet to announce specific measures to rebuild ties, severed over allegations that Qatar supports terrorism, a charge that Doha denies.
Each of the three countries have had their own differences with Qatar.
The UAE and Egypt both resent Qatar’s support for Islamists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, the world's oldest Islamist movement, which they see as a political foe. Bahrain, an arch critic of Iran, is uneasy about Qatar's even-tempered relations with Tehran and the kingdom also has a territorial dispute with Doha.
The Trump administration has for over a year been pressing for a resolution, particularly reopening airspace to Qatar, to bolster efforts to contain Iran. But a deal had proven elusive despite U.S. and Kuwaiti mediation efforts.
White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and other officials made a renewed push with the support of Prince Mohammed, the source said, handing Trump another diplomatic win after normalisation deals between Israel and several Arab states.
""We wanted to get it done before the end of the term,"" a senior Trump administration official to Reuters. ""I expect the same level of compliance as Saudi Arabia,"" the official said of other boycotting nations.
SCORING POINTS
Saudi Arabia is currently the only one taking active steps to reopen its airspace and borders to Qatar and restore diplomatic ties, the three sources said.
For Riyadh's allies, the third informed source said, it will be very hard to retreat from Tuesday's announcement, but may also be difficult to move forward fast and that some view the deal at the summit as ""a starting point rather than the finish line"".
Saudi Arabia, which lobbied hard for Trump's maximum pressure campaign against foe Iran, has come under international scrutiny over its human rights record following the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Kashoggi and over the ruinous Yemen war.
For Prince Mohammed, seen by critics as an unpredictable leader, his push for detente with Qatar appeared aimed at showcasing him as a statesman seeking regional stability.
President-Elect Joe Biden has said he would take a harder line against the kingdom, an oil exporting giant and major buyer of American arms, over those issues.
Diplomats in the region and analysts have said Riyadh's push for Gulf detente was largely aimed at positioning Riyadh as a valuable U.S. partner at a time of regional tensions with Iran.
An internal Israeli Foreign Ministry memorandum seen by Reuters said that for Saudi Arabia, Tuesday's summit presented an opportunity to put forward a ""conciliatory image"" vis-à-vis Washington, while Qatar had scored the biggest gains.
""But it can be assumed that the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain will scrutinise Qatar's conduct through a magnifying glass before they expand reconciliation measures with it,"" it added.
PRESSURE
The UAE, which has largely extricated itself from Yemen and forged ties with Israel last year, is not expected to face the same kind of pressure as Riyadh from a Biden administration.
It remains at cross purposes with Qatar and Turkey over Libya and the Muslim Brotherhood, also key issues for Egypt.
Senior Emirati official Anwar Gargash told Al Arabiya TV on Tuesday it would take time to rebuild trust and that the agreement established ""foundations"" to end the row.
The boycotting nations had set Doha 13 demands, including closing Al Jazeera TV, shuttering a Turkish base, cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran.
A U.S. official has told Reuters that under the deal, Qatar would suspend legal cases linked to the boycott. Qatari officials have insisted any resolution must be based on mutual respect of sovereignty, including foreign policy.
""The thaw may do little to dampen competition between Qatar and the UAE, and their respective allies in regional hotspots,"" said Elham Fakhro, senior Gulf analyst at International Crisis Group.

""These are massive, very demanding challenges,"" Giuseppe Conte said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), adding that it was essential to ""reinforce the cohesion of the majority and the solidity of the government team"".
He said the government's actions should remain focused on improving conditions for citizens, protecting their right to healthcare and granting a future to the younger ones, adding: ""Everything else does not concern me."" 
Conte's relations with coalition partner and former premier Matteo Renzi have deteriorated markedly in recent weeks and a showdown could bring down his government. 
Renzi has called for radical changes in the government's plans aimed at relaunching the economy. 
In his Facebook post, Conte added that after meeting with ministers on Wednesday the government had updated its Recovery plan - a document detailing how the country will access some 209 billion euros ($256.57 billion) from the European Recovery Fund - incorporating contributions from other parties.
""I have never reneged on discussions or listening to the parties that support the government,"" the prime minister said. 

Conte also said that greater resources would be aimed at the health sector, youth, nurseries and people with disabilities.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union can no longer legally recognise Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's legitimate head of state after he lost his position as head of parliament, the bloc's 27 governments said on Wednesday.
Guaido is still seen by the United States and Britain as Venezuela's rightful leader following the disputed 2018 re-election of President Nicolas Maduro, and two EU diplomats stressed the EU still did not recognise Maduro as president.
An EU statement on Wednesday threatened further sanctions against the Maduro government, on top of an arms embargo and sanctions on Venezuelan officials already imposed, to decry what it views as rights violations and the rupture of democracy.
But EU governments referred to Guaido as one of the ""representatives of the outgoing National Assembly"", in the statement, which denounced a Dec. 6 parliamentary election that many countries say was rigged. The new assembly, now controlled by Maduro supporters, began work on Wednesday.
As Venezuela has sunk into a crisis that has brought mass emigration and hyperinflation, Guaido was the unifying figure leading protests to seek an end to Maduro's rule.
The two EU diplomats said Guaido remained one of the most important pro-democracy figures in Venezuela, where the EU, the United States, Britain and Latin America want to mediate to organise free and fair elections.
However, the envoys said the statement by the 27 EU governments came after agreement in Brussels that Guaido's self-declared role of interim president had no institutional standing now that Maduro had taken control of the National Assembly.

The boat, bound for the regional capital Goma, capsized overnight on Tuesday, after having set off in the dark overloaded and from an illegal mooring, regional government spokesman Claude Basila said.
Deadly boat accidents are common in Congo, which has few tarred roads across its vast, forested territory and where vessels are frequently loaded well beyond their capacity.
The spokesman said the boat had 51 passengers on board, of whom 46 were rescued, three died, leaving two missing.
However, survivors who were rescued by local boatsmen said the vessel had been carrying at least 100 passengers.
""A big wave knocked it over and there was nothing more but screams,"" said Daniel Mutukura, who trod water for five hours before being rescued.
""I realised a lot of people had drowned because there were more than 100 people on board,"" he told Reuters.
A survivor, Mubatiza Mukanirwa, said his wife and children had drowned. He estimated the boat had been carrying nearly 250 people, while another survivor thought 200 had been on board.

GB News, a 24-hour TV and digital news service, will start hiring immediately for 140 jobs, including 120 journalist positions.
""GB News is a massive undertaking in a fiercely competitive market but we’re confident there’s an appetite for a fresh approach to news in Britain, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,"" Chairman Andrew Neil said.
Neil, a former editor of Rupert Murdoch's Sunday Times, had a reputation as one of Britain's toughest interviewers during his 25-year career at the BBC before he left in 2020. 
Britain's media market has been distressed by the COVID-19 crisis. Though television viewing has gone up, the cost of producing programmes has also risen. Print newspaper sales and advertising have collapsed. 
The new channel, founded by telecommunications executives Andrew Cole and Mark Schneider, casts itself as a disruptor which will focus on issues that matter to populations outside London. It is unclear where the channel will be based.
""GB News will be proudly independent and fearless in tackling the issues people care about, especially in communities outside London,"" Chief Executive Officer Angelos Frangopoulos said.
Frangopoulos said the channel was passionate about ""shaking things up"". 
Britain's media industry is dominated by the publicly-funded BBC which provides television channels, radio stations and one of the biggest websites in the world.

Dan Eliasson, head of the Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), the body responsible for the management of emergencies and public safety, has asked the government to transfer him out of his job, the MSB said in a statement. 
Sweden has been reluctant to enforce lockdown measures during the pandemic, but as cases and deaths hit record levels in December, the government issued its toughest measures yet and implored the public to limit their travel in the holiday season.
""MSB as an authority should have the best possible conditions to carry out its important assignment. That is why today I have requested a transfer to leave the position,"" Eliasson said in statement on MSB's website.
Eliasson on Saturday defended his trip to the sunny archipelago off the northwest coast of Africa, saying that he wanted to visit his daughter who lived on the islands and that he had previously given up many opportunities to travel due to the pandemic.
He is not the only government figure to fall foul of the country's own guidance during the holiday period.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven and Justice Minister Morgan Johansson were forced to apologise after both were spotted - and in Lofven's case photographed - on trips to shopping malls over Christmas.
Although the incidents do not break the law, they have angered many Swedes, whom the government has repeatedly asked to maintain high standards of personal responsibility during the holidays.
Sweden's death rate per capita is several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than that of several European countries that imposed lockdowns.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar police arrested nearly 100 ethnic Rohingya on Wednesday after raiding a house in the commercial capital of Yangon, police and local media said.
Photos published by the local Tomorrow News Journal showed several barefoot men and dozens of women in colourful head scarves sitting on the ground in a courtyard.
Myanmar frequently detains Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, on grounds of ""illegal travel"" for attempting to leave their native western Rakhine state.
Tin Maung Lwin, a police captain from Shwe Pyi Thar township, where the group was found, confirmed the arrests but declined to give further details.
""The investigation is still ongoing,"" he said, adding that either 98 or 99 people had been arrested. He said they would be sent to a quarantine centre to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
Some 600,000 Rohingya live in Myanmar under what Amnesty International has called ""apartheid conditions"", mostly confined to camps and villages and unable to travel freely or access healthcare or education.
The vast majority lack citizenship and are considered illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh, despite many tracing their ancestry in the country back hundreds of years.
""It is outrageous that Myanmar authorities continue their policy of arresting Rohingya for merely travelling in their own country,"" said John Quinley, senior human rights specialist at Fortify Rights. ""The group arrested in Yangon should be immediately and unconditionally released.""
A government spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
More than 730,000 fled to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a military-led crackdown that U.N investigators have said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"" and included mass killings and rapes.
Myanmar denies accusations of genocide and says the army was fighting a legitimate counter-insurgency campaign against militants who attacked security posts.
In recent years, hundreds of Rohingya have been imprisoned in jails and youth detention centres across the country after being caught leaving Rakhine, many seeking to flee to Thailand and Malaysia. Others have been returned to camps.
The government says it is working on a national strategy to close camps and that Rohingya would not face movement restrictions if they accepted a so-called national verification card, an identity document many reject because they say it labels them foreigners.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - An Israeli military court on Wednesday convicted a Palestinian rights activist of offences in the occupied West Bank, his lawyer said, in a case that Amnesty International described as politically motivated.
The military did not immediately provide Reuters with the Ofer military court's verdict against Issa Amro of the Palestinian city of Hebron, and arguments over sentencing will await a further hearing on Feb. 8.
Amro denied the charges, which included protesting without a permit, obstructing Israeli soldiers' activities in the flashpoint city of Hebron and assaulting a Jewish settler.
Amro, 40, founded an activist group that regularly protests against settlement construction in Hebron. Under heavy Israeli military protection, around 1,000 settlers live there among 200,000 Palestinians.
""It doesn't make sense to punish someone for non-violent resistance,"" Amro told Reuters. ""The Israeli military system exists only to oppress Palestinians and restrict freedom of speech.""
Amro was convicted on six of 18 charges against him, in incidents that occurred between 2010 and 2016, his lawyer, Gaby Lasky, said.
Lasky said it was hard to predict whether Amro would face prison time, but that a Palestinian in a similar case received a 10-month term.
Amnesty International said the charges against Amro were ""politically motivated and linked to his peaceful work in exposing Israel's human rights violations"".
The group has also condemned as ""disgraceful"" charges brought against Amro by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
Amnesty said the PA has accused him of ""disturbing public order"" and ""insulting higher authorities"" over Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts in 2017 critical of Palestinian leaders.
Amro said his next Palestinian court hearing is on Jan. 20. 
Most countries view settlements Israel built on West Bank land captured in a 1967 war as illegal. Israel disputes this, citing biblical and historical connections to the territory, as well as security needs.

Romanian authorities have banned public gatherings due to the coronavirus, but said they would allow up to 3,000 people with face masks to attend the open air service.
The Orthodox Church wields considerable influence in the socially conservative state, and a Reuters reporter estimated up to 4,000 attended the event, some without masks and many joining a tightly-packed crowd being blessed by holy water.
More than 20 swimmers dove into the cold sea to retrieve crosses thrown by Orthodox Archbishop Teodosie, a popular ritual.
""It's for the joy of being closer to God,"" said Mihail Fedul, one of the swimmers. Asked how he was protecting himself from getting infected, the 31-year-old lifeguard said: ""We continue to protect ourselves with the holy cross and with the imposed restrictions.""
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Epiphany is one of the most important religious feasts, commemorating the baptism of Christ and the revelation of the Holy Trinity, and associated events took place in Athens and Kalofer, Bulgaria.
While Romania's Orthodox Church has mostly respected curbs on religious services to limit the spread of COVID-19, Archbishop Teodosie has repeatedly violated restrictions, holding services indoors for unmasked crowds, and organised pilgrimages, which are mostly banned. 
""We will hold our service the same as every year,"" he was quoted saying by state news agency Agerpres on Tuesday, ""because mass does not change in the pandemic, it stays the same. We must hold more services in the pandemic.""

The European Union state, which has extended a state of alert until mid-January, has reported 654,007 coronavirus cases and 16,299 deaths.

In a popular ritual, Orthodox priests cast a crucifix into a lake or river, and it is believed that the person who retrieves it will be freed from evil spirits and will be healthy through the year.
Despite calls from authorities to cancel the celebration, about 70 men from Kalofer took part in the ritual, while dozens gathered along the river banks to watch it. 
""We tried... not to have it, but there was no way. Even if we did not help them, they would have done it anyways,"" said Kalofer Mayor Rumen Stoyanov. ""This is an important event for the community... We tried to limit the access, but we could not.""
After the crucifix was recovered, the men put their arms around each other's shoulders, sang and danced in a circle to music played on drums and bagpipes.
The event in Kalofer sparked heated debates on social networks, where some supported it while others called for the men and the town to be fined for breaking rules they fear may fuel coronavirus infections.
Christians in Greece also defied bans on public gatherings to mark one of the most important religious days in the Eastern Orthodox Church commemorating the baptism of Chirst and the revelation of the Holy Trinity.
Bulgaria, which ranks second in number of deaths per capita from COVID-19 in the European Union, managed to limit the surge in new infections after closing schools, restaurants and banning large public gatherings since late November.
On Wednesday, the Balkan country reported 1,310 new cases, bringing the total to 205,390, including 7,902 deaths.

423,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 08:00AM ET</span>",Over 2 million people displaced by conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region - local official,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - About 2.2 million people have been displaced within Ethiopia's Tigray region since fighting erupted there in November with about half fleeing after their homes were burned down, a local government official said.
Gebremeskel Kassa, a senior official in the interim administration in Tigray appointed by the federal government, made the comments in an interview broadcast by state-run ETV's Tigriniya language channel late on Tuesday. 
The figure given by the official was more than double a previous estimate for the number of people displaced of 950,000, which included 50,000 who had fled to neighbouring countries.
Ethiopia's federal government restricted access to Tigray after fighting began on Nov. 4 between its troops and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party that was governing the province. The government declared victory in late November though the TPLF has vowed to fight on.
The conflict in Tigray has called into question whether Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, can hold together fractious ethnic groups in the country.
An official from Ethiopia's National Disaster Risk Management Commission told Reuters on Wednesday that the figures cited by the administrator in Tigray were not official.
The commission's Mitiku Kassa said 110,000 people were displaced within Tigray and 1.8 million were in need of assessment, though he said the actual number of displaced was likely to be far higher than its current tally.
A U.N. refugee agency official also said on Tuesday that Ethiopians were still crossing into neighbouring Sudan from Tigray. 
""Some 800 people crossed from Ethiopia's Tigray region into eastern Sudan in just the first few days of the new year,"" spokesman Andrej Mahecic told reporters in Geneva.
A spokeswoman for Abiy's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report that refugees were continuing to cross into Sudan.

More than 56,000 people have now crossed into Sudan from Tigray since the conflict started, according to the U.N. refugee agency's latest data.

On Monday, the electoral commission declared President Faustin-Archange Touadera the winner of the race, with voter turnout of over 76% despite an offensive by rebel groups seeking to derail the vote.
However, only half of the country's 1.8 million eligible voters were able to register for the vote due to the violence.
Ten of the 17 candidates are now rejecting this result, saying turnout of registered voters was just 37% and that the insecurity disrupted campaigning and the electoral process.
""We demand an annulment pure and simple and a rerun of the election,"" they said in the statement.
There was no immediate comment from the electoral commission or Touadera. 
A disputed election could further destabilise the gold and diamond producer, whose population of 4.7 million has endured waves of militia violence since 2013 that has killed thousands and forced more than a million from their homes. 
A powerful coalition of opposition politicians has also called for the vote to be repeated, including former president, Francois Bozize.
Touadera and the United Nations, which has over 12,800 uniformed peacekeepers in CAR, have accused Bozize of being behind the rebel offensive, which briefly seized the country's fourth-largest city ahead of the election.
Bozize has not been reachable for comment. 
His party has previously denied the government's accusations, but some in the party have suggested they are working with the rebels.
Touadera came to office in 2016 after Bozize was overthrown in a rebellion three years earlier. He struggled to restore peace in his first term and swathes of the country remain beyond government control.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested 53 people in dawn raids on democracy activists on Wednesday in the biggest crackdown since China last year imposed a new security law which opponents say is aimed at quashing dissent in the former British colony.
Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy advocates were arrested in raids on 72 premises as the authorities said last year's unofficial vote to choose opposition candidates in city elections was part of a plan to ""overthrow"" the government.
The arrests were linked to an unprecedented, independently organised and non-binding vote to select opposition candidates for a since-postponed legislative election.
About 1,000 police took part in the raids, which included searches of the offices of a pollster and a law firm.
""The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong,"" said Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong. ""Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society.""
Patten said the West should get tougher with China and scolded the European Commission for seeking a trade deal with Beijing.
""We should not be seeking to contain China but to constrain the Chinese Communist Party,"" Patten said.
Hong Kong Secretary for Security John Lee said those arrested had planned to cause ""serious damage"" to society and that authorities would not tolerate subversive acts.
""The operation today targets the active elements who are suspected to be involved in the crime of overthrowing or interfering seriously to destroy the Hong Kong government’s legal execution of duties,"" Lee told reporters. 
The arrests will further raise alarm that Hong Kong has taken a swift authoritarian turn.
Critics say the June 2020 security law crushes wide-ranging freedoms promised when the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997 and the arrests place China further on a collision course with the United States just as Joe Biden prepares to take over the presidency.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Biden's pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Twitter the arrests were ""an assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights"".
Beijing's top representative office in Hong Kong said in a statement it firmly supported the arrests. Members of the democratic camp held a news conference to call for the release of ""political prisoners"".
Police did not name those arrested, but their identities were revealed by their social media accounts and their organisations. They included former lawmakers, activists and people involved in organising the 2020 primaries, among them James To, Lam Cheuk-ting, Benny Tai and Lester Shum.
'SUBVERSIVE' VOTE
Police said campaigning to win a majority in Hong Kong's 70-seat Legislative Council with the purpose of blocking government proposals to increase pressure on democratic reforms could be seen as subversive.
The city's leader is not directly elected and only half the legislative seats are open to democratic vote, with the other half stacked mostly with pro-Beijing figures.
""The people involved are suspected of making use of what they call a '35+' plan ... to somehow paralyse the Hong Kong government,"" Lee said, adding the government would not tolerate any ""subversive acts"".
Police cited a rule that if the legislature fails to pass the annual budget twice, the city's chief executive must step down. The national security law prohibits disrupting and interfering with the city's administration.
The legislative election was due in September last year but was postponed, with authorities citing coronavirus risks. It is unclear who could run for the opposition in any future polls following the mass arrests.
In Wednesday's operation, police searched the offices of Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute which helped organise the primaries. The organisers destroyed the data of the more than 600,000 people who voted immediately after ending the count. 
American lawyer John Clancey was arrested during a raid of law firm Ho, Tse, Wai & Partners, a source at the firm said.
Visits to four media outlets, including anti-government tabloid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, were about ""transactions"" with pro-democracy groups and unrelated to reporting matters, police said.
The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.
The Hong Kong and Beijing governments say it is vital to plug holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub in 2019.
In response to the law, Washington imposed sanctions on local and Beijing officials and several countries suspended extradition treaties.
Since its imposition, leading activists such as media tycoon Jimmy Lai have been arrested, some democratic lawmakers have been disqualified, activists have fled into exile and protest slogans and songs have been declared illegal.
Taiwan's government said Hong Kong had changed from the ""pearl of the Orient"" to ""purgatory of the Orient"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's police chief apologised on Wednesday amid an outpouring of grief and anger over the death of an adopted child in a country with a long history of adoption both domestically and abroad.
The 16-month-old girl, who media have identified by just her given name, Jeong-in, died on Oct. 13 after being taken to hospital with injuries.
""I deeply apologise for failing to protect the life of a young child who suffered abuse,"" Kim Chang-yong, the commissioner general of the Korean National Police Agency, told a news conference.
The apology came a day after President Moon Jae-in expressed regret over the girl's fate and called on authorities to make the welfare of adopted children a priority.
Kim vowed to reform the response to child abuse and he also removed the local police chief from his post. Media said reports had been lodged with the police about the girl before her death.
Kim said the case was being investigated but said nothing about any charges. He did not comment on media reports the adoptive parents were being investigated.
The hashtag ""Sorry, Jeong-in"" has trended on Korean Twitter this week and several actors and singers, including a member of top band BTS, Jimin, posted the hashtag on their social networks and made donations to childcare agencies.
The case has shone a spotlight on child abuse.
The Korean Women Lawyers Association said 28 adopted children had died in 2018 alone from abuse, according to the National Center for the Rights of the Child, and 80% of the child abuse takes place within the family.
South Korea has been a source of babies for adoption by people abroad since the 1950-1953 Korean War, especially to the United States. Adoption is also relatively common domestically.

A total of 387 children were adopted domestically and 317 abroad in 2019, according to health ministry data.

Controversy over whether vaccines adhere to Islamic principles has stymied public health responses before, including in 2018, when the Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) issued a fatwa declaring that a measles vaccine was forbidden under Islam.
""Hopefully the edict can be declared before the government starts its vaccination program,"" said Muti Arintawati, an official at MUI in charge of analysing food and drugs to assess whether they are halal.
She said data was still being gathered before MUI could make a final edict.
Indonesia is struggling with the worst COVID-19 outbreak in Southeast Asia and authorities are relying on a vaccine to help alleviate dual health and economic crises ravaging the country.
Asked about the risk of public resistance, a health ministry official said the government would wait to see how MUI handled the issue.
In a bid to boost acceptance, President Joko Widodo has said he will be the first to receive a vaccine shot next week.
Dicky Budiman, a researcher at Australia's Griffith University, said authorities needed to be transparent on the halal certification to reassure the public.
The New York Times reported that Sinovac told Indonesia's state-owned drugmaker Bio Farma that the vaccines were ""manufactured free of porcine materials.""
Bambang Heriyanto, Bio Farma's corporate secretary, confirmed receiving the statement, but said the halal status was decided by MUI. Sinovac did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Ahmad Ishomuddin, an official at Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's biggest mainstream Muslim organisation, said emergency vaccines that were not halal could be used if there were no other options.
Indonesia's food and drug agency (BPOM) needs to issue emergency use approval for vaccinations to start.
In neighbouring Malaysia, religious authorities have declared COVID-19 vaccines were permissible for Muslims, and mandatory for those the government has identified to receive them.
Malaysia does not require vaccines to be certified halal, though authorities are planning to introduce a certification framework this year to allay concerns among some Muslims.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - China has notified downstream neighbours it is holding back the Mekong River flow at a hydropower dam on the waterway's upper reaches for 20 days, as part of a new data-sharing pact, the Mekong River Commission (MRC) and Thailand said on Wednesday. 
The statements came a day after a new U.S.-backed monitoring system said China had failed to notify downstream countries of water restrictions that started on Dec. 31.
China agreed last October to share water data with the MRC, an advisory body to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam that had long sought the information for planning.
More than 60 million people in those countries depend on the river for fishing and farming.
Thailand's National Water Command Center said China had on Tuesday notified Thailand that its Jinghong Dam will from Jan. 5 to 24 reduce the water discharge rate from 1,904 cubic metres per second to 1,000 cubic metres per second, which amounts to a decrease of about 47%.
That was for ""maintenance of transmission lines"" in its electricity grid, it said. 
The MRC said it received notification the same day, though it first detected water levels dropping on Dec. 31. The level would likely drop by about 1.2 metres and river navigation and fishing could be affected, it said.
The MRC said the Chinese notification assured the flow ""will be gradually restored to its normal operation status on January 25"", without specifying an exact volume rate.
The new Mekong Dam Monitor on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Tuesday said China had not notified neighbors when the Jinghong dam starting restricting waters on Dec. 31, ""causing a sudden 1 metre drop in river level"" downstream that could devastate the fish population.
The monitor uses cloud-piercing satellites to track levels at 11 upstream dams in China and those in other countries. Partly-funded by the U.S. State Department, it started operations last month, adding to the China-U.S. superpower rivalry in Southeast Asia.
Chinese authorities could not immediately be reached for comment. Beijing has rejected suggestions its Mekong dams harm downstream countries.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Christian churches held Epiphany services on Wednesday, openly defying government coronavirus restrictions that banned public gatherings including religious ceremonies on one of the most important days of the Orthodox calendar.
Despite a plea by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis for Church authorities to set an example during a crisis that has killed more than 5,000 in Greece, worshippers attended morning services, although limits were placed on the number allowed into churches at one time.
""State orders are one thing and faith is another,"" said a 38-year-old worshipper who gave her name as Stavroula, after attending morning service at a church in the outskirts of Athens. ""No law can order us what to do.""
Police patrolled outside a number of churches but said they would not interfere with services and would use ""mild"" measures to persuade people not to crowd inside.
The approach underlined the reluctance of Mitsotakis' conservative government to seek confrontation with the Orthodox Church, which plays an influential role in Greek public life.
On Sunday, authorities extended public lockdown measures, effectively withdrawing permission which had been granted previously to hold Epiphany services with a maximum of 50 people in attendance in large churches and 25 in smaller ones. 
A Reuters reporter saw no signs of that limit being breached at the Athens church where she spoke to worshippers.
On Monday, in a rare show of dissent, Synod leaders wrote to the government to say there was no justification for preventing Epiphany services. Until now, the Church has largely respected curbs on religious services to limit the spread of COVID-19.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Epiphany is one of the most important religious feasts, commemorating the baptism of Christ and the revelation of the Holy Trinity. A popular ritual in which swimmers retrieve a cross thrown into the water by a priest has been banned this year.
While Greece has been more successful than many European countries in containing the coronavirus, its struggling health services have been badly weakened by years of financial crisis. In recent weeks it has been battling significant COVID clusters in northern Greece and western Attica near the capital Athens.

433,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 05:06AM ET</span>",WikiLeaks' Assange to discover if he will be freed from jail on bail,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) -WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange will discover on Wednesday if he will be allowed to taste freedom after years of self-incarceration and jail time, following victory in his battle to avoid extradition from Britain to the United States.
A British judge on Monday rejected a request from U.S. authorities for Assange, 49, to be sent across the Atlantic to face 18 criminal charges of breaking an espionage law and conspiring to hack government computers.
The charges relate to the release by WikiLeaks of hundreds of thousands of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which U.S. officials say put lives in danger.
Although Judge Vanessa Baraitser accepted the U.S. legal arguments in the case, she said Assange's mental health issues meant he would be at risk of suicide if he were extradited. 
The U.S. Department of Justice says it will continue to seek his extradition and will appeal against her verdict. 
In the meantime, Assange, who is currently being held in the top-security Belmarsh Prison in southeast London, will seek to be freed on bail at a hearing on Wednesday.
If Baraitser grants his request at a hearing that was due to begin at 1000 GMT, Assange would be able to enjoy freedom for the first time in more than eight years.
""We're just being positive that there'll be a good outcome, that he'll be able to walk free,"" Kristinn Hrafnsson, editor of WikiLeaks, told reporters outside the court.
Admirers hail Australian-born Assange as a hero for exposing what they describe as abuses of power by the United States. But detractors cast him as a dangerous figure who has undermined the security of the West, and dispute that he is a journalist.
WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. diplomatic cables that laid bare often critical U.S. appraisals of world leaders, from Russian President Vladimir Putin to members of the Saudi royal family.
Assange made international headlines in early 2010 when WikiLeaks published a classified U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NASDAQ:APA) helicopters that killed a dozen people in Baghdad, including two Reuters news staff.
FREEDOM?
In June 2012, Assange fled to London's Ecuadorean embassy after losing his bid to prevent extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning over alleged sex crimes.
He remained in the embassy, living in confined conditions, until being dragged out in April 2019. Although the Swedish case against him had been dropped by then, he was jailed for breaching British bail conditions and his supporters forfeited sureties of 93,500 pounds ($127,076). 
He has remained behind bars after completing his jail term pending the outcome of the U.S. extradition case, which would include any appeal by the United States. Baraitser has previously refused him bail, saying he remained a flight risk.
Assange's partner Stella Moris, with whom he had two children while holed up in the embassy, said they could not celebrate as long as he was still in prison.
""We will celebrate the day he comes home,"" she said.
Assange's lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said on Monday that the extradition ruling cast a new light over the bail decision. But Nick Vamos, lawyer at London-based firm Peters & Peters and former head of extradition at Britain's Crown Prosecution Service, said he expected his bid not to succeed.
""To do so, he would have to point to some change in circumstances, for example the COVID-19 risk in Belmarsh, other than the extradition judgment in his favour,"" Vamos said. ""I expect his bail application to fail.""

John Clancey, chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and a member of a group linked to pro-democracy protesters in the city, was arrested as police raided the law firm Ho, Tse, Wai & Partners, said the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue.
Hong Kong police did not respond to a request for comment.
Clancey is the treasurer of Power for Democracy, which was involved in an unofficial, independently organised vote in July 2020 to select opposition candidates for a since-postponed legislative election.
Earlier on Wednesday, police arrested dozens of pro-democracy activists linked to that vote, intensifying a crackdown on the movement since the security legislation was imposed on the city in June. 
The source at the law firm based in the heart of the global financial centre confirmed Clancey is an American passport holder. 

Footage posted online showed police officers arriving at the law firm which has represented several opposition figures in the Chinese-ruled city.

435,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2021 04:20AM ET</span>",Ugandan presidential challenger Bobi Wine campaigns in a flak jacket,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's main opposition candidate in next week's presidential election has swapped his trademark red beret for a helmet and starts each day with shadow-boxing and a prayer to survive a campaign trail he describes as a war zone. 
Popstar-turned-lawmaker Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, who goes by the name Bobi Wine, is the frontrunner among 10 candidates challenging Yoweri Museveni, who is seeking to extend his 34-year rule in the East African nation at the Jan. 14 vote.
While former guerrilla fighter Museveni, 76, has long been seen as a stabilising force in Uganda after the brutal reigns of Milton Obote and Idi Amin, opponents say his administration has become riddled with corruption and nepotism.
""Museveni is a different generation. He is a representative of history. I am a representative of the future,"" Wine, 38, told Reuters at his home, a sprawling compound in Magere, a suburb on the northern outskirts of the capital Kampala.
Previous presidential election campaigns have been marked by the intimidation of opposition candidates though analysts say crackdowns by the security forces have been more brutal and widespread this time around.
Wine's energy, music and humble origins have struck a chord with Uganda's many young people, unnerving the ruling party and leading to repeated arrests of Wine and his loyalists for allegedly threatening public order.
""I am in this struggle to liberate Uganda,"" he told Reuters. ""Before that is accomplished I don't care how many times I am arrested, harassed, beaten, tear gassed or pepper sprayed.""
If elected, Wine said he would create jobs for the youth and crack down on corruption that he says has left schools and hospitals crumbling in the country of 46 million people. 
Uganda has one of Africa's youngest populations with nearly 80% under 30 years old, government data shows. The government estimates four out of six young Ugandans are unemployed and 80% of those working are in informal jobs with low pay.
Museveni's office did not respond to a Reuters request for an interview. His spokesman referred requests for comment on allegations of corruption and nepotism to the ruling National Resistance Movement party, which did not respond.
Museveni has previously said there was a corruption problem but he was fighting it. He has denied accusations of nepotism.
'WAR ZONE'
Under Museveni, Uganda has been a staunch Western ally and it provides the biggest contingent of the African Union force fighting Islamist insurgents in Somalia. Uganda found major oil reserves over a decade ago but has yet to produce any crude and it relies on foreign aid for a quarter of its budget.
Last month, the government banned election rallies saying they could spread COVID-19 but Wine and other candidates argue that has prevented a free and fair election because government allies control most of the media outlets.
Electoral Commission spokesman Paul Bukenya told Reuters rallies could become coronavirus superspreader events and candidates had many ways to disseminate their messages including flyers, banners, billboards, brochures and social media.
Wine, a slim but sturdy figure, grew up in a Kampala slum, the 20th child in a polygamous family of 33 children. 
He said his music - and his politics - was inspired by the struggles his mother faced as she hawked street food to educate and feed her children.
Wine's musical career took off in the early 2000s with songs decrying urban poverty and political oppression, backed by catchy, feel-good beats. In 2017, he won a parliamentary by-election as an independent by a landslide and then last year he became leader of the opposition National Unity Platform party.
He has been detained multiple times since entering politics, including on the day he filed his nomination papers, and has taken to wearing a bullet-proof vest, as well as his helmet.
""If I didn't have it I don't know what would have happened to me. Every one, six people whom I move with in the car, have all been hit,"" Wine said. ""(It's) more or less a war zone.""
Wine says he has been targeted with tear gas canisters, rubber bullets and pepper spray. Police say his campaign is breaking laws governing public order and COVID-19 restrictions. 
At least 54 people died in protests that erupted when Wine was detained in one incident in November. In another, an injured protester died in his campaign ambulance after police blocked its path, Wine said. 

""Some days you start eating tear gas as early as seven in the morning. Others you start much later. You start a day with 20 people and by the end of the day half of them are in prison.""

China has been angered by stepped up support for the democratic island by outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, including new arms sales and visits to Taipei by senior U.S. officials, which have strained already poor Beijing-Washington ties.
The U.S. State Department said Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Clarke Cooper would deliver ""virtual remarks"" at the Taiwan political and military dialogue from the State Department late on Wednesday, though gave no other details.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said it would make a ""necessary response based on how the situation develops"" and was ""resolutely opposed"" to the talks.
China urges the United States to ""immediately stop any form of official exchanges and military links with Taiwan, to avoid further damaging stability in the Taiwan Strait and Sino-U.S. relations"", she added.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said it would not give details of the talks, citing ""Taiwan-U.S. mutual trust and a tacit diplomatic understanding"".
""The two sides often maintain close and smooth communication on various issues of common concern, so as to continue to deepen cooperation at all levels of politics, economics, and security,"" said spokeswoman Joanne Ou.
Cooper met Taiwan's top diplomat in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, in August, saying it was a pleasure to talk with her ""as we work together for regional peace and stability"". 

Democratic Taiwan, claimed by China as its sovereign territory, has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which has ramped up military activity near the island.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean delegation is heading to Iran on Wednesday to seek the release of a chemicals tanker and its 20-member crew seized in Gulf waters by Iranian forces, Yonhap news agency reported.
Iran denied on Tuesday it was using the ship and its crew as hostages, a day after it seized the tanker near the Strait of Hormuz while pressing a demand for Seoul to release $7 billion in funds frozen under U.S. sanctions.
The seizure of the MT Hankuk Chemi has been seen as an attempt by Tehran to assert its demands, just two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in the United States. Iran wants Biden to lift sanctions that were imposed by outgoing President Donald Trump.
Seoul's foreign ministry had called in the Iranian ambassador on Tuesday to call for early release of the tanker and its crew of 20. Iran had said the ship was held over environmental violations. 
In a report submitted to parliament, the ministry said South Korea is reviewing whether the ship violated international law by polluting the waters, as claimed by Tehran, but also whether Iran violated it during the boarding and seizure process.
South Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun is scheduled to visit Tehran on Sunday, a visit that was previously scheduled and during which a range of bilateral issues will be discussed, the ministry said on Tuesday.
In response to the seizure, meanwhile, Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism warned Japanese shippers to use extra caution in operations in the area, an official at the ministry's maritime bureau said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his five-year economic plan had failed to meet its goals ""on almost every sector"" as he kicked off a congress of the ruling Workers' Party, state media KCNA reported on Wednesday. 
The rare political gathering, which Kim last hosted in 2016, has drawn international attention as he is expected to unveil a new five-year economic plan and address inter-Korean ties and foreign policy. The congress, attended by 250 party executives, 4,750 delegates and 2,000 spectators, comes just two weeks before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office. 
In his opening speech, Kim said the country had achieved a ""miraculous victory"" by bolstering its power and global prestige, referring to military advances that culminated in successful tests in 2017 of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of striking the U.S. mainland and a series of meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
But the five-year economic strategy unveiled in 2016 had failed to deliver, he said, urging North Korea's greater self-reliance. 
""The strategy was due last year but it tremendously fell short of goals on almost every sector,"" Kim said, according to KCNA.
Kim had sought to accelerate economic growth and boost electricity supplies but U.N. agencies reported chronic power and food shortages, exacerbated by sanctions, the coronavirus pandemic and severe floods.
While consolidating power with a series of military provocations and ruthless purges, Kim has been trying to build a ""man of the people"" persona by openly admitting some of his failures - once a taboo in a country that reveres an errorless, godlike leader. 
Kim was even seen shedding tears as he thanked people for their sacrifices at a military parade in October.
""He seems to have made a strategic decision to admit economic failure as he can also blame the coronavirus,"" said Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul. 
""By doing so, he would also seek to cement his image as a people-loving leader."" 
'STABLE ANTI-VIRUS SITUATION'
On the pandemic, Kim lauded party workers for ensuring ""stable situations against the coronavirus from beginning to end."" 
""They had resolutely overcome difficulties in the face of an unprecedentedly prolonged, unparalleled global health crisis,"" he added.
North Korea has not officially confirmed any coronavirus infections, although it reported thousands of ""suspected cases"" to the World Health Organization. 
South Korean authorities have said an outbreak in the North cannot be ruled out as it had active trade and people movement with China before closing its border last January.
Seoul's Unification Ministry in charge of cross-border affairs said it hopes the meeting will provide a chance to foster peace and advance inter-Korean ties. 
KCNA said Kim will suggest ""strategic and tactical policies"" aimed at promoting reunification and foreign relations during the congress. 
Kim usually gives a New Year address which maps out blueprints for his diplomatic, military and economic policy but skipped it this year. 
Analysts said he will likely give a message once the congress is over. 
In KCNA images, no one was seen wearing masks and participants did not sit apart, unlike at some other recent public events. 
Kim was accompanied by top aides, including his sister and senior party official Kim Yo Jong, nominal head of state Choe Ryong Hae and Premier Kim Tok Hun. 
Lists of participants released by KCNA showed nearly 75%, or 29 of 39 leaders who took the podium have been replaced since the 2016 congress, as Kim sacked many of his father's longtime confidants, weakened the powerful military and promoted relatively younger loyalists, including his sister.

Experts expect further leadership changes to be announced over the remaining days of the meeting.

Police said in a statement the raid in Makassar in South Sulawesi by the Densus 88 unit led to a fatal shootout with two suspected militants who resisted arrest.
Makassar police chief Witnu Urip Laksana told Reuters separately that the suspects were involved in the bombings of a church on Jolo island in a restive, predominantly Muslim region of the Catholic-majority Philippines.
Police carried out ""firm and calculated"" action against the two suspects, Witnu said, adding an investigation was ongoing. 
Police suspect the men were members of the Islamic State-inspired Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), which has carried out a series of attacks in Indonesia. 
Philippine authorities have concluded that the January 2019 church attack was a suicide bombing by an Indonesian couple, with the help of a faction of local group Abu Sayyaf, which has pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
More than 100 people were also wounded in the incident, which was among the first and so far deadliest suicide bombings in the Philippines, where such attacks were almost unheard of until 2018.
Philippine Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
The region of Mindanao in the southern Philippines has for decades been beset by separatist and Maoist conflict. 
Authorities are concerned about extremism taking a hold in its impoverished, mainly Muslim areas, where operatives from Indonesia, Malaysia and beyond have linked up with local groups to plan attacks and recruit and train fighters.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea rolled out mass testing for 52 prisons in the country after a massive prison outbreak and may extend flight suspensions from Britain in a bid to prevent the spread of coronavirus cases, the health minister said on Wednesday.
Over half of the total 2,292 inmates and personnel in a prison in southeastern Seoul were tested positive after a first cluster infection was reported within the prison last month, Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health ministry official, told a briefing.

Authorities will complete mass testing on some 70,000 prison inmates and staff nationwide, as the number of confirmed cases linked to prisons throughout the country surged to 1,191.
The health authorities will also decide whether to extend flight suspensions from Britain after at least 12 cases of a new strain of the coronavirus had been found, said Yoon.
The country had already extended a ban on direct flights from Britain until Jan. 7, and required any passengers arriving from that country or South Africa to undergo testing before departure.
The country reported 840 new cases as of midnight on Tuesday, a slight uptick from 715 a day before, bringing the national tally to 65,818 infections with 1,027 deaths.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party on Tuesday inaugurated a parliament controlled by allies of President Nicolas Maduro, while the opposition convened a rival committee of legislators in a virtual session, following disputed elections on Dec. 6.
The opposition, led by speaker Juan Guaido, had boycotted the vote, widely considered fraudulent by Maduro adversaries and many Western countries. On Dec. 26, the opposition-controlled parliament approved a statute extending its term into 2021.
But it was Socialist Party lawmakers and allies who physically occupied the legislative palace on Tuesday, walking towards it from a nearby plaza, carrying photos of late President Hugo Chavez and founding father Simon Bolivar. 
The shift marks a formal consolidation of power for Maduro, who in early 2019 looked vulnerable as the United States and dozens of other countries recognized Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader.
""You are examples for the world of how democracy should be exercised,"" said Jorge Rodriguez, former information minister, who was named president of the new Socialist Party-run National Assembly and swore in 227 lawmakers. ""We are here by constitutional mandate.""
Security forces blocked off nearby roads.
The ceremony marked the symbolic end of the opposition's five-year struggle to weaken Maduro after it won a 2015 landslide victory in parliamentary elections. 
But control of parliament will give Maduro's allies little capacity to improve a crippled economy hemmed in by U.S. sanctions. And the pro-government supreme court had in any case for years hamstrung opposition legislators by shooting down every one of their measures.
""I am not aware of the assembly, I am working to solve my problems,"" said Maria Rojas, 49, who works in the Caracas mayor's office. ""God is the only one who can solve the situation.""
INTERNATIONAL REACTION
The outgoing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has recognized the Venezuelan opposition's extension of its own term. 
""President Guaido and the National Assembly are the only democratic representatives of the Venezuelan people as recognized by the international community,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Tuesday. 
""They should be freed from Maduro's harassment, threats, persecution, and other abuses.""
Lima Group, a regional bloc comprised mostly of Latin American nations, said on Tuesday it does not ""recognize the legitimacy or legality of the National Assembly installed on January 5"" in Venezuela, describing the Dec. 6 elections as ""fraudulent"".
The statement from Lima Group was co-signed by Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Paraguay and Peru.
Other international supporters of Guaido, including the European Union, have yet to say if they agree if the opposition still rightfully controls parliament. 
The move has generated rifts within Guaido's coalition, with one major opposition party abstaining from the vote on the extension and several individual lawmakers announcing they would stop serving as legislators after Jan. 5. 
Over the past year, public approval for Guaido has fallen, while Maduro retains some popular support. 
The looming inauguration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20, after years of escalating U.S. sanctions and diplomatic pressure on Maduro under Trump, represents another uncertainty for Guaido. 
Biden has repeatedly labeled Maduro a dictator and has said he would work with other countries to seek free and fair elections in Venezuela but has not laid out details of policies he plans to implement toward the oil-rich nation.
A representative of Biden's team did not immediately reply on Monday when asked if his administration would continue recognizing Guaido as the head of parliament.
Maduro calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup. He has said the Dec. 6 elections had the same electoral conditions as the 2015 vote won by the opposition.
Maduro, who retains the support of the armed forces and allies like Cuba, Russia and Iran, helped push opposition lawmakers out of the congressional headquarters and forced dozens of legislators into exile.
Guaido has vowed a ""diplomatic offensive"" to ensure as many countries as possible refuse to recognize the legitimacy of the socialist-held congress and called on supporters to take to the streets. 

""The dictatorship bet that we were going to leave the country and the answer is simple, here we are, here is the National Assembly defending the constitution,"" Guaido said in Tuesday's virtual session.

KENOSHA, Wis. (Reuters) -Wisconsin prosecutors on Tuesday cleared a white police officer of criminal charges in the shooting a Black man from behind in the presence of his young children, leaving him paralyzed and triggering deadly protests that inflamed U.S. racial tensions.
Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley found officer Rusten Sheskey acted in self-defense while responding to a domestic dispute last Aug. 23 and shooting Jacob Blake seven times at close range, saying Blake was armed with a knife and had resisted arrest, withstanding multiple Taser shots.
The decision against prosecuting Sheskey or the two other officers on the scene could incite more demonstrations, which have frequently broken out in the United States in recent years after police have been cleared of wrongdoing in shootings of African Americans.
Calm remained after dark as about 50 people braved subfreezing temperatures and marched through streets where storefronts had been boarded up in anticipation of unrest.
""This is an expression of our deep suffering,"" said Caliph Muab'El, a Black minister, as he rode along in a car behind the marchers. ""I wasn't surprised by the decision. It's a perpetuation of the same old, same old that we see in this country.""
Kenosha, a city of 100,000 people between Milwaukee and Chicago, had braced for the decision, and Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers authorized the Wisconsin National Guard to support local law enforcement.
Protests broke out last summer in response to viral cellphone video that showed Blake walking around the front of his car with Sheskey following and opening fire after Blake opened the door.
But investigators said the video was incomplete, failing to reveal that Blake was armed with a knife and that he had resisted arrest when police tried to detain him on a felony arrest warrant.
""Everybody has seen the video. And so from their perspective, they have tried this case, at their computer screen or in their living room. As a professional, I am called upon to talk about how to try this case, in a real jury room in a real court,"" Gravely said.
Blake refused police commands to drop the knife, which Graveley said gave Sheskey the right to self-defense. As Sheskey made a final attempt to detain the man, Blake turned and thrust the knife toward Sheskey, an act blocked on the video by the car door and another officer, investigators said. 
SEVEN SHOTS
Sheskey fired seven times until Blake dropped the knife, a justified number and in accordance with police training, said former Madison Police Chief Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) Wray, who had been named by the Wisconsin Department of Justice to review the investigation.
Graveley called the incident a tragedy for all those involved, especially Blake, who was paralyzed from the waist down and shot in the presence of three of his young sons, one of whom was in the car. Blake's lawyers said they are considering a civil lawsuit against Sheskey.
The shooting took place while passions were still inflamed over the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck. Thousands took the streets in ""Black Lives Matter"" anti-racism protests in the United States and around the world following Floyd's death despite the coronavirus pandemic.
B'Ivory LaMarr, one of the lawyers for the Blake family, said Sheskey should have been charged with attempted homicide and called on people to advocate for racial justice and police reform.
""The video made it clear that Jacob ... never raised a knife,"" LaMarr said.
The shooting of Blake attracted a mix of civil rights demonstrators, anarchists and right-wing militias to Kenosha last summer.
At the height of those protests, teenager Kyle Rittenhouse opened fire with a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 rifle, killing two men and wounding another. Rittenhouse, now 18, was charged with first-degree reckless homicide and five other criminal counts. 

Earlier on Tuesday, Rittenhouse pleaded not guilty to all counts in an appearance by video in Kenosha County Circuit Court.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal's top court on Wednesday will begin hearings on petitions challenging Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli's sudden decision to dissolve the parliament, a move that has triggered public outrage and has been labelled unconstitutional.
In their plea before the Supreme Court, politicians, activists and lawyers are questioning whether it is the legitimate right of the leader to dissolve the parliament, 18 months before schedule. 
The Oli, 68, cited internal squabbling within his ruling Communist party and lack of political unity as reasons behind his Dec. 20 decision.
His colleagues and opposition political parties have blamed Oli for derailing a stable government amid a pandemic that has triggered an economic downturn. 
Seven ministers have quit Oli's government to oppose his move and protesters last month burnt effigies of him.
""The constitution duly defines and delimits the power of the prime minister,"" said Dinesh Tripathi, an independent petitioner.
""It does not give Oli the prerogative to cause an untimely death to parliament at his will,"" he said.
The five-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, including the chief justice, will hear at least 13 petitions questioning the rights of the prime minister. 
Officials working with Oli said his move was in line with the constitution.
""We are fully prepared to face the challenge in the court,"" said Rajan Bhattarai, an aide to Oli. 
If the court upholds Oli's move, Nepal will hold elections this summer. If not, parliament will be reinstated.
""If the verdict is in favour of the dissolution, there will be elections for a new parliament but we risk that in the near future, governments may not complete a full five-year-term, as the prime minister could dissolve it anytime,"" said constitutional lawyer Bhimarjun Acharya.

""The country has been trapped into a tunnel of instability, as the dissolution was a blunder,"" Acharya added.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A civil court in El Salvador on Tuesday found former President Elias Antonio Saca and his wife Ana Mixco guilty of ""illicit enrichment"" and ordered them to return $4.4 million to state coffers, authorities said. 
Prosecutors had found irregularities in the couple's wealth declaration and accused both of transferring public money to their personal bank accounts and to those of broadcasting companies they owned during Saca's presidency, said Gerver Montoya, an attorney from the prosecutor's office.
Along with the order to return stolen funds, Saca was banned from public office for 10 years. 
The ruling adds to a 10-year prison term Saca received in September 2018 after pleading guilty to money laundering and embezzlement of $300 million during his administration from 2004 and 2009.
Reuters could not immediately reach attorneys for the former president and his wife.

""It's known that past officials and presidents stole,"" Attorney General Raul Melara said in a tweet. ""We're working so that they pay for their crimes, and this money is used for the benefit of Salvadorans.""

As part of its six-month rotating EU presidency, which began this month, Portugal held an initial consultation with Greece, a country on the frontline of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015 and 2016.
Last September, the European Commission initially put forward a proposal for the migration pact during Germany's EU presidency. The most sensitive part of the pact obliges each member state to host some refugees. A final deal on the pact is yet to be reached.
In a statement, Portugal's Internal Affairs Ministry said problems related to migration from outside the EU could only be solved with ""solidarity between countries"" but highlighted ""such solidarity cannot be voluntary"". 
""Flexible"" but ""mandatory solidarity"" between EU countries is the key concept Portugal is pushing for, the ministry said, adding solutions must be found to two main issues: regular migration flows and migration crises.
The minister in charge, Eduardo Cabrita, said he would also hold meetings with government officials in Spain, Italy and Malta, where migrants mainly arrive, but also with reluctant countries such as Poland and Hungary. 
""The goal of these meetings (...) is to find points of convergence between member states and the paths that will allow us to overcome aspects that generate less consensus in the pact,"" said the ministry. 
Talks will take place ahead of a meeting between Internal Affairs ministers on Jan. 28.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Crowds gathered on Tuesday in a Rio de Janeiro cemetery to bury Marcelo Guimarães, the latest victim to be killed by police in Brazil, home to some of the world's deadliest security forces. 
Guimarães was killed on Monday at the entrance to the City of God favela, after dropping off his son for his first day of school. His family said Rio's military police, known for their deadly raids on poor, Black neighborhoods, shot him from inside an armored vehicle as he drove past on a motorcycle. 
Police violence is a long-running problem https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/brazil-police-violence in Brazil, and particularly in Rio, home to some 17 million people. State security officers killed 1,160 people between January and November 2020, about the same number as in the whole of the United States. 
Critics accuse far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who has for years lived in Rio, of exacerbating the issue by urging police to show no mercy to criminals he has labeled ""cockroaches.""
Speaking to reporters after the burial, Guimarães' daughter, Vitoria, accused the officers of murdering her father. 
""They are the bandits, the corrupt ones,"" she said. ""The government kills poor people, Black people, favela-dwellers and workers. My father was honest. They aren't.""
In a statement, Rio state's military police said Guimarães was caught in crossfire during a shootout.
""At the time of the action, a motorcyclist passing by was hit. Unfortunately, the victim did not survive the injuries,"" it said.

The police added that security had deteriorated in the area recently, and its officers had been shot at. The death is under investigation, police said.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's health minister said on Tuesday that ""controversy"" had arisen over a liability waiver in the country's negotiations to obtain COVID-19 vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) 
Pilar Mazzetti told Congress that Peruvian officials had been in ""constant contact"" with Pfizer since July but that a dispute arose in their negotiations in December. 
She said she could not give details because of a confidentiality agreement but added that they related to ""the waiving of important elements such as ... jurisdictional immunity."" 
""It is true that one needs the vaccine but it is also true that there are aspects related to aspects of our sovereignty that the country has to protect ... it has to do with risk for future generations,"" she told lawmakers. 
Several other countries, including Brazil and Argentina, have raised concerns about liability waivers in their negotiations with Pfizer.
World Bank officials said on Tuesday they were working with countries to address the liability waiver issue which they said had emerged as one of the key obstacles to sealing vaccine supply deals. 
Peru has hosted trials for COVID-19 vaccines developed by China`s Sinopharm, U.S.-based Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and is in negotiations to secure vaccines from other companies, Mazzetti said. 
Peru's foreign minister told a legislative commission last month that Peru had resumed conversations with AstraZeneca after cutting off negotiations in October when it alleged the company had not provided adequate data on its testing.
Peru has also signed up to receive 13.2 million doses of vaccines through the COVAX facility, an alliance led by the World Health Organization and GAVI.
Mazzetti told Congress on Tuesday that the doses had previously been expected in July but the government had been ""recently"" told by COVAX to expect them ""in the first three months of this year.""

On Monday, Iran said it resumed 20% uranium enrichment at a nuclear facility, a move that coincides with rising tensions with the United States in the last days of President Donald Trump's term. The decision is the latest of several Iranian breaches of a 2015 nuclear accord with world powers. 
Netanyahu said the move was aimed at developing nuclear weapons and Israel would never allow Tehran to build them. Iran says it has never sought nuclear weapons.
Iran's Nour News quoted an unnamed security official as saying: ""This regime (Israel) should be aware that any aggression against Iran's interests and security from any side and in any way, whether (Israel) admits or denies responsibility, will face a decisive response from Iran against this regime.""
The statement was widely carried by Iranian news agencies and state media.
Separately, Iran on Tuesday gave more details about its enrichment decision by saying it had the capacity to produce up to 9 kg of 20% enriched uranium per month.
""At present, we produce 17 to 20 grammes of 20% uranium every hour,"" Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, said according to state media. ""We have a monthly production capacity of 8 to 9 kg to reach the 120 kg stipulated by the law.""
The decision to enrich to 20 percent purity was one of many moves mentioned in a law passed by Iran's hardline-dominated parliament last month in response to the killing of the country's top nuclear scientist, which Tehran has blamed on Israel.
Tehran started violating the accord in 2019 in a step-by-step response to Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear accord in 2018 and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions lifted under the deal.

BIHAC, Bosnia (Reuters) - Nearly 3,000 migrants are stranded in northern Bosnia without shelter, the International Organization for Migration said, and some are suffering from respiratory problems and other complications as night-time temperatures plunge.
Some of those sleeping in the open were forced to flee the Lipa camp near the Croatian border two weeks ago when much of it was burned to the ground. A few remain at the facility, relying on makeshift tent structures, while many more have left.
Others have spread out into nearby forests, hoping to cross the border and seek a better life in the European Union, of which Croatia is a member.
""Over the past two weeks, we watched with growing concern the dire humanitarian situation facing many migrants in Bosnia,"" said IOM spokesman Paul Dillon.
""IOM and its partners are providing support as best we can, but it's clear that a sustainable long-term solution must be found.""
Some of the hundreds of people who have remained close to the damaged camp queued up on Tuesday for food being distributed by humanitarian aid groups.
Men huddled around fires made from scraps of wood, while others bathed in a nearby stream, shivering as they tried to dry off.
IOM chief of mission in Bosnia, Peter Van der Auweraert, said there was space for many of the stranded migrants in centres nearby, but it had been difficult to get political agreement from national and local authorities.
Suhret Fazlic, mayor of the northern town of Bihac close to where the camp is located, said his region was taking on a heavy burden which should be shared with other parts of the country.
He also said that funds for supporting migrants had not reached the city.
""The budget of Bihac has not received a euro from any level of authorities in Bosnia and from the European Union, from any other countries, from anybody,"" he told Reuters.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on Bosnian authorities to open new accommodation facilities for migrants.
""#BiH authorities should behave like an aspiring EU member,"" Borrell tweeted on Sunday, referring to the potential future expansion of the bloc to include Bosnia.

According to the IOM, around 70,000 migrants have passed through Bosnia since 2018. Currently some 6,000 are in camps in addition to the nearly 3,000 without accommodation.

So far, the country has administered jabs to about 44,000 healthcare workers using  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine, the only one available in the country so far, but authorities hope to ramp up vaccinations in coming weeks.
Vaccinating all ""senior citizens"" by the end of March would be a huge logistical challenge in a nation of 127 million people with shoddy medical services in vast rural areas.
""We are going to start at the bottom, where the most marginalized people live,"" Lopez Obrador told his daily morning news conference.
Mexico expects to receive 1.4 million Pfizer vaccines that require two doses per person by the end of January, which should be enough to vaccinate most of the 750,000 frontline healthcare workers who are at the front of the queue.
Lopez Obrador said the plan to vaccinate older adults in remote areas will rely on vaccines from Chinese company CanSino Biologics, in part because it requires a single shot and is easy to store. Pfizer's vaccine needs to be kept in special ultra-cold freezers.
Mexico has sought to order 35 million CanSino vaccines, with about 8 million arriving by March, officials say, though Mexico's regulator has yet to approve its use. 
Mexico's vaccination drive would be carried out in 10,000 community centres serving small and remote towns and focusing on adults above 60 years of age. Medium sized towns and large cities would follow, Lopez Obrador said.
More than 127,000 people have died from COVID-19 in Mexico, which has the world's fourth highest death toll.
Mexico has several vaccine agreements, including with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and the World Health Organization-backed COVAX scheme set up to deliver vaccines to developing countries.

The central European country of 5.5 million has seen record numbers of new cases and hospitalisations in the past days, with 3,146 people in hospitals as of Monday, despite a partial national lockdown.
People from the Nitra region of about 160,000 would not be allowed to attend work as of Monday without a negative test, Prime Minister Igor Matovic told a televised news conference from the central Slovak city.
""The situation in Nitra is so dramatic that only voluntary testing would not be enough,"" Matovic said. ""This is a better way to protect workers, companies, the health of the people.""
Slovakia has limited movement of people to necessary work commutes, shopping and nature walks within their district, but new cases have remained high, with around 10,000 found on Monday through PCR and antigen testing. 
Jaguar Land Rover is the biggest employer in the Nitra region with around 2,800 workers.
Milan Dubaj, head of the Nitra University Hospital, said more than 10 people were dying in his COVID-19 ward every day, and called the situation ""desperate"".

AL-ULA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Embracing Qatar's ruler, Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince pushed a deal to end a bitter row with Doha at a Gulf Arab summit on Tuesday to try to shore up an anti-Iran front, although a final declaration contained only a general pledge of solidarity. 
The kingdom's foreign minister said Riyadh and its Arab allies agreed to restore ties with Doha to end a boycott imposed in mid-2017 and strengthen a Gulf Arab alliance against Tehran.
While the communique contained no detailed confirmation of a deal, the apparent breakthrough signalled hope for mending a rift between major U.S. allies two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office and at a time of regional tensions with Iran.
""There is political will and good faith"" to guarantee implementation of the deal, Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan al-Saud told a news conference, saying the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt had all agreed to restore ties with Doha. 
The apparent deal followed mediation efforts by the United States and Kuwait, and a U.S. official said on Monday Qatar would suspend legal cases related to the boycott under the emerging deal.
Ahead of the gathering in the historic city of al-Ula, which was also attended by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, Kuwait anounced that Saudi Arabia would reopen its airspace and borders to Qatar. The other three nations have yet to announce similar moves.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, hugged at the airport tarmac before heading to the summit venue in a mirrored building reflecting the desert landscape.
Saudi de facto ruler Prince Mohammed, who chaired the short event instead of his father King Salman, said the al-Ula agreement ""confirms Gulf, Arab and Islamic unity and stability"". 
He also called for serious action by the global community to address a threat he said was posed by Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and its ""subversive and destructive plans"".
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar over allegations Doha supports terrorism, a charge it denies.
WORKING THE PHONES
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been pushing for a resolution to the dispute that Washington sees as hindering efforts to contain Iran.
Kushner, tasked by Trump, his father-in-law, to work on ending the rift, was making phone calls on the emerging deal until the early hours of Monday, a U.S. official had said.
Diplomats and analysts said Riyadh was also pushing reluctant allies to show Biden that the kingdom is open to dialogue. Biden has said he will take a harder line with the kingdom over issues including its human rights record and the Yemen war.
""This (deal) is seemingly influenced by a desire to pre-empt pressure from an incoming Biden administration, more than a genuine commitment to conflict resolution,"" said Emadeddin Badi, nonresident senior fellow at Atlantic Council.
""The détente within the GCC is very unlikely to significantly affect geopolitical dynamics beyond the Gulf.""
All the states are U.S. allies. Qatar hosts the region's largest U.S. military base, Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE host U.S. troops.
Qatar says the boycott aims to curb its sovereignty.

The other countries had set Doha 13 demands, including closing Al Jazeera TV, shuttering a Turkish base, cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain began its third COVID-19 lockdown on Tuesday with the government calling for one last major national effort to defeat the spread of a virus that has infected an estimated one in 50 citizens before mass vaccinations turn the tide.
Finance minister Rishi Sunak announced a new package of business grants worth 4.6 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) to help keep people in jobs and firms afloat until measures are relaxed gradually, at the earliest from mid-February but likely later.
Britain has been among the countries worst-hit by COVID-19, with the second highest death toll in Europe and an economy that suffered the sharpest contraction of any in the Group of Seven during the first wave of infections last spring.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the latest data showed 2% of the population were currently infected - more than a million people in England.
""When everybody looks at the position, people understand overwhelmingly that we have no choice,"" he told a news conference.
More than 1.3 million people in Britain have already received their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination, but this is not enough to have an impact on transmission yet.
Johnson announced the new lockdown late on Monday, saying the highly contagious new coronavirus variant first identified in Britain was spreading so fast the National Health Service risked being overwhelmed within 21 days.
In England alone, some 27,000 people are in hospital with COVID, 40% more than during the first peak in April, with infection numbers expected to rise further after increased socialising during the Christmas period.
Since the start of the pandemic, more than 75,000 people have died in the United Kingdom within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according to official figures. The number of daily new infections passed 60,000 for the first time on Tuesday.
A Savanta-ComRes poll taken just after Johnson's address suggested four in five adults in England supported the lockdown.
""I definitely think it was the right decision to make,"" said Londoner Kaitlin Colucci, 28. ""I just hope that everyone doesn't struggle too much with having to be indoors again.""
Downing Street said Johnson had cancelled a visit to India later this month to focus on the response to the virus, and Buckingham Palace called off its traditional summer garden parties this year.
VACCINATIONS ARE KEY
Under the new rules in England, schools are closed to most pupils, people should work from home if possible, and all hospitality and non-essential shops are closed. Semi-autonomous executives in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have imposed similar measures.
As infection rates soar across Europe, other countries are also clamping down on public life. Germany is set to extend its strict lockdown until the end of the month, and Italy will keep nationwide restrictions in place this weekend while relaxing curbs on weekdays.
Sunak's latest package of grants adds to the eye-watering 280 billion pounds in UK government support already announced for this financial year to stave off total economic collapse.
The new lockdown is likely to cause the economy to shrink again, though not as much as during the first lockdown last spring. JP Morgan economist Allan Monks said he expected the economy to shrink by 2.5% in the first quarter of 2021 -- compared with almost 20% in the second quarter of 2020.
To end the cycle of lockdowns, the government is pinning its hopes on vaccines. It aims to vaccinate all elderly care home residents and their carers, everyone over the age of 70, all frontline health and social care workers, and everyone who is clinically extremely vulnerable by mid-February.
But senior minister Michael Gove urged caution in terms of when that might translate into an easing of restrictions.
""We'll be able to review the progress that we've made on the 15th of February ... and we hope that we'll be able to progressively lift restrictions after that, but what I can't do is predict, nobody can predict with accuracy what we will be able to relax and when,"" he said on Sky News.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for Lisa Montgomery, a convicted murderer and the only woman on federal death row, asked U.S. President Donald Trump to halt her execution scheduled for next week, saying she committed her crime after a lifetime of being abused and raped.
Montgomery, due to be killed by lethal injections of a barbiturate on Jan. 12, was convicted in 2007 in Missouri for kidnapping and strangling Bobbie Jo Stinnett, then eight months pregnant. Montgomery then cut Stinnett's fetus from the womb. The child survived.
Montgomery suffered sexual abuse and torture at the hands of her stepfather and mother that Montgomery's lawyers and her sister, who was also raped in their childhood home, compared to a horror movie. In a nearly 7,000-page clemency petition filed on Tuesday, they asked Trump to commute Montgomery's sentence to life in prison.
""Broken before she was born, Lisa Montgomery's life was filled with torture, terror, failure, and betrayal,"" the lawyers wrote, saying Montgomery was born brain-damaged because of her mother's alcoholism.
Montgomery is held at the Federal Medical Center in Carswell, Texas, a prison for inmates with mental illness.
Trump is a long-time exponent of the death penalty, and has allowed more executions in a year than any other U.S. president has done since the 19th century. His administration revived the punishment in the federal system in 2020 after a 17-year hiatus even as the novel coronavirus spread to infect prison employees, inmates' lawyers and two other inmates facing execution. President-elect Joe Biden has said he will seek to abolish the death penalty. He takes office on Jan. 20.
The lawyers have said it is wrong to execute Montgomery because of her mental illness and because other women who have committed similar crimes did not face the death penalty.
Montgomery, now 52, was abused by her stepfather, who built a room in the back of a trailer where they lived in which he and his friends raped her from about the age of 11 on and where her mother pimped her for sex, Montgomery's lawyers said. 
Diane Mattingly, Montgomery's older sister, told reporters at a briefing that she was also repeatedly raped, sometimes with Montgomery in the same room, until authorities removed her to foster care.

""So many people let her down,"" Mattingly said. ""Yes, I started out the same way, but I went into a place where I was loved and cared for and shown self worth. I had a good foundation. Lisa did not and she broke. She literally broke.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is extending its nationwide lockdown until the end of the month and introducing tougher new restrictions in an effort to curb surging coronavirus infections, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday.
""We need to restrict contact more strictly... We ask all citizens to restrict contact to the absolute minimum,"" Merkel told reporters after a meeting with the leaders of Germany's 16 federal states.
The new rules restrict for the first time non-essential travel for residents of hard-hit areas all over Germany.
They limit movement to a 15-kilometre (nine-mile) radius in towns and districts where the number of new coronavirus cases is above 200 per 100,000 residents over seven days.
Members of any one household will be allowed to meet only one other person in public. That compares with a current rule under which public gatherings are limited to five people from two households.
Like many other European countries, Germany is struggling to contain a second wave of the virus. Britain began its third COVID-19 lockdown on Tuesday with citizens under orders to stay at home.
Concern is growing that hospitals in Germany will struggle to cope, and Merkel said a new mutation of the coronavirus first detected in Britain increased the need to be more cautious.
SHOPS, SCHOOLS TO STAY SHUT
Shops and restaurants will remain shut until the end of January. Schools are also to remain closed, with classes to be held online, until at least the end of the month.
""We believe these measures are justified, even if they are hard,"" Merkel said.
The chancellor said she and the state leaders would review the new measures on Jan. 25.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany roseby 11,897 to 1.787 million in the last day, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Tuesday. The death toll rose by 944 to 35,518.
Germany had imposed a partial lockdown in November but was forced to close schools, shops and restaurants in mid-December after the initial steps failed to have the desired impact.

Germany is rolling out a vaccine against COVID-19 but the media and some officials have criticised the government for a slow start and for ordering too few doses. By Tuesday, around 317,000 people had received a shot.

It was not immediately clear who carried out the attacks but a French army source told Reuters that French forces operating in Mali had carried out an air strike in the area on Sunday that killed ""dozens of fighters"" from Islamist groups in the area.
The health worker, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the air strikes had targeted men on motorbikes in the villages of Bounty and Kikara believed to be Islamist militants.
But civilians were caught up in the strike as people gathered for a wedding ceremony, the source said, adding that some of the wounded had to receive amputations at a nearby health centre. 
The identity of the targets was confirmed by drone before the attack and on the ground afterwards, the French army source said. 
France has more than 5,100 military personnel based in the region to help counter Islamist militants. But a seven-year intervention has come at a cost as forces struggle to contain jihadists in the open desert. 
Five French soldiers have been killed in the country in recent days.

Police had told his lawyer Melkamu Ogo that their lines of inquiry included accusations of disseminating false information, communicating with groups fighting the government, and disturbing the public's peace and security. However, Ogo said he had seen no evidence.
""We are delighted that Kumerra has been released and reunited with his family. His release today affirms he has done nothing wrong,"" Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement.
""Kumerra is a journalist who has consistently demonstrated his professionalism and commitment to accuracy, as part of a Reuters team that reports from Ethiopia in a fair, independent and unbiased way. Journalists like Kumerra must be allowed to report the news in the public interest without fear of harassment or harm, wherever they are.""
The Ethiopian police and prosecutor's office did not respond to questions from Reuters on the reasons for Kumerra's arrest and subsequent release.
Kumerra, 38, has worked for Reuters for a decade.
His family said they were preparing a special meal and looking forward to having him home for Christmas, which many Ethiopian Christians will celebrate on Thursday.
""We are so relieved that Kumerra has been released and would like to thank everyone who has supported us during this difficult time,"" the family said in a statement.
""Kumerra is a dedicated and professional journalist who has done nothing wrong. He simply wants to report on Ethiopia in an independent way. His family missed him every day he was detained, and we are delighted that Kumerra will be home for Christmas.""
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, has overseen sweeping reforms since taking office in 2018, including the unbanning of more than 250 media outlets and the release of dozens of journalists.
However, rights groups say press freedom has eroded as the government faced outbreaks of deadly violence including fighting between the military and rebellious leaders in the northern region of Tigray. 
Media watchdog groups reported the arrests of at least 12 other journalists in Ethiopia last year, seven of them in November when the Tigray conflict broke out.
Only one journalist was charged, for social media posts about COVID-19 that were denounced by the health ministry as false, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders.
Eight have since been released and the rest remain in custody, the two groups said.

Police and government officials did not return calls and messages seeking comment. The government has previouslysaid the nation is facing security threats and is committedto maintaining law and order.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Scaling the world's second-highest peak, K2, in winter is one of the last great feats in mountaineering -- and despite what some see as a lack of experience, 28-year-old Pole Magdalena Gorzkowska wants to be the first to do it.
If Gorzkowska, a medal-winning runner who also became the youngest Polish woman ever to climb Mount Everest, makes it to the summit, she will have made history and silenced those who see her attempt as a social media stunt with no chance of success.
""Everyone can have their opinion, and some believe that it takes many years to be able to face such challenges. I just do what I feel I can do,"" Gorzkowska told Reuters by telephone from her base camp. ""Why should I limit myself?""
Gorzkowska is one of several mountaineers attempting this winter to scale K2, which at 8,611 metres (28,251 feet) is second only to Mount Everest.
Gorzkowska, who is being accompanied by sherpas, said she had returned to her base camp, at an altitude of 5,000 metres, after an acclimatisation trip that saw her spend a night at a camp at 6,550 metres.
""The conditions were very difficult. The mountain gives you a hard time, it is very demanding. You have to climb hard all the time, the wind is very strong. It is at least minus 30 degrees non-stop,"" she said.
NOTORIOUS PEAK
K2, in the Karakorum mountains along the border between China and Pakistan, is notorious for its high winds, especially steep and icy slopes, and a high fatality rate among climbers. Eighty six climbers are reported to have died on its slopes.
Two years ago a Polish team abandoned their attempt to reach the summit in winter due to heavy snow. 
The scale of the challenge has made some in the male-dominated world of Polish mountaineering regard her bid with scepticism.
""Just wait for the desire to attack K2 in winter to be announced by top Polish Youtubers, Instagrammers or other influencers,"" Polish mountaineer Marcin Miotk said, on hearing the news of her attempt.
Gorzkowska is unfazed by such comments.
""I dreamt of K2 in winter and that's why I'm here. Maybe they (her critics) don't have dreams like that, maybe they aren't so determined,"" she said.

Over the first 11 months of the year, some 19 million foreign tourists visited Spain, around 78% fewer than in the same period of 2019, the National Statistics Institute (INE) said.
Tourists spent 91% less in November than in the same month a year ago, INE said.
The situation is worst in the Canary Islands, where mild temperatures attract tourists all through the European winter. Travel restrictions in the region have left beaches and hotels almost empty, bringing local businesses to the brink of collapse.
""Right now, the situation is null, not a single person passes by during the day. They say more tourists will arrive, but we can't find the way, every day we see no change,"" said Chandni Mathrani, who owns a clothes shop in San Bartolome de Tirajana, Gran Canaria.
Germany and Britain added the islands, located off the West African Atlantic Coast, to their list of COVID-19 risk areas at the end of December after an increase in cases. Tourists from both countries account for about half the visitors to the islands, according to INE. 
""There are maybe five flights a week, that is not enough for all the islands, it is impossible,"" Mathrani added.
Between January and November, almost 3.6 million foreign visitors flew to the Canary Islands, 70% fewer than in the same period of 2019, according to INE. 
Playa del Ingles and Playa San Agustin in San Bartolome, a popular spot for international tourists, were almost empty on Tuesday morning, with only a handful of sunbeds occupied. 
""It is terrible, we have no help, nothing. We pay rent, taxes... I don't know how we keep going,"" Gabriele Weinmann, who owns another clothes shop in San Bartolome.
Following nine months of business restrictions related to the pandemic, the number of jobless people in the archipelago rose 29% from December 2019.
The number of jobless people in Spain stood at 3.89 million in December, with an additional 755,000 workers on a state-supported furlough scheme.

Saied and Mechichi are at odds over their respective powers and political alliances. With the dismissal of Interior Minister Taoufik Charfeddine, the tensions could mushroom into a crisis threatening a collapse of the technocratic government.
A cabinet statement said Mechichi would supervise the interior ministry on an interim basis pending the appointment of Charfeddine's successor. No reasons were given for his removal.
Mechichi is expected in coming weeks to reshuffle his cabinet amid demands from pro-government parties in parliament to include party figures in the government. Opposition parties and the presidency want a continued technocratic cabinet.
Parliament approved a technocratic government in a confidence vote four months ago, hoping to end months of political instability and focus on tackling worsening economic and social problems.
Though Saied proposed Mechichi as premier in the new government, Tunisian politicians said he subsequently withdrew his support, underlining brewing tensions between the presidency and government.
While previous bouts of political discord in Tunisia focused on the split between secularists and Islamists, or over economic reforms, more recent tensions seem rooted in the division of powers between president and parliament.
Tunisia is the only Arab country to have managed a peaceful transition to democracy after the ""Arab Spring"" uprisings that swept through the region in 2011.
But the North African nation's economy has been crippled by high debt and deteriorating public services, made worse by the global coronavirus pandemic.

Hundreds of students and about two dozen faculty members say the appointment of Melih Bulu at the leading Turkish school was undemocratic. Such demonstrations are rare and little tolerated in Turkey, especially since a failed coup in 2016.
Students clashed with police on Monday at the entrance to the university and officers used tear gas to disperse the crowd. Police on Tuesday raided 24 homes and detained 17 people including two Bogazici students, the Istanbul governor's office said. 
Faculty members gathered on campus later on Tuesday during the swearing-in of Bulu, who has a doctorate in business management, and turned their backs on the rector's building.
They said in a statement Bulu was the first rector appointed from outside a university since a 1980 military coup and part of increasing anti-democratic practices since 2016, when the failed coup prompted Erdogan's government to launch a crackdown against perceived opponents. 
In an interview on Haberturk TV, Bulu said he would not resign because his appointment met global standards, and that police stopped non-students from entering campus.
""Bogazici students can protest wherever and however they want,"" he said. 
Bulu added he joined Erdogan's ruling AK Party when it was founded about two decades ago and later applied to run for parliamentary election.
Several hundred police officers and a handful of trucks with water canons were sent to the school on Tuesday. 
More than a hundred students gathered on campus for a second day and chanted: ""Melih Bulu is not our rector"" and ""Students and teachers are in solidarity"".
Turkish Deputy Interior Minister Ismail Catakli criticised the slogans.
""We cannot accept or remain silent to our police being called murderers,"" he said, adding some of those detained had links to an outlawed leftist organisation. 
Authorities have arrested thousands of academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants and military members as part of the post-2016 crackdown, which the government says was necessary given threats to the country.
Critics say Erdogan has used the coup attempt as a pretext to quash dissent.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Public health experts advising Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called on Tuesday for the swift imposition of a state of emergency in the Tokyo area as daily COVID-19 cases hit a record and some citizens accused the government of dragging its feet.
The government's top spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, said a decision would likely come on Thursday on whether to impose the second state of emergency since the start of the pandemic.
Japanese media said it would take effect by Friday and last about a month. The government is anxious about the economic impact of another state of emergency as it prepares to host the Olympics in the summer.
""There is a risk of a nationwide and rapid spread of infections taking place if the infection situation in Tokyo and surrounding regions does not subside,"" said Shigeru Omi, head of the panel of public health experts advising Suga.
New cases in Tokyo surged to 1,278 on Tuesday, the second highest daily total since the pandemic began, with the national daily tally reaching a record 4,907, public broadcaster NHK reported.
Tokyo and the three surrounding prefectures, which have requested an emergency declaration, asked residents to refrain from non-essential, non-urgent outings after 8 p.m. from Friday until at least the end of the month, and said restaurants must close by that time.
But measures are likely to be far less sweeping than they were during last year's roughly month-long state of emergency, during which schools and none-essential businesses shut down, as the government seeks to keep economic damage to a minimum.
A second lockdown in and around Japan's capital could cause the economy to contract in the first quarter of this year, analysts said. 
Education Minister Koichi Hagiuda said the government wouldn't seek to close all schools, leaving that decision to local authorities.
Senior ruling party lawmaker Hiroshige Seko said the government should declare the state of emergency for a month and later extend it if needed. 
Suga said on Monday that ""limited, concentrated measures"" would be most effective, but details remained unclear, including whether sports venues, theatres and cinemas would close.
A lack of legal teeth to enforce measures means they must be couched as ""requests"", although a bill may be submitted later this year to rectify this. 
FRUSTRATION
Frustration reigned on social media, with many questioning the piecemeal measures, especially as the country still plans to host the Olympics, postponed from 2020 by the pandemic but set to open in under 200 days.
""Do you really think you can extinguish a fire by leaving it until it's big and then just splashing it with water from a bucket?"" wrote user Kei Koike.
Suga's initial political honeymoon after taking up his post last September has ended, his support rating battered by criticism of his response to the virus and his decision to attend a group steak dinner in defiance of his own calls for caution.
He has also drawn criticism for his initial reluctance to pause a domestic travel subsidy programme.
""They asked us to stay home and promoted travel, they ask us to eat in small groups and promote restaurants. Their deeds are the exact opposite of their words,"" wrote another Twitter user, Jinrui Minakyou.
Since the start of the pandemic, Japan has recorded more than 245,000 cases and about 3,600 deaths - far fewer than many other countries. But the numbers have been climbing rapidly.
Though Suga has pledged to have enough vaccine supply for the nation's population of 126 million, Japan has yet to approve any for use and only aims to begin inoculations by the end of February.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) last month became the first drugmaker to apply for Japanese approval of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. Japan has arranged to buy 120 million doses, or enough to inoculate 60 million people. 

But when those shots will be available remains unclear, as Pfizer has encountered production and roll-out snags in other parts of the world where its vaccine has already been approved for use.

Iran and the regional forces it backs have increasingly relied in recent years on drones in Yemen, Syria, Iraq and the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf.
Iran's armed forces are to test combat drones used as bombers, interceptors and in reconnaissance missions in the two-day exercises in central Semnan province, the semi-official Fars news agency said.
""The fingers of our heroic armed forces are on the trigger, and if enemies commit the slightest mistake, the armed forces will surely respond fiercely,"" said Mohammad Baqeri, chief of staff of the armed forces, quoted by state media.
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said U.S. President Donald Trump may be trying to find an excuse to attack Iran in his last days in office, or Israel might try to provoke a war. Israel rejected the allegation.
The exercises coincided with increased tensions between Iran and the United States, two days after the first anniversary of the killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad airport, and two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
Biden aims to revive a nuclear agreement with Iran abandoned by Trump, though diplomacy is expected to be tricky.
Beyond surveillance, Iranian drones can drop munitions and also carry out a ""kamikaze"" flight when loaded with explosives and flown into a target, according to a U.S. official who spoke to Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-iran-drones-idUSKCN1UC1X4.
Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of international sanctions and embargoes barring it from importing many weapons. Western military analysts say Iran sometimes exaggerates its weapons capabilities, though concerns about its ballistic missiles contributed to Washington leaving the nuclear pact.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As a team from the World Health Organization (WHO) prepares to visit China to investigate the origins of COVID-19, Beijing has stepped up efforts not only to prevent new outbreaks, but also shape the narrative about when and where the pandemic began.
China has dismissed criticism of its early handling of the coronavirus, first identified in the city of Wuhan at the end of 2019, and foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday that the country would welcome the WHO team.
But amid simmering geopolitical tensions, experts said the investigators were unlikely to be allowed to scrutinise some of the more sensitive aspects of the outbreak, with Beijing desperate to avoid blame for a virus that has killed more than 1.8 million people worldwide.
""Even before this investigation, top officials from both sides have been very polarised in their opinions on the origins of the outbreak,"" said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think tank.
""They will have to be politically savvy and draw conclusions that are acceptable to all the major parties,"" he added.
While other countries continue to struggle with infection surges, China has aggressively doused flare-ups. After a new cluster of cases last week, the city of Shenyang sealed off entire communities and required all non-essential workers to stay home. 
On Saturday, senior diplomat Wang Yi praised the anti-pandemic efforts, saying China not only curbed domestic infections, but also ""took the lead in building a global anti-epidemic defence"" by providing aid to more than 150 countries. 
But mindful of the criticism China has faced worldwide, Wang also became the highest-ranking official to question the consensus about COVID-19's origins, saying ""more and more studies"" show that it emerged in multiple regions. 
China is also the only country to claim COVID-19 can be transmitted via cold chain imports, with the country blaming new outbreaks in Beijing and Dalian on contaminated shipments - even though the WHO has downplayed those risks. 
TRANSPARENCY 
China has been accused of a cover-up that delayed its initial response, allowing the virus to spread further. 
The topic remains sensitive, with only a handful of studies into the origins of COVID-19 made available to the public.
But there have also been signs China is willing to share information that contradicts the official picture. 
Last week, a study by China's Center for Disease Control showed that blood samples from 4.43% of Wuhan's population contained COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that the city's infection rates were far higher than originally acknowledged.
But scientists said China must also share any findings suggesting COVID-19 was circulating domestically long before it was officially identified in December 2019. 
An Italian study showed that COVID-19 might have been in Europe several months before China's first official case. Chinese state media used the paper to support theories that COVID-19 originated overseas and entered China via contaminated frozen food or foreign athletes competing at the World Military Games in Wuhan in October 2019.
Raina MacIntyre, head of the Kirby (NYSE:KEX) Institute's Biosecurity Research Program in Australia, said the investigation needed to draw ""a comprehensive global picture of the epidemiological clues"", including any evidence COVID-19 was present outside of China before December 2019. 

However, political issues mean they are unlikely to be given much leeway to investigate one hypothesis, that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, said MacIntyre. 
""I think it is unlikely all viruses in the lab at the time will be made available to the team,"" she said. ""So I do not think we will ever know the truth.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indonesian ride-hailing and payments firm Gojek and e-commerce leader Tokopedia are in advanced talks to seal a $18 billion merger ahead of a potential dual listing in Jakarta and the United States, people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.
A deal, which would be the biggest yet for Indonesia, could transform the landscape in the country's e-commerce market, whose growth has accelerated as stay-at-home pandemic restrictions have stoked demand for food delivery and e-payments.
Bigger rivals in the space include Southeast Asian ride-hailing, food delivery and e-payments firm Grab, and Singapore-based regional internet company Sea Ltd, which commands a market value of $100 billion and operates e-commerce platform Shopee.
As a merged company, decade-old start-ups, Gojek and Tokopedia would seek to expand market share and pursue profitability by offering services, such as grocery shopping and courier services from a single platform.
""An international listing for a regional internet group will showcase that Southeast Asia isn't a one-hit wonder. It'll pave the way for global growth and exits for several other high-growth startups from the region,"" said Varun Mittal, head of emerging markets fintech business at E&Y.
Common investors in the pair, which are Indonesia's most valuable start-ups, include Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, Sequoia Capital and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL). 
 Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd and SoftBank Group Corp are among Tokopedia's investors, while Gojek's include Warburg Pincus LLC and Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.
Three of the people with direct knowledge of the matter said Gojek and Tokopedia in late December agreed to conduct due diligence of each other's business.
The founders and some senior executives of Gojek and Tokopedia have been friends for the last decade and aim to finalise a deal in the first half, the people said.
""These are amicable conversations between mutually trusted partners. The broad terms are largely agreed,"" said one person.
Talks between the companies started in 2018, two people said. Negotiations gathered momentum in November last year after months of merger talks between Gojek and Grab faltered, they said.
To finalise a deal, Gojek and Tokopedia need to thrash out merger ratios and seek approval from their boards.
The people said Gojek was last valued at just over $10 billion and Tokopedia at around $7 billion. The combined entity would figure in the top 10 Indonesian companies by market value and become one of the largest Southeast Asian tech companies.
All the sources declined to be identified as the talks were private. Gojek, Tokopedia and Grab declined to comment.
BATTLEGROUND INDONESIA
A listing of the combined businesses could raise as much as $2 billion, two people said, in what could be one of the biggest IPOs by an Indonesian company.
Reuters reported last month that Tokopedia received a merger approach from a blank-cheque acquisition firm. Tokopedia had said an indirect listing via a special purpose acquisition company was an option.
Gojek and Grab are both seeking to become one-stop shops for ride-hailing, food delivery and payments.
Tokopedia is a marketplace which, unlike most of its rivals, does not hold its own inventory.
Southeast Asia, with a population of about 650 million, expects to see its internet economy grow to $300 billion from an estimated $100 billion last year.
""In order to truly compete against Sea, Gojek and Tokopedia would have to demonstrate that they are more than an Indonesian business,"" said Joel Shen, a technology lawyer at Withers.
""On the other hand, Gojek and Tokopedia are seen as homegrown tech champions. For this reason, a merger would appeal more strongly to the nationalistic sentiments of Indonesian investors and regulators alike.""
Gojek has expanded in countries including Singapore and Vietnam, while Tokopedia's Indonesian marketplace has more than 100 million monthly active users.

Bloomberg News earlier reported merger talks between Gojek and Tokopedia.

Melchior, Caspar and Balthazar are widely celebrated in Spain on Epiphany (Jan. 6), when they are said to have visited the infant Christ with gold, frankincense and myrrh.
On that day children get presents their parents tell them have been brought by the Three Wise Men, and not Santa Claus - even if the latter has also become increasingly popular in Spain.
Balthazar was impersonated by a white man with black face paint, as is often the case in Epiphany celebrations in some Spanish cities. The practice has not drawn the same degree of controversy and condemnation as the ""Black Pete"" Christmas character in the Netherlands - a fictional character usually portrayed by white people wearing black face paint and which is gradually disappearing. 
After flying over Seville and waving at children watching from their homes, the Wise Men said they hoped they would be back with a proper parade next year.
""It has been an amazing flight. We come with huge enthusiasm to deliver all the presents,"" Caspar told Reuters.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian illegal armed groups lost roughly 5,120 members in 2020 as the country's armed forces continued operations amidst the coronavirus pandemic to weaken them and stop them from growing in size and territory, said General Luis Fernando Navarro. 
The figure includes combat deaths, captures, and desertions affecting the National Liberation Army (ELN), dissidents of the demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who rejected a 2016 peace deal, and other armed groups including Clan del Golfo, Los Caparros, and Los Pelusos, Navarro said. 
All five armed groups are linked to drug trafficking and illegal mining, he added. 
""The remnants (FARC dissidents) have lost some 1,100 men. The ELN lost more than 700 men due to legitimate state action in targeted strikes,"" Navarro, commander of Colombia's armed forces, told Reuters in an interview. 
Colombia's military is authorized to bomb the groups, which hold strategic areas in the country's jungles and mountains for producing cocaine and illegally mining metals, mainly gold. 
""They don't have the capacity to recover from the damage done by Colombian authorities, which is why we believe their plans are focused on containment and our objective is to take them to a turning point,"" Navarro said. 
Excluding the members lost, the five groups finished 2020 with around 6,800 combatants, according to an intelligence report seen by Reuters. The groups ended 2019 with a similar number of combatants.
FARC dissidents and the ELN accounted for 2,500 combatants and 2,450 combatants respectively.
The result came during a year when the armed forces undertook operations to reinforce border security and deliver food and aid to people in need amid the coronavirus pandemic, Navarro added.
""We believe we've met our objectives, and will continue to meet them, with our strategy to keep diminishing these armed groups,"" Navarro said, adding that Colombia's military will have more territorial control in 2021 as part of its offensive against criminal organizations.

""Well, the justice system is making its way and we're not a party to that. And like any Australian, they're offered consular support and should, you know, the appeal fail, obviously he would be able to return to Australia like any other Australian,"" Morrison told local radio station 2GB. 
""So, yes, it's just a straightforward process of the legal system in the UK working its way through.""
Assange, 49, is accused by the United States of 18 offences during the administration of former President Barack Obama relating to the release by WikiLeaks of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which they say put lives at risk.
Assange's supporters, however, see him as an anti-establishment hero who has been victimised because he exposed U.S. wrongdoing in Afghanistan and Iraq and say his prosecution is a politically motivated assault on journalism and free speech.
WikiLeaks came to prominence when it published a U.S. military video in 2010 showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NASDAQ:APA) helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. It then released thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic cables.
Mexico on Monday offered political asylum to Assange, a move that could anger the United States.

Lai Xiaomin was convicted of receiving or seeking bribes totalling 1.788 billion yuan ($276.72 million) from 2008 to 2018, when he was also a senior banking regulator, according to the Secondary Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin. 
Lai, who was expelled from the ruling Communist Party in 2018, was also convicted on a charge of bigamy. 
Reuters was unable to contact Lai or his lawyer for comment. 
""Lai Xiaomin was lawless and extremely greedy,"" the court statement said.
Huarong said its Communist Party committee supports the verdict. 
""The severe treatment of Lai Xiaomin reflects the strong determination of the Central Committee with President Xi Jinping as the core to administer the party and its zero tolerance in punishing corruption,"" the company said in a statement. 
The court noted that most of the activity in question took place after the 18th Party Congress in late 2012, referring to an event that sparked a sweeping anti-corruption campaign by soon-to-be President Xi Jinping that became a hallmark of his first term.
""The social harm was huge and the crimes were extremely serious and he should be severely punished according to law,"" the court said.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Members of the Shi'ite Hazara minority in Pakistan who have blockaded a highway in Quetta with the bodies of slain coal miners said on Tuesday they will not withdraw until Prime Minister Imran Khan meets them and the killers are brought to justice.
Islamic State militants slit the throats of 11 miners in a residential compound near a mine site in Pakistan's Balochistan province on Sunday, filming the entire incident and later posting it online.
Thousands of Hazaras have since staged a protest, arranging the coffins across a highway in the provincial capital Quetta.
""We have become tired of picking up the bodies of our people,"" Syed Agha Raza, a Hazara Shi'ite political leader, told Reuters.
Masooma Yaqoob Ali told Reuters her elder brother along with four other relatives were among those killed. 
“Now we have no male member [of our family] to take coffins of our brother and other relatives to the graveyard for burial,” she said, shedding tears as she spoke.
The protesters are refusing to bury the victims of the attack until demands, which include the resignation of the provincial government, are met. Protests also occurred on Tuesday in Karachi, Pakistan's large southern city.
Balochistan Home Secretary Hafiz Basid told Reuters at least nine of the victims were from neighboring Afghanistan, and two bodies had thus far been taken there for burial. Afghanistan's Foreign Office said in a statement that seven of the dead were Afghan, and both sides were investigating the incident together. 
Hazaras have faced persecution by extremists in both countries, where Sunni Islam predominates. Some Afghan Hazaras come to Pakistan for work in the winter, including at the coal mine in Balochistan.
Hundreds of Hazara have been killed over the last decade in attacks in Pakistan, including bombings in schools and crowded markets and brazen ambushes of buses along Pakistani roads.

The militants struck late on Monday, killing residents of Mwenda village with machetes and guns, its civil society leader Jeremi Mbweki said.
He blamed the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group which has emerged as the most lethal militia in Congo's eastern borderlands and is suspected of hacking to death at least 17 people in a nearby village last week. 
""Now we live in total fear, with no certainty about the future,"" Mbweki said by phone. The administrator of Beni territory, Donat Kibwana, confirmed the death toll and said the ADF was responsible.
More than 1,000 civilians were killed in attacks attributed to the ADF in 2019 and 2020, according to U.N. figures, despite repeated offensives by the army and U.N. peacekeepers against the group over the past decade. 
Nine more bodies were discovered on Monday in another village in the area - also victims of an alleged ADF attack, Kibwana said.
Congo's eastern borderlands with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi have been ravaged by attacks by militias, many formed of remnants of groups that fought in Congo's civil wars around the turn of the century. 
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for many suspected ADF attacks in the past, although U.N. experts said last week that they have been unable to confirm any direct link between the two groups.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Iran denied on Tuesday it was using a South Korean ship and its crew as hostages, a day after it seized the tanker in the Gulf while pressing a demand for Seoul to release $7 billion in funds frozen under U.S. sanctions.
The seizure of the MT Hankuk Chemi and its 20-member crew near the strategic Strait of Hormuz has been seen as an attempt by Tehran to assert its demands, just two weeks before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in the United States.
Iran wants Biden to lift sanctions imposed by outgoing President Donald Trump. Tehran's critics have long accused it of capturing ships and foreign prisoners as a method of gaining leverage in negotiations.
""We've become used to such allegations,"" Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told a news conference. ""But if there is any hostage-taking, it is Korea's government that is holding $7 billion, which belongs to us, hostage on baseless grounds.""
South Korea summoned the Iranian ambassador, called for the ship to be released and said it was dispatching a delegation to Iran to discuss it. Iran says the ship was held over environmental violations.
Iran's ability to challenge shipping in the Gulf is one of its main points of leverage in what is expected to be a difficult negotiation when the Biden administration takes office on Jan. 20. In 2019, Iran held a British tanker for two months.
South Korea, like other countries, is required to limit Iran's access to its financial system under the U.S. sanctions, which were imposed by Trump after he abandoned a nuclear agreement reached with Iran under his predecessor Barack Obama.
Iran says the sanctions are illegal and have hurt its economy, including its ability to respond to the worst outbreak of COVID-19 in the Middle East.
Biden aims to revive the nuclear agreement, but any thaw is likely to pose a diplomatic challenge. Since Trump abandoned the deal, Iran has taken steps that violate it; Biden says Iran must be fully compliant before the deal can be restored, while Iran says Washington must first lift the sanctions.
On Monday, Tehran announced it had stepped up uranium enrichment at an underground facility, its latest move in violation of the nuclear deal's terms.

CREW 'SAFE'
South Korea's Foreign Minister, Kang Kyung-wha said on Tuesday she was making diplomatic efforts to secure the release of the tanker and had made contact with her counterpart in Tehran.
Iran's ambassador in Seoul, Saeed Badamchi Shabestari, asked about the status of the ship's crew before his meeting at the foreign ministry, told reporters ""all of them are safe"".
In addition to a South Korean delegation expected to go to Iran as soon as possible to try to free the ship, South Korea's Vice Foreign Minister, Choi Jong-kun, is scheduled to visit Iran on Sunday. Iranian state TV cited a Tehran government official as saying the visit had been scheduled earlier, to discuss the frozen funds.
'ARMED SOLDIERS'
The ship's Busan-based operator, Taikun Shipping Co. Ltd., told Reuters there had been nothing to indicate before the vessel was seized that Iranian authorities were probing possible violations of environmental rules.
""If it really was marine pollution, as they say, the coastguard was supposed to approach the ship first,"" Taikun's management director, Lee Chun-hee, said by telephone. ""But instead, armed soldiers approached the crew and said they needed to be investigated.""
Last Sunday, the Tehran Times newspaper reported Iran was hoping to negotiate an agreement to use the frozen funds to trade for commodities, including coronavirus vaccine doses.

According to South Korean news agency Yonhap, a foreign ministry official said the Iranian government had tried to secure vaccines through the global COVAX initiative, backed by the World Health Organization. Tehran had been in talks with the ministry and the U.S. Treasury to pay for the doses with South Korean won.

BANGI, Malaysia (Reuters) - Malaysian researchers have developed a method to transform the fibre found in normally discarded pineapple leaves to make a strong material that can be used to build the frames for unmanned aircraft, or drones.
The project, headed by Professor Mohamed Thariq Hameed Sultan at Malaysia's Putra University, has been trying to find sustainable uses for pineapple waste generated by farmers in Hulu Langat, an area about 65 km (40 miles) from Kuala Lumpur. 
""We are transforming the leaf of the pineapple into a fibre that can be used for aerospace application, basically inventing a drone,"" he told Reuters at a workshop.
Mohamed Thariq said drones made out of the bio-composite material had a higher strength-to-weight ratio than those made from synthetic fibres, and were also cheaper, lighter and easier to dispose of. 
If the drone was damaged, the frame could be buried in the ground and would degrade within two weeks, he said.
The prototype drones have been able to fly to a height of about 1,000 metres (3,280 ft) and stay in the air for about 20 minutes, he added.
Ultimately, the research team hopes to create a larger drone to accommodate bigger payloads, including imagery sensors, for agricultural purposes and aerial inspections.
""Our role here is to help the industry, the farmers, to increase their yield and make their jobs much easier,"" said William Robert Alvisse of the Malaysian Unmanned Drones Activist Society, a non-governmental group helping to design the drone and advising on the project.
Before the project launched in 2017, pineapple stems were discarded after the once-in-a-year harvest period, but farmers hope the drones project will encourage more innovation to find uses for the waste and boost incomes.

""With the health issue, the economy problem due to COVID-19, the society is desperate and there is no alternative to increase income,"" said pineapple farmer Irwan Ismail.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The governor of Indonesia's South Sulawesi said on Tuesday an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) found in the waters off his province that has sparked concern about a potential security breach or espionage attempt appeared to be made in China.
The vehicle, described as a ""seaglider"" by the Indonesian navy, was found late last month by fishermen off Sulawesi island and brought to Jakarta this week. 
Governor Nurdin Abdullah told Reuters ""based on findings, it seems like it was made in China.""
""Whether it was put there or who put it there is unknown to us,"" he said by telephone.
The Chinese embassy in Jakarta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Indonesian archipelago straddles strategically important sea lanes used for trade, with its waters also home to rich fishing grounds and important energy reserves. 
Indonesian security officials have previously voiced suspicion about Chinese maritime activities, amid increased militarization by Beijing in waters around Southeast Asia that have raised regional tensions.
Yudo Margono, the chief of staff to the navy, told a news briefing on Monday that an investigation had been launched and the vehicle was able to collect hydro-oceanography data and could be used for military purposes.
He also said it was unclear where it had originated and that no country had claimed the vehicle.
The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), to which Indonesia is party, says that marine scientific research in a country's exclusive economic zone or on the continental shelf should only be conducted with the consent of the coastal state.
Sukamta, an Indonesian lawmaker on a commission overseeing defence, urged authorities not to take too long to reveal the identity and origins of the ""drone"" so that further action could be taken.

Pham Chi Dung, Nguyen Tuong Thuy and Le Huu Minh Tuan were convicted of ""making, storing, spreading information, materials, items for the purpose of opposing the state"" at a one-day trial in Ho Chi Minh City, the Ministry of Public Security said. 
Dung established the Independent Journalists Association of Vietnam in 2014, which police said had sought regime change. 
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and tolerates little criticism. 
The party, under the leadership of 76-year-old Nguyen Phu Trong, has intensified a crackdown on dissent ahead of its five-yearly congress due to be held later this month. 
Dung was jailed for 15 years and Thuy and Tuan 11 years each. Reuters could not immediately reach their lawyers for comment. 
They wrote stories to ""distort and defame the people's administration, infringe the interests of the Communist Party of Vietnam and state,"" the ministry said in a statement.
""These are especially dangerous activities that if not stopped could hurt national security,"" it said. 
Amnesty International said the verdict underscored the government's contempt for free media, particularly ahead of the congress. 
""Even by its own deeply repressive standards, the severity of the sentences show the depths being reached by Vietnam's censors,"" said its deputy regional director, Emerlynne Gil.
Ahead of the trial, Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, called the charges ""bogus"". 
""If the ruling party is so assured in its leadership, it should demonstrate its confidence by respecting civil and political rights, ending its tight control of the press, and allowing independent journalists to freely voice their opinions instead of silencing them with arrest and long prison sentences,"" he said.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China has said it would revoke the licences of two human-rights lawyers involved in the case of 12 Hong Kongers whom mainland authorities arrested at sea and accused of trying to flee to Taiwan, according to the two lawyers.
One of them, Ren Quanniu, said mainland authorities warned him in September, telling him that taking on the case could imperil his licence. The lawyers said they had received letters on Monday about revoking their licences, and were given three days to appeal. Both said they intended to do so.
Families of two of the defendants appointed Ren and Lu Siwei to represent them, but the lawyers were denied access. 
The 12 were represented in court by lawyers appointed by mainland authorities. 
China's Ministry of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
    Both lawyers have been critical of China's legal process, and say the licence threat is linked to the case of the Hong Kongers, which drew criticism from international rights groups and foreign governments. 
    Ren also recently represented Zhang Zhan, a citizen-journalist sentenced to four years in prison over her reporting on the coronavirus in Wuhan.
Ten of the 12 Hong Kongers were sentenced last week by a court in Shenzhen to between seven months and three years in prison for illegal border crossing, while the two youngest were returned to Hong Kong for trial on charges related to anti-government protests last year.
The letters were issued by the jurisdictions where the lawyers are based. If the lose their licences, they will be unable to practice law in China. 
    In a letter from the justice department of Sichuan province seen by Reuters, Lu was accused of ""making multiple inappropriate remarks online"" over a long period of time, ""severely damaging the image of the industry"" and ""causing negative impacts on society.""
""I have no regrets,"" he told Reuters. 
    Ren, 40, showed Reuters a letter from the Henan province justice department accusing him of violating regulations over a case he took in 2018 representing a defendant in a religious matter.
The Henan justice department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Sichuan justice department could not immediately be reached for comment.
Ren said that a local lawyers association, the local justice department, and local national security officers had pressured him to drop the Hong Kong case in September, warning after an initial attempt to visit the detainee that his licence was at stake. 
The family of detainee Wong Wai-yin, who hired Ren, said they were ""appalled"" by the news.
Human rights lawyers in China are routinely targeted with jail terms and disbarment, and rights groups say such pressure has intensified in recent years under a crackdown on dissent under President Xi Jinping.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian ministers decided to keep nationwide restrictions in place this weekend to slow coronavirus infections, but agreed to relax curbs on weekdays.
Italians spent much of Christmas and New Year at home, with people allowed to leave their houses only for work, health and emergencies, or for brief trips to see a limited number of friends or relatives.
These rules are set to expire on Thursday and ministers agreed at a late Monday night cabinet meeting to return to the old, three-tier system, which allows for different measures to be applied to different regions.
But all bars and restaurants across the country will have to close this weekend, with travel between towns and cities kept to a minimum.
The government has also decided to postpone the Thursday reopening of high schools to 50% of their capacity until Monday. Some regions, including northern Veneto around Venice, have decided to delay the reopening until Jan. 31.
The number of daily cases has fallen from a high of around 40,000 in mid-November to well under 20,000 at present, but the infection rate has vacillated, with many hundreds dying each day.
The government decree also extended to Jan. 15 a ban already in place on movement between Italy's 20 regions, with travel permitted only for work, health or emergencies.
Italy, the first Western country to be hit by COVID-19, has reported nearly 76,000 deaths since February, the fifth highest world tally.

On Saturday, the Health Ministry pushed back the re-opening of the ski resorts to Jan. 18 from a previously planned Jan. 8, saying the closure was extended at the request of regional governors and on the advice of health experts.

Abu Bakar Bashir was jailed in 2011 for links to militant training camps in the Indonesian province of Aceh. He is considered the spiritual leader of the al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiah (JI) network, which was accused of orchestrating the bombings of nightclubs on the holiday island of Bali.
""Our embassy in Jakarta has made clear our concerns that such individuals be prevented from further inciting others to carry out future attacks against innocent civilians,"" Payne said in a statement. 
Bashir, 82, denied any involvement in the Bali bombings. A lawyer for Bashir did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his release, due on Friday.
The Bali bombings killed more than 200 people, among them scores of Australians. JI operatives were also accused of organising an attack on the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta that killed 12 people in 2003.
A senior JI operative was believed to have made bombs for both attacks.
Payne said Australia has told Indonesia to ensure he is no longer a danger to others. [L4N2JF2CG]

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state New South Wales on Tuesday called on residents in three cities to be tested for COVID-19 and isolate, as concerns grew that a Sydney cluster may have spread to regional areas after a visitor from the city tested positive. 
Concerns over the extent of the Sydney cluster saw authorities ban residents from several suburbs from attending a Jan. 7 Australia-India cricket test in Sydney, and again called for widespread testing for even the mildest of symptoms.
Sydney is battling a number of clusters, the most concerning in its western suburbs which has been linked to a liquor outlet frequented by possibly thousands of people over the Christmas period.
New South Wales (NSW) state, the epicentre of Australia's latest outbreak, on Tuesday said it had detected four new local cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, one in a man who travelled from Sydney to the outback town of Broken Hill.
""This is a reminder of what can occur for people who are moving out of Sydney. We said clearly in the past, if you have any symptoms, if you are concerned, you should limit your mobility,"" acting NSW Premier John Barilaro told reporters in Sydney.
Barilaro urged people in three regional NSW cities, which the infected man visited, to get a COVID-19 test and isolate while awaiting a test.
NSW on Monday reported zero new local infections, the first time the state reported no new infections since Dec 15.
NSW has recorded nearly 200 cases in the recent Sydney outbreaks, though infections have largely been confined to just a few suburbs.
The state has imposed new social distancing restrictions and mandated the wearing of masks in shopping centres and on public transport or face a A$200 ($154) fine.
NSW has been effectively isolated from the rest of Australia after other states and territories closed borders or imposed 14-day mandatory quarantine rules.
Australia shut its international borders in March to all non-citizens and permanent residents. Those allowed to enter must enter a 14-day hotel quarantine.
Australia has reported just over 28,500 coronavirus cases and 909 deaths.

The South American country faces pressure from the United States, the main destination for cocaine, to counter coca cultivation. The area covered by coca crops soared to 212,000 hectares in 2019, with a potential production output of 879 tonnes a year, according to the U.S. government.
""In 2020 we also seized more than 500 tonnes of cocaine hydrochloride, another objective we are keeping for 2021. The fight against drugs will continue to be a key focus and will continue to combine all the available tools,"" Duque said at the end of a security meeting in the Caribbean city of Cartagena. 
In 2019 Colombia's police and armed forces destroyed 100,000 hectares of coca and seized 428 tonnes of cocaine.
Duque is looking to restart aerial fumigation of coca crops with the herbicide glyphosate, which is quicker than manual eradication.

WASHINGTON/RIYADH (Reuters) -A breakthrough has been reached in Qatar's three-year-old dispute with Saudi Arabia and three other Arab countries and an agreement aimed at ending their rift is to be signed in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, a senior Trump administration official said.
The development is the latest in a series of Middle East deals sought by Washington - the others involving Israel and Arab states - aimed at building a united front against Iran. 
As part of the deal, Saudi Arabia will reopen its airspace and land and sea border to Qatar as of Monday, Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Ahmad Nasser al-Sabah said on Kuwait TV ahead of a Gulf Arab summit in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.
Saudi state agency SPA quoted Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as saying the annual gathering of Gulf leaders would unite Gulf ranks ""in the face of challenges facing the region"". 
Qatar's ruler, Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, will attend, the royal court said. The U.S. official said the Saudi crown prince and Qatari emir would sign the deal.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed a diplomatic, trade and travel embargo on Qatar since mid-2017 accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar denies it and says the embargo aims to undermine its sovereignty.
While Saudi Arabia made clear it intended to lift the blockade, the other three countries did not do so immediately, but the Trump official said ""it's our expectation"" they would also join in lifting the blockade. Under the emerging agreement, Qatar will suspend lawsuits related to the blockade, the official said.
All of the countries involved in the deals are U.S. allies. Qatar hosts the region’s largest U.S. military base, Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE host U.S. troops.
White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, assigned to work on the dispute by U.S. President Donald Trump, helped negotiate the deal and was working the phones on it until the wee hours of Monday morning, the official said.
When in December Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said a resolution to the dispute seemed within reach, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a Twitter post said he hoped Gulf reconciliation “contributes to stability and political and economic development for all peoples of our region.” 
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said in a Twitter post that Tuesday's summit would restore Gulf unity and that ""more work lies ahead and we are moving in the right direction"". [C6N2J405Y]
On Monday, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it welcomed the move by Saudi Arabia and called it an important step towards resolving the dispute.
“Our hope is that this dispute reaches a comprehensive and lasting resolution based on mutual respect for the countries’ sovereignty and that other sanctions against the people of Qatar are lifted as soon as possible,” it said, adding that Turkey supported all efforts to bring stability to the Gulf region.
Kushner, Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz and Brian Hook, a special State Department adviser, were flying to the Saudi Arabian city of al-Ula to attend the ceremony, the U.S. official said. 
If the deal holds, the Gulf dispute will be added to a string of diplomatic achievements of the Kushner team, a list that includes normalization deals last year between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.
Kushner, who is also Trump's son-in-law, has been working on more normalization deals between Israel and Arab countries but may run out of time with President-elect Joe Biden due to take over the presidency on Jan. 20.
""It's just a massive breakthrough,"" the U.S. official said. ""The blockade will be lifted. It will allow for travel amongst the countries as well as goods. It will lead to more stability in the region."" 
Diplomats in the region have said that Saudi Arabia was keen by pushing a deal to resolve the dispute to demonstrate to Biden that they are peacemakers and open to dialogue.

The United States has about 10,000 troops in Qatar, which is home to Al Udeid Air Base. There are thousands more troops in the UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

""Faustin-Archange Touadera, having received the absolute majority of the vote in the first round with 53.9%, is declared winner,"" Mathias Morouba, president of the electoral commission, told a news conference in the capital, Bangui.
The election was marred by a coordinated offensive by rebel groups who tried to disrupt the vote after former President Francois Bozize's candidacy was rejected by the country's highest court. 
Attacks and the destruction of voting materials, including on election day, prevented voting in several towns.

Morouba said about half of the country's electorate, or around 910,000 people, had registered to vote and turnout among the registered voters was 76.3%.

496,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",UK judge rejects extradition of 'suicide risk' Assange to United States,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - A British judge ruled on Monday that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should not be extradited to the United States to face criminal charges including breaking a spying law, saying his mental health problems meant he would be at risk of suicide. 
The United States said it would continue to seek the extradition of Australian-born Assange and U.S. prosecutors are set to appeal Monday's decision to London's High Court.
The U.S. authorities accuse the 49-year-old of 18 offences relating to the release by WikiLeaks of vast troves of confidential U.S. military records and diplomatic cables which they say put lives in danger.
Assange's lawyers will seek bail on Wednesday for their client, who has spent most of the last decade either in prison or self-imposed confinement. 
""We will continue to seek Mr. Assange's extradition,"" a U.S. Department of Justice statement said, adding that the United States had won on all the legal points, including arguments relating to freedom of speech and political motivation.
Assange's legal team had argued the entire prosecution was brought on by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, and that Assange's extradition would pose a severe threat to press freedom.
But it was only the real risk he would commit suicide if he were held in a U.S. maximum security jail that led Judge Vanessa Baraitser to reject the extradition request.
Assange, she said, suffered at times from severe depression and had been diagnosed with autism. Half a razor blade was found in his London prison cell in May 2019, and he had told medical staff of suicidal thoughts and made plans to end his life.
""I find that Mr Assange's risk of committing suicide, if an extradition order were to be made, to be substantial,"" Baraitser said in her ruling, delivered at London's Old Bailey court.
""The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man, who is genuinely fearful about his future.""
She said Assange had made regular calls from jail to the Samaritans charity.
Wearing a navy suit and a mask, Assange showed little emotion at the ruling. Outside court, his partner Stella Moris, with whom he had two children while seeking asylum in London's Ecuadorean Embassy, said the decision was a victory but the threat of extradition was still hanging over him.
""I call on the president of the United States to end this now: Mr President, tear down these prison walls, let our little boys have their father. Free Julian, free the press, free us all,"" she said.
U.S. prosecutors and Western security officials regard the WikiLeaks founder as a reckless and dangerous enemy of the state whose actions imperilled the lives of agents whose names were in the leaked material.
The U.S. authorities say more than 100 people were put at risk by the disclosures and about 50 had received assistance, with some fleeing their home countries with their spouses and families to move to the United States or another safe country. 
ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT HERO 
Supporters regard him as an anti-establishment hero who has been victimised because he exposed U.S. wrongdoing in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and say his prosecution is a politically motivated assault on journalism and free speech.
Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his country would now offer Assange political asylum.
""Assange is a journalist and deserves a chance, I am in favor of pardoning him,"" he said. ""We'll give him protection."" 
WikiLeaks came to prominence when it published a U.S. military video in 2010 showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NASDAQ:APA) helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. It then released thousands of secret classified files and diplomatic cables. 
The legal saga began soon afterwards when Sweden sought Assange's extradition from Britain over allegations of sex crimes. When he lost that case in 2012, he fled to the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he spent seven years.
When he was finally dragged out in April 2019, he was jailed for breaching British bail conditions although the Swedish case against him had been dropped. Last June, the U.S. Justice Department formally asked Britain to extradite him.
Baraitser rejected his lawyers' arguments that the case was political and an assault on journalism and freedom of speech, saying there was insufficient evidence that prosecutors had been pressured by Trump's team and little evidence of hostility from the U.S. president.
She said there was no evidence that Assange would not get a fair trial in the United States and that his actions had gone beyond investigative journalism.
But she said there was a real risk that, if found guilty, he would be held in the ADX Florence maximum security prison (SAM) in almost total isolation, and that he would find a way around their suicide prevention measures.

""I am satisfied that, if he is subjected to the extreme conditions of SAMs, Mr. Assange's mental health will deteriorate to the point where he will commit suicide,"" Baraitser said.

Caretaker Health Minister Hamad Hasan said the lockdown would start on Thursday and run until Feb. 1, with further details on Tuesday on which sectors would be exempt.
The lockdown will include a curfew from 6 pm to 5 am. 
""It has become clear that the pandemic challenge has reached a stage that is seriously threatening Lebanese lives as hospitals are not capable of providing beds,"" Hasan told reporters after a meeting of the ministerial committee on COVID-19. 
Lebanon registered 2,870 new infections on Sunday, bringing its total to 189,278 cases and 1,486 deaths since Feb. 21.
The new lockdown comes amid concerns over soaring unemployment, inflation and poverty. 
Lebanon is facing a devastating financial crisis that has crashed the currency, paralysed banks, and frozen savers out of their deposits. Medical supplies have dwindled as dollars have grown scarce.
Intensive care units had previously reached critical capacity over the summer as the virus spread after a massive explosion at the docks wrecked swathes of Beirut, killed 200 people and destroyed several hospitals. 
Adherence to social distancing and other preventive measures has been lax and there are now fears of a significant rise in cases after the Christmas and New Year holidays. 
""It is a big problem. In the next ten days it will be very difficult and we are expecting death rates to increase as infections rise,"" Mahmoud Hassoun, head of the critical care unit at Rafik Hariri hospital, told Reuters.
""We are nearly full now and we haven't even seen the effect of the holiday period yet.""

Greece tightened coronavirus curbs for a week from Sunday and reversed an earlier decision to allow Epiphany services after hospitals struggled to deal with a flood of new cases.
The Greek Orthodox Church said it had written to the government urging it to respect the agreement allowing Epiphany services to go ahead. 
""The Holy Synod... does not concur with government measures regarding the operation of churches and insists on what was initially agreed with the state - that churches will stay open for the participation of the faithful in the Mass of Epiphany,"" it said in a press release.
The letter marks a rare show of dissent by Church authorities, which until now have largely respected government restrictions curbing religious services along with other public activities during the pandemic.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Epiphany is one of the most important religious feasts and commemorates the baptism of Christ and the revelation of the Holy Trinity.
As well as church services, it is traditionally marked by popular celebrations including one in which swimmers retrieve a cross thrown into the water by a priest. The government had already banned such celebrations but had agreed to allow a limited number of worshippers to take part in church services. 
A government official said lockdown laws applied to everyone equally. ""We hope the Church will realize the urgency of the moment for society, as it has responsibly done so far,"" the official said.
While Greece has been more successful than many European countries in containing the spread of the coronavirus, its health services, badly weakened by years of financial crisis, have struggled to cope with thousands of new cases.

On Monday, health officials reported a total of 140,526 infections and 5,011 COVID-related deaths since the first coronavirus case was detected in February.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has resumed 20% uranium enrichment at an underground nuclear facility, the government said on Monday, breaching a 2015 nuclear pact with major powers and possibly complicating efforts by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal. 
Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of Iran's arch foe Israel, said the move was aimed at developing nuclear weapons and Israel would never allow Tehran to build them.
The enrichment decision, Iran's latest contravention of the accord, coincides with increasing tensions between Iran and the United States in the last days of President Donald Trump's administration.
Tehran started violating the accord in 2019 in a step-by-step response to Trump's withdrawal from it in 2018 and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions lifted under the deal.
The agreement's main aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it chose to, to at least a year from roughly two to three months. It also lifted international sanctions against Tehran.
""A few minutes ago, the process of producing 20% enriched uranium has started in Fordow enrichment complex,"" government spokesman Ali Rabiei told Iranian state media. 
The U.N. nuclear watchdog confirmed that Iran had started the process of enriching uranium to 20% purity at its Fordow site.
""Iran today began feeding uranium already enriched up to 4.1 percent U-235 into six centrifuge cascades at the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant for further enrichment up to 20%,"" the IAEA said in a statement on a report that was sent to member states. 
The step was one of many mentioned in a law passed by Iran's parliament last month in response to the killing of the country's top nuclear scientist, which Tehran has blamed on Israel. 
""Our measures are fully reversible upon FULL compliance by ALL (parties to the deal),"" tweeted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. 
Tehran insists it can quickly reverse its breaches if U.S. sanctions are removed. Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said the United States will rejoin the deal ""if Iran resumes strict compliance"" with the pact. 
NUCLEAR WATCHDOG
The Biden transition team declined comment on Iran's enrichment move. The White House National Security Council had no comment, and referred queries to the U.S. State Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tehran's move could further hinder efforts to salvage the pact as its breaches have increasingly worried some of the deal's other parties, which have urged Iran to act responsibly. 
In Brussels, a European Union Commission spokesperson said that the ""move, if confirmed, would constitute a considerable departure from Iran's commitments"".
On Jan 1, the IAEA said Tehran had told the watchdog it planned to resume enrichment up to 20% at the Fordow site, which is buried inside a mountain. 
""The process of gas injection to centrifuges has started a few hours ago and the first product of uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas will be available in a few hours,"" Rabiei said. 
Iran had earlier breached the deal's 3.67% limit on the purity to which it can enrich uranium, but it had only gone up to 4.5% so far, well short of the 20% level and of the 90% that is weapons-grade. 
U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Iran denies ever having had one.

In Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Iran's enrichment decision could be explained only as a bid to ""continue to carry out its intention to develop a military nuclear programme"". ""Israel will not allow Iran to produce nuclear weapons,"" he added

SANAA(Reuters) - Paralysed and severely malnourished, seven-year-old Faid Samim lies curled up on a hospital bed in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, having barely survived the journey there. 
""He was almost gone when he arrived but thank God we were able to do what was necessary and he started improving. He is suffering from CP (cerebral palsy) and severe malnutrition,"" said Rageh Mohammed, the supervising doctor of the Al-Sabeen hospital's malnutrition ward.
Faid weighs only 7 kg (just over 15 lb) and his tiny, fragile frame takes up barely a quarter of a folded hospital blanket. His family had to travel from Al-Jawf, 170 km (105 miles) north of Sanaa, through checkpoints and damaged roads, to get him there.
Unable to afford Faid's medication or treatment, the family relies on donations to get him treated. Mohammed says malnutrition cases are on the rise and impoverished parents are forced to rely on the kindness of strangers or international aid to get their children treated. 
Famine has never been officially declared in Yemen, where a six-year war has left 80% of the population reliant on aid in what the U.N. says is the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
U.N. warnings in late 2018 of impending famine prompted an aid ramp-up. But coronavirus restrictions, reduced remittances, locusts, floods and significant underfunding of the 2020 aid response are exacerbating hunger.
The war in Yemen, in which a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement since 2015, has killed more than 100,000 people and left the country divided, with the Houthis holding Sanaa and most major urban centres.

As north and sub-Saharan Africans grew desperate after losing incomes from tourism and other industries because of the COVID-19 pandemic, 23,023 migrants arrived in the archipelago last year, up from 2,687 in 2019, the ministry said.
Hundreds of people died last year making the perilous crossing to the Spanish islands in the Atlantic Ocean, often in overcrowded boats with unreliable engines, the International Organization for Migration said.
The migrants tend to see the Canary Islands as a staging post to get to mainland Europe, but the islands are still more than 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) from continental Spain. 
Overall, the number of illegal migrants intercepted by Spanish authorities across the country in 2020 rose by 29% to 41,861, as fewer people sailed to continental Spain and the Balearic Islands or crossed the land border between Morocco and the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla.

The license, which replaces a similar previous one, also allows for certain transactions with Venezuela's National Assembly and some others, effectively recognizing the extension of the opposition-controlled National Assembly's term by a year.
The term was extended after the mainstream opposition boycotted a parliamentary election on Dec. 6 handily won by President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialists that the opposition and most Western democracies said was neither free nor fair.
Venezuela’s Supreme Court last week ruled that the move by the opposition-controlled National Assembly to extend its term an additional year was invalid, paving the way for allies of Maduro to take over the body this month.
Washington in January 2019 recognized Venezuelan politician Guaido as the OPEC nation’s rightful leader and has ratcheted up sanctions and diplomatic pressure in the aftermath of Maduro’s 2018 re-election, widely described as fraudulent.
Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela’s military as well as Russia, China and Cuba.
The recognition of Guaido as interim president by the United States and others derives from his position as speaker of the National Assembly. Guaido invoked Venezuela's constitution to assume a rival interim presidency in 2019, declaring Maduro was usurping the presidency after rigging his 2018 re-election. 

The Treasury Department in the license said that transactions involving the Venezuelan National Constituent Assembly convened by Maduro or the National Assembly scheduled to be seated on Tuesday are not authorized.

In a decree published on Saturday, Erdogan appointed Melih Bulu, who has a doctorate in business management, as rector of Bogazici University in Istanbul.
The move led to protests by students and academics, and footage on social media showed hundreds of students carrying signs calling for Bulu's resignation. 
They chanted slogans including ""Melih Bulu is not our rector"" and ""We don't want a state-appointed rector."" 
Some students who were able to enter the campus sealed one of the university's buildings. Later footage showed students clashing and scuffling with security forces at the entrance to the campus. 
Istanbul police did not immediately comment.
Bulu, who Turkish media say applied to be a candidate for Erdogan's ruling AK Party in a 2015 parliamentary election, was the first rector chosen from outside a university since a military coup in Turkey in 1980, Bogazici faculty members said.
In a statement shared on social media, they said: ""We do not accept it as it clearly violates academic freedom and scientific autonomy as well as the democratic values of our university."" 
The appointment was ""yet another case of many ongoing anti-democratic practices since 2016,"" they said, referring to a large-scale crackdown since a failed coup five years ago. 
Speaking at a news conference after an AK Party meeting chaired by Erdogan, a spokesman for the party, Omer Celik, denied the appointment was a blow against academic freedom.
""Every academic, like every person, is entitled to their political opinion (...) We do not base appointments on the political affiliations of academics,"" he said.
Authorities have arrested thousands of academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants and members of the military as part of the crackdown.
Critics say Erdogan's government has used the coup attempt as a pretext to quash dissent. The government says the measures are necessary because of security threats facing Turkey.

DUBAI/SEOUL (Reuters) -Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps seized a South Korean-flagged tanker in Gulf waters and detained its crew, Iranian media said on Monday, amid tensions between Tehran and Seoul over Iranian funds frozen in South Korean banks due to U.S. sanctions.
Seoul confirmed the seizure of a South Korean chemical tanker by Iranian authorities in the waters off Oman, and demanded its immediate release.
Several Iranian media outlets, including state TV, said the Guards navy captured the vessel for polluting the Gulf with chemicals. 
""According to initial reports by local officials, it is purely a technical matter and the ship was taken to shore for polluting the sea,"" state television quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh as saying.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency published pictures showing the Guards' speed boats escorting the tanker HANKUK CHEMI, which it said was carrying 7,200 tonnes of ethanol.
It said the vessel's detained crew members included nationals of South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and Myanmar. Iran's state TV said the tanker was being held at Iran's Bandar Abbas port city. The ship had 20 crew members, according to South Korea's foreign ministry.
The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet is aware of the incident and is monitoring the situation, spokeswoman Rebecca Rebarich said in response to a Reuters query.
The incident comes ahead of an expected visit by South Korea's deputy foreign minister to Tehran. Khatibzadeh said the visit would happen in coming days, during which officials would discuss Iran's demand that South Korea release $7 billion in funds frozen in South Korean banks because of U.S. sanctions. 
NUCLEAR DEAL
The United States re-imposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 after Washington withdrew from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers. Under that deal, Iran had agreed to curb its nuclear work in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
Iran has retaliated by bypassing the restrictions of the deal step-by-step. In a move that could complicate efforts by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to rejoin the deal, Tehran said on Monday it had resumed 20% uranium enrichment at its underground Fordow nuclear facility.
British firm Ambrey said the South Korean-flagged vessel, owned by DM Shipping Co, had departed from the Petroleum Chemical Quay in Jubail, in Saudi Arabia, before the incident.
Another maritime security firm, Dryad Global, said on its website the chemical tanker had ""likely been detained by Iranian forces"" in the Strait of Hormuz while inbound to Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.

In early 2019, Iran jacked up tensions in the world's busiest oil waterway by seizing British-flagged tanker Stena Impero, two weeks after a British warship had intercepted an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian police said on Monday they were investigating documents and audio recordings dating back to 2012 about plans to murder a Belarusian journalist who was subsequently killed by a car bomb in Kyiv in 2016.
The police released a statement on the case on the same day as online newspaper EUobserver published a recording of what it said was the Belarusian KGB security service in 2012 discussing plans to kill investigative journalist Pavel Sheremet. 
The Ukrainian police gave few details of the audio recordings it is looking into and did not identify any suspects.
If the veracity of the recording published by EUobserver is confirmed, it would increase suspicions that Belarus's KGB was involved in killing Sheremet, a critic of the Belarusian leadership under President Alexander Lukashenko. 
The Belarusian KGB did not reply to a request for comment. 
In the recording, which EUobserver said it obtained through a Belarusian opposition activist, plans are discussed to kill enemies of Lukashenko's rule with poison or explosives.
The Ukrainian police said they obtained their own material through the country's foreign intelligence service. 
Fragments of the information they obtained ""have been published on the internet. Unidentified persons are discussing the murder of journalist Pavel Sheremet,"" the police statement said.
Lukashenko has cracked down on protests since a disputed election in August which his opponents say was rigged. Lukashenko has denied electoral fraud. 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy made investigating the killing a priority when he came to power two years ago. 
Three Ukrainian suspects are on trial in Ukraine in connection with the killing but the authorities have not established who ordered the murder. The suspects deny wrongdoing. 
Sheremet was given Russian citizenship after fleeing alleged persecution in Belarus but relocated permanently to Ukraine in 2014 after no longer feeling safe in Moscow.

Sheremet worked for the online news website Ukrayinska Pravda whose founder, Georgiy Gongadze, was also murdered in 2000. Gongadze's decapitated body was discovered in a forest outside Kyiv.

A Russian Mi-24 helicopter was shot down over Armenia near the border with a region belonging to Azerbaijan, killing two crew members and injuring another, just few hours before a Moscow-brokered peace deal over Nagorno-Karabakh was reached.
Heavy fighting between Azerbaijan, which has the political backing of Turkey, and ethnic Armenian forces over the mountainous region had been raging for six weeks at the time of the incident.
Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said Azeri forces shot down the helicopter by accident, expressing apologies to Moscow and a readiness to pay compensation.
Interfax said on Monday, citing the source, that a case had initially been opened into a potential infringement of flying regulations that had resulted in deaths through negligence.
The reported switch to a murder charge, which could lead to a sentence of life imprisonment for those held responsible, may complicate relations between Moscow and Azerbaijan.
The conflict has tested Moscow's influence in the South Caucasus, a swath of the former Soviet Union it views as vital to defending its own southern flank.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government on Monday refused to roll back farm reform laws, prompting farmers to threaten to step up their weeks-long protests, but the two sides agreed to meet again on Friday.
Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping out on roads around the capital, New Delhi, for 40 days, insisting that the government withdraw the reforms and guarantee a minimum support price for their produce.
""I am hopeful the stalemate will be resolved very soon,"" Agricultural Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters after the seventh round of meetings between the ministers and 40 farming unions.
""For resolution, the cooperation of both sides is essential.""
Farmers leaders, however, said they would not give up their fight unless the government agrees to repeal the laws, approved by parliament in September.
""Our agitation will continue till the three laws are withdrawn. There is no other way,"" said Rakesh Tikait, one of the farmers' leaders who attended the meeting with ministers. 
Reliance Industries asked authorities to help stop attacks on its telecommunication masts by protesting farmers, who say the conglomerate has profited from the reforms at their expense.
.
The majority of India's farmers sell their produce largely to small retailers at a much lower price than the government guaranteed price - offered to only a fraction of farmers.

They fear that with the introduction of the new laws, big retailers like Reliance will enter the market to buy their produce at a lower price, while the government may slowly dismantle the current system of procurement at the guaranteed price.

The closures are a fresh headache for migrants already coping with reductions to the southern routes of a Mexican cargo train known as ""La Bestia"" (The Beast) that has long helped them get north.
Fewer shelters mean fewer safe places for Central Americans to take cover, even as many walk hundreds more miles than before, over a dozen migrants told Reuters.
When the main shelter in the northern city of Saltillo, a busy staging post on the road to Texas, shut before Christmas due to a COVID-19 outbreak that killed its founder, dozens of migrants were left to camp on the sidewalk outside. 
Alarmed by the prospect of gangsters who often prey on migrants in the city, an important transit point for violent drug gangs, they organized their own night patrol.
""At night, suspicious cars park nearby or circle the area with two or three men inside,"" said Honduran migrant Michael Castaneda, 27, who helped organize the sentry. ""We know the gangs are watching us, and they know we're watching them.""
A network of privately funded shelters provides food, legal and medical aid to tens of thousands of migrants traversing Mexico each year. Run by non-governmental agencies or religious organizations, they are subject to government rules, including health laws that have forced some to close in the pandemic.
Castaneda wants to reach the United States to work and send money back to his parents and three younger siblings to rebuild their family home, which was hammered by two devastating hurricanes that hit Central America in November.
But his journey across Mexico has been slow, he said, after he injured his leg en route and could not access medical care or rest properly because of shuttered shelters.
Estimates vary over how many refuges there are, but a 2020 study by bank BBVA (MC:BBVA) Bancomer identified 96 shelters, rest houses and canteens for migrants on Mexico's main migration routes.
The mounting risks Castaneda and other migrants face could complicate Mexican-U.S. efforts to improve their lot under the incoming U.S. president, Joe Biden, who has pledged to pursue more humane policies than the incumbent, Donald Trump.
Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20 and the two hurricanes have already encouraged some Central Americans to head north. Social media chats used by migrants say a major migrant caravan is organizing to depart Honduras on Jan. 15.
The number of Hondurans, Guatemalans and Salvadorans caught trying to cross the U.S. border rose more than three-fold between July and November, U.S. official data show.
EXHAUSTION
In the southern town of Tenosique, a gathering point for migrants entering Mexico from Guatemala, an influential shelter known as ""The 72"" had to close its doors to new arrivals after a coronavirus outbreak there at the end of November.
""It's a shame not to allow people into the shelter because that's what we're here for, especially in such a difficult moment,"" said director Fray Gabriel Romero.
Before he began turning migrants away, Romero said he had been taking in Central Americans who had lost their homes and livelihoods to Hurricanes Eta and Iota in November. Even now, dozens of migrants continue arriving every day, he says.
In Saltillo, concerned residents shared hot plates of tamales with migrants on Christmas Eve, and the city has improvised to cope with the loss of shelter accommodation.
Longtime resident Glenda Troches, a Honduran, has opened her modest wooden home to migrants, well aware of the dangers they face, having once been kidnapped by a gang herself.
Troches is offering refuge to compatriots like Sara Servellon, a 32-year-old who left Honduras for the United States with her husband just as Eta was closing in.
By then, gang violence, a lack of work and the pandemic had convinced them they had no future in Honduras, Servellon said.
Still, she was so tired from the trek across southern Mexico that upon trying to climb aboard the ""La Bestia"" en route to Saltillo, she fell face first and passed out, she recalled.
""I was so weak,"" she said.
They pressed on quickly though.
Before reaching Troches' makeshift migrant refuge, Servellon said she had not slept safely in a shelter since the southern town of Palenque, more than 1,000 miles away.

""We'd walked across practically all of Mexico,"" she said, ""and we hadn't eaten all day or night.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will release radical cleric and alleged mastermind of the 2002 Bali bombings Abu Bakar Bashir from prison later this week, its government said on Monday, upon completion of his jail term. 
Bashir, 82, who was among Indonesia's most notorious extremists, is considered the spiritual leader of the al Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiah (JI) network. He was jailed in 2011 for his links to militant training camps in Aceh province.
Bashir will be released on Friday ""in accordance with the expiration date and the end of his term,"" Rika Aprianti, spokeswoman of the corrections directorate general at the law and human rights ministry, said in a statement.
Jemaah Islamiah is accused of plotting several big attacks in Indonesia and includes operatives trained in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the southern Philippines.
Its members are accused of orchestrating the 2002 bombings of Bali nightclubs, which killed more than 200 people, among them scores of Australians, and an attack on the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta that killed 12 people a year later.
A senior JI operative believed to have made bombs for both attacks, Zulkarnaen, was among 23 suspected militants arrested last month. 
Bashir denied any involvement in the Bali bombings. A lawyer for Bashir did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on his upcoming release.
Security analyst Ridlwan Habib said that though Bashir's stature has weakened, extremists may try to associate their activities with him to gain traction and boost their credibility. 
""Bashir is a senior figure in Indonesia's jihadist movement, and it's not impossible that his big name could be used,"" he said 

While seeking reelection, President Joko Widodo in January 2019 had considered an early release for Bashir on health grounds, but scrapped the plan after Bashir reportedly declined to pledge allegiance to the Indonesian state ideology.

The decision came after Austria's opposition parties blocked a draft law that would have allowed an early exit from lockdown for anyone producing a negative test for the coronavirus, APA cited Health Minister Rudolf Anschober as saying.
It was not immediately clear whether schools are also to remain closed until Jan. 24 or if they can open as originally planned on Jan. 18, APA reported. 
The draft law would have allowed those with a negative coronavirus test to attend cultural or sport events, buy non-essential goods and get their hair cut, a week before the official end of the lockdown on Jan. 24.

The military detail broke no laws when they administered the COVID-19 vaccines to themselves, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said, even though the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to approve any coronavirus vaccines. 
""The president is saluting the PSG for what they did. They risked their lives to protect our president,"" he told a media briefing, referring to the Presidential Security Group. 
""We thank you for your loyalty and courage,"" he said, quoting Duterte's remarks. 
Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana last week called the PSG's move ""justified"" even as he said the vaccines they gave themselves as far back as September, without his knowledge, had been smuggled into the Philippines.
The FDA has said any importation, distribution and sale of a COVID-19 vaccine is at present illegal and warned of potential dangers from using vaccines it has not approved. 
It has said it was working with the Bureau of Customs to determine how the vaccines were brought into the country.
Some senators are demanding answers and want the head of Duterte's guard to appear before an inquiry on the government's vaccination plan set for next week.
Senator Richard Gordon has said PSG chief Brigadier General Jesus Durante should consider resigning for violating the law.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan government representatives and Taliban officials are due to resume peace talks in Qatar after a three-week break, officials said on Monday, although battlefield clashes and targeted killings risk undermining efforts to end the war.
The negotiations, due to get going again on Tuesday, are expected to cover contentious issues such as power-sharing and a ceasefire after the two sides reached an initial agreement on procedural rules in December. 
The talks began in Qatar in September months after the Taliban reached an agreement with the United States allowing it to pull its troops out of Afghanistan and end its longest war in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.
The Taliban have refused to recognise the U.S.-backed government and that was an issue that would have to be tackled, said a member of the team representing the government.
""An interim government is an undeniable topic of discussion, because we want a ceasefire and the Taliban aren't ready to agree to one with the current government,"" the delegate, Hafiz Mansoor, told Reuters in Kabul before setting off for Qatar.
A Taliban spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
Under the terms of the agreement the United States struck with the Taliban, the formation of a ""new post-settlement Afghan Islamic government"" would be determined through negotiations between the two Afghan sides.
President Ashraf Ghani's government was elected in 2019 for a five-year term but the Taliban rejected the election.
But relentless violence is over-shadowing the bid to find peace.
Government officials have in recent weeks accused the Taliban of a string of high-profile murders, including of bureaucrats and journalists, and bomb attacks.
The Taliban have rejected some of the accusations but at the same time, they have made gains against government forces in fighting in various parts of the country.
The level of violence has prompted occasional intervention by Western forces.
On Monday, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said U.S. forces had conducted air strikes against insurgents, terming it a violation of the agreement between the two sides.
A spokesman for U.S. forces, Colonel Sonny Leggett, said the strikes were defensive and not a violation of the agreement, and he called for a reduction in violence.
European officials have also urged both sides to reduce hostilities and move quickly towards a settlement.
The United States has been scaling back its presence in Afghanistan nearly 20 years after it intervened with its allies to overthrow the Taliban in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on U.S. cities.

Afghan security officials expect the size of the U.S. force to dwindle to about 2,500 troops early this year.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia has started reopening schools and museums as it relaxes a six-week lockdown following a coronavirus outbreak late last year, marking a contrast with some neighbouring countries that are facing new restrictions due to rising COVID-19 cases. 
The Southeast Asian country of just over 16 million people, one of the least impacted by the novel coronavirus with just 382 infections and no deaths since the beginning of the pandemic, saw a rare cluster of cases in November.
On Monday, students wearing masks lined up for temperature checks and hand washing before being allowed to enter the Sovannaphumi primary school in the capital Phnom Penh.
While private schools have started reopening this week, students at public schools are due to return next week.
At the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a former Khmer Rouge torture centre and prison in the capital, staff and ""tuk tuk"" motorcyle taxi drivers awaited the arrival of visitors.
""I am worried that we can get infected, but I see that we Cambodians are following the instructions set by the government on wearing masks, washing hands with alcohol or soap and social distancing,"" said Theun Ngor, a 43 year-old tuk-tuk driver. 
In November, Cambodia put in a place of range of restrictions after a rare outbreak of community transmission linked to a 56-year-old woman who had travelled to the country’s two biggest cities since Nov. 20. 
As Cambodia loosens curbs, authorities in neighbouring Thailand warned on Monday that the country could face a strict lockdown as infection numbers climbed and spurring it to declare 28 provinces high-risk zones.
While welcoming the prospect of more business, a coffee vendor near the Tuol Sleng museum was concerned after hearing that some Cambodians working in Thailand had been infected.

""I am so worried that they could spread it here again,"" said Ngeth Sokuntheary, 27, as she prepared iced coffee.

Israel has been in talks with Washington on how to preserve its military advantage after the Trump administration approved a possible F-35 sale to the United Arab Emirates last year. The plane was previously available only to Israel in the region.
""Without doubt, we need to expand the F-35 array. Right now we have two squadrons. I reckon we will expand that. That is what I requested of the Americans,"" Defence Minister Benny Gantz told Ynet TV. 
""I would buy another F-35 squadron and then examine what to do with the balance - continuing to expand the F-35 (procurement), going for F-15s?""
Gantz did not specify the number of F-35s in the proposed new squadron. Defence officials have said the two squadrons already ordered by Israel consist of 50 planes. 
Gantz's coalition government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu fell apart last month, triggering a March 23 ballot. Both men remain in their posts until a new government is formed after the ballot. 
Asked if Israel might complete a defence procurement deal with the United States before Trump steps down, he said: ""I hope so. I think the defence budget needs to be handled properly, to be safeguarded. It is a kind of active insurance policy.""

The F-35 is made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and the F-15 by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co.

Kenosha saw civil unrest and large demonstrations against racism and police brutality in August after police shot Blake, an African-American man, who was left paralyzed from the waist down.
The decision is likely to come within the first two weeks of January, Mayor John Antaramian and Police Chief Daniel Miskinis said in a statement.

Blake was shot several times in the back and the incident, which was caught on video, sparked days of protests.  Two protesters were fatally shot during the unrest, with teenager Kyle Rittenhouse of Antioch, Illinois, being charged in connection with the shootings. Blake's shooting came about three months after the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

In August 2019, the naked body of Nora Anne Quoirin, 15, who suffered from learning difficulties, was found in a ravine near the Dusun holiday resort where her family was staying in Seremban, about 70 km (44 miles) south of the Malaysian capital.
On Monday, the Seremban Coroner's Court closed the inquiry, saying there was insufficient evidence to indicate foul play. 
Police had earlier ruled that out, but her family questioned the findings and said she had never before left them voluntarily.
Malaysia opened an inquest into the death in August at the family's request, with proceedings streamed online due to coronavirus restrictions. 
The court on Monday ruled that there was no one involved in Quoirin's death and it was more likely she had simply got lost in the jungle. 
""It was more probable than not that she had died of misadventure..."" coroner Maimoonah Aid told the court. 
""For me to speculate and presume of her actions and involvement of a third party without any proof, that would be a breach of my duty so the inquiry is hereby closed."" 
A lawyer for the family did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Her parents, Sebastien and Meabh Quoirin, appeared solemn on the court proceedings live-stream as the decision was read. 
Her mother Meabh, one of nearly 50 witnesses who testified at the inquest, had said she believed her daughter could have been abducted and accused authorities of not taking her concerns seriously.
Police, however, said there was no evidence that Quoirin was kidnapped and insisted their probe was thorough.
An autopsy had established that Quoirin had died from internal bleeding, probably caused by prolonged hunger and stress.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's most populous state New South Wales (NSW) on Monday reported zero local coronavirus cases for the first time in nearly three weeks, as Sydney battled multiple outbreaks and authorities urged tens of thousands of people to get tested.
NSW daily testing numbers have dropped to around 20,000 in the last two days from a peak of about 70,000 recorded on Christmas Day, Dec. 25. The overwhelming majority of tests are in the state capital Sydney.
""The numbers are far too low... if we're going to succeed in staying ahead of the COVID pandemic, testing is crucial in large numbers so we can be confident of the data when we're making decisions,"" NSW Acting Premier John Barilaro told reporters.
Authorities have imposed mandatory masks in indoor spaces and on public transport from Monday for Sydney's five million residents or face a spot fine of A$200 ($154). 
NSW officials had rejected calls for mandatory face masks since the pandemic started and the change of policy follows the latest Sydney outbreak, which seems to be highly infectious, and ahead of a cricket test match between Australia and India in the city scheduled to start Jan. 7.
The Australian Cricket Board on Monday further reduced the crowd capacity for the test to 25%, around 10,000 spectators, from 50%, amid criticism from health officials the event would become a virus superspreader.
Australia and India are in the middle of a four-test series, being played in the backdrop of strict health measures, with both sides to travel to Sydney for the third test from Thursday.
Two cases linked to Sydney's fresh cluster centred around a liquor store were recorded after the daily deadline of 2000 local time. These will be added to Tuesday's tally.
Low single-digit cases from a cluster in northern seaside suburbs in recent days suggest a strict lockdown there since mid-December may have effectively eliminated the virus, but a KPMG report said the lockdown cost NSW economy A$3.20 billion ($2.46 billion) in December.
NSW and Sydney, Australia's largest city, have been isolated from the rest of Australia by state border closures or 14 day mandatory quarantine rules for interstate arrivals from NSW. 
Neighbouring Victoria state, which is also battling new cases in state capital Melbourne, on Monday reported three local cases bringing the active cases in the state to 36. 
Australia has largely avoided the high number of cases and deaths from the new coronavirus compared with other developed countries but the latest COVID-19 clusters in Sydney have sparked fears of a wider outbreak.
It has reported just under 28,500 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)

SINGHU, India (Reuters) - In a standoff between farmers from India's northern breadbasket and the government that has convulsed the country, the farmers have a 21st-century ally: a handful of supporters scattered around the world running a Twitter handle.
The farmers have paralysed some traffic in and out of New Delhi, protesting recent agriculture laws that they fear could eventually eliminate government-guaranteed minimum prices for their crops.
But the demonstrators, many of them from the Sikh religious minority, say they are also battling a social media campaign by the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The BJP brands some of the protesters as separatists from the giant multi-ethnic nation, a charge the demonstrators call disinformation.
Bhavjit Singh became energised for the battle in November from his bedroom in Ludhiana in the agricultural heartland state of Punjab, where he watched with dismay the online attacks on the farmers.
With a few friends, the information technology professional launched the @Tractor2twitr Twitter account in late November. The following month he journeyed to the focal protest site on a main highway connecting Haryana state and Delhi, the territory that includes the capital.
Thousands there have jammed the road for kilometres with tractors, trailers and tents, sleeping in makeshift hovels and cooking in ramshackle kitchens.
Singh, 38, joined the protesters with two smartphones.
""We will intensify our campaign because we are getting organised and getting more support now,"" Singh told Reuters, speaking near the noisy protest site where open kitchens dished out midmorning snacks. ""Our war of perception, the war of messaging is going in the right direction.""
The account, with more than 23,000 followers, promotes its message by pushing one hashtag a day. One day recently, #FarmersDyingModiEnjoying, pushed by @Tractor2twitr, was among the top hashtags on Indian Twitter - battling #ModiWithFarmers.
Thirteen thousand kilometres (8,000 miles) away in Houston, Texas, Baljinder Singh is part of the core group that helps run the account.
The BJP ""were targeting us, so we felt we had to answer them back,"" the owner of a couple of 7-Eleven stores in the United States told Reuters. ""We are all the sons and daughters of farmers.""
Baljinder and Bhavjit Singh, who share a common Sikh family name, are not related.
@Tractor2twitr has been joined in recent weeks by a union group called the Farmers Unity Front (Kisan Ekta Morcha), setting up accounts on Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube, WhatsApp and Snapchat, staffed by 50 volunteers, that have surged to hundreds of thousands of followers.
'MANIPULATED MEDIA'
The farmers demand Modi repeal the three farm laws, enacted in September, which they say could make them vulnerable to retail giants like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and India's Reliance Industries.
The government says the laws, which let growers bypass government-regulated wholesale markets and sell directly to buyers, are a reform that gives farmers more options. It has sought to assure the farmers that the guaranteed-pricing system will not be dismantled.
As the farmers were trooping toward Delhi late in 2020, a wave of misinformation began spreading online, said Rajneil Kamath, publisher of fact-checking website Newschecker.
Old, unrelated images and videos - including some from demonstrations outside India calling for an independent Sikh homeland - were passed off as representing the farmers, Kamath said.
In December, Twitter flagged a tweet by the head of the BJP's vast social media team, Amit Malviya, as ""manipulated media,"" saying a video he posted showing an elderly protestor narrowly avoiding a police beating had been misleadingly edited.
BJP spokesman Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga says the party has been legitimately highlighting that people other than farmers, including Sikh separatists, had potentially infiltrated the protests.
""We believe some people are trying to hijack the movement,"" Bagga said.
At the protest site, Ammy Gill, a 25-year-old lyricist from Punjab, divides his time helping out at community kitchens and chronicling the protests on social media.
""The objective of our social media messages is to counter the trolls and the campaign against farmers,"" Gill said.
""We are not here for a picnic.""

BAGHDAD (Reuters) -Tens of thousands of supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups chanted anti-American slogans in central Baghdad on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia commander.
The gathering coincided with increasing tensions between Iran and the United States in the last days of President Donald Trump's administration, and many in the crowd demanded revenge.
Soleimani, head of an elite overseas unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, was killed along with Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis on Jan. 3, 2020, in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport. 
Washington had accused Soleimani of masterminding attacks by Iranian-aligned militias on U.S. forces in the region, and his killing took U.S.-Iranian hostilities into uncharted waters and stoked concern about a major conflagration.
Demonstrators gathered on Sunday in central Tahrir square in response to calls by an array of militia groups known collectively as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), which are mostly backed by Iran. 
They waved the Iraqi and PMF flags and chanted anti-American slogans such as ""America is the Great Satan"", while carrying the portraits of Soleimani and Muhandis.
Big posters of the two men along with others killed in the attack were everywhere around the square and hung on adjacent buildings.
PMF head Faleh al-Fayyad and politician Hadi al-Ameri, commander of the Badr Organization militia, who were both at the rally addressing the crowds, called for the expulsion of U.S. troops.
The leader of the Tehran-backed Lebanese organization Hezbollah said in a televised speech later on Sunday that Soleimani's killing caused serious repercussions in the region.
""Removing America from the region ... would not have been a serious and a declared goal that the people in region must work towards (achieving) if it weren't for this historical incident,"" Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said, adding that Iran is strong and capable of responding militarily.
REGIONAL STRAINS
""We are here today to condemn what the American-Israeli enemy had done by targeting the leaders of victory,"" protester Abu Ahmed said in Baghdad. 
""We call on the government to take a serious stance to hold those who killed them accountable.""
Reflecting continuing regional strains, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday urged Trump not to be ""trapped"" by an alleged Israeli plan to provoke a war through attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq.
An Israeli official dismissed the accusation as ""nonsense"" and said it was Israel that needed to be on alert for possible Iranian strikes.
While no attacks occurred against U.S. forces or diplomats on Jan. 3 in Iraq, American officials say they remained concerned about advanced planning for potential attacks.
On Sunday, Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Chris Miller said he was reversing his decision to send the aircraft carrier Nimitz back to it's homeport.
""Due to the recent threats issued by Iranian leaders against President Trump and other U.S. government officials, I have ordered the USS Nimitz to halt its routine redeployment,"" Miller said.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the carrier was expected to stay outside the Arabian Sea.
The official said the Pentagon's move appeared to be more precautionary than a response to specific new intellegence.
The United States blames Iran-backed militias for regular rocket attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility.
The U.S. military flew two nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to the Middle East in a message of deterrence to Iran last week, but the bombers have since left the region.

On Saturday evening thousands of mourners gathered on the highway that leads to Baghdad airport in a simulated funeral procession in tribute to Soleimani and Muhandis.

COVID-19 cases in Britain are at record levels and the increase in numbers is fuelled by a new and more transmissible variant of the virus.
Britain recorded 54,990 new cases of the virus on Sunday and has registered more than 75,000 deaths from the pandemic.

Japan saw a record 4,520 new cases on Dec. 31 in a fresh wave of infections, prompting the capital and neighbouring prefectures to call on the national government to announce an emergency declaration.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has so far resisted those calls, mindful of the potential damage to the economy. He is set to hold a news conference to mark the start of 2021 at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT). 
As an interim measure, restaurants and karaoke parlours in the Tokyo area are being asked to close at 8 p.m., while businesses that serve alcohol should close at 7 p.m.
If declared, it would be the second time parts of Japan have entered a state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic. The first lasted for more than a month last spring, when schools and non-essential businesses were asked to close.
Japan has relied on voluntary closures and travel restrictions rather than the sort of rigid lockdown measures seen elsewhere in the world.
Although the case numbers in Japan pale in comparison to many parts of Europe and the Americas, Suga has the challenge of hosting the Olympics in Tokyo this summer after the pandemic caused the Games' first-ever delay in 2020.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2021 06:56PM ET</span>","As end to pandemic mask-wearing nears, South Koreans scramble to arrange cosmetic surgery","By Joori Roh
SEOUL (Reuters) - When Ryu Han-na, a 20-year-old university student, got cosmetic surgery on her nose in mid-December, she had a simple reason: it might be the last chance to do so covertly before people start taking off masks this year as vaccines are distributed.
Ryu, who has been attending her courses online throughout 2020, said the ability to recuperate at home and wear a mask in public without drawing attention were deciding factors.
""I always wanted to get a nose job ... I thought it would be the best to get it now before people start taking off masks when vaccines become available in 2021,"" she said as she prepared for the 4.4 million won ($4,013) procedure.
""There will be bruises and swelling from the surgery but since we'll all be wearing masks I think that should help,"" she added.
That attitude is fuelling demand for such operations in South Korea, which had already experienced a pickup in cosmetic surgery in 2020.
The country has been a world capital of cosmetic surgery even during non-pandemic times. The industry is estimated to be worth about $10.7 billion in 2020, up 9.2% year-on-year, and is expected to hover around $11.8 billion this year, according to Gangnam Unni, the country's largest online cosmetic surgery platform.
Cosmetic surgeons say patients are interested in all parts of the face: those that can be easily hidden under masks, such as the nose and lips, as well as those that face coverings don't conceal, which some consider the criteria of beauty in the coronavirus era.
""Both surgical and non-surgical inquiries about eyes, eyebrows, nose bridge and foreheads - the only visible parts - certainly increased,"" said Park Cheol-woo, a surgeon at WooAhIn Plastic Surgery Clinic, who was in charge of Ryu's operation.
Surgeon Shin Sang-ho, who operates Krismas Plastic Surgery Clinic in the centre of Gangnam district, said many people have spent their emergency stimulus payment from the government at hospitals and clinics, boosting revenue in the third and fourth quarter of 2020. 
""I felt like it's sort of a revenge spending. I've sensed that customers were expressing their pent-up emotions (from the coronavirus) by getting cosmetic procedures,"" Shin said.
Government data showed that of 14.2 trillion won ($12.95 billion) government cash handouts, 10.6% was used in hospitals and pharmacies, the third-largest segment by classification behind supermarkets and restaurants, though the details of hospital types were not disclosed.
Gangnam Unni data showed its users surged 63% from a year earlier to about 2.6 million last year. They requested 1 million counselling sessions, double the amount from a year earlier.
The pandemic made it harder to promote services to foreign clients, so in the last year it embraced a more local and regional focus.
But a third wave of coronavirus at home remains a concern as the country reports record-breaking daily cases.
""We've seen growing numbers of cancellations in consultation appointments recently as people refrain more from going outside ... especially customers from the suburbs mostly postponed their surgeries to 2021,"" Park said.

527,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2021 06:50PM ET</span>",At least nine Syrian soldiers killed in militant attack in Badia,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - At least nine Syrian army soldiers were killed on Sunday in an ambush on their bus on a main highway in the central Syrian desert in the second such incident in less than a week by suspected Islamic State militants, residents and defectors said.
Syrian state media earlier said six people, without identifying them as soldiers, were killed near Wadi al Azeeb in the western part of the Syrian desert known as the Badia, east of the city of Hama, when their bus was targeted while on the road.
Russian jets flying from a major air base in the area at high altitudes bombed its vicinity in the surprise attack that left at least twenty two soldiers injured, several seriously, according to two military defectors in touch with their coordinates on the ground.
State media said last Wednesday twenty-eight people were killed in a similar ""terrorist"" attack on a bus along a main highway in Deir al-Zor province that borders Iraq. 
Pro-Syrian army supporters later published on social media burning army vehicles in what residents and defectors said was an ambush on buses transporting soldiers returning to their barracks after leave. [L1N2JA1FW]
Military defectors gave a higher toll that exceeded thirty dead saying they were recruits from the Syrian army's elite Fourth Brigade, which has a strong presence in the rich oil-producing province since Islamic State fighters were ousted at the end of 2017.
Islamic State's Amaq news agency a day later claimed responsibility for the ambush, saying it had killed 40 Syrian army soldiers and badly wounded six others. L4N2JB1YY
Western intelligence sources say there has been a rise in recent months of ambushes and hit-and-run attacks by remnants of Islamic State militants who take shelter in caves in the mainly rugged sparsely Syrian Badia.
They also say in the last few months, Arab Sunni tribes who inhabit the area have been angered by executions by Iranian Shiite militias operating in the area of dozens of Arab nomads suspected of affiliation to Islamic State militants.

NIAMEY (Reuters) -One hundred people were killed on Saturday in attacks on two villages in western Niger, Prime Minister Brigi Rafini said following one of the deadliest days in recent memory for a country ravaged by Islamist violence. 
Rafini announced the death toll in remarks broadcast on national television on Sunday from a visit to the zone, near the border with Mali. He did not say who was responsible.
Security sources said on Saturday that at least 70 civilians had been killed in simultaneous raids by suspected Islamist militants on the villages of Tchombangou and Zaroumdareye. 
Niger has suffered repeated attacks by militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State near its borders with Mali and Burkina Faso. The violence is part of a wider security crisis in West Africa's Sahel region that has unnerved Western allies like France, who have poured troops and resources into the region. 
Niger has also seen tit-for-tat killings between rival ethnic communities that have been stoked by the jihadist violence and competition for scarce resources. 
Saturday's attacks came on the same day that the electoral commission announced the results from the first round of the election to replace President Mahamadou Issoufou, who is stepping down after a decade in power.
Ruling party candidate Mohamed Bazoum, who finished in first, expressed his condolences on Sunday to the victims. 
The attacks, he said in a video he posted on social media, ""remind us that terrorist groups constitute a grave threat to cohesion within communities unlike any other"". 
Bazoum will face former President Mahamane Ousmane in a second round run-off expected on Feb. 21.

Federal, state and local law enforcement officers have been trying to figure out why the 63-year-old suspect, Anthony Q. Warner, who died by suicide in the explosion, detonated the bomb while inside his motor home on Dec. 25 in downtown Nashville, Tennessee's largest city.
News Channel 5 Nashville reported on Saturday that a man who knew Warner received a package on New Year's Day, postmarked two days before the blast, containing at least nine typed pages and two thumb drives. The man turned it over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
While the package did not have a return address, the contents of the letter referenced various conspiracy theories, including that aliens have launched attacks on earth, which indicated it was likely from Warner, News Channel 5 said.
Warner's writings also indicate he believed reptilians and lizard people controlled the earth and had altered human DNA.
""We're aware the suspect sent materials which espoused his viewpoints to several acquaintances throughout the country,"" FBI Special Agent Jason Pack said in a statement, calling on anyone who had received such packages to contact the FBI.
The bombing took place in the early morning when there was little activity in the city, and an automated message emanating from the vehicle warning of a bomb allowed the police to evacuate people. More than 40 businesses were damaged in the explosion. Warner is the only known death.

In addition to the warning, the audio on Warner's recreational vehicle played a recording of Petula Clark's 1964 hit ""Downtown"" before the blast.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Rebel fighters in Central African Republic attacked and partially occupied a diamond-mining town on Sunday, four security and humanitarian sources said, a day before authorities are due to declare results of the presidential election. 
At least five rebels were killed and two army soldiers wounded in the clashes in Bangassou, which lies on the southern border with Democratic Republic of Congo, the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSCA said in a statement. 
Rebels, whom the government and United Nations say are backed by ex-president Francois Bozize, launched an offensive last month after the constitutional court rejected Bozize's candidacy to challenge President Faustin-Archange Touadera in last Sunday's vote.
Bozize's party officially denies he is working with the rebels, but some in the party have suggested they are working together. 
After hours of fighting on Sunday, CPC fighters had entered Bangassou by late afternoon, the sources told Reuters, although it was not clear to what extent they were in control of the town. Two of the sources said army soldiers had taken refuge at the MINUSCA base in Bangassou. 
An army spokesman said he did not have information about the situation in Bangassou. A MINUSCA spokesman was not immediately available for comment. 
In its statement earlier in the day, MINUSCA said the rebels attacked Bangassou at around 5:30 a.m. and that its peacekeepers had intervened in support of the army. 
It said the fighting had let up at around 10:00 a.m. but that the situation remained ""tense"". The CPC also attacked Touadera's hometown of Damara, about 80 km (50 miles) north of the capital Bangui on Saturday, MINUSCA said. 
Threats and attacks by the rebels kept more than 14% of polling stations closed on election day. Complete results are expected on Monday.
The country descended into chaos in 2013 when mostly Muslim rebels ousted Bozize, sparking reprisals from mostly Christian militias. 
Bozize's candidacy was rejected because he faces an arrest warrant and U.N. sanctions for allegedly ordering assassinations and torture while president. Bozize has denied those charges.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway will impose fresh restrictions to prevent a resurgence in the spread of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Sunday, including a nationwide ban on serving alcohol in restaurants and bars and not inviting guests home.
The Nordic country has seen a rise in cases over the past month and now estimates its R number - which represents the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to - stands at 1.3.
""We see more signs of a new wave of infections,"" Solberg told a news conference, citing Christmas and New Year's Eve celebrations and the emergence of the more contagious variant of the virus first identified in Britain among the reasons.
Norwegians must put their social lives on hold for the next two weeks in order to keep the virus under control, she said.
""I ask you not to have any visitors at home. Wait a fortnight before inviting anyone home or visiting others,"" she said.
A day earlier the government announced that university lectures were suspended and told students to stay at home. 
Shops, kindergartens and elementary schools will remain open. Middle schools and high schools will also remain open but will use more remote learning than currently. 
All travel for private purposes, be it foreign or domestic, is now discouraged. Norway had already some of the toughest travel restrictions in Europe, requiring non-residents to have proof they are COVID-19 negative before entering the country.
On Thursday, Oslo imposed mandatory COVID-19 tests for all people entering Norway from abroad, either upon arrival or within 24 hours, to stop the spread of the coronavirus variant detected first in Britain.
Small border crossings have been shut as they do not have capacity to have COVID-19 test centres and more military personnel will man the border with Finland in the Arctic.

Norway's 14-day cumulative number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants was at 113.6 in the week Dec. 21-27, the fourth lowest in Europe behind Iceland, Greece and Finland, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has said.

VATICAN CITY/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday accepted the resignation of the head of the Catholic Church in Belarus, Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, who spent time in exile last year after angering President Alexander Lukashenko.
Kondrusiewicz turned 75 on Sunday, the age at which bishops are required to submit resignation letters to the pope, which he then decides whether to accept.
It is highly unusual for the pope to accept a bishop's resignation precisely on his 75th birthday and even more so to announce it on a Sunday.
The speed with which the resignation was accepted indicated the possibility that a face-saving deal for both sides was found in negotiations between the Vatican and the Belarus government to win Kondrusiewicz's return from exile in December, a diplomatic source in Rome said.
Bishops are usually kept in place for months and sometimes years after they formally hand in their resignations. Particularly in areas of conflict or in delicate positions, they often stay until a successor is appointed.
Instead, the Vatican statement announcing the resignation said Kazimierz Wielikosielec, an auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Pinsk in western Belarus, would act as Apostolic Administrator until a new archbishop is appointed in Minsk.
Kondrusiewicz angered Lukashenko by defending the rights of anti-government protesters, who began calling for the president's resignation soon after a disputed election on Aug. 9. 
The archbishop was denied entry to Belarus the same month on his return from a ceremony in neighbouring Poland.
That led to tensions between the Church and the government, and the Vatican sent a special envoy to negotiate on Kondrusiewicz's behalf, with diplomats working for almost five months to secure the archbishop's return.
He returned to Belarus on Dec. 24, when Christian communities celebrate Christmas Eve. 

Belarusians overwhelmingly observe Orthodox Christianity, but the country has small Catholic minorities, observing the Roman rite common in Poland or the Eastern rite found in neighbouring Ukraine.

Salvador Franco died just weeks after family members and activists reported he was suffering from health problems. A court in November had ordered his transfer to a medical facility, but authorities did not comply, according to Penal Forum attorney Olnar Ortiz. 
""The regime let him die,"" Ortiz said. Critics of President Nicolas Maduro's government call him a dictator who has systematically jailed opponents and denied them rights to due process.
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The government frequently accuses the opposition of seeking to foment a violent coup to seize control of the OPEC nation's vast oil reserves.
Some 12 other indigenous men remain incarcerated under accusations of participating in the December 2019 raid on the outpost in southern Bolivar state. Maduro at the time accused the men of conspiring with Colombia, Peru and Brazil to spark a rebellion in Venezuela, a charge all three countries denied.

QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility for an attack on Sunday that killed 11 miners from Pakistan’s minority Shi’ite Hazaras in Baluchistan province.
The attack took place early on Sunday morning in the Mach area of Bolan district around 100 kms southeast of Baluchistan's capital Quetta, killing the miners who were in a shared residential room near the coal mine where they worked, officials said.
“The throats of all coal miners have been slit, after their hands were tied behind their backs and (they were) blind folded,” a security official told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to media.
A video clip making the rounds on WhatsApp groups, apparently shot by a first responder, showed three bodies lying outside the room and the rest inside in pools of blood.
“The condemnable killing of 11 innocent coal miners in Mach Baluchistan is yet another cowardly inhuman act of terrorism,” Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said in a tweet.
“Have asked Frontier Constabulary to use all resources to apprehend these killers and bring them to justice,” he said.
Islamic State later claimed responsibility for the attack, through its Amaq news agency via its Telegram communications channel.
The attack came after a relative lull in nearly a year of violence against the mainly Shi’ite Hazara minority in the province.
In April, a market suicide bombing killed 18 people, half of whom were Hazaras.
Following Sunday's attack, members of the Hazara minority in Quetta blocked the western bypass and set fire to tyres to protest against the killings.
Baluchistan is the focus of the $60-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a transport and energy link planned between western China and Pakistan’s southern deepwater port of Gwadar.
Hazaras have been frequently targeted by Taliban and Islamic State militants and other Sunni Muslim militant groups in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.
The attacks in Afghanistan have been claimed by an affiliate of Islamic State.
In 2013, three bombings killed more than 200 people in Hazara neighbourhoods in Quetta.

The traditional Angelus blessing is normally given from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square, but it was moved indoors to prevent any crowds gathering and limit the spread of COVID-19.

It was Israel that needed to be on alert for possible Iranian strikes on the one-year anniversary on Sunday of the assassination of Tehran's top general, Qassem Soleimani, in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Kan public radio. 
Washington blames Iran-backed militia for regular rocket attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq, including near the U.S. embassy. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility. 
On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter: ""New intelligence from Iraq indicate that Israeli agent-provocateurs are plotting attacks against Americans — putting an outgoing (President Donald) Trump in a bind with a fake casus belli.""
""Be careful of a trap, @realDonaldTrump. Any fireworks will backfire badly, particularly against your same BFFs,"" Zarif wrote, in what appeared to be a veiled threat against Israel.
Steinitz said the remarks showed that Iran, after mounting U.S. sanctions billed as curbing its nuclear programme and involvement in regional conflict-zones, was ""under pressure - economic pressure, and pressure in terms of national security"". 
""We hear this nonsense by Zarif, that Israel would set off terrorist attacks against the United States - this really is total nonsense,"" Steinitz told Kan public radio.
""But on the other hand it is a warning sign - a warning sign that Iran is taking aim at Israel, is looking for excuses to lash out at Israel, and therefore we need to have our finger on the pulse and be at the highest state of alert.""
The U.S. military flew two nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to the Middle East in a message of deterrence to Iran on Wednesday, but the bombers have since left the region.
Interviewed separately on Kan, Israeli Culture Minister Chili Tropper, who like Steinitz sits in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, confirmed media reports that Israel was on heightened alert for the Soleimani anniversary.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Australia's most-populous state of New South Wales (NSW) reported eight new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, while neighbouring Victoria's tally increased by three, as new measures to combat the disease kicked in.
The NSW outbreak started around mid-December in Sydney's Northern Beaches area, where a quarter of a million people are in strict lockdown until Jan. 9. Cases associated with the cluster now total 148.
A smaller cluster in the west of the city, linked to a different genome sequence, has 13 confirmed cases. But the state's chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said authorities are worried as recent transmission at a liquor store occurred with ""fleeting"" exposure.
""We know these transmission events have happened through very minimal exposure. We are asking members of the community who did purchase alcohol or enter that premises for that period to be very vigilant,"" Chant told reporters.
NSW has made wearing masks mandatory at indoor venues like gaming rooms, hair salons and shops as authorities try to limit the spread of the disease. They will be legally enforced from midnight local time.
Australia has avoided the worst of the pandemic following swift action by authorities to shut borders, enforce lockdowns, and to carry out widespread testing and social distancing.
Since the pandemic began, it has reported more than 28,450 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)
Despite the outbreak in Sydney, a scheduled 5-day cricket match between Australia and India, starting on Thursday, will go ahead, although with a reduced number of spectators. Five Indian players have been placed in isolation while the Australian and Indian cricket boards investigate allegations of a breach of biosecurity protocols.
In Victoria, where all cases are linked to the same Melbourne restaurant, officials are investigating how the disease spread from the source in NSW, authorities said.
Victoria has more than 30 active cases and has made masks mandatory across the state, restricted the number of people who can meet socially and shut its border with NSW.
Health authorities have identified 220 ""close contacts"" and more than 50 ""exposure sites"" linked to positive cases.

But, ""what is important is that they are in quarantine when they are diagnosed so that the risk of onward transmission is reduced,"" Victoria's Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng said in Melbourne.

""New intelligence from Iraq indicate(s) that Israeli agent-provocateurs are plotting attacks against Americans — putting an outgoing Trump in a bind with a fake casus belli (act justifying war),"" Zarif said in a tweet. 
""Be careful of a trap, @realDonaldTrump. Any fireworks will backfire badly,"" Zarif wrote.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and the Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment on Zarif's remarks.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Zarif's message.
Esmail Ghaani, who succeeded Soleimani as head the elite Quds force, said on Friday Iran was still ready to respond.

The U.S. military flew two nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to the Middle East in a message of deterrence to Iran on Wednesday, but the bombers have since left the region.

The National Association of Headteachers, England's largest headteachers’ union, said on Saturday they had instructed lawyers to write to the government demanding that it reveals the data behind its decision to reopen schools.
The National Education Union called on the government to move learning online in all primary schools in England for the first few weeks of the month. It has also issued advice to its members reminding them of their legal right not to have to work in an unsafe environment.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has been criticised for frequent reversals during the pandemic, including delaying lockdown during the first wave in March and abandoning a system to award school grades without exams.Earlier this week, in a hastily arranged statement to parliament on bringing children back to school this term, the education minister Gavin Williamson said that the majority of primary schools in England would open as planned on Monday.
A few days later, he announced that all London primary schools will remain shut during the first weeks of January.

The three - two former security chiefs and the younger brother of former President Abdelaziz Bouteflika - were given 15-year prison sentences in September 2019 on charges of conspiracy against the state. 
Their jailing marked an apparent success for the ""Hirak"" mass protest movement that took to the streets in early 2019, pushing the army to oust Bouteflika in April that year after 20 years in office. 
But many in Hirak said their uprising had not yet achieved its goals of ousting the old ruling elite, forcing the army from politics and ending corruption when the coronavirus pandemic stopped their weekly protests last March. 
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, elected in December 2019 in a vote the protesters decried as a sham, has sought to placate Hirak by praising the movement as a moment of national renewal and introducing some constitutional changes. 
But many supporters of the leaderless Hirak movement rejected those moves as merely cosmetic change despite the senior status of some of those imprisoned. 
""We still want a radical change of the whole regime,"" said Rachid Hamani, a Hirak figure. 
Mohamed Mediene, who enjoyed vast power as a secretive security chief known to his compatriots by the nickname Tewfic, was freed by Saturday's acquittal. 
""The military justice rejected the plot theory against Tewfic. This is good,"" a source close to Mediene said. 
His less influential successor, Bachir Tartag, as well as Said Bouteflika, younger brother of the former president, were also acquitted but remain in prison pending corruption charges in a civilian court, the sources said. 
Dozens of other figures close to Bouteflika, including prominent business leaders and less powerful officials, remain in prison.

In a wide-ranging interview with Italian sports daily La Gazzetta dello Sport published on Saturday, Francis recalled his own days playing soccer as a child with a ball made of rags and laid bare his scorn for doping cheats.
Francis is a big soccer fan and met Maradona, who died in November, several times after becoming pope in 2013.
""On the field he was a poet, a great champion who gave joy to millions of people, in Argentina as in Naples. He was also a very fragile man,"" Francis said.
Maradona played for Napoli from 1984 to 1991 winning two Serie A titles and the UEFA Cup. In 1986, he captained the Argentine team to victory in the World Cup.
Despite his love for the game, Francis said he was living in Germany at the time and was not able to see the final played in Mexico against West Germany. He only discovered the result the next day when a student wrote ""Viva Argentina"" on the blackboard during a language class.
""I personally remember it as a victory of loneliness because I had no one to share the joy of that sporting victory with,"" he said.
Francis said he himself had no talent for the sport and was forced by his companions to play in goal. 
""But being a goalkeeper was a great school of life for me. The goalkeeper must be ready to respond to dangers that can come from all sides,"" he said. 
Being poor, he recalled how he and his friends could not afford a proper ball, so had to improvise: ""All we needed was a ball made of rags to have fun and perform.""
While extolling the virtues of sport, Francis took aim at athletes who took performance enhancing drugs.

""Doping in sport is not only cheating, it is a shortcut that destroys dignity,"" he said. ""Better a clean defeat than a dirty victory. I wish this for the whole world, not just the world of sport.""

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan on Saturday arrested a man accused of being a leader of an Islamist militant group blamed by the United States and India for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, a counter-terrorism official said. 
The arrest is in relation to terrorism financing, the official said, and not a specific militant attack. 
""Proscribed organisation LeT (Lashkar-e-Taiba) leader Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi (has been) arrested on charges of terrorism financing,"" a spokesman for the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of the Pakistani province of Punjab said.
The suspect is said to have been running a medical dispensary to collect and disburse funds for militant activities, the spokesman said.
A U.N. Security Council sanctions committee says Lakhvi is LeT's chief of operations and accuses him of being involved in militant activity in a number of other regions and countries, including Chechnya, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Indian authorities said the lone surviving gunman in the 2008 Mumbai siege, in which 166 people were killed, had told interrogators before his execution that the assailants were in touch with Lakhvi. 
India has long called on Pakistan to bring Lakhvi to trial, but Islamabad says Delhi has not provided concrete evidence to try the LeT leader. He was first arrested in 2008 but was later released on bail. 
Imran Gill, Lakhvi's lawyer, confirmed the arrest and told Reuters his case would be heard next week. He did not respond to further questions.
Another man that India says was the mastermind of the Mumbai siege, Hafiz Saeed, was convicted by a Pakistani court on two charges of terrorism financing last year. Saeed denies involvement in the Mumbai attacks.

However, it was still unclear when these workers would get vaccinated. The ministry said it would give more details on Monday.
Amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, unions and hospitals have been pushing for front-line carers to get vaccinated rapidly.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's federal territory of Jammu and Kashmir plans to attract investments worth up to $4 billion in the next two three years and would provide security to businesses setting up shop in the insurgency-hit region, its chief said on Saturday.
Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) was India’s only Muslim-majority state until August 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi carved out a Buddhist-dominated enclave and designated both as federally-administered territories.
Tens of thousands of security forces guard the region where India has been fighting an armed-insurgency for decades, especially in the disputed Kashmir valley that is also claimed by Pakistan.
J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha said his administration was identifying 6,000 acres (2,400 hectares) of land for businesses and that they would make companies feel secure.
""We have an annual budget of 1 trillion rupees ($13.68 billion) for the region and a good amount of that is being used for providing security for businesses,"" Sinha said a group of journalists in New Delhi.
The government was also working on organising an investment summit there after a delay due to the coronavirus pandemic, he said.
""We are in touch with all big business houses,"" he said.
J&K is one of India’s least industrialized regions, with per capita income of 62,145 rupees in 2016/2017, lower than the national average of 82,229 rupees but higher than several other states.

The government enforced the changes the region through a harsh crackdown, deploying thousands of additional troops, imposing a communication blackout and detaining scores of people.

Relations between the world's two biggest economies have come under increasing strain amid a series of disputes over trade, human rights and the origins of COVID-19. In its latest move, the United States blacklisted dozens of Chinese companies it said had ties to the military.
Wang, China's state councillor and foreign minister, said in a joint interview with Xinhua news agency and other state media outlets that recent U.S. policies towards China had harmed the interests of both countries and brought huge dangers to the world. 
But there was now an opportunity for the two sides to ""open a new window of hope"" and begin a new round of dialogue, he said.
The election of Joe Biden as U.S. President has been widely expected to improve relations between Washington and Beijing after four years of escalating tensions under the administration of Donald Trump.
Last month, Wang said he hoped the election of Biden would allow U.S. China policy to ""return to objectivity and rationality"".
However, President-elect Biden, who will take office on Jan. 20, has continued to criticise China for its ""abuses"" on trade and other issues.
Wang did not mention Trump or Biden by name, but he urged the United States to ""respect the social system and development path"" chosen by China, adding that if Washington ""learns lessons"", the conflicts between the two sides could be resolved.
""We know some people in the United States are apprehensive about China's rapid development, but the most sustainable leadership is to constantly move forward yourself, rather than block the development of other countries,"" he said.
Politicians in the United States have accused China of covering up the outbreak of COVID-19 during its early stages, delaying its response and allowing the disease to spread much further and faster. 
But Wang said China had done its utmost to combat the virus's spread, ""sounding the alarm"" for the rest of the world.

""We raced against time, and were the earliest to report the epidemic to the world,"" he said. ""More and more studies show that the epidemic very probably emerged in many places throughout the world.""

Taiwan is ready to have ""meaningful"" talks with China as equals as long as they are willing to put aside confrontation, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday, offering another olive branch to Beijing in her New Year's speech.
China views the democratic and self-governed island as its own territory, and cut off a formal talks mechanism in 2016 after Tsai was first elected, viewing her as a separatist bent on a formal declaration of independence.
In a statement late on Friday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said there was no way of changing the reality that the island was part of China, and the refusal of Taiwan's government to accept that was the root cause of present tensions.
Since 2016, Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) ""has continued to provoke by seeking independence, confronting the mainland at every turn, deliberately creating confrontation across the Taiwan Strait"", it said.
""They again talked about so-called 'dialogue,' but where can that come from?"" the office added. ""We urge the DPP authorities to stop it with these cheap tricks that dupe people.""
Tsai, re-elected by a landslide last year on a pledge to stand up to China and defend Taiwan's democracy and security, has repeatedly said Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.
Tensions have risen in recent months with China ramping up its military activities near the island, including on occasion flying fighter jets across the median line of the narrow Taiwan Strait, which usually serves as an unofficial buffer.

China says it is responding to ""collusion"" between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing U.S. support for the island. Beijing views this as a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China.

Emergency workers are continuing their search in what Bjoern Nuland, head of the health team at the site, said was still a rescue operation. A search-and-rescue team from neighbouring Sweden was assisting.
Some 1,000 people have so far been evacuated from Gjerdrum, including 46 people from an area 2 km (1.2 miles) away from the landslide, after cracks were observed in the ground.

558,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2021 12:30PM ET</span>",Wisconsin pharmacist arrested on charges of sabotaging COVID vaccine doses,"By Steve Gorman and Rebecca Spalding
(Reuters) - A Wisconsin hospital pharmacist was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of sabotaging more than 500 doses of coronavirus vaccine by deliberately removing them from refrigeration to spoil, police and medical authorities said.
The pharmacist, an employee of Aurora Medical Center in Grafton, Wisconsin, at the time that 57 vials of vaccine were found left out of cold storage earlier this week, has since been fired but has not been publicly identified, officials said. 
Each vial contains 10 doses. Nearly 60 of the doses in question were administered before hospital officials determined the medication had been left unrefrigerated long enough to render the vaccine ineffective. The remaining 500-plus doses were then discarded.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, maker of the vaccine, has assured the hospital that receiving an injection of any of the doses removed from refrigeration poses no safety issue, other than leaving the recipient unprotected from COVID infection, said Dr. Jeff Bahr, Aurora Health Care Medical Group president.
Neither Aurora Health nor law enforcement offered any possible motive for the sabotage. 
Those who received the ineffective doses have been notified and will need to be re-vaccinated. The episode means that immunization will be delayed for 570 people who should by now have received their first shot of the two-dose vaccine.
Speaking to an online press briefing on Thursday, Bahr said there was no evidence the pharmacist tampered with the vaccines in any way besides removing them from refrigeration, or that any other doses were disturbed. 
Grafton police said in a statement that the pharmacist ""knew the spoiled vaccinations would be useless and that people who received the vaccinations would think they had been vaccinated against the virus when in fact they were not.""
The incident comes amid public opinion surveys showing widespread skepticism about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines, which were granted emergency-use authorization by federal regulators just 11 months after the virus emerged in the United States.
Reluctance to take the vaccine has even been expressed by some healthcare workers who are among those designated as first in line to receive them.
When initially questioned after the misplaced vials were discovered on Dec. 26, the pharmacist said it was an inadvertent error, but during further review of the matter admitted on Wednesday to intentionally removing the vaccine from refrigeration, hospital officials said.

The individual, a resident of Grafton in the Milwaukee suburbs, was arrested on Thursday and booked into the Ozaukee County jail on felony charges of recklessly endangering safety, adulterating a prescription drug and criminal damage to property, police said.

The commission also detailed brutality by civilians involved in the clashes, saying some attackers beheaded and tortured people after dragging them from their homes and using ethnic slurs.
The ""widespread and systematic attack"" on civilians by attackers constituted crimes against humanity, the commission said.
Its report on the violence, some of the worst in Ethiopia since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018, said a total of 123 people were killed and at least 500 injured.
Abiy's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.
Ethnic violence has surged in many parts of Ethiopia, Africa's second-most populous nation, since Abiy took office and lifted the lid on long-repressed tensions between more than 80 ethnic groups. Abiy has urged national unity, but powerful ethnic-based movements are opposed to this.
The summer violence began amid protests triggered by the killing of Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, a popular singer from the Oromo ethnic group, the country's largest. Oromos, including Haacaaluu himself, were a strong force in the anti-government protests that piled pressure on the former ruling coalition and eventually led to Abiy being selected as premier in 2018. 
The street protests after the singer's death spread from the capital Addis Ababa to the surrounding Oromiya region.
The commission's report found that attackers ""moving in groups and armed with knives, stones, flammables, electric cables, sticks, axes and machetes; beat, injured and killed people in a gruesome manner, including through torture and beheading.""
In October, Ethiopia's attorney general charged four suspects with terrorism in connection with the killing of the singer. 
The rights commission the proportionality of the force employed in some parts of the response by security forces to the unrest was ""highly questionable"". 

The violence in June and July was not related to a conflict since November between federal forces and a rebellious force in the northern Tigray region that is believed to have killed thousands and displaced around 950,000 people.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's drug regulator on Friday approved a coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University for emergency use, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The decision clears the vaccine's rollout in the world's second-most populous country which, after the United States, has the highest number of COVID-19 infections.
India wants to start administering the vaccine soon, most likely by Wednesday, said one of the sources, both of whom declined to be named ahead of an official announcement expected later in the day.
A representative of India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), whose experts are meeting for the second time this week, declined to comment. 
Britain and Argentina have already authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine for urgent public use.
The CDSCO is also considering emergency-use authorisation applications for vaccines made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) with Germany's BioNTech, and by India's Bharat Biotech.
Cheaper and easier to distribute than rival shots, the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine could be a game-changer for global immunisation. 
Countries with relatively basic health infrastructure have high hopes for a shot that, unlike Pfizer's, can be stored and transported under normal refrigeration, rather than supercooled to -70 degrees Celsius (-94 Fahrenheit).
India has reported more than 10 million COVID-19 cases, though its rate of infection has come down significantly from a mid-September peak. The country hopes to inoculate 300 million of its 1.35 billion people in the first six to eight months of 2021.
DOSING REGIMEN?
Britain became the first country this week to authorise the AstraZeneca vaccine, moving ahead of other western countries as it seeks to stem a record surge of infections driven by a highly contagious form of the virus that has also surfaced in India.
The AstraZeneca shot is being manufactured in India by Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest producer of vaccines, which has already stockpiled about 50 million doses.
Though the Indian government has not yet signed a purchase agreement with SII, the company says it will focus on the home market first, and then exports - mainly to South Asian countries and Africa.
Questions about the degree of effectiveness of the AstraZeneca shot have surrounded it since data published in November showed a divergence in success rates, which the developers said reflected different dosing regimens.

Britain's medicines regulator further clouded the picture this week when it said that it had found an 80% success rate when two full doses were administered, three months apart, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found.

At the station, Bedour was detained and has been held in jail for four months on morality charges, relatives and activists say, even though the then 14-year-old had no connection to alleged rape and was not at the scene when it occurred at Cairo's Fairmont Nile City Hotel in 2014.
Three sources close to Bedour said he was accused of drug abuse and debauchery. His lawyer could not be reached for comment. The public prosecution department was not available for comment and the state press centre did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
In addition to Bedour, two others who had come forward to testify in support of the rape victim - party organizer Ahmed Ganzoury and Nazly Karim, ex-wife of one of the defendants in the rape case - have also been detained and are being held in prison on the same drug and debauchery charges, sources close to them said. Their lawyer could not be reached. 
Three other witnesses who also wanted to testify in support of the victim, including Bedour's friend, have been released after also being arrested.
The case against Bedour and the witnesses is running alongside that of those suspected of committing the rape. 
Of nine men accused of the rape, five are under arrest and four are outside the country.
Some human rights activists say the arrests of the witnesses are part of a tendency by authorities to prioritise traditional social morality at the expense of women’s rights. 
They say authorities are trying to counter a growing movement against exposing sexual abuse in Egypt that drew comparisons with the international “#MeToo” campaign and helped encourage witnesses to testify about the alleged rape at the Fairmont in April 2014.
ROOFTOP PARTY
In the Fairmont case, a rooftop party took place at the hotel and later the same evening a woman was allegedly gang-raped at an after-party there.
Encouraged by the #MeToo movement, the alleged Fairmont victim posted an anonymous account online before filing a formal complaint in July saying she had been drugged and gang raped. 
In a statement on Aug. 31, Egypt’s public prosecutors said Bedour, now aged 21, and the five witnesses were being interrogated in connection with “ongoing investigations” in the Fairmont case, without specifying charges.
They said Bedour and the witnesses were tested for drug use, and two were subjected to “medical tests”. In a report published in September, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the tests were anal examinations. 
Family and friends have pleaded for the release of Bedour and the two witnesses still being held, saying they did nothing wrong.
""Our lives have completely turned upside down,"" Bedour's sister, Nivan Bedour, said. The detainees' next hearing is on Jan. 2, when they could be released or kept in custody. 
Ganzoury has been cooperating with prosecutors and sharing details of the party he has said he organised at the Fairmont on the evening of the alleged rape, which happened at an after-party later that night which he did not organise, according to a friend of his and a source close to the victim.      
Karim, the ex-wife of one of the rape defendants, was falsely portrayed as the rape victim in an anonymous smear campaign on the web, her family says. Reuters has also seen that material. 
Several friends and activists say Karim's mental state has deteriorated in prison. 
Her mother, actress Noha al-Amrousy, wrote on the Free Nazly Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page: “Nazly shifted from being a courageous girl who would never back down from telling the truth to a cowardly, scared girl ... Is that what you want this generation to be like? To silence them so that they don’t say the truth?”

The pope was unable to attend services on Thursday and again on Friday morning because of the sciatica - a relatively common problem that causes pain along the sciatic nerve down the lower back and legs.
It was believed to be the first time since he became pope in 2013 that Francis, who turned 84 last month, has been prevented by health reasons from leading a major papal event.
However, he showed no sign of discomfort as he delivered a noon address and prayer, standing at a lectern in the library of the Vatican's Apostolic Palace.
""Life today is governed by war, by enmity, by many things that are destructive. We want peace. It is a gift,"" Francis said, adding that the response to the global coronavirus crisis showed the importance of burden-sharing. 
""The painful events that marked humanity's journey last year, especially the pandemic, taught us how much it is necessary to take an interest in the problems of others and to share their concerns,"" he said.
The noon blessing is normally given from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square, but it was moved indoors to prevent any crowds gathering and limit the spread of COVID-19.
Francis highlighted in particular his worries about Yemen, which has been blighted by six years of violence that has pitted a Saudi-led coalition against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. At least 22 people were killed in an attack on Aden airport on Wednesday, which triggered a fresh round of coalition air raids.

""I express my sorrow and concern for the further escalation of violence in Yemen, which is causing numerous innocent victims,"" Francis said. ""Let us think of the children of Yemen, without education, without medicine, famished.""

Tshisekedi moved last month to end an awkward power-sharing coalition he was forced into with Kabila, who stepped down in January 2019 after 18 years in office but whose allies still controlled majorities in parliament.
Tshisekedi says divisions in the alliance have frustrated his efforts to address armed violence in the mineral-rich east, reform the judiciary and secure financial support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
In response, he has tried to convince members of Kabila's alliance to defect to a new political bloc, known as the Sacred Union, that will support his agenda. 
Tshisekedi registered an early victory on Dec. 10 when the lower house of parliament voted to remove a Kabila ally as speaker.
Late on Thursday, he nominated Senator Modeste Bahati as a facilitator whose task will be to determine whether the Sacred Union has the support of a majority of legislators. 
Bahati will have a 30-day mandate, which can be renewed once, the presidency said in a statement. 
If Tshisekedi is successful, the new parliamentary majority could initiate a motion of no confidence against the government of Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga, a Kabila ally. 

Tshisekedi, a longtime opponent of Kabila, won office by defeating Kabila's chosen successor in the December 2018 election, even as independent observers said another opposition candidate had won.

The three - two women and a man – were abducted by the banned Arakan Army in mid-October while campaigning in Rakhine as candidates before a Nov. 8 election. The candidates were held for more than two months.
""This is a goodwill gesture ... and we hope Myanmar army and Myanmar government will make similar goodwill gestures too,"" said Arakan Army spokesman Khine Thu Kha told Reuters in an audio recording sent by text message.
A spokesman for Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) confirmed the candidates had been transferred to an army camp near Paletwa in Chin state. 
""We haven't met with the candidates yet, so we do not have any more information right now,"" spokesman Myo Nyunt Myo Nyunt told Reuters by phone.
Rakhine state has been roiled for more than a year by conflict between government troops and insurgents from the Arakan Army fighting for greater autonomy for the region. 
The fighting is separate from violence that has led to the flight of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Rohingya, also from Rakhine state.
The NLD scored another commanding win in the November parliamentary election.
In Rakhine, however, the party lost most of the seats it took in 2015, a result some analysts said highlighted the deepening sense of grievance many there harbour against a central government dominated by the ethnic Bamar majority.
About two-thirds of the state's population were unable to vote after the election commission shut some polling stations, citing insecurity because of fighting between government troops and the Arakan Army insurgent group.

The United States killed Soleimani, leader of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, in Iraq on Jan. 3, 2020. Washington had accused him of masterminding attacks by Iranian-aligned militias on U.S. forces in the region. 
Days after the U.S. drone strike, Iran retaliated with a rocket attack on an Iraqi air base where U.S. forces were stationed, and Iranian forces on high alert mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger airliner taking off from Tehran.
Esmail Ghaani who succeeded Soleimani as head the elite Quds force, said on Friday Iran was still ready to respond.
""From inside your own house, there may emerge someone who will retaliate for your crime,” he said at a televised event to mark the anniversary at Tehran University.
“American mischief will not deter the Quds force from carrying on its resistance path,” he added.
Two U.S. B-52 bombers flew over the Middle East on Wednesday in what U.S. officials said was a message of deterrence to Iran ahead of the first anniversary.
On Thursday, Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused U.S. President Donald Trump of attempting to fabricate a pretext to attack Iran, and said Tehran would defend itself forcefully.

Representatives of Iran’s regional allies and movements in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Gaza also spoke at Friday's anniversary event.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan's famous truck art will move from its highways to the skies, as a flying academy is painting a two-seater Cessna aircraft with the colourful technique.
With elaborate and flamboyant motifs, Pakistani truck art has inspired gallery exhibitions abroad and prompted stores in Western cities to sell miniatures.
“We want to show the world that Pakistan is not all about Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and terrorism issues; it a very diverse country and a land of opportunities,” Imran Aslam Khan, chief operating officer of Sky Wings, a flight training organisation, told Reuters.
He also plans to paint other aircraft, with the aim of promoting tourism in Pakistan.
Such art has become one of Pakistan's best-known cultural exports in recent years. UNESCO, for example, has been using truck art, blended with indigenous themes, to promote girls' education in a northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
""The world is familiar with our truck art representation; now, with this aircraft, our colours will fly in the air. We are really excited,"" Haider Ali, the artist painting the aircraft, told Reuters at the academy's hangar. 
Trained by his father, Ali, 40, has been decorating trucks since his childhood and is now one of the most prominent such painters in Pakistan.

Ali hopes to paint an Airbus or Boeing (NYSE:BA) aircraft in the future, saying an opportunity to work on such gargantuan planes would truly be a learning experience.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Large crowds took to the streets at midnight on Friday in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, celebrating the arrival of 2021 after a year marred by a deadly pandemic that killed thousands there and required the city to be locked down between the end of January and early April.
   As per tradition, hundreds gathered in front of the old Hankow Customs House building, one of the city’s more popular New Year’s Eve spots. When the building’s old clock reached midnight many people released balloons into the air, cheered and called out ""happy new year"".
    ""I’m so so so incredibly happy,"" said 20-year-old student and tourist Yang Wenxuan. ""This is my first time in Wuhan. But it (the countdown) was so spectacular.""
   ""I hope that I can successfully obtain my bachelor degree and I hope I can find a boyfriend,"" Yang added.
   There was a heavy police presence and strict crowd control. Some security personnel were seen telling several of the few people without masks that they must put one on if they wished to stay. Still, the countdown appeared to proceed peacefully, in a relaxed atmosphere.
    The festivities came 12 months after the World Health Organization (WHO) said it first received word of cases of a pneumonia of an unknown cause in Wuhan, which later became known as the world's first outbreak of COVID-19. A team of WHO experts is scheduled to arrive in China in January 2021 to investigate the origins of the pandemic. 
    Wuhan has been largely virus free for months, and in recent days it has been vaccinating some specific groups of the local population. But a recent small rise in cases in various Chinese cities, including Beijing, has reminded people in Wuhan that the pandemic is not over yet. 
    ""I hope that in 2021 everything goes well in the country and Wuhan can return to normal and I hope that the world can soon defeat the pandemic,"" said Wuhan resident Anson Yang. 
    The 25-year-old ,who works in the international trade sector, said his earnings were hit hard in 2020 and he knows of many businesses in Wuhan who are yet to return to normal trading levels. 
    Several students yearned for an end to the pandemic so they could get on with in-person studies. One university student, however, drew some positive lessons from the fight against the pandemic. 

    ""If we look at the measures people took, the things people did as part of the epidemic control and the like, a human or friendly touch, something that we would not normally see, was felt by everyone,"" said 21-year-old Chen Mengfan.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - A Pacific storm of record proportions swept a remote stretch of Alaska's Aleutian Islands chain on Thursday, battering a region used heavily by commercial shipping with hurricane-force winds and seas five stories high.
“It’s the most intense storm ever recorded in the North Pacific, excluding typhoons,” said Brian Brettschneider, a NOAA research scientist with the National Weather Service.
The center of what forecasters refer to as “bomb cyclone” was measured at a record-low barometric pressure of 921 millibars, equivalent to the eye of a Category 4 hurricane and the lowest documented over the Aleutians as far back as the 1950s, Brettschneider said.
The storm unleashed seas as high as 54 feet (16.5 meters) and winds topping 80 miles per hour (120 kph) - a force of Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale - in the western Aleutians, the weather service said.
The storm was too far from large populated areas to pose a direct hazard to many people besides those traveling in the region by aircraft or vessel, Brettscheneider said.
The Aleutian island of Shemya with a small air station and a few personnel was in the epicenter of the storm, about 1,450 miles southwest of Anchorage, Alaska's largest city. Most of the Aleutian Islands are uninhabited.
The waters, however, are heavily used by cargo ships traveling between Asia and North America. Thousands of vessels a year ply a shipping corridor known as the North Pacific Great Circle Route. The area is also important for commercial fishing.
The storm also caused some erosion of Bering Sea winter ice, already at some of its thinnest levels on record for this time of year, further disrupting a frozen landscape that walruses and some species of seals depend on.
“This may kind of set back ice formation,” Brettschneider said, adding that it would likely take five or six days for the winds to calm and for cold northern air to flow back in, allowing the Bering Sea to regain some ice.

Between midnight (2300 GMT) and just six minutes later, the Berlin fire service said it was called to 18 fires, with more following deeper into the night. No one was initially reported seriously injured.
Berlin revellers usually take to the streets to light up the sky with fireworks on New Year's Eve but authorities banned the use of fireworks in certain public places, including more than 50 zones in the capital, to discourage large crowds from gathering.
The sale of fireworks was also prohibited in the run up to Dec. 31 in Germany, which is locked down with only essential shops open until at least Jan. 10 to try to suppress the new coronavirus.
After faring better than many of its neighbours in the early stage of the pandemic last year, Germany has suffered a surge in cases and fatalities linked to COVID-19. A record daily high of 1,129 new cases were reported on Wednesday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un marked the new year with a letter to the country's citizens and a visit the tomb of his father and grandfather, state media reported, but gave no immediate sign he would give a speech as he has in past years.
In the letter, Kim offered thanks to the people for having trusted and supported the ruling Party even in the ""difficult"" times, state news agency KCNA reported on Friday.
The North Korean leader has previously apologised for failing to fulfil promises of economic improvement and for the hardships citizens have endured as a result of international sanctions and strict measures aimed at preventing a coronavirus outbreak.
""In the new year, too, I will work hard to bring earlier the new era in which the ideals and desires of our people will come true,"" Kim wrote, according to KCNA.
North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases of coronavirus, though officials in South Korea and the United States say that is unlikely.
Its economy has been strained by self-imposed border lockdowns and other strident measures to prevent an outbreak.
Crowds of partiers wearing face masks rang in the new year at a concert and fireworks show in the main square in the North Korean capital Pyongyang on Thursday night, state media showed.
As the clock struck midnight, Kim as well as other senior leaders visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the bodies of his father and grandfather - the previous rulers of North Korea - lie preserved under glass.
Kim was also accompanied by delegates to the Eighth Party Congress, a rare political gathering due to be held some time in early January, KCNA reported.
Together the leaders and the delegates ""hardened their firm pledge to glorify the 8th Congress of the Party as the watershed in the development of the Party and the revolution,"" KCNA said.

Kim is expected to use the congress to announce a new five-year economic plan, make leadership changes, and make other political statements.

Democratic Taiwan, claimed by China as its sovereign territory, has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which has ramped up military activity near the island.
China says it is responding to ""collusion"" between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing U.S. support for the self-governed island. Beijing views this a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China.
Speaking at the presidential office, Tsai said that in the past year, Chinese military activity near Taiwan has threatened peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
""I want to reiterate, that when it comes to cross-strait relations we will not advance rashly and will stick to our principles,"" Tsai said.
""As long as the Beijing authorities are determined to defuse antagonism and improve cross-strait relations, in line with the principles of reciprocity and dignity, we are willing to jointly promote meaningful dialogue,"" she added, echoing comments she made in October in her national day speech.
China, which cut off a formal talks mechanism in 2016 after she first won office, has repeatedly rejected Tsai's advances, saying she has to first accept Taiwan is part of China, something Tsai has refused to do.
Tsai expressed her hope that once the COVID-19 epidemic is under control, ""normal and orderly exchanges to increase understanding and reduce misunderstandings"" between people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume.
There was no immediate response from China. President Xi Jinping did not mention Taiwan in his New Year's speech on Thursday evening.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia amended its national anthem to remove reference to the country being ""young and free"" amid calls to recognise that its Indigenous people are the oldest continued civilization in the world.
The change to ""for we are one and free"" took effect on Friday.
""We live in a timeless land of ancient First Nations peoples, and we draw together the stories of more than 300 national ancestries and language groups,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
""And our anthem should reflect that. The changes we have made and we have announced today, I think, achieve that goal.""
Australia has struggled for decades to reconcile with Aborigines, who arrived on the continent some 50,000 years before British colonists. 
Each year Australians have a national holiday on Jan. 26, marking the date the “First Fleet” sailed into Sydney Harbour in 1788, carrying mainly convicts and troops from Britain. Some indigenous people refer to Australia Day as “Invasion Day”. 
There is now a renewed focus on Indigenous empowerment amid the Black Lives Matter movement.
The idea to change the wording was floated in 2020 by New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian who had said the current wording ignored Australia’s ""proud First Nations culture"".
The proposal was welcomed by several lawmakers, including federal minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt as well as firebrand rightwing One Nation party leader Pauline Hanson.

When asked if he would want to be the first person to sing the new national anthem, Morisson said: ""I think singing by prime ministers is the same as public exercise by prime ministers -- it is best done in private.""

The Pennsylvania governor's office confirmed on Twitter that Thornburgh died on Thursday. It did not give details.
During the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, Thornburgh sought to put the public at ease, calling for a partial evacuation and overseeing cleanup efforts. It was the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. 
President Ronald Reagan picked Thornburgh, a fellow Republican, to be attorney general in 1988. Reagan's successor, George H.W. Bush, asked Thornburgh to stay on, having briefly considered asking him to be his vice presidential running-mate.
As attorney general, he concentrated on white collar crime and drug trafficking and oversaw the prosecution over the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez oil spill in Alaska. He served as undersecretary general to the United Nations in 1992-93.
Born on July 16, 1932, in Pennsylvania, Thornburgh earned a law degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1957.
Republican Senator Pat Toomey, also of Pennsylvania, wrote on Twitter on Thursday: ""The steady nature in which he guided PA through the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island should serve as an example for all elected officials.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Only a handful of invited guests, including health care workers and others from the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, will gather on Thursday evening in New York's Times Square to witness the dropping of the New Year's Eve ball, marking the end of a sobering 2020 and a hopeful start to 2021.
For decades, tens of thousands of merrymakers -- many of them tourists -- have filled the blocks around Times Square on New Year's Eve, standing for hours in the cold waiting to see a glittering crystal ball glide down a pole mounted atop a skyscraper in the year's final seconds. When the ball reaches the bottom, the crowds erupt in hugs, kisses and good cheer. 
But this year Mayor Bill de Blasio and police officials have told New Yorkers and out-of-towners alike to stay away and watch pared-down festivities on television. A large contingent of police officers will barricade the area to prevent unauthorized people from gathering, aiming to prevent an event that could accelerate the spread of the virus in a city already struggling to contain it. 
Scores of New Year's Eve events around the United States have been similarly curtailed or moved online.
""It's going to be actually, arguably, the most special, the most poignant, the most moving New Year's Eve,"" de Blasio, who will push the button to start the crystal's ball descent, told reporters. ""In 2021, we're going to show people what it looks like to recover, to come back.""
Some people either didn't get the message or decided to come to Times Square anyway, hoping to get an early glimpse of the ball before police started to clear the plaza of anyone who was not authorized to be there.
""It's actually sad to see such a big distress, but I wanted to be here because it is my tradition,"" Matt Wozniak, a 41-year-old New Yorker who owns a construction business, said in explaining why he came to Times Square on Thursday morning. ""I've been coming for many years, sometimes in a big crowd. Now it's different - it feels different.""
New York police will allow only a few dozen people to watch the ball drop at the so-called Crossroads of the World in midtown Manhattan. Organizers have invited a grocery store worker, a building doorman, a pizza delivery man and doctors and nurses, including Sandra Lindsay (NYSE:LNN), the New York nurse who became the first recipient of a coronavirus vaccine in the United States outside of a trial earlier this month.
The masked guests, spaced apart for safety, will gather in front of a temporary stage set up in the plaza to see live performances by the Bronx-born singer Jennifer Lopez and Gloria Gaynor, who will perform her disco classic ""I Will Survive.""
More than 25,000 New Yorkers have been killed by COVID-19 this year. In the spring, during the early days of the U.S. outbreak, the city emerged as the epicenter of the pandemic. 
""New York is undefeatable -- as the world is,"" Kathleen Mukameal, 62, a retired New Yorker who now works as a voting rights activist, said during an early swing through the square. ""We're celebrating everything good and we have so much to be grateful for in spite of this horrific situation that we're enduring."" 
As new daily case tallies continue to rise across the United States, bars and restaurants and other gathering places in New York City are closed or have sharply limited capacity. 
In Las Vegas, Boston and beyond, official fireworks displays have been canceled. Organizers of Boston's annual First Night arts festival on New Year's Eve have arranged for six hours of live performances streamed online by local musicians and artists.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",Iran's foreign minister says Trump trying to fabricate pretext to attack Iran,"DUBAI (Reuters) -Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of attempting to fabricate a pretext to attack Iran, and said Tehran would defend itself forcefully.
Separately, a military adviser to Iran's supreme leader warned Trump ""not to turn the New Year into mourning for Americans"".
Zarif said in a tweet: ""Instead of fighting Covid in US, @realDonaldTrump & cohorts waste billions to fly B52s & send armadas to OUR region. Intelligence from Iraq indicate plot to FABRICATE pretext for war.""
The U.S. military flew two nuclear-capable B-52 bombers to the Middle East in a message of deterrence to Iran on Wednesday, but the bombers have since left the region. 
The Pentagon announced on Thursday that the Nimitz aircraft carrier, which was off the coast of Somalia, would be heading back to it's homeport. Previously operating in the Middle East, some U.S. officials said the move could be seen an attempt to reduce tensions in the region. 
In recent days there has been increased concern and vigilance about what Iranian-backed forces might do in the lead up to the anniversary of a Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike in Iraq that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, the official said.
Washington blames Iran-backed militia for regular rocket attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq, including near the embassy. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility.
Iran is preparing to hold events marking the anniversary of Soleimani's killing.
""Iran doesn't seek war but will OPENLY & DIRECTLY defend its people, security & vital interests,"" Zarif wrote.
Hossein Dehghan, a military adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Twitter: ""I saw on the news that the Americans are on alert for fear of the revenge (over Soleimani's killing) and have flown two B-52 bombers over the Persian Gulf"".

""All their military bases in the region are covered by our missiles. I advise the White House evictee (Trump) not to turn the New Year into mourning for Americans,"" said Dehghan, a former defence minister.

Ethiopia, for its part, accused its neighbour of sending forces into its territory for attacks. 
Border tensions have reignited since the outbreak of a conflict in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region in early November, which sent more than 50,000 mainly Tigrayan refugees fleeing into eastern Sudan.
Clashes have occurred in recent weeks over agricultural land in the al-Fashqa area, which lies within Sudan's international boundaries but has been settled by Ethiopian farmers for years.
On Saturday, Sudan said it had taken control of most, but not all, of the territory. Acting Foreign Minister Omar Gamareldin told a news conference on Thursday it had now taken the rest.
Talks between the two countries over the border broke down last week. Sudanese officials say Ethiopia has not formally disputed the border, which was demarcated decades ago. But comments from Ethiopian officials suggest disagreement.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Ethiopia's foreign ministry spokesman Dina Mufti accused Sudan of sending troops onto its land.
""The condition has reached a point where some (Sudanese) political leaders were saying it was their land, and they controlled their own land and they are not going to leave the land,"" he said.
In an Independence Day address late on Thursday, the head of Sudan's sovereign council said its troops had not left Sudan.
""Sudan has not and will not cross international borders or violate our neighbour Ethiopia,"" General Abdelfattah al-Burhan said late on Thursday. He said Sudan was looking to solve the issue of trespassing farmers through dialogue.
Ethiopia has accused Sudan of carrying out attacks on the farmers starting in early November. Sudan has said the forces it has engaged with are trained and armed like regular troops.
Ethiopian spokesman Mufti also blamed Sudan's behaviour on an unnamed third country, which he said was seeking instability in the region and occupying Sudanese land. That appeared to be a reference to Egypt, which summoned the Ethiopian charge d'affairs to demand an explanation for Mufti's remarks.

Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan have so far failed to end a three-way dispute over the filling and operation of the billion-dollar Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which Egypt sees as a threat to its agricultural economy, and which began filling in July.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's demobilized FARC guerrillas have delivered just a fraction of the assets they had pledged to compensate conflict victims in the four years since they signed a peace deal, the government said on Thursday. 
Colombia signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) at the end of 2016, which ended the rebel group's part in five decades of conflict that has left more than 260,000 dead and millions displaced. After disarming, the FARC became a legal political party using a different name with the same acronym. 
Under the deal, the FARC agreed to hand over around 1 trillion pesos ($291 million) in assets taken during the conflict by the end of 2020. However, the former rebels have delivered just 44.4 billion pesos ($12.9 million) in local currency, dollars and gold, according to the government - a number that was confirmed by the FARC.
""It's an issue that greatly concerns the government, not just because of the amount of resources we're talking about, but because the FARC's ill-won assets were destined to compensate victims, which would have an impact on reconciliation,"" Emilio Archila, the presidential adviser for implementing the peace deal, told Reuters.
The FARC attributed the shortfall to the government failing to do its part to help implement the deal, and threats to former guerrillas - of whom 249 have been killed since the peace deal was signed. It also cited illegal armed groups taking over territories it formerly controlled, among other reasons. 
""Our willingness isn't in doubt, we won't renounce our commitments,"" Pastor Alape, a delegate from the FARC political party, said in a statement in which he also requested an extension to the compensation deadline.
Alape's comments were dismissed by Archila. 
""When the date was decided, we established not only the deadline but also the means (to deliver the assets),"" he said. ""There is really no reason to have a new deadline.""
In addition to money and gold, the FARC said it has handed over infrastructure, including roads and health posts they constructed in areas in which they operated, as well as livestock and weapons.
The government said such infrastructure - which would be equivalent to half the total amount the FARC promised to deliver - cannot be converted into money to compensate victims.
Some 9 million people have been registered as victims in Colombia's armed conflict, which involves leftist guerrillas, former far-right paramilitaries, and criminal groups associated with drug trafficking.

    The two victims died on Wednesday after officers reportedly used live firearms against a protest blocking the main coastal road through La Libertad, a farming community 600 kilometres (370 miles) north of the capital Lima. 
""We deplore and reject what happened in La Libertad,"" ​​said President Francisco Sagasti on his Twitter account on Thursday. ""We condemn those who incite violence. We will sanction the police officers who violated the ban on the use of firearms.""    
    A hospital report said one, a 16-year-old boy, died from a gunshot injury. The local prosecutor said he had been taking part in the protest but his family said he was simply passing by. The second person's identity and their cause of death has not yet been confirmed. 
    A photograph widely published in local media showed a man identified by the interior ministry as a police officer pointing a pistol. 
    It sparked fresh calls for police reform in the wake of anti-government protests earlier this month in which at least two people were killed and 200 injured amid widespread allegations and reports of police violence.
    Sagasti also called for fresh dialogue between political parties and the three branches of government on reform of Peru's key agricultural sector, saying the new law passed on Tuesday night ""does not satisfy any of the parties involved."" 
    The new law increased the base salaries of farm workers that had been as low as as 39 soles ($11) daily by 30% but workers' groups say the salary and benefits provisions are still not enough. They also claim the law upholds what they say are unjustified benefits enjoyed by powerful agricultural conglomerates.
    ""We continue to be discriminated (with the new law) in terms of benefit payments,"" Juan Antonio Herrera, the national leader of the agricultural workers' union, told Reuters. ""In Peru, even those who sell candy pay taxes, why do large companies that have grown for 20 years continue to enjoy tax exemptions?"" 
Agricultural producers, on the other hand, have criticized the new law saying it would put jobs at risk in the sector. 

    Agro-exports of products, including blueberries, grapes and avocadoes have become the second largest generator of foreign exchange for Peru in recent years after mining.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario's Finance Minister Rod Phillips resigned on Thursday after public outrage over a Caribbean vacation he took earlier this month in violation of his own government's coronavirus travel warnings.
Phillips, a member of the ruling Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Conservative Party in the Canadian province, admitted this week that he travelled to the French island of St. Barts on Dec. 13, after the legislative session ended. 
Federal and provincial leaders across Canada have urged the public to avoid non-essential travel because of the pandemic.
""Today, following my conversation with Rod Phillips, I have accepted his resignation as Ontario's Minister of Finance,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a statement.
""At a time when the people of Ontario have sacrificed so much, today’s resignation is a demonstration that our government takes seriously our obligation to hold ourselves to a higher standard.""
Ford said he has asked Peter Bethlenfalvy to step into the finance minister's role and deliver the government's 2021 budget in addition to his current role as president of the province's Treasury Board.
Phillips served as Ontario's minister of the environment before becoming finance minister as part of a 2019 cabinet reshuffle.
He returned to Canada on Thursday and apologized for his actions.

Ontario, home to Canada's industrial and manufacturing heartland, began a lockdown on Dec. 26 to curb the spread of the virus.

(Reuters) -Fireworks soared into the sky above the Sydney Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) House, but the harbour below was a deserted ghost town, a fittingly creepy send-off for a year that will not be missed.
No light show illuminated Beijing from the top of the TV tower. St Peter's in Rome was nearly empty for vespers. London's Trafalgar Square, Moscow's Red Square, Madrid's Puerta del Sol and New York's Times Square were all barricaded off.
Good riddance, 2020. Hello, 2021.
While some cities would launch fireworks over empty streets, others, such as London and Singapore, called their displays off. Paris, Rome and Istanbul were under curfew. 
New York's countdown ball was set to drop on Broadway. But in place of hundreds of thousands of people jammed shoulder-to-shoulder in Times Square, the audience would be a few dozen pre-selected key workers - including nurses, doctors, a grocery store worker and a pizza delivery man - their families kept six feet (2 metres) apart in socially distanced pens.
Organisers booked Gloria Gaynor to sing her disco classic ""I Will Survive"". (Lyrics: ""You think I'd crumble? You think I'd lay down and die? Oh no, not I!"")
""It's going to be actually, arguably, the most special, the most poignant, the most moving New Year's Eve,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio, who will push the button to start the crystal's ball descent, told reporters. ""In 2021, we're going to show people what it looks like to recover, to come back.""
With more than 1.7 million people dead and 82 million infected around the globe since last New Year's Eve - yet hope emerging that new vaccines can help tame the pandemic - the year ended unlike any other in memory.
Angela Merkel, in her 16th New Year's Eve address as German chancellor, said as much: ""I think I am not exaggerating when I say: never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy. And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope.""
China's President Xi Jinping said the year's extraordinary hardship had allowed people to demonstrate their resilience: ""Only in hard times can courage and perseverance be manifested. Only after polishing can a piece of jade be finer.""
'HELL OF A YEAR'
In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands were expected to gather at landmarks across the city centre to count down to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but not particularly worried.
""Safety is the priority,"" said Wuhan resident Wang Xuemei, 23, a teacher.
In Australia, where Sydney's fireworks annually serve as the world's first big visual display of the new year, gatherings were banned and internal borders shut. Most people were barred from Sydney’s downtown.
""What a hell of a year it's been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state, which includes Sydney. ""Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us."" 
The virus did not stop North Korea from staging its celebration in Pyongyang. State media showed revellers in face masks filling the main square for a concert and fireworks.
But in Madrid's Puerta del Sol, where Spaniards typically count down to midnight by stuffing grapes into their mouths at each clock strike, police put up barriers to keep people out. Jose Angel Balsa, a 61-year-old retiree, said he would spend the evening ""with family, just the four of us at home, holding lots of video calls and hoping for this to end as soon as possible.""
In Britain, under ever tighter restrictions to fight a new, more contagious variant of the virus, official billboards instruct the public to ""see in the New Year safely at home"".
Italy's bars and restaurants were closed, and a curfew imposed for 10 p.m.
The rules prevented the traditional assembly of thousands of Roman Catholic worshippers for New Year's Eve vespers at St Peter's Basilica. Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead the service because of a flare-up of his sciatica, the Vatican said, and a cardinal read the pope's sermon to a small congregation at a secondary altar.
At ""A la Ville de Rodez"", an upmarket delicatessen in Paris, manager Brice Tapon sent customers home with packages of foie gras, truffles and pate for groups of two or three. Rules forbid more than six adults to gather around the dinner table.
One of the customers, Anne Chaplin, said she would ""stuff myself with foie gras, champagne and all this food.""

""And I’ll stay home.""

Mexican authorities seized 1,301 kilograms (2,868 lbs)of the drug in 2020, up from 222 kilograms (489 lbs)last year, Defense Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval told a regular government news conference.
Mexican security officials also raided 175 fentanyl laboratories, almost double the number from last year.
In the United States, fentanyl has helped to fuel a worsening epidemic of overdose deaths, which hit a record 81,000 in the 12 months through May 2020, U.S. official data show.
The seizures coincided with growth in demand, despite government-backed efforts in both the United States and Mexico to disrupt illegal distribution and to treat addicts.
""These drugs are much more profitable for criminal organizations, there's a high addictive capacity for consumers... and they easily lend themselves to illegal trafficking,"" Sandoval said.
Seizures of other drugs also increased. 
Authorities confiscated 27,584 kilograms (60,812 lb)of cocaine, 45% more than last year; 244,112 kilograms (538,175 lbs)of marijuana, up 8%; and 34,555 kilograms (76,180.73 lbs)of methamphetamine, also up 8%.
Earlier this year, the government ordered the armed forces to manage the ports in an effort to curb the entry of materials from Asia used to make synthetic drugs.

There was no report of the execution on Iran's media and judiciary officials could not be reached for comment on Thursday, the start of the weekend in the country.
""This is the fourth confirmed execution of a child offender in Iran in 2020. The execution of child offenders is categorically prohibited under international law and Iran is under the obligation to abide by this prohibition,"" the U.N. human rights office said in a statement.
""U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet strongly condemns the killing of Mohammad Hassan Rezaiee. We are also dismayed that this execution took place despite interventions ...with the Government of Iran on this issue,"" the statement said.
Amnesty International said on Twitter that Rezaiee had been convicted based allegedly on forced confessions and had spent 12 years on death row.
Persons convicted of crimes as juveniles have been executed regularly since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. 
Under Iran's laws, the age for adulthood is determined by puberty, 15 for boys and nine for girls, but a judge is expected to determine the maturity of the defendant in capital punishment cases. 
When there is a discrepancy between domestic law and international legal obligations, Iranian authorities have turned to domestic law.

ADEN (Reuters) -Saudi-led coalition warplanes struck targets in Yemen's Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Thursday in retaliation for attacks in the southern port city of Aden the previous day that took place as officials in a government backed by Riyadh arrived there.
The coalition accused the Houthi movement, which it has been fighting for six years, of staging the attack on Aden's airport and a second one on the presidential palace.
Thursday's coalition air strikes hit Sanaa airport and several other sites in and around the city, residents said. Loud blasts were heard and warplanes flew overhead for several hours, they said.
Houthi-run Masirah television said the planes hit at least 15 locations in different districts in the capital. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Coalition air strikes have killed thousands, including many civilians, over the course of the war.
But they have been less frequent in recent years as the conflict has reached a stalemate, with the Iran-aligned Houthis controlling most population centers and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's internationally recognised government - supported by Riyadh and Western powers - basing itself in Aden.
The main war has been eclipsed by a power-struggle between Hadi's government and southern separatists in Aden. Saudi Arabia has been trying to unite them to focus on fighting the Houthis.
STEEL BOLTS
At least 22 people were killed and dozens more wounded in Wednesday's attack on Aden airport, which took place just as members of Hadi's new cabinet arrived from Saudi Arabia. A second attack was made on the Maasheq palace, where they had been taken to safety.
A coalition statement said the alliance had downed an explosive-laden Houthi drone that was targeting the palace. 
""The desperate, terrorist attack to target Maasheq palace confirms the responsibility of the terrorist, Iran-backed Houthi militia of the attack in Aden International Airport,"" the statement said. 
There was no immediate reaction from the Houthis, who had earlier denied responsibility for the airport attack.
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid group said 19 people were treated for wounds at its hospital in Aden.
""The missile hit the terminal's gate and we were only meters away...We pulled out people screaming, then I realised that I was wounded myself,"" Nasser Mubarak, one of the survivors said.
Mubarak lied on a bed in MSF's hospital with others wounded mostly by shrapnel. The medical staff showed steel bolts that were removed from some of the victims.
Aden has been mired in violence because of the rift between the separatists and Hadi's government, which has been based there after being driven from Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014.
The Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for south Yemen, declared self-rule in Aden in April, triggering clashes with Hadi's forces and complicating United Nations efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire in the overall conflict.
The new cabinet unites the STC with Hadi in an effort to fulfil the Saudi aim of ending the feud. Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik said all members of the cabinet were ""fine"" and will remain in Aden despite the attack. 
However, government officials were among the casualties in the Aden airport attack. 
Three International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) staff members were also killed, the organisation said.
Sara al-Zawqari, ICRC spokeswoman for the Near and Middle East, said a dozen staff members were heading from Sanaa to Djibouti and transiting for a short period in Aden airport when the attack took place. 
""We’re still in shock and trying to process everything that has happened since yesterday,"" Zawqari said.

CARACAS (Reuters) - With her arms full of $11.87 worth of bananas, red peppers and onions, an elderly woman at a produce stand in western Caracas approaches vendor Walquiria Garcia and offers to pay with a $10 or $20 bill.
A flustered Garcia disappears into a closet, re-emerges, takes the $10 note and scribbles, ""owes $1.87"" on the back of an old crumpled receipt that the customer is to bring on her next shopping trip.
Since a sudden liberalization of Venezuela's economy at the end of 2018, routine purchases increasingly have been made in U.S. dollars rather than the South American country's virtually worthless bolivar currency.
But a chronic shortage of denominations of less than $20 has forced businesses to come up with improvised workarounds ranging from makeshift vouchers and customer IOUs to offers of additional products in place of change.
Within several hours of opening for business, Garcia's produce stand had run out of small bills. When the next customer arrived with a $20 bill, the vendor laughed nervously. 
""With each client it is different and you have to decide in the moment with the customer how to resolve the situation,"" Garcia said. ""I try to save the small bills for change, but there are just not enough $1 or $5 dollar bills."" 
President Nicolas Maduro, who for years forbade the use of dollars in local transactions, relaxed currency controls after a decline in oil revenues and an intensification of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela.
The socialist president now embraces the use of dollars, calling it an ""escape valve, a form of resistance,"" that can help the country weather a deep-rooted economic crisis. 
But the mechanics of the informal and spontaneous transition has left Venezuelans scrambling.
SAVING THEIR DOLLARS
Around $2 billion of cash in circulation is mostly in denominations of $20, $50 and $100 bills, according to local consultancy Ecoanalitica, as the U.S. sanctions give the government little access to the international financial system.
Dollar use has accelerated amid inflation which the opposition-run congress estimates at above 4,000% per year.
Many people still get paid in the local bolivar currency, but with the monthly minimum wage equivalent to around $1 per month, most salaried workers take up side jobs that are often paid in greenbacks, such as baking cakes or fixing cars.
The business of buying and selling dollars has also flourished, and low-denomination bills are worth more. 
Maria Briceno, a cigarette street vendor in Maracaibo, the second-largest city in Venezuela, sells any $1 and $5 dollar bills she earns to other businesses. 
""I collect the $1 dollar bills and go to the market, and for $17 of $1 notes, they give me a $20 dollar bill,"" Briceno said. 
In Caracas, the country's capital, one ceramics store has taken to passing out mosaics with a number equivalent to the change owed as a credit for subsequent purchases.
""Most people come prepared with (mobile payment platform) Zelle, because there is really little change in U.S. dollars,"" said the ceramics store owner, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It is a challenge, but it is better if they pay in dollars and not in bolivars, which lose value.""
While many customers use apps such as Zelle, those services often require a bank account in the United States, forcing people to turn to friends, relatives, or others willing to loan their accounts.
Vendors sometimes lose customers if there is no change, while others allow most of a purchase to be paid in dollars, with the remainder in bolivars. 

""I try to save my dollars,"" said Isabela, a woman in Caracas who declined to give her last name. ""Because the worst is when I cannot buy gasoline after waiting for hours because they only accept dollars in cash, and there is no change.""

595,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>","Bewildered and angry, Northern Ireland unionists fret over place in UK","By Natalie Thomas and Amanda Ferguson
LARNE, Northern Ireland (Reuters) - As Northern Ireland's unionists prepare to celebrate 100 years since the state's creation cemented their place in the United Kingdom, post-Brexit trade barriers are triggering their deepest fears: being cut off from Britain and pushed towards a united Ireland.
The British-run region remains deeply divided along sectarian lines, with Catholic nationalists aspiring to unification with Ireland while Protestant unionists seek to retain the status quo.
Nearly 23 years after a 1998 peace deal ended three decades of confrontation between the Irish Republican Army, pro-British ""loyalist"" paramilitaries and the British military, it is customs declarations and phytosanitary certifications that are now the focus of unionist angst.
    From Friday, many British goods entering the smallest of the United Kingdom's four nations will require customs checks and paperwork under Britain's withdrawal deal with the European Union - which keeps Northern Ireland in the UK's customs territory but also still aligned with the EU's single market for goods.
    Many unionists are fiercely opposed to a compromise championed by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the Irish government that will keep trade across the 500-km (300-mile) open land border with EU-member Ireland frictionless by effectively placing a customs border down the Irish Sea.
""I think it's a disgrace,"" Mervyn Gibson, grand secretary of the influential Protestant Orange Order organisation, told Reuters outside his Belfast home, where Britain's Union Flag flies above the doorway.
""We should be treated equally whether we live in Devon or Cornwall (in England) or Antrim or Down (in Northern Ireland). We've been let down and indeed betrayed by the prime minister who promised us there would be no border down the Irish Sea.""
The vast majority of the 30,000-member Orange Order - who hold large and sometimes divisive marches each year to celebrate centuries-old military victories - are bewildered and angry that Brexit has ""made Northern Ireland a place apart"", Gibson said.
Calls for Irish unity have increased since the 2016 Brexit referendum, when Northern Ireland voted 56%-44% to remain in the EU, though most opinion polls suggest the prospect remains distant for now.
Under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the British government can call a ""border poll"" if it appears likely a majority of those voting would seek to form part of a united Ireland. Unionist politicians remain dismissive.
""I'm 50 this year and ever since I was a child I was told the united Ireland is coming,"" Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster told Reuters on Wednesday. 
""It never has come because, at the heels of the hunt, people realise that they are much better off in the United Kingdom than they are within the Republic of Ireland or within a European superstate.""
PLACE IN THE UNION
Foster's Democratic Unionist Party says it will lobby the British government hard to limit post-Brexit barriers, fearing a reorientation of parts of the economy towards the Irish Republic could undermine Northern Ireland's place in the union.
With border control posts due to be erected next year, the overwhelmingly Protestant port town of Larne could be one of the first places where the psychological impact of Northern Ireland being treated differently to the rest of the UK is felt.
Unionists there celebrate their identity by painting road edgings in the red, white and blue of the British flag or erecting pro-British murals. An 8-metre steel crown celebrating Queen Elizabeth's diamond jubilee sits on a roundabout in the town.
Local unionists are concerned but mainly bemused by it all, says David Hume, a historian and former member of Northern Ireland's Flags and Culture Commission, a body set up after the curtailing of a century-old tradition of flying the British flag over Belfast City Hall in 2012 led to weeks of rioting.
""You can't see the Irish Sea border, it's all happening on paper. If it starts to hit them in their pockets, that's the sort of thing that will make them very annoyed and quite truculent,"" said Hume. 
""Unionists will be very suspicious as to the longer term.""
But where unionists are unsure of what Brexit will mean in practice, nationalist politicians sense an opportunity to press their case that Irish unity is the logical destination.
Northern Ireland's largest nationalist party Sinn Fein, now also the joint largest in the Irish parliament, thinks a vote on its central goal can be held and won within a decade.
""More and more people are asking themselves the question, what is my identity outside the European Union, what has Brexit done to my identify and there are people saying my identity as a European can be protected in a united Ireland,"" John O'Dowd, a senior Sinn Fein lawmaker in the Northern Irish Assembly, said.

596,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>","World risks 'moral catastrophe' if COVID shots delayed in Africa, its CDC chief says","NAIROBI (Reuters) - The world risks a ""moral catastrophe"" if COVID-19 vaccinations are delayed in Africa while wealthier regions inoculate their entire populations, the head of the continent's disease control body said on Thursday.
The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hopes significant vaccination campaigns on the continent will begin in April, its head, John Nkengasong, told reporters.
""That's a long way to go given that this virus transmits very quickly,"" he said, adding that in Africa, ""the second wave is here with a vengeance"".
Cases of the new coronavirus increased by nearly 19% since last week and deaths increased by 26%, according to Africa CDC data. Africa has recorded 2.7 million coronavirus infections and 64,000 deaths as of Thursday, it says. 
South Africa, where a new variant of the virus has been detected, recorded 82,000 cases in the past week, he said.
""We cannot delay, we need those vaccines and need them now,"" Nkengasong said.
The major blockers to vaccinations beginning in Africa are global availability of doses and financing, he said.
Wealthy nations have acquired vaccines in excess of what they need, he said.
""We don't have to get into a moral crisis, where these things are stocked in the developed world and we in Africa are struggling to have,"" Nkengasong said. 
The African Union is in talks with the European Union, Canada, and pharmaceutical companies to secure doses, he said, to secure vaccines in addition to what Africa has been promised by the World Health Organization’s COVAX programme. COVAX is a global scheme to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries.
""This would easily become a moral catastrophe if we should not come together as one to address going forward as early as possible in 2021 and meet Africa at its point of need.""
Approval processes for various vaccines will likely be fast-tracked through a central African Union process, he said.
A handful of nations on the continent are further along.
Morocco said earlier this month it plans to roll out China's Sinopharm vaccine within weeks as soon as its Phase 3 trials are over, while Egypt received its first shipment of Sinopharm vaccines on Dec.11. 
South Africa expects to get the COVAX vaccine by the second quarter of 2021, President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Monday. The COVAX alliance said on Dec. 18 its first deliveries were due in early 2021, without giving a specific date.

African governments should learn the lesson that local manufacturing of vaccines and strong testing capacities are critical, Nkengasong said, noting that the continent faced the same scenario of a scramble for vaccines - and Western nations far ahead - more than a decade ago during the H1N1 swine flu outbreak.

It was the first time in years that Francis, who turned 84 this month, has had to skip a papal event for health reasons.
A year-end vespers service that the pope was to lead on Thursday afternoon will be led by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, and the Friday Mass will be said by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State.
The Vatican said the pope would lead his noon prayer on Friday as scheduled.
The pope suffers from sciatica, a condition that causes pain that radiates from the lower back along the sciatic nerve to the lower part of the body. 

He can sometimes be seen walking with difficulty because of the pain and receives regular physical therapy because of the condition.

The charity said in a statement on Wednesday that the 52-year-old worker was killed in Hitsats refugee camp. He had worked for the charity for 10 years and leaves a wife and seven children.
It did not name him or give any details of the killing.
""We confirm with great sadness that our colleague was murdered during the recent conflict while on duty for ZOA,"" Edwin Visser, ZOA's Chief Programme Officer, said in the statement, without giving the victim's nationality.
Redwan Hussein, spokesman for the government's emergency task force on Tigray, did not immediately take a call from Reuters or respond to WhatsApp message for comment on the killing.
Four Ethiopian aid workers employed by two separate foreign organizations were killed in Hitsats in November, near the border with Eritrea. 
War broke out in Tigray on Nov. 4 after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed accused forces of the region's deposed ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front, of attacking the federal military's Northern Command stationed in the area.

The conflict is believed to have killed thousands and displaced around 950,000 people. Access to the region remains tightly controlled by the government and telecommunications in many places remain down.

Stanley Johnson, a former member of the European Parliament who voted Remain in Britain's 2016 referendum, told RTL radio he wanted to become a French citizen because of strong family links to France.
""If I understand it correctly, I am French. My mother was born in France, her mother was totally French as was her grandfather. So for me it is about reclaiming what I already have. And that makes me very happy,"" said the 80-year-old Johnson, who was speaking in French.
""I will always be a European, that's for sure. One cannot tell the British people: you are not Europeans. Having a tie with the European Union is important,"" he added.
His son Boris was the public face of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum and says Britain can ""prosper mightily"" as a fully sovereign nation outside what he sees as an overly bureaucratic EU.
But on Wednesday the prime minister sounded a more concilatory note as parliament approved a new trade deal with the EU, saying: ""This is not the end of Britain as a European country. We are in many ways the quintessential European civilisation... and we will continue to be that.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel is juggling supplies and pace in its COVID-19 vaccination drive in the hope of meeting a late-January goal of full protection for its most vulnerable people, officials said on Thursday.
Having begun the vaccinations on Dec. 19, Israel is now administering more than 150,000 doses a day. Top priority are the quarter of its 9 million population who are over 60, suffer from risky health problems or are medical workers.
Some other lucky citizens have managed to get vaccinated, witnesses and officials at Israel's main health providers say - often as clinic ""walk-ins"" who were given surplus injections which would otherwise have had to be thrown away at the end of the day.
But the Health Ministry is husbanding supplies closely. That means pushing back against public expectations that the campaign might soon be opened up to all adults or the at-risk criteria expanded to include groups like teachers.
Early January will see an ""abeyance"" of about two weeks in the administering of first doses, ministry director-general Hezi Levy said, to ensure that those who already got them get their scheduled follow-up booster injections.
""We are doing everything in our power to bring forward supplies"" of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc vaccines that might allow for broadening out the campaign by February, he told Kan radio, saying the age threshold could then be lowered to 50.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will in February be the first country to ""emerge"" from the health crisis, thanks to the vaccines, adding that it would attain sufficient doses for all other groups within weeks.
How this might happen given global scarcity was not clear.
One Health Ministry official, Yaron Niv, said in a separate Kan interview that each dose cost the country $62.
It was not clear to what extent the disparity with the European Union agreement to pay 15.50 euros per dose for the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, might be due to secondary outlay in Israel.
Otherwise, Israel is emphasising thrift. 
Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told reporters an Israeli firm had safely subdivided the frozen Pfizer vaccine trays so that smaller batches can be thawed and deployed.

Some health providers have been extracting six, rather than the advertised five, usable doses from each Pfizer vial, an official said.

In Beijing, the capital of the world's most-populous country, an annual New Year light show at the China Central Television Tower scheduled for Thursday through Sunday has been called off.
The Beijing Yonghe Lama Temple, a tourist site, has also cut the number of visitors allowed by half since Thursday. Many Chinese tourists are staying home or taking shorter domestic trips.
The coronavirus emerged a year ago in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and has since spread globally, infecting more than 82 million people and killing more than 1.7 million.
In Wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have originated, thousands are expected to gather at several popular landmarks across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but weren't particularly worried.
""Safety is the priority,"" said Wuhan resident Wang Xuemei, 23, a teacher.
""It's fine because these measures aren't enforced very strictly,"" added her friend and colleague Wang Anyu. ""You can still go out.""
Australia, whose fireworks over the Sydney Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) House are a visual staple of the season, has in many places restricted movement, gatherings and even internal borders. Most people are banned from coming to Sydney’s downtown on Thursday night.
""What a hell of a year it's been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of New South Wales state, where Sydney is located. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us."" 
Weather and COVID-19 are putting a damper on celebrations in Japan, which is calling off events and reducing public services.
Japan's Imperial Household Agency has cancelled an annual New Year's event set for Jan. 2, at which Emperor Naruhito and other imperial family members were to greet well-wishers, because of the pandemic.
    Shrines have asked people to stagger visits on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. East Japan Railway Company and Tokyo Metro are cancelling extra train services in the Tokyo metropolitan areas from late on Dec. 31 to Jan. 1. Snow, meanwhile, has blanketed parts of the country, leading to about 140 cancelled flights and other disruptions.
In Singapore's downtown Marina Bay, there will be no fireworks to ring in the New Year for the first time since the annual tradition began in 2005. Instead, fireworks will be set off at different locations across the Southeast Asian citystate.
The globally famous band BTS is holding an online concert on Thursday night in South Korea, while observers elsewhere in the country are watching to see whether their neighbours to the north hold their annual New Year fireworks display in Pyongyang.
Elsewhere in South Korea, the government has shut down the beaches in Gangueng, on the country's east coast, where people traditionally go to watch the first sunrise of the New Year. Seoul's Bosingak bell-ringing ceremony was cancelled for the first time since 1953, but can be viewed ""virtually"" on the city's website.
Many cities on the self-ruled island of Taiwan are cancelling public attendance at events like fireworks displays, and have asked people to watch online or on television.
But the Taipei city government is allowing in-person attendance to its New Year's events, as well as broadcasting them live - including fireworks set off from the outside of Taipei 101, once the world's tallest building.
It has capped attendance at the main viewing spot at 40,000, half of the 80,000 it had originally planned, with attendees required to register their personal details and wear masks.
New Year celebrations in India will most likely be muted as several states and major cities have imposed night curfews, restricted large gatherings and shut down pubs and restaurants.
New Delhi said it would not allow more than five people to assemble at public places, while financial capital Mumbai and tech capital Bengaluru limited gatherings to four.
However, there were no restrictions in Goa, a small state along India's western coast known for its grand beach parties during Christmas and New Year. Media have reported people arriving in Goa in droves during the past week.
Vietnam, which has had just 1,456 infections and 35 deaths from the coronavirus disease, decided against additional measures for the New Year. The wearing of masks in public places remains compulsory, but otherwise firework displays and parties in major cities are due to go ahead without restrictions on the number of attendees.

Nearby Thailand has also refrained from extra restrictions but authorities have urged people not to travel and to gather in only small groups.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican and the Australian Catholic Church have both denied knowledge of transfers worth US$1.8 billion which Australia's financial watchdog says have been sent from Rome to Australia in the past seven years.
""That amount of money and that number of transfers did not leave the Vatican City,"" a senior Vatican official with knowledge of the city-state's finances said on Wednesday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Vatican would be seeking details from Australian authorities on the specific origin and destination of the money.
""It's not our money because we don't have that kind of money,"" he said. ""I am absolutely stunned.""
The figures were made public in December by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) in response to a parliamentary question by Australian Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, and first reported by the newspaper The Australian.
They involved about 47,000 separate transfers, according to AUSTRAC.
Archbishop Mark Coleridge of Brisbane told Reuters the Australian Church was not aware of any such transfers: ""I can assure you that no diocese or other Church entity saw any of the money.""
Fierravanti-Wells had asked what funds had been transferred to Australia ""from the Vatican or any of its entities, or individuals associated with the Vatican or Vatican entities"" since 2014.
The official in Rome said the Vatican had around 100 legal entities, including hospitals and the like, ""but they don't have that kind of money"".
AUSTRAC said the transfers ranged from yearly totals of A$71.6 million (US$55.2 million) in 2014 to A$581.3 million (US$448.0) million in 2017.
In an email to Reuters on Dec. 24, AUSTRAC said it had no further comment. On Thursday, in a further email, it said it could not comment on the specifics of this story before next week. 
""SCIENCE FICTION""
Two Vatican offices handle money transfers - its bank, commonly known as the IOR, and APSA, the Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See.
The Vatican official said APSA had sent less than 800,000 euros (US$980,000) to Australia since 2014, mostly for payment of salaries and expenses for the Vatican embassy, as well as pensions and travel costs.
Similarly, the money sent to Australia by the IOR for its clients, typically members of religious orders, was nowhere near the amounts listed by AUSTRAC, he said.
""The Holy See's entire yearly budget is about 330 million euros. The (AUSTRAC) figures are about four times that,"" the official said. ""It seems like science fiction.""
He said the Vatican wanted to find out if others had illegally used its name or that of a related entity to move money through banks in other countries.
Archbishop Coleridge said the funds had not been used for financial settlements with victims of sexual abuse or for legal costs related to Cardinal George Pell.
""Given the speculation that is rife, there is a need for clarification,"" he said.
Pell worked in the Vatican as its treasurer from 2014 to 2017, when he returned to his native Australia to face charges of historical sexual abuse.

He spent 404 days in jail before his conviction was overturned last April, and he is currently in Rome. He did not respond to a request for comment. ($1 = 1.2975 Australian dollars) ($1 = 0.8137 euros)

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian rescuers deployed drones and dogs to negotiate unstable clay soil in a search for 10 people still missing on Thursday after a landslide in southern Norway swept away more than a dozen buildings the previous day.
Another 10 people were injured, one critically, after the landslide in the residential area in the Gjerdrum municipality, about 30 km (19 miles) north of the capital, Oslo.
(Graphic: Location of landslide in Southern Norway - https://graphics.reuters.com/NORWAY-LANDSLIDE/qmyvmqyeavr/chart.png)
Conditions remained challenging, with the clay ground still too unstable for emergency workers to walk on and temperatures registering -1 Celsius (30F) at 0600 GMT. 
The edges of the crater continued to break away, authorities said, asking people not to approach the area. Some 1,000 people have so far been evacuated.
""We are still searching for survivors,"" the head of the police operation at the site, Roger Pettersen, told reporters, adding that both children and adults were missing.
During the night, police used drones with heat-seeking equipment to search for survivors in the debris. Helicopters have tried lowering military and police with search-and-rescue dogs on some structures believed stable enough to stand on. 
A Dalmatian dog was rescued during the night.
On Thursday, Pettersen asked locals not to send up fireworks to celebrate New Year's Eve so as to not interfere with the helicopters and drones. 
Separately, questions were being asked about why construction was allowed in the area. 
Broadcaster TV2 said a 2005 geological survey for municipal authorities labelled the area at high risk of landslides. But new homes were built three years after the report was published.
In a rare public statement, Norway's King Harald said the landslide had left a deep impression.

""My thoughts are with all those who are affected, injured or have lost their homes, and those who now live in fear and uncertainty of the full extent of the catastrophe,"" the 83-year-old monarch said in a statement released by the royal palace.

The daughter of Gulshan Abbas told a briefing organized with the bipartisan U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) that the family had recently learned her mother received the sentence in March last year on terrorism-related charges after disappearing in September 2018.
In Beijing on Thursday, a foreign ministry spokesman said Abbas was sentenced for the crimes of joining a terrorist organization, helping terrorist activities, and ""assembling a crowd to disrupt social order"".
""We urge certain politicians in the United States to respect facts and stop fabricating lies and smearing China,"" the spokesman, Wang Wenbin, told a news conference.
The daughter, Ziba Murat, called the charges ""preposterous."" Gulshan's sister, Rushan Abbas, said they stemmed from activism by her and her brother Rishat Abbas, both of whom are based in the United States.
""We have committed to working to defend our people's rights and advocate for justice, and now our sister is denied justice as a punishment,"" Rushan said.
In a tweet, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, Robert Destro, said Gulshan Abbas must be released.
""Her forcible disappearance, detainment and harsh sentencing by the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) is evidence of a family suffering the consequences of speaking out against a government that has no respect for human rights,"" he said.
Ziba Murat said she could not reveal the source of the information on the sentencing to protect their identity. ""We only learned that she is sentenced to 20 years, and we're trying to get more information.""
""My mom is a medical professional, non-political, kind person who has spent her life helping people,"" she said, adding that her mother was in fragile health and suffered from multiple conditions, including high blood pressure.
The CECC chairman, Democratic Representative James McGovern, called the punishment of an innocent family member in what he said was an attempt to silence free expression ""morally reprehensible."" 
He said it was just part of a ""mass persecution"" of Uighurs in China that has involved detention of as many as 1.8. million in internment camps, forced labor and other abuses.
U.N. experts and advocates say at least a million ethnic Uighurs have been detained at some point in camps in China's Xinjiang region.

China calls the heavily guarded centers educational and vocational institutes, and says all those who attended have ""graduated"" and gone home. Access to the camps is restricted and it is not possible to independently verify whether all have closed.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Alarmed that a political crisis in Nepal could endanger China's strategic interests and Belt and Road projects, a Chinese Communist Party emissary has held days of talks to try to stop the Himalayan country's ruling communist party from tearing itself apart.
The crisis erupted on Dec. 20 when Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, decided he could no longer work with rival factions within his Nepal Communist Party (NCP), which was formed in 2018 to unite the Marxist-Leninist and main Maoist parties following their success in elections in late 2017.
With two years of his term to run, Oli dissolved parliament and called for fresh elections in a move that foreign diplomats say caught China by surprise and plunged the impoverished nation of 30 million people into uncertainty.
Seven ministers quit Oli's government, and anger over the descent into political infighting at a time when the economy is reeling from the coronavirus sparked protests at which effigies of the prime minister were burnt.
Within days, Beijing dispatched to Kathmandu Guo Yezhou, a vice-minister in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) International Liaison Department, which manages relationships with foreign political parties of all hues, both in power and opposition.
""It is evident that China is angered by Oli's abrupt move amid a pandemic ... they are clearly concerned about the massive investments they have pledged,"" said a senior European diplomat.
""They are shocked as to how Oli could make a bold political move without prior consultations,"" said the diplomat, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
Oli has recommended an election be held in two phases in April and May, but what happens next could be in the lap of the Supreme Court, as his opponents have challenged the dissolution of parliament as unconstitutional. A hearing will resume in January. 
SPEAKING TO ALL SIDES
Guo has held separate meetings with Oli, and rivals in the communist party to get their sides of the story, as well as leaders of the main opposition party and other politicians.
Commenting on the delegation's visit to Kathmandu, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China hoped ""all the various parties in Nepal can put national interest and the overall situation first, and proceed from there, while properly handling internal differences and working towards political stability and the country's development.""
Madhav Kumar Nepal, a former prime minister and one of the main critics of Oli within the Nepal Communist Party (NCP), was high on Guo's dance card, and Ram Karki, the NCP's deputy chief of the foreign affairs attended their meeting.
""They want to listen more than they speak. They wanted to know the reason leading to the split in the party,"" Karki said of the Chinese delegation.
""China always wants stability in Nepal. Since the CCP has a fraternal relationship with the NCP, they are concerned about the present situation. Certainly, they tried to know whether there is any possibility of uniting the party,"" Karki said. 
Guo also held talks with the opposition Nepali Congress Party leader and former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba.
""Irrespective of any change in Nepal, China wants to continue its relationship with all political parties and its economic cooperation including the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network,” Dinesh Bhattarai, a Deuba aide present at the meeting, told Reuters.
The network - involving the construction of ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications - was agreed during a visit by China's President Xi Jinping to Nepal in October 2019. And the multi-billion dollar investment in infrastructure could be a godsend for Nepal's ailing economy.
INFLUENCE ON DISPLAY
Still, some foreign diplomats in Kathmandu viewed Guo's mission as a brazen demonstration of China's growing influence over Nepal's internal affairs.
""Why would a country rush a delegation to a neighbouring nation amid a pandemic? It's rather obvious they control the internal politics of Nepal as they want to expand investments in near future,"" a senior Western diplomat said.
An Asian diplomat struck a similar note.
""They have been buying land and investing in large-scale infrastructure projects by keeping a tight control on the ruling party and the opposition,"" said the Asian diplomat. 
""A lot is at stake for Beijing,"" he said.
Sandwiched between India and China, Nepal's tilt into China's orbit is a growing concern for India. 
Oli has raised border disputes between Nepal and India at a time when India is already dealing with the worst tensions in decades along sections of its long frontier with China in the Himalayas.
""India has its own history of interference in Nepal but has taken a back seat this time, leaving China more exposed to a growing feeling of resentment among Nepalis,"" said Constantino Xavier, an analyst at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress, an independent think thank in New Delhi.
Feyzi Ismail, a researcher at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, suspected China could be disappointed if it maintains backing for Oli in the hope of restoring political stability.

""Protests against Oli's authoritarianism, his clamping down on civil liberties are likely to intensify,"" said Ismail.

In recent years, hundreds of Taiwanese suspected of telecom fraud have been deported to China, sometimes forcibly, from countries including Kenya, Cambodia and Armenia, according to the Taiwan government.
China has defended the deportations, saying they were suspected of defrauding Chinese people and so should be tried in Chinese courts.
In the latest judgement, a Beijing court ruled that the suspects had defrauded people living in China by calling them from their base in Spain and claiming to be Chinese law enforcement officials, the Beijing News said.
A total of 14 victims were defrauded out of more than 6.17 million yuan ($941,985), it said.
China claims democratically and separately governed Taiwan as its own territory, with no right to be treated as a country.
The deportations have arisen from the ""one-China"" policy of most countries under which they maintain formal relations only with the People's Republic of China rather than Taiwan, with governments deciding to send them to China for trial.
Taiwan has complained about a lack of due process and expressed concern about mistreatment of its people in Chinese jails.
Chinese authorities have sought to contain an explosion of telecom crime it says has led to huge financial losses, with callers often impersonating officials or authority figures and preying on the elderly, students or the unemployed.
The fraud has spread overseas, with Chinese speakers recruited in Taiwan setting up operations in East Africa or Southeast Asia.

It said the counter-terror squad police carried out simultaneous raids on 34 addresses in 14 districts of the city after receiving intelligence about possible militant attacks over the New Year period.
Prosecutors in the capital Ankara ordered the arrest of a further 15 suspects in another Islamic State-related investigation, Anadolu also said.
Turkey has imposed a lockdown from 9 p.m. on Dec. 31 to 5 a.m. on Jan. 4 as part of measures to curb the spread of coronavirus.
Police have rounded up alleged jihadist militants in late December in the last two years, since New Year's Day in 2017 when a gunman killed 39 people in an Istanbul nightclub in an attack claimed by the militant group.

Taiwan has kept the pandemic well under control thanks to early and effective prevention measures, including quarantines for every arrival from abroad, with 800 confirmed cases, including seven deaths, almost all imported.
But the government been unnerved by its first domestic transmission since April, confirmed this month, and first case of the British variant, announced on Wednesday. Both people are in isolation in hospital.
The cities of Kaohsiung, Tainan, Taichung, Taoyuan, Chiayi and Keelung all said late on Wednesday they would cancel public attendance at events like fireworks displays, and have asked people to watch at home online and on television.
However, the Taipei city government said on Thursday people could still watch events live, the highlight of which is fireworks set off from the outside of Taipei 101, once briefly the world's tallest building.
But it has capped attendance at the main viewing spot next to the city government at 40,000, half of the 80,000 it had originally planned, with attendees having to register their personal details and wear masks.
The traditional New Year's Day flag raising ceremony at the presidential office would also be restricted to officials and invited guests owing ""to the latest pandemic situation"", it said.
Unusually low temperatures across subtropical Taiwan would probably have kept most people inside in any case, with snow reported on high mountain passes.

Lows of 6 degrees Celsius (42.8 Fahrenheit) have been forecast for Taipei on New Year's Eve.

China, which claims democratically run Taiwan as its own territory, has been angered by stepped-up U.S. support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait, further souring Beijing-Washington relations.
The U.S. Navy said the guided missile destroyers USS John S. McCain and USS Curtis Wilbur had ""conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit Dec. 31 in accordance with international law"".
""The ships' transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.""
This is the 13th sailing through the strait by the U.S. Navy this year.
China's Defence Ministry denounced the trip as ""provocation"" and ""a show of force"", adding Chinese ships and aircraft trailed the U.S. ships.
The passage of the ships sent the wrong message to supporters of Taiwan independence and are a serious threat to peace and stability, it added.
""The Chinese People's Liberation Army maintains a high level of alert at all times, responds to all threats and provocations at all times, and resolutely defends national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" the ministry said.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the ships had sailed in a northerly direction through the strait on what it termed an ""ordinary mission"". Taiwan's armed forces monitored the sailing and the situation is ""as normal"", it added.
China's military said it had tailed the last U.S. warship to pass through the Taiwan Strait on Dec. 19, and denounced the mission. 
The day after that trip, Taiwan's navy and air force deployed as a Chinese aircraft carrier group led by the country's newest carrier, the Shandong, sailed through the Taiwan Strait.
China said the group was on its way to routine drills in the disputed South China Sea.

Kolomoisky, one of the most prominent tycoons in Ukraine and regarded as a key political backer of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had denied the previous allegations. Bruce Marks, a U.S. lawyer who represents Kolomoisky, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the latest complaint.
Representatives for the other businessman, Gennadiy Boholiubov, could not be immediately reached for comment. He previously has not commented on the matter. 
In a statement, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged the two men had used misappropriated funds from Ukraine-based PrivatBank to buy commercial real estate in Ohio and that the U.S. was seeing its forfeiture. 
U.S. prosecutors said that between 2008 and 2016, Kolomoisky and Boholiubov obtained fraudulent loans and lines of credit, some of whose proceeds they laundered through shell company accounts at PrivatBank's Cyprus office before transferring the money to the United States.

Altogether, the properties in the three U.S. states are worth more than $60 million, the Justice Department said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Inside the shrine of Chao Mae Thap Thim in Bangkok, a figurine of the sea goddess Mazu sits in the centre of a gold-framed altar of deities in a room festooned with lanterns and Chinese scriptures.
Outside, a tall, newly erected metal fence stands between the goddess and a vast construction site, where a dozen trucks and excavators are waiting to move in and demolish the historic shrine once at the heart of the Thai capital's Chinese migrant community.
The stone lions that protect the shrine may not hold out much longer. Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, which owns the land, plans to construct two residential buildings comprising 1,758 units, despite protests from its own students. 
""Sooner or later they will cut the water supply and electricity,"" said Penprapa Ployseesuay, the shrine's caretaker for 25 years.
Chao Mae Thap Thim is a rare holdout against a wave of gentrification across one of Asia's most vibrant capitals, where change is being thrust upon a melting pot of communities that have for generations resisted it. 
Penprapa lives with her mother and two sons in a small house beside the shrine and opens it to anyone wishing to pay respects to the goddess, or seek her guidance or blessings.
Construction has interfered with the shrine's drainage system, sometimes flooding it, and Penprapa fears the height of the surrounding fence means few people know it is still there. 
""I feel very sad. They don't see the importance and value of this place that deserves to be preserved,"" she said of the university. 
""They chose not to make the two worlds live together,"" she added. ""They only want us to get out.""
A committee is fighting the eviction and has sought a court injunction against it.
OLD AND NEW
The university, in a response to Reuters' questions, said it would build a new shrine at a space it has prepared at its Centenary Park ""where its grace and auspiciousness will remain with the community"".
Penprapa said a new site could not replicate the original charm of the century-old shrine, which moved to its current location 53 years ago after a fire.
""We will resist as long as we can,"" she said. ""I know it won't be easy.""
The coexistence of old and new is central to Bangkok's character, but its skyscrapers and condominium clusters are eclipsing its shabbier side. A notable example is the $1.79 billion Iconsiam, a mega-mall of entertainment, retail and panoramic riverside views where stilted houses and blackened buildings once stood. 
""I'm excited about the new vibe,"" said Surin Sae-Ton, 50, who runs a tea shop across the river from Iconsiam. ""But I don't know how the community will be in future with this new prosperity.""
Lee Kwang Tao, 62, who owns a Chinese medicine shop, also welcomed the prospect of modernisation.
""This area used to have very good business, but in recent years it has gone down,"" he said. ""That's why people in this neighbourhood are selling their property.""
Conservation advocates say the mixed-up identity that makes Bangkok so popular is being lost, and that the city must find solutions to carefully manage the changes. 

""This is the speed that nobody can control, it is really unstoppable,"" said Niramon Serisakul, director of the Urban Designer and Development Center at Chulalongkorn University. ""Sometime people forget about other important things, like how to preserve the heritage.""

616,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 06:15PM ET</span>","Pandemic made my last year in office the hardest, says emotional Merkel","By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - Angela Merkel said in her last New Year's address to the nation as German chancellor that 2020 was by far the most difficult of her 15-year leadership, yet the start of vaccinations against COVID-19 made 2021 a year of hope.
In a rare show of emotion, Merkel, who steered Germany and the European Union through the 2008 financial crisis, the Greek debt crisis a year later and the migrant crisis five years ago, condemned a protest movement opposed to lockdowns and said she would get vaccinated when the shot is widely available.
""Let me tell you something personal in conclusion: in nine months a parliamentary election will take place and I won't be running again,"" said Merkel, 66. ""Today is therefore in all likelihood the last time I am able to deliver a New Year's address to you.""
She added: ""I think I am not exaggerating when I say: never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy and never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope.""
Her message will resonate with most people in a country struggling with a rise in coronavirus infections and deaths and where a majority support lockdown measures and vaccination as the best weapons against the virus.
Praise for Merkel, a trained physicist whose management of the pandemic has been guided by scientific advice, for having tamed the first wave has however turned to criticism of her perceived failure to tackle the second.
Europe's biggest economy holds an election in September and Merkel, whose conservatives are expected to win most seats in parliament, will most likely hand over the baton to one of three men vying to lead her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.
""I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona or who are having to fight against the repercussions of an illness when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,"" said Merkel.
""Conspiracy theories are not only false and dangerous, they are also cynical and cruel,"" she added. ""I will also get vaccinated when my turn comes.""
Merkel's fourth and last term was marked by discontent within conservatives after losses in regional elections which many blamed on her decision to welcome more than one million asylum seekers in 2015.
The setbacks at regional polls in 2018, in which conservatives lost voters to both the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the ecologist Greens, prompted her not to seek a fifth term.

Should coalition building after September election drag on beyond December, Merkel will remain as caretaker chancellor in 2022 until a new government is in place.

The mainstream opposition, led by National Assembly speaker Juan Guaido, boycotted parliamentary elections held on Dec. 6 on the basis they would not be free and fair. While the ruling socialist party won that vote handily, Guaido's allies rejected the results and voted last weekend to extend their term.
The sentence declared any action taken by current legislators ""with the purpose of perpetuating, extending or continuing their status as National Assembly lawmakers"" to be ""lacking in judicial validity and effect."" 
The opposition views the Supreme Court as beholden to Maduro's government, which it labels a dictatorship. Many Western democracies, including the United States, have disavowed the Dec. 6 vote. 

Maduro calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup to win control of the OPEC nation's vast oil reserves.

The public prosecution's comments appeared intended to signal the officers are no longer considered suspects in Egypt and that Cairo does not want Italy to prosecute them. 
Giulio Regeni, a postgraduate student at Britain's Cambridge University, disappeared in the Egyptian capital in January 2016. His body was found almost a week later and a post mortem examination showed he had been tortured before his death.
Egyptian police and Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in Regeni's killing.
But Italian prosecutors said on Dec. 10 they planned to charge four senior members of Egypt's security services whom they suspect of taking part in the ""aggravated kidnapping"" of Regeni. One of them also faces charges of ""conspiracy to commit aggravated murder"", they said. 
They gave the four men 20 days to respond to the charges after which, they said, they would ask a judge to indict them.
In a statement on Wednesday, Egypt's public prosecution said ""there is no point in launching a criminal case (over Regeni's torture and killing) ... due to the lack of knowledge of the perpetrator"".
It said investigative authorities should ""exclude what was attributed (by Italian prosecutors) to four officers ... from the papers in that incident."" 
Italy's foreign ministry described the Egyptian public prosecution's position as ""unacceptable"".
In a statement, it expressed confidence in the work of the Italian judiciary and said Italy would ""continue to act in all forums, including the European Union, so that the truth about the barbaric murder of Giulio Regeni can finally emerge.""
It urged Egypt's public prosecution to ""share this need for truth"" and cooperate with Italian prosecutors.
Egypt announced on Nov. 30 that it was temporarily suspending its investigation into the murder, saying it had reservations about the evidence Italy had compiled.
Intelligence and security sources told Reuters in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security. The police have denied this and Egyptian officials have denied any involvement in Regeni's killing.
Regeni, 28, disappeared on Jan. 25, 2016, the fifth anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising that ended the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak. 
Italian and Egyptian investigators had been working together to try to solve the crime. But Italian judicial sources told Reuters last year that Italy was frustrated by the slow pace of developments in Cairo and decided to press ahead with its own line of inquiry to try to move things forward.

Asked during a regular news conference how confident he was heading into 2021, when Mexico holds legislative elections in June, Lopez Obrador said he was optimistic. Then he asked aides to project an ongoing survey of 13 world leaders' approval ratings.
""It's not to show off,"" he said. ""In the understanding that to me, power is humility, but at the same time, it's not bad for people to know,"" he added, arguing that most of Mexico's leading print and broadcast media did not want to publicize the poll.
The Global Leader Approval Rating Tracker by data firm Morning Consult showed Lopez Obrador placing second to India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in terms of net approval rating, or the sum of positive opinions versus negative ones.
As of Dec. 22, Lopez Obrador scored 29, just ahead of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who had 27.
The Mexican president then guided viewers through direct comparisons between himself and some of the other heads of government in the survey, which showed Modi way out front with 55. French President Emmanuel Macron was last at minus 25.
An astute communicator, the leftist Lopez Obrador won election by a landslide in 2018. Since then, his popularity has remained robust, even though he has fallen short of the goals he set on improving security and economic growth.
He has cultivated an antagonistic relationship with much of the media, accusing them of being sympathetic to his critics and ""neoliberal"" economic policies he blames for Mexico's problems.

Earlier this week, he pretended he was going to scrap the daily morning news conferences he uses to answer criticism before revealing 40 minutes later he was joking.

ADEN (Reuters) - At least 22 people were killed and dozens wounded in an attack on Aden airport on Wednesday, moments after a plane landed carrying a newly formed Saudi-backed cabinet for government-held parts of Yemen.
Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik said all members of the cabinet were ""fine"". But the attack underlined the difficulties facing a government intended by Saudi Arabia to unite two of its allies in the war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. 
Hours after the attack, a second explosion was heard around Aden's Maasheq presidential palace where the cabinet members including Maeen as well as the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammad Said al-Jaber, had been taken to safety, residents and local media said.
In the airport attack, loud blasts and gunfire were heard shortly after the plane arrived from Riyadh, witnesses said. A local security source said three mortar shells had landed on the airport's hall.
The cabinet gave the death figure on Twitter, citing the interior minister, and said 50 people were wounded. Medecins Sans Frontieres aid group had earlier said 17 people were treated for wounds at its hospital in Aden. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
The Saudi-led coalition said it had downed an explosive-laden Houthi drone that was targeting the presidential palace. 
There was no immediate reaction from the Houthis, who denied responsibility for the airport attack.
""We and the members of the government are in the temporary capital of Aden and everyone is fine,"" Maeen tweeted from Maasheq palace. ""The cowardly terrorist act that targeted Aden airport is part of the war that is being waged against the Yemeni state and its great people.""
Jaber tweeted: ""Peace, security and stability will prevail thanks to Yemenis' strong will and their brave government.""
The new cabinet unites the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi with southern separatists, intended to fulfil a Saudi aim of ending a feud among Riyadh's allies.
The two groups are the main Yemeni factions in a southern-based, Saudi-backed alliance fighting the Houthis who control the north, including the capital Sanaa.
ICRC STAFF MEMBERS KILLED
TV footage from Saudi-owned Al Arabiya channel showed dozens of people leaving the airplane when a first blast hit the airport's hall. Heavy gunfire from armoured vehicles followed, with plumes of white and black smoke rising from the scene. 
Other video footage showed damage to the terminal's concrete walls and smashed glass.
Government officials were among the casualties in the airport attack, sources said. Two International Committee of the Red Cross staff members were killed in the airport attack and one was missing, ICRC said in a statement.
The southern port city of Aden has been mired in violence because of a rift between the separatists and Hadi's government, based there after being driven from the capital by the Houthis in 2014.
The separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for south Yemen, declared self-rule in Aden in April, triggering clashes and complicating United Nations efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire in the overall conflict.
The Saudi-led coalition announced the new power-sharing cabinet this month after more than a year of intense Saudi mediation between the government and the separatists.
The STC condemned the attack and accused the Houthi movement of responsibility.
U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths and several Arab countries condemned the attack.

""I wish the cabinet strength in facing the difficult tasks ahead,"" Griffiths said. ""This unacceptable act of violence is a tragic reminder of the importance of bringing Yemen urgently back on the path towards peace.""

His lawyer Melkamu Ogo said on Wednesday that police informed him that their lines of enquiry included accusations of disseminating false information, communicating with groups fighting the government, and disturbing the public's peace and security. However, he said he has seen no evidence. 
Kumerra was arrested at his home in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa last Thursday and is being held until at least Jan. 8 pending a police investigation.
Kumerra's family said he was being held in a cold cell and was sleeping on a mattress on the floor. However, they said they were being allowed to visit Kumerra, as is his lawyer, and have brought him extra clothing, food and medication.
The Ethiopian police and prosecutor's office did not respond to questions from Reuters on the reasons for Kumerra's arrest and the conditions in which he is being held, nor requests for comment on his case.
""Kumerra is part of a Reuters team that reports from Ethiopia in a fair, independent and unbiased way,"" Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in a statement on Monday. ""Kumerra’s work demonstrates his professionalism and impartiality, and we are aware of no basis for his detention.""
Similar accusations have been levelled against several other journalists this year, Melkamu said. However, media watchdog groups say in most cases no formal charges were filed.
Police and government officials did not respond to requests for comment.
PROMISES OF CHANGE
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019, has overseen sweeping reforms since taking office in 2018, including the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners and unbanning of scores of media outlets.
However, some rights activists have expressed concern that his government may be reverting to some of its predecessor's authoritarian ways. Thousands of people were arrested this year after outbreaks of deadly violence, including a conflict between the military and a rebellious regional force in the northern region of Tigray.
Media watchdog groups, including the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists and Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF), reported the arrests of at least seven Ethiopian journalists in November, the month that fighting broke out in Tigray.
""After freeing the journalists who were in prison when Abiy Ahmed became prime minister in 2018, the Ethiopian authorities are now going into reverse,"" said Arnaud Froger, who heads the RSF's Africa desk. 
The prime minister's office did not return calls and messages seeking comment. However, his government has previously said the nation is facing security threats, and it is committed to maintaining law and order. 
Reuters has been unable to determine whether Kumerra's arrest was connected to his work.
His wife, Hawi Desalegn, said the couple's three children were deeply upset about his arrest. On Tuesday, she said that their 4-year-old son woke up several times in the night before crying ""Daddy"" and that their 7-year-old daughter was displaying outbursts of anger.
Her 10-year-old sister bursts into tears every time his name is mentioned, she said. 

""We try to avoid talking about her dad in her presence.""

PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - A mob in northwestern Pakistan attacked and set ablaze a century-old Hindu temple on Wednesday, officials said, prompting condemnations from the Muslim-majority country's Hindu community.
Hindus are the largest non-Muslim majority in the country, which gained independence from British rule in 1947, when the subcontinent was partitioned into Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India. 
Videos made by locals at the scene and shared with Reuters showed a crowd breaking apart blocks of the temple structure’s walls using stones and sledgehammers, as dark smoke from a large fire billowed into the sky. 
Local Muslim clerics had organised what they told police would be a peaceful protest against the alleged expansion of the temple, located in a town in Karak district, in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Rahmatullah Wazir, a police officer in the town, told Reuters. 
He added that clerics leading the protest started ""provocative speeches"", following which the crowd attacked the temple. 
“It was a mob and then nobody was there to stop them from damaging the temple,” Wazir said, adding that most of the structure had been damaged.
District police chief Irfanullah Khan told Reuters nine people had been arrested on suspicion of taking part in the attack.
The temple was first built in the early 1900s as a shrine, but the local Hindu community left in 1947 and by 1997 the site had been taken over by local Muslims. 
In 2015, Pakistan’s Supreme Court ordered it be handed back to the Hindu community and the shrine rebuilt, on condition that it would not be expanded in the future.
The spokesman of the provincial government did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
“This is a barbaric way to deal with minorities. We are shocked and hurt ... and (the incident has) sent a wave of insecurity in Hindu community,” Haroon Sarbdyal, a local leader of the Hindu community, said in an interview. 
Sarbdyal said while local Hindus had relocated from the village, devotees still travelled there every Thursday to visit the shrine.
Pakistan’s Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari condemned the incident on Twitter.
Earlier this year, rights watchdog Amnesty International called on Pakistani authorities to ""protect the right to freedom of religion and belief for the country’s beleaguered Hindu community, including the construction of temples to exercise that right"".

Fire destroyed Camp Lipa, near the town of Bihac in western Bosnia, last week. The migrants were supposed to be transferred to the town of Bradina, about 320 km away in central Bosnia.
They were initially put onto buses and waited in cold winter weather for more than a day to be taken to another place. However, there was no final agreement on where they should go.
""The buses are leaving the Lipa area and the migrants have been left behind,"" Nermin Kljajic, the interior ministry chief in Unsko-Sanska county, said on the Klix.ba. news site
Migrants got out of the busses and walked through muddy terrain and woods back to the burned camp. Bundled up in hats, scarves and winter jackets to guard against the cold, they caried their few possessions with them in bags, a Reuters journalist at the scene said.
""They commanded us to go to Lipa. We don't know what to do and how to make a life there,"" a young migrant from Afghanistan told Reuters.
The lack of an agreement among local authorities in Bosnia about where the migrants should go has complicated their lives. They have been trying unsuccessfully to cross the border with Croatia and carry on to wealthier countries of the European Union.
On Tuesday, local media had quoted Bosnian security minister Selmo Cikoti, as saying that the migrants would be moved to a
military barracks in Bradina. But Finance Minister Vjekoslav Bevanda said there had not been any agreement.
""I think that each county should carry part of the burden of the migrant crisis,"" Kljajic told Klix.ba.
Earlier, residents of Bradina had rallied to protest against the possible relocation of the migrants to their town.
Camp Lipa, which was opened last spring as a temporary
shelter for the summer months, housed about 1,200 people and was due to be shut on Wednesday for winter refurbishing.
The central government had wanted them to temporarily return to the Bira camp in Bihac, 25 km away, which was shut down in October. But local authorities disagreed, saying that other parts of Bosnia should also share the burden of the migrant crisis.

The European Union, which had supported Bosnia with 60 million euros to manage the crisis and pledged 25 million euros more, has repeatedly asked the authorities to find an alternative to the unsuitable Camp Lipa, warning of an unfolding humanitarian crisis. About 10,000 migrants are stuck in Bosnia.

There were no more details of the incident in an area where mostly Syrian army and Iranian-backed militias are based, near the ancient city of Palmyra.
A senior military defector in the area said the vehicle carried soldiers and pro-government militias who had finished their leave and were on their way back to their base in the desolate, sparsely populated area.
Another source said at least thirty soldiers were killed, mostly from the Syrian army's elite Fourth Brigade, which has a strong presence in the rich oil-producing province since Islamic State fighters were ousted at the end of 2017. 
Deir al-Zor residents and intelligence sources say there has been a rise in recent months of ambushes and hit-and-run attacks by remnants of Islamic State militants who hid in caves in the mainly desert region.
They also say in the last few months, Arab tribes who inhabit the area have been angered by executions by Iranian militias operating in the area of dozens of nomads suspected of affiliation to militants.

Last week, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Turkey must release Demirtas - already charged with terrorism-related offences - saying the justification for his four years in prison was a cover for limiting pluralism and debate.
State-owned Anadolu news agency said the Ankara state prosecutors' office sought punishment for the 108 suspects on various charges including 37 cases of homicide and disrupting the unity and territorial integrity of the state.
In early October, a Turkish court ordered the pre-trial detention of 17 people, including senior pro-Kurdish opposition members, in connection with the Kobani protests in October 2014, which led to the deaths of 37 people.
The protesters in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast accused Turkey's army of standing by as Islamic State militants besieged Kobani in plain view, just across the Syrian border.
Turkish authorities said the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) - designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union - incited the protests and that the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) supported them. The HDP, the third largest party, denies links to terrorism.

India has been fighting an armed insurgency in the disputed Himalayan region for decades and killed more than 200 militants this year, according to official data.
It is, however, rare for families to immediately contest victims' allegiance to insurgent groups. Police in Kashmir this month filed charges against an army officer and a civilian for allegedly killing three labourers and planting weapons to pass them off as militants.
""Parents might not be knowing activities of their wards,"" Vijay Kumar, the Kashmir valley's top police official, said about the men killed on Wednesday, adding they were supporters of militant groups and likely planning an attack.
One rifle and two pistols were recovered from the site of the gun battle, he said.
A spokesman for the Indian Army declined to comment, referring the matter to the police.
Bashir Ahmad Ganai, grandfather of 25-year-old Aijaz Ahmad Ganai, who was killed in the protracted firefight in Srinagar, told reporters his grandson was not a militant.
""He was a student. Why did they kill him?"" he said at a protest by family members outside a police office.

Athar Ahmad, 27, who was also shot dead, studied at Kashmir University and had left home on Tuesday to fill in an academic form, his sister Rifat Wani said.

Blake was buried at the Troyekurovskoye cemetery in western Moscow. President Vladimir Putin, a former KGB officer, offered his condolences over the weekend, describing him an ""outstanding professional"".
Britain says Blake exposed the identities of hundreds of Western agents across Eastern Europe in the 1950s, some of whom were executed as a result of his treason. 
He was sentenced to 42 years in prison in Britain after being unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1961, but escaped jail and was whisked across Europe to the Soviet Union.

He spent the rest of his life there and in Russia.

The construction of a new concourse in the iconic Farley Post Office building across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station had been talked about for decades before being set on a concrete path by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in 2016.
The 255,000 square-foot Moynihan Train hall, named for the late U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who championed the project, will serve passengers on Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road when it opens for business on Jan. 1, 2021.
Featuring a 92-foot high glass skylight and a lounge for nursing mothers, the new facility is designed to provide more space for the notoriously congested transit hub, which served some 650,000 people daily before the pandemic.
In a statement on Sunday, Cuomo hailed the project as a ""shot of hope"" amid the dark days of the pandemic and said its completion was proof the health crisis did not stop New Yorkers ""from dreaming big and building for the future.""

Construction began in 2017 and the project was completed on time and within budget, Cuomo said.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 09:41AM ET</span>",Georgia legislators seek scrutiny of jail deaths as new case emerges,"By Ned Parker
(Reuters) - Georgia lawmakers are calling for greater oversight of the Chatham County Detention Center over a string of deaths documented in a series of reports by Reuters.
At least 24 inmates died over 12 years at the facility, two-thirds of them in the last seven years, as the Savannah jail’s healthcare was managed by two different companies. The lawmakers said the pattern of deaths raises questions about the role of private industry in inmate healthcare.
“They are not providing proper care to the inmates through privatization,” said Georgia House Representative Sandra Scott. The Democrat said the state should better monitor healthcare in jails across Georgia, including at the Chatham County facility, to ensure inmates are promptly being seen by medical staff and receiving their medications.
A fellow Democrat, Representative Kim Schofield, said she plans on collaborating with Scott in drafting bills mandating more stringent oversight in a state with no mandatory inspection system for local jails. “This stuff has gone on long enough,” she said.
Any reforms would require support from the legislature’s Republican majority. This year, the parties came together to pass legislation allowing people convicted of misdemeanors to petition to seal their criminal records. GOP legislators did not respond to interview requests for this story.
As scrutiny of the Savannah jail escalates, Reuters has identified another inmate who died there after receiving what independent experts said appeared to be substandard care.
Lee Creely, 34, was arrested on a probation violation September 3 for not reporting his change of address three weeks earlier. Creely, who had served time for drug possession, had just moved from a motel to a house so his sons, aged 12 and 7, could have their own rooms. “We were making a fresh start,” said his girlfriend, Jessica Hodges.
Three nights after his arrest, officers and nurses discovered Creely on his bed, with his face and hands turned blue, his fists clenched in rigor mortis, jail records reviewed by Reuters show.
Officially, the cause of Creely’s death remains under investigation.
Yet Reuters has reviewed confidential internal jail records showing that the facility’s medical provider, CorrectHealth LLC, delivered Creely’s daily medications just once in four days. He had been prescribed the medications to help manage his withdrawal from heroin and benzodiazepines. CorrectHealth also stopped checking his vitals after his second day in jail, violating the company’s own protocols. CorrectHealth’s nurses had not visited Creely’s cell in almost 48 hours before finding his corpse, the records show.
Two correctional healthcare specialists, who reviewed the records gathered by Reuters, said the failure to provide medications and monitor someone in withdrawal violated jail medical standards. The abrupt halting of benzodiazepines can cause seizures, while unsupervised withdrawal from heroin can lead to severe dehydration.
“Benzodiazepine withdrawal can kill someone,” said Dr. Robert Cohen, a former director of medical care at New York’s jail complex on Rikers Island, who has served as a federally appointed monitor overseeing inmate healthcare across the United States.
CorrectHealth did not respond to written questions about Creely’s death. The Chatham County Sheriff’s Office declined comment, citing an “open investigation” into the death.
Sheriff John Wilcher and his office announced the firing of five officers for allegedly failing to check on Creely or respond more quickly. One officer was arrested for allegedly writing falsely in log books that he checked inmates' cells 10 times over two and half days. Wilcher asked the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to carry out a probe.
The GBI told Reuters it was awaiting the results of Creely’s autopsy before delivering its findings to the district attorney. The agency said it is examining the actions of both jail and medical staff.
Like two-thirds of American jail inmates who die behind bars, Creely died without being convicted of the charge on which he was being held.
“My younger son keeps asking, ‘Why did they let my daddy die?’” said Hodges, the mother of their children. “I don’t know why.”
FINES WAIVED, BONUS GIVEN
Creely’s death is part of a long record of questionable inmate care at the jail. To see earlier Reuters reports on the jail, click https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-monitor/ and https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-privatization
CorrectHealth won the contract in 2016. A year later, an outside monitor suggested the county fine the contractor $5.2 million for staffing and healthcare lapses. The county waived the fines and dismissed the monitor. This November, the county awarded CorrectHealth a $500,000 bonus, citing its increased costs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and boosted its overall contract by more than $1 million for next year.
Outgoing Chatham Commission Chairman Al Scott said the county acted on the suggestion of Sheriff Wilcher, who has jurisdiction over the jail, in boosting the company's pay. Wilcher, who has previously praised CorrectHealth's performance, declined to comment, citing the investigation into Creely's death.
Another outgoing commissioner, Tabitha Odell, told Reuters that CorrectHealth was not meeting the contract’s terms. “When any tragedy occurs, it is necessary to evaluate systems, services, and procedures to see where we can make improvements,” Odell said.
State legislator David Wilkerson plans to propose legislation in the new year that would include mandatory state investigations of jail deaths, oversight of healthcare and alternatives to jail for those with mental health issues or experiencing drug withdrawal.
Wilkerson said he is concerned about the circumstances of Creely’s death.

“There has got to be a better way,” Wilkerson said. “No one should die in jail.”

BANGUI (Reuters) - A group of influential opposition politicians in Central African Republic has called for an annullment of last Sunday's election, saying that a third of voters were unable to cast their ballot because of insecurity. 
Voting took place amid an offensive by armed groups in rural areas long beyond the reach of government control in the sparsely-populated country of 4.7 million people. 
In the build-up, the government relied on United Nations' peacekeepers to deliver election materials to the provinces by plane because roads were made unpassable by heavy rains or rebel checkpoints. 
Results are expected to trickle in from Wednesday, but an opposition coalition that includes five presidential candidates and former President Francois Bozize, says the vote should be repeated. 
Insecurity halted voting in 2,115 polling stations, silencing over 621,000 voters, or about a third of the electorate, it said in a statement. In some polling stations, voting started late, counting was delayed or the number of votes surpassed the number of registered voters, it said. 
It did not provide details on which polling stations were closed or proof to back up the assertions. 
The electoral commission said on Tuesday that around 800 of a total 5,408 polling stations did not open because of insecurity.
""Given that the elections ... were not an expressision of the will of the Central African people,"" the coalition demanded the ""outright cancellation and repeat of elections"". 
The coutry, which has substantial diamond and gold resources, has struggled to stabilise due to waves of militia violence since 2013 that have killed thousands and forced more than a million from their homes.
Campaigning was marred by threats from armed groups after several candidates, including Bozize, were barred from running. 

Security forces, helped by more than 12,000 U.N. peacekeepers, and reinforcement from Russia and Rwanda, managed to fend off attacks in the capital.

OSLO (Reuters) - Ten people were injured, one of them critically, and 21 people remained unaccounted for after a landslide in southern Norway swept away more than a dozen buildings in the early hours of Wednesday, police said.
The landslide struck a residential area in the municipality of Gjerdrum, some 30 km (19 miles) north of the capital Oslo.
(Graphic: Location of landslide in Southern Norway - https://graphics.reuters.com/NORWAY-LANDSLIDE/qmyvmqyeavr/chart.png)
Photos of the site showed a large crater with destroyed buildings at the bottom of it. Other buildings hung on the edges of the crater. 
Helicopters hovered over the area, at times lowering emergency responders towards the debris of collapsed houses, TV footage showed.
Around 700 people have been evacuated from the area so far, police said.
""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK.
""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly.""
The missing people were from homes in the innermost area of the landslide but it was not immediately clear whether they had been trapped in their houses, were away at the time or had managed to escape, the police said.
""There are many who are still unaccounted for. This is a big catastrophe,"" Prime Minister Erna Solberg told reporters during a visit to the site.
The area remains unstable for now and can only be accessed by helicopter, said Roger Pettersen, head of the police operation at the site.
Masses of earth are continuing to move in what has been one of the largest clay slides in recent Norwegian history, Torild Hofshagen, the regional head of the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, told a news conference.

Southern Norway has seen large amounts of precipitation in recent days, which may have caused the clay soil prevalent in the area to shift, broadcaster NRK said.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda opposition presidential candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, and his campaign team were arrested in the country's central region on Wednesday, he said on Twitter.
No further details of their arrest were immediately available. They were arrested in Kalangala in central Uganda, Wine said in the post.
Joel Senyonyi, spokesman for Wine's party, the National Unity Platform, said: ""Yes police has arrested him together with his whole campaign team. They (police) put them in police trucks and started driving but we don't know where they are taking them.""
Police spokesman Fred Enanga was not immediately available for comment.
Wine has emerged as the strongest challenger to President Yoweri Museveni, 76, in the presidential election on Jan. 14.
In November, at least 54 people died after protests erupted following Wine's brief detention over alleged violation of COVID-19-related social distancing measures.
Police said at the time they had arrested nearly 600 people and accused protesters, whom authorities had enlisted the help of the military to disperse, of rioting and looting.

On Tuesday, United Nations human rights experts called on Uganda to rein in violent security forces and drop charges against political opponents and activists arrested in what the experts called an election clampdown.

633,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>","Putin targets U.S. social media, secret agent leaks and protests with new laws","MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin signed an array of laws on Wednesday handing Russia new powers to restrict U.S. social media giants, label individuals ""foreign agents"", and to crack down on the disclosure of its security officers' personal data. 
The laws, which also introduce new restrictions for protests, cap a year of constitutional reforms allowing Putin, 68, to stand for two more six-year terms in the Kremlin instead of stepping down in 2024 as he had been legally required to do. 
Other reforms such as one granting former presidents lifelong immunity from prosecution have kept analysts guessing about his plans as Moscow's ties with the West have come under new strain over the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
One of Wednesday's laws enables Russia to block or restrict access to sites that ""discriminate"" against its media, part of a campaign under Putin to increase Russia's internet ""sovereignty"" that has fuelled fears of creeping China-style controls. 
Twitter currently labels some Russian media ""state-affiliated media"", a move decried by Moscow. The law's backers cited complaints made about prejudice shown by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter and YouTube. 
A second law introduces hefty fines of up to 20% of their previous year's Russia-based turnover for sites that repeatedly fail to remove banned content, something that YouTube and Facebook have often failed to do according to Russian lawmakers. 
A third law prohibits the disclosure of the personal data of Russian security officials, records that are sometimes leaked online and have been used by investigative journalists to track clandestine operations. 
Earlier this month, investigative website Bellingcat used flight records and other data to identify a group of alleged Federal Security Service agents whom Navalny has accused of trying to poison him in August, an allegation denied by Moscow. 
Other new laws introduced jail sentences of up to two years for slander online as well as new regulations that would prohibit the funding of protests by ""foreign agents"" and allow rallies to be banned due to emergencies. 

Another law granted authorities new powers to label individuals ""foreign agents"" and also jail them for five years if they fail to report their activities correctly.

634,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 07:51AM ET</span>",Special Report-Nuns arrested as Beijing turns up heat on Church in Hong Kong,"By Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - In a high-walled Art Deco villa in the Hong Kong suburbs of Kowloon, the Vatican operates an unofficial diplomatic mission, its only political outpost of any kind in China.
The mission keeps such a low profile that it isn't listed in the Roman Catholic Church's formal directory of every priest and property in the city. The two monsignors who staff the outpost have no formal standing with Beijing or the Hong Kong government, and they don't conduct official work, not even meeting Hong Kong officials. The tenuous foothold is a sign of the delicate position in China of the world's largest Christian denomination, many of whose members in Hong Kong staunchly support the city's democracy movement.
And now the mission – and the Church as a whole in Hong Kong – is coming under mounting pressure as Beijing moves to extinguish opposition voices in the city under a new national security law.
In May, two Chinese nuns who work at the mission were arrested by mainland authorities during a visit home to Hebei province, according to three Catholic clerics with knowledge of the matter. The nuns, in their 40s, were detained for three weeks before being released into house arrest without being charged. They are forbidden to leave the mainland, according to one of the clerics. Meanwhile, Western diplomats say, Chinese security agents have stepped up surveillance of the mission in recent months.
The arrests, which haven't been previously reported, are viewed by top clerics here and in the Vatican as a sign Beijing wants the mission shut. It lacks official standing because the Holy See and China haven't established formal diplomatic ties. While priests are sometimes arrested on the mainland, ""it is highly unusual for nuns to be detained,"" said another of the clerics, who has long-time contacts on the mainland. ""Normally they are left alone.""
The pressure is also being felt at the heart of the Church in Hong Kong, by the leadership of the large local diocese.
Senior members of the clergy in Hong Kong told Reuters that Beijing is trying to extend its control over the diocese, in part by influencing the choice of the city's next bishop, a position that's been open since the last bishop's death two years ago. Beijing, they said, is seeking to apply to Hong Kong a two-year-old agreement with the Holy See that gives the Chinese government a significant say in the appointment of prelates on the mainland.
According to Vatican officials, Hong Kong wasn't part of the deal because of the city's semi-autonomous status. But with Beijing exerting greater control over Hong Kong, mainland priests have been passing information to priests in the city about which clerics the ruling Communist Party favors to take on the bishop's role, the senior clerics said.
As the pressure rises, the acting head of the local Church, Cardinal John Tong, has been curbing activist voices in the Catholic hierarchy, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. One target has been the Justice and Peace Commission, a human rights body within the diocese that has traditionally championed political and religious liberty.
In October, the four people said, Tong's executive committee, known as the curia, censored a statement on Sino-Vatican relations released by the commission. They removed a reference to James Su Zhimin, the Bishop of Baoding, who was arrested by Chinese authorities more than 20 years ago on the mainland and has become a hero to many in the Church. His fate is unknown.
Tong, 81, has also told his priests not to deliver sermons that are too political, cautioning them that they should avoid using language that causes ""social disorder."" Tong, like all bishops, has full administrative authority over his diocese.
""We are at the bottom of the pit – there is no freedom of expression anymore,"" the former Bishop of Hong Kong, Cardinal Joseph Zen, told Reuters in a written reply to questions. ""All these things are normal in mainland China. We are becoming like any other city in China.""
With the exception of 88-year-old Cardinal Zen, all Church leaders, local priests and parishioners interviewed for this article declined to be named. ""For any word you say,"" Zen told Reuters, the authorities ""can say you're offending the National Security Law.""
In a written statement, the office of Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents, including freedom of religion, are safeguarded under both Hong Kong's Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution, and the national security law.
The Liaison Office, the main arm of the Chinese government in Hong Kong, didn't respond to questions for this article. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing didn't answer questions about the nuns' status. Asked whether China sought to shut down the unofficial Vatican mission in the city, the ministry said in a statement: ""As far as we know, the Vatican has not set up any official representative institution in Hong Kong.""
A Vatican spokesman declined to comment for this story. In a statement, the Hong Kong diocese said that parishioners are encouraged to express their views. ""Hence, instead of suppression, the Diocese welcomes a wide spectrum of different voices,"" it said. Cardinal Tong declined an interview request.
ACTIVISTS ARRESTED
The pressure on the Catholic Church is building as Beijing advances a broader effort to stamp out independent political forces in Hong Kong. That push began early this year, after months of sometimes violent mass protests. It intensified on June 30, when China imposed the new national security law that makes anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.
Since then, leading pro-democracy activists have been arrested. Democratic lawmakers have been ousted from the legislature, and others have quit in protest. This month, one of Hong Kong's most prominent democrats, media tycoon Jimmy Lai, was charged with colluding with foreign forces under the national security law. And teachers have had their licenses revoked for allegedly making political comments in class.
The Church is the latest major institution here to feel squeezed by Beijing. Reuters has documented this year how other institutions central to the city's freedoms and rule of law, including its judiciary, its police force and the democracy movement itself, have been weakened, co-opted or cowed. For the ruling Communist Party, Hong Kong's Catholics pose a serious challenge to its authority.
On the mainland, a government religious bureaucracy and decades of repression have contained religious practice and the sway of the Vatican, effectively driving big sections of the Catholic Church underground. But in Hong Kong, the Church has flourished.
The Catholic enclave grew in importance during the decades Britain ruled the city after the Communist Party took power in 1949 and dramatically curtailed religious freedom on the mainland. Hong Kong became a base for missionary outposts that reached into mainland China, attempting to keep contact with the faithful.
Today, there are an estimated 400,000 Catholics in this city of 7.5 million, and the Church permeates society through a network of schools, hospitals, charities and newspapers. Many of the city's elite are products of Catholic schools opened early in the British colonial era. Particularly troubling for Beijing, Catholic activists have been influential in the city's protests and pro-democracy movement.
With Beijing's crackdown on Hong Kong intensifying, Tong and his diocese leadership are now moving to curb these activist voices, including that of the Justice and Peace Commission. The decision by the Church hierarchy to remove the reference to Bishop Su and other clerics detained on the mainland from the commission's October statement is telling, according to three of the clerics who spoke to Reuters. For years, the commission had stood by Su, regularly issuing calls for his freedom.
The focus on the commission reflects its decades of support for democratic movements in the city, said multiple people familiar with its work. Formed in 1977 and funded by the diocese, the commission comprises lay Catholic volunteers and full-time staffers who are overseen by senior clergy. It has long monitored religious persecution on the mainland. And it is a member of a broad democratic action group called the Civil Human Rights Front that has organized some of Hong Kong's larger regular protests, as well as some of last year's mass peaceful protests.
""Although the commission faces more challenges under the National Security Law, we will continue to implement Catholic Social Teachings for the promotion of social justice in every aspect of human life,"" Lina Chan, the body's executive secretary, said in response to questions.
The commission's work has included speaking out for religious figures, such as Bishop Su, who have been repressed on the mainland. In October 2017, for instance, it organized a prayer vigil to mark his detention that was attended by then-Bishop Michael Yeung.
Hong Kong Catholics say Su's plight has long resonated in their community, given the harshness and length of his detention and his role as a spiritual leader in China's Hebei province, traditionally an underground Catholic stronghold. Su's fate has never been explained by Chinese authorities.
U.S. House Republican Chris Smith chastised China for Su's treatment at a congressional human rights hearing this year. ""Why does a powerful dictatorship fear peaceful men and women of faith and virtue?"" said Smith, who met Su in 1994.
POLITICAL SERMONS
Since the national security law was imposed, said one person familiar with the commission's operations, the diocese leadership has been particularly keen for the body ""to adopt a more neutral posture.""
In response to questions, a spokesman for the diocese said it had not received ""any messages or instructions from authorities concerned stating that Cardinal Tong and members of the clergy needed to rein in pro-democracy elements in the diocese.""
The removal of the reference to Su in the Justice and Peace Commission's statement wasn't the first time superiors reined in the body. In May, the commission issued a statement of concern about police enforcement of COVID-19 restrictions to hamper protest activities. Later, after the diocese received complaints from within the Catholic community about the statement, the commission was told by the diocese leadership that it had to submit all future statements for checking, according to the four people with knowledge of the matter.
""Apparently the authorities in the diocese have now decided to please the government by discouraging certain initiatives of the commission … rather than respecting the commission in doing its job according to the social teaching of the Church,"" said Cardinal Zen. ""I'm afraid that a real persecution has already begun.""
In late August, Tong issued a letter to clergy urging them to avoid politically loaded sermons. In another statement released in September, Tong referred to the August letter, saying he had called on pastors in their sermons to ""keep abreast of the times and speak out for justice, and, on the other hand, avoid using slandering and abusive expressions that insinuate or instigate hatred and social disorder, inasmuch as they are against the Christian faith.""
Hong Kong-born Tong marked a significant change in style when he was appointed by the pope as bishop in 2009, upon Zen's retirement. While Tong did call last year on the city government to listen to the people of Hong Kong, he is known for his non-confrontational approach toward Beijing. Zen, by contrast, has long been outspoken in his support for democracy and civil rights.
Born in Shanghai and raised by Salesian priests after his family fell into poverty in World War Two, Zen frequently criticized the Hong Kong government over civil rights in his seven years as bishop, from 2002 to 2009. He was also a prominent figure at annual pro-democracy marches and vigils to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown of 1989. In recent years, Zen has grown increasingly critical of the Vatican's deal with Beijing on the appointment of Chinese bishops.
Tong, who served as bishop between 2009 and 2017, returned in an acting role following the death of his successor, Bishop Michael Yeung, in January 2019. He has openly supported the Vatican-Beijing agreement on bishops.
Some of Tong's critics say he is too pliant towards Beijing. But his defenders say he is trying to ""keep the wolf from the door,"" as one priest put it.
""His back is against the wall and he is trying to save his flock under this intense pressure,"" said another priest. ""He is pro-Vatican rather than pro-Beijing.""
Tong also presides over a divided congregation. Some of Hong Kong's most influential pro-Beijing figures are Catholics, including Chief Executive Lam and other members of the city elite. And some of the most vocal critics of the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities are pillars of the Catholic community, too, chief among them Cardinal Zen, the media magnate Lai, and barrister Martin Lee, who founded Hong Kong's largest democratic party.
Asked how Lam, as a Hong Kong Catholic, viewed Beijing's moves toward the Church, her spokesman said that ""any attempt to politicize"" her faith was regrettable and that it ""should remain a private matter.""
CONTROVERSIAL DEAL
It has rarely been easy to be a Catholic in China. The Church struggled to gain a significant foothold during centuries of imperial rule, starting with the Vatican's first diplomatic efforts in the 13th century. The Communist Party's victory in 1949 led to the suppression of Christian missions across the country.
The situation on the mainland remains tough for the Vatican. The Party views Catholicism as an inherent threat because it recognizes a foreign leader, the pope, as its moral authority. Beijing is also wary of the Church's role in the downfall of communist regimes across Eastern Europe in 1989, in particular Poland. And the Vatican continues to recognize Taiwan, where it established its main presence after the Communist victory on the mainland, and does not have formal diplomatic ties with Beijing.
The estimated 10 million Catholics on the Chinese mainland were for decades split between a state-sanctioned church and an underground church that recognized the pope's authority. Then, in 2018, the Holy See struck an interim deal with Chinese officials aimed at addressing the divide. While the deal gives the pope final say on the appointment of bishops, it allows the government the right to propose candidates. The agreement's exact terms remain secret.
Critics of the deal say it has failed to end persecution of Christians on the mainland, while the Vatican has said it is needed to heal the split in the Church in China. It was extended for another two years in October despite reports of ongoing detentions of priests and the destruction of some churches on the mainland. Reuters hasn't independently confirmed these reports.
But the deal didn't include Hong Kong, say Vatican officials. It was deliberately kept out of the arrangement, Vatican officials have told Reuters, reflecting the ""one country, two systems"" guarantees under which Britain handed its former colony back to Chinese rule in 1997, and which has afforded the city a high degree of autonomy and broad individual freedoms. The appointment of bishops in the city has been the sole preserve of the Vatican.
Now, however, senior Hong Kong clerics and missionary priests say the city has emerged as a new battleground between Rome and Beijing. China, they say, is acting as if the new security law effectively allows it to apply the deal to Hong Kong, where the Catholic community is anxiously awaiting the announcement of the next bishop, succeeding temporary leader Tong.
Even before the national security law was introduced, priests on the mainland began passing on information to their counterparts in Hong Kong about which clerics the Communist Party favors to lead the Church in Hong Kong, according to multiple Church sources. ""Mainland priests with previously little knowledge of Hong Kong church politics are suddenly apparent experts and pushing candidates,"" said the priest with long-time contacts on the mainland.
Five priests in the city told Reuters that Beijing has been quietly backing Father Peter Choy for bishop, sending messages to that effect via mainland priests. Choy, 61, is a member of the diocese's executive committee and also vice-director of a diocese study center that focuses on the evolution of the Church in China. He kept a low profile during the anti-government protests of 2019 as the unrest escalated, some priests and lay Catholics say.
Many Catholics say Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Ha would be a popular choice in the Hong Kong flock. He took a higher profile than Choy amid the protests last year, leading a public prayer for peace and trying to mediate between police and protesters at a violent standoff at the city's Polytechnic University.
A Vatican official in Rome told Reuters the Church is aware that Beijing would not want someone in the position who was too radical.
Choy and Ha both declined to be interviewed.
China's foreign ministry didn't answer a question about whether it was trying to extend the interim agreement on the appointment of bishops to Hong Kong. The agreement with the Vatican was ""an important deal"" and the two sides ""remain in good communication"" on its implementation, the ministry said in a statement.
Cardinal Zen said he fears the Vatican may not have the backbone to stand up to China on the prelate pick. ""They are afraid of irritating or displeasing the Beijing government, so everybody knows that the future bishop of Hong Kong needs to have the blessing from Beijing,"" Zen said. ""We hope they have the courage to assign a good shepherd to our diocese instead of appointing somebody who would be only an official chosen by the Beijing government.""
ANXIOUS PARISHIONERS
Tong's parishioners sense the pressure, too. As in churches around the world, masses in Hong Kong have been subdued because of COVID-19 restrictions. The devout still go to pray during quiet moments in the cathedral and the smaller parish churches that dot the city, some in high-rises. Others visit outdoor grottos built into church walls with statues of the Virgin Mary. Even so, some Hong Kong Catholics talk of a particularly ominous sense of darkness.
""I've started to pray for the church for the first time,"" said one woman, 62, as she left a grotto in the city's Eastern District. ""The Hong Kong church has been so strong for us over the years, but now it seems so weak. There is too much secrecy – we don't know what is in this strange deal between the Vatican and Beijing, and we don't know who our bishop will be.""
The Vatican has no formal embassy to represent its interests with the Chinese government. By contrast, in countries with which the Holy See has full relations, Vatican missions engage in regular, open diplomacy.
But the Vatican does have the unofficial mission in a suburban corner of Kowloon, across the harbor from the main island of Hong Kong. Though the two monsignors who lead the mission must remain discreet, they do maintain links with local and mainland clerics and missionary organizations, according to Western diplomats.
For the Holy See, the Vatican official said, the mission provides another advantage: leverage. What the Vatican would really like is a presence in Beijing. If China were ever to agree to a Vatican presence on the mainland, then the mission in Hong Kong could be closed, the official said.
The mission's two detained Chinese nuns find themselves caught between Beijing and the Holy See. The nuns, who were extensively involved in the mission's work, have served there for the past five years.
They were detained in Hebei after traveling there to visit their families, two of the clerics said. After their three-week detention, they spent months under house arrest, and their families' homes were under surveillance. The restrictions were eased last month. They are free to attend mass in nearby churches but cannot leave the mainland and return to Hong Kong.
The Church has not publicly mentioned the arrests. The Vatican official in Rome told Reuters he interpreted the move as a way for Beijing to indicate its unhappiness with the mission's presence in Hong Kong.

Cardinal Zen says efforts by government authorities to silence the Church in Hong Kong are inexorable. ""I don't know for how long you can still hear my voice,"" he wrote in his statement to Reuters. ""So please pray for us.""

MAJSKE POLJANE, Croatia (Reuters) - Rescue workers sifted through the rubble on Wednesday to make sure there were no more people trapped after an earthquake in central Croatia that killed seven people and destroyed scores of homes and other buildings.
Many residents spent the night in their cars, terrified that a series of aftershocks of up to 4.8 magnitude would send more debris tumbling from houses already weakened by Tuesday's 6.4 magnitude quake. 
Others had no home left to stay in.
Drone footage from the town of Petrinja, near the epicentre, showed tangles of wood and brick, people's rooms and belongings exposed to the daylight after the force of the tremor sheared the walls and roofs from their houses. 
Josip Granic, from the mountain rescue service HGSS, said his men would continue working throughout the day, sifting methodically through the wreckage in the towns and villages to find anyone else who might be trapped.
""We want to be sure by the end of the day that no one has been left behind in the rubble,"" he said.
As well as the seven killed, 26 were injured, including six who are seriously wounded, officials said.
In the village of Majske Poljane, where five of the people died, the vast majority of the houses were completely destroyed.
Mira Zlonoga was in tears as she looked at what was left of her home.
""What shall we do, where shall we go? God knows. Only God can help us ... I have a grandmother, she’s 91, immobile, she wears diapers, she is in some sort of accommodation, and I spent the whole night in the car,"" she said.
For Marijana Matic, the picture was the same: ""We started from scratch, when we raised these animals, pigs."" A few survived and she and her husband were trying to work out where to shelter them - and themselves.
Asked where they would go, she said: ""I don’t know. My husband went to look.""
In Sisak, another badly hit town, Mayor Kristina Ikic Banicek said: ""Our immediate worry is to find shelter and secure supplies for everyone. The people are the priority. After that the priority is to deal with damage to infrastructure."" 
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the government had set aside 120 million kuna ($19.50 million) to urgently help the worst affected areas.
Croatia has also asked for help from the European Union and the European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic was due to visit the area affected later on Wednesday.
The government declared Jan. 2 as a day of national mourning. 
Pope Francis prayed for the victims. ""I express my closeness to the wounded and to those who were hit by the earthquake and I pray in particular for those who lost their lives and for their families,"" he said.

A Ghanaian employee on her farm in the northern Italian region of Trentino has admitted to killing Agitu Ideo Gudeta, 42, with a hammer and raping her, Italian news agency Ansa reported. The report could not immediately be confirmed.
Gudeta had made her home in the mountains of Trentino's Valle dei Mocheni, making goat's cheese and beauty products in her farm La Capra Felice (The Happy Goat), which was built on previously abandoned land.
Her story was reported by numerous international media, including Reuters , as an example of a migrant success story in Italy at a time of rising hostility towards immigrants, fueled by the right-wing League party.
Gudeta escaped from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, in 2010 after her participation in protests against 'land-grabbing' angered local authorities. Activists accused the authorities of setting aside large swathes of farmland for foreign investors.
On reaching Italy she was able to use common land in the northern mountains to build her new enterprise, taking advantage of permits that give farmers access to public land to prevent local territory from being reclaimed by wild nature.
Starting off with 15 goats, she had 180 by 2018 when she became a well-known figure.

""I created my space and made myself known, there was no resistance to me,"" she told Reuters in a story that year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of 3,000 precision guided munitions to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in a deal valued at up to $290 million, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
The sale comes in the final days of U.S. President Donald Trump's term. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the Middle East's biggest buyer of American weapons, in a bid to pressure Riyadh to end a war in Yemen that has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
The package would include 3,000 GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I) munitions, containers, support equipment, spares and technical support, the Pentagon said.
""The proposed sale will improve Saudi Arabia's capability to meet current and future threats by increasing its stocks of long-range, precision air-to-ground munitions,"" the Pentagon said in a statement. It added that ""the size and accuracy of the SDB I allows for an effective munition with less collateral damage.""
The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale on Tuesday. Members of Congress have been angered by steep civilian casualties in Yemen and earlier this year tried and failed to block the sale of F-35 warplanes to Riyadh. 
If Congress cannot block the munition sale, the Biden administration should do so when it takes office, William Hartung, the Director of the Arms and Security Program at the Center for International Policy, said in a statement. Adding, ""it is particularly concerning that the Trump administration is trying to ram through these controversial deals when it has less than a month left in office.""
Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.

The Pentagon said Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co was the prime contractor for the weapons.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Benny Gantz, the former general who came close to ending Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's long dominance of Israeli politics, is finding his star is fading fast as a new rival from the right emerges as a challenge in an election set for March.
With his centrist Blue and White party on the verge of demise, Gantz has said he will press on and bring Netanyahu's more than decade-old reign to an end.
But with anger mounting against Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis from across the political spectrum, the main threat to the prime minister appears to be Gideon Saar, a defector from his right-wing Likud party.
Saar has accused Netanyahu, who is under criminal indictment for corruption, of putting his own interest ahead of the nation's. Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing, has dismissed the allegation. 
A survey by N12 News predicted Likud would be down to 28 seats in the 120-seat parliament, with Netanyahu short of a backing majority, Blue and White shrinking to five and Saar's New Hope (OTC:NHPEF) party winning 19 in the March 23 election.
Up until May, Gantz was the great hope of Israel's centre-left, desperate to oust Netanyahu in three elections held since 2019 in which Blue and White ran neck-in-neck with Likud, winning around 35 seats each.
But in the past week a string of political allies have bolted Blue and White, which polls see teetering on the edge of the threshold required in order to enter parliament.
""The race for the exit from B&W is reaching stampede proportions,"" Anshel Pfeffer, a political analyst for the liberal Haaretz newspaper, wrote.
""Centrist parties in Israel are usually short-lived but this is a political write-off of epic proportions."" 
""POLITICAL SUICIDE""
At a news conference on Tuesday, Gantz said he would remain at the party helm and bring Netanyahu down. 
""Many have mentioned the term 'political suicide' to me but I didn't care then and I don't care now,"" he said. ""I see only the State of Israel."" 
Alone at the podium and angrily rebuffing critics hours after he was abandoned by a senior party comrade, Gantz's sombre statement was a stark contrast to the buzz he generated in the previous campaigns. 
A towering and laid-back former military chief, Gantz, 61, was a political novice whose main election pledge was to form a government without Netanyahu.
Likud and Blue and White emerged as the two biggest parties at the ballots. But neither Gantz nor Netanyahu secured enough votes to form a government. As the coronavirus crisis mounted, Gantz backtracked on his election promise and joined an emergency unity government headed by Netanyahu, taking the position of Defence Minister.
Alienating voters and enraging allies, Gantz struck a power-sharing deal that would have seen him taking the premiership from Netanyahu in November 2021 - an accord many political analysts were sceptical would hold. 
It was a costly move. Gantz's party split with about half its members quitting as his own popularity plummeted in opinion polls. The government, formed in May, collapsed last week, triggering another snap election.

LUCKNOW (Reuters) - Over 100 retired senior civil servants and diplomats urged the Hindu nationalist leader of Uttar Pradesh state to repeal a new law criminalising forced religious conversion of brides, warning in an open letter that it risked fuelling communal tensions.
Although no religion is specified in the legislation, critics say it is aimed against the country's Muslim minority. Hardline Hindu groups have accused Muslim men of waging a campaign, dubbed ""Love Jihad"", to lure Hindu women to Islam with promises of marriage.
Uttar Pradesh (UP), a northern state that is controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and is the most populous in the country, enacted a law last month against pressuring brides to change their faith or offering financial rewards to converts. The BJP-controlled government in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh is preparing to follow suit. 
""You can pose no greater threat to the nation than by turning its own citizens against one another, a conflict that can only serve the country's enemies,"" the former bureaucrats wrote in the letter addressed to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a firebrand Hindu monk and rising star in the BJP.
Vigilantes from Hindu groups were intimidating and harassing Indians, especially Muslim men, and ""acting as a power unto themselves,"" the former bureaucrats from various federal ministries, states, government agencies and foreign missions said. 
""What is worse is that your law enforcement machinery, with the active backing of your government, is playing a role reminiscent of the secret police in authoritarian regimes,"" they said in the letter dated Dec. 29.
Thirty Muslim men were arrested in Uttar Pradesh under the new law earlier this month, and could face jail terms if found guilty.
The former bureaucrats, several of whom were well-known public figures, said the state government should withdraw the ""illegal"" order, compensate victims and hold errant policemen accountable.
Mrityunjay Kumar, an advisor to Adityanath told Reuters that the government has not received any letter yet and called it ""a publicity stunt."" 
""It's an open letter and, therefore, it's been placed in the public domain,"" said Wajahat Habibullah, India's former chief information commissioner and one of the signatories. 
""The main purpose is to awaken the public to the illegality of the action taken by the UP government,"" he said.

641,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2020 06:17AM ET</span>",Indonesia bans hardline Islamic Defender's Front group,"By Agustinus Beo Da Costa and Kate Lamb
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has banned the controversial and politically influential hardline group the Islamic Defender's Front, the chief security minister announced on Wednesday.
Minister Mahfud MD said the group, widely known by its acronym FPI, was prohibited with immediate effect. 
""The government has banned FPI activities and will stop any activities carried out by FPI,"" Mahfud said. ""The FPI no longer has legal standing as an organisation.""
The ban follows the November return of the group's spiritual figurehead, Rizieq Shihab, from three years of self-exile in Saudi Arabia, which was celebrated with events attended by thousands.
Rizieq's return to the world's largest Muslim-majority country had fuelled concern within government that he could be angling to harness opposition forces.
The 55-year-old cleric was arrested this month and charged with violating health protocols and remains in custody, while a clash between police and his supporters – in which six of his bodyguards were shot dead – is being investigated by the national human rights body.
Mahfud said the FPI had officially been disbanded since June last year, but had continued unlawfully conducting activities.
Six senior government officials, including the attorney general, police chief and counter-terrorism agency head were involved in the decision to ban the group, he said.
The deputy justice minister, Edward Omar Sharif Hiariej, said the FPI was outlawed because nearly 30 of its leaders, members and former members had been convicted on terrorism charges, and because the group conflicted with the nation's state ideology, Pancasila, which emphasises unity and diversity.
Formed soon after the 1998 fall of former strongman Suharto, the FPI were notorious for raiding bars and brothels and intimidating religious minorities. It is also known for offering assistance during natural disasters.
Its political sway has risen in recent years, particularly after its role in protests in 2016 against Jakarta's former Christian governor who was jailed for insulting Islam. 
The government saw the demonstrations as one of the biggest threats to President Joko Widodo's rule.
'LOCUS OF ISLAMIST OPPOSITION'
Dr Ian Wilson, senior lecturer in politics and security studies and a research fellow at the Asia Research Centre, Murdoch University, said the ban may prove to be counterproductive. 
""Banning the FPI will do little to mitigate the factors that have driven its popularity as a social phenomenon, and is likely to 'radicalise' some members and sympathisers,” he said.
The ban raised questions about enforcement and the implications for democratic expression in the world's third-largest democracy, he said.
Wilson said the decision had to be viewed in the context of recent political developments, including the purging of FPI members and sympathisers from the Indonesia Ulema Council.
""The government is on the offensive against what they see as a potential locus of popular Islamist opposition, sharpened by the recent return of Rizieq,” he said.
""While having a sound legal foundation, the banning is clearly politically driven as well.”
Security analysts have suggested the ban could spark a backlash or force the FPI and its activities underground. 
Senior FPI member Novel Bamukmin was defiant, telling Reuters the ban would do little to dampen spirits.
""They can disband FPI but they cannot disband our struggle to defend the country and religion. And if we want, this afternoon we can declare a new Islamic mass organization,” he said, 

""If they disband it again, we'll create a new one.”

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - Dozens of Cubans protested at the U.S. border in the northern Mexican city of Ciudad Juarez on Tuesday night, demanding they be allowed to cross and claim asylum in the United States.
U.S. authorities, including police in anti-riot gear, closed off the bridge that leads into El Paso, Texas, with a concrete barrier topped with barbed wire. 
A recording blared from a loudspeaker warning that any person who crossed could be arrested.
Late into the evening, some 200 migrants who had walked right up to the barrier stayed put.
Jonathan Castro, 25, said he has spent one year and eight months in Mexico after attempting to request asylum in the United States, and is prepared to protest at the bridge throughout the night. 
Like many other Cubans, he was sent back across the border under the ""Remain in Mexico"" program - a key piece of U.S. President Donald Trump's hardline policy to curb migration by making asylum seekers wait out their proceedings in Mexico. 
""We're fed up waiting,"" he said, adding that the group had formed at the border after word circulated that U.S. authorities were prepared to let them cross.

Cuban migrant Rauvel Tejeda, who has spent nearly as long in Mexico under the same circumstances, said he was tired of poor treatment by Mexican police, and wanted ""a little bit of help"" from both Mexico and the United States.

Nicholas Slatten was convicted of first-degree murder, while Paul Slough, Evan Liberty and Dustin Heard were convicted of voluntary and attempted manslaughter, over the incident in which U.S. contractors opened fire in busy traffic in a Baghdad square and killed 14 unarmed Iraqi civilians.
The four contractors, who worked for the private security firm Blackwater owned by the brother of Trump's education secretary, were included in a wave of pre-Christmas pardons announced by the White House.
“Pardoning the Blackwater contractors is an affront to justice and to the victims of the Nisour Square massacre and their families,” said Jelena Aparac, chair of the U.N. working group on the use of mercenaries, said in a statement.
The Geneva Conventions oblige states to hold war criminals accountable for their crimes, even when they act as private security contractors, the U.N. experts said.
""These pardons violate U.S. obligations under international law and more broadly undermine humanitarian law and human rights at a global level.""
By allowing private security contractors to ""operate with impunity in armed conflicts"", states will be emboldened to circumvent their obligations under humanitarian law, they said.
The pardons were strongly criticised by many in the United States. General David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, respectively commander of U.S. forces and U.S. ambassador in Iraq at the time of the incident, called Trump's pardons ""hugely damaging, an action that tells the world that Americans abroad can commit the most heinous crimes with impunity"". 

In a statement announcing the pardons, the White House said the move was ""broadly supported by the public"" and backed by a number of Republican lawmakers.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's Senate voted on Wednesday to legalize abortion, a first for a big country in Latin America and a triumph for women's rights campaigners achieved over the visceral objection of the Catholic Church.
Abortion is extremely rare in a region where the Church has held cultural and political sway for centuries. Previously, it was allowed on demand only in Communist Cuba, tiny Uruguay and parts of Mexico.
The fiercely contentious vote was held at 4:00 a.m. after a marathon debate that lasted through the night. In a vote of 38-29 with one abstention, the Senate backed the government proposal to allow terminations through the 14th week of pregnancy. The lower house had already approved it this month.
As the result was read out, a crowd of thousands of people who had supported the bill erupted in cheers outside the Senate building in Buenos Aires, waving the green flags that represented their campaign. Green smoke rose in the dawn light above the crowd.
""This has been a struggle for many years, many women died. Never again will there be a woman killed in a clandestine abortion,"" said Vilma Ibarra, the author of the law and legal and technical secretary for the presidency, who wept as she spoke to reporters after the result.
""We did it sisters. We made history. We did it together. There are no words for this moment, it passes through the body and the soul,"" tweeted Monica Macha, a lawmaker with President Alberto Fernandez' center-left ruling coalition.
Fernandez himself reacted moments later: ""Safe, legal and free abortion is law. Today we are a better society that broadens rights for women and guarantees public health.""
But Pope Francis - himself an Argentinian - reflected the Church's opposition in his own tweet sent on Tuesday before the Senate debate: ""The son of God was born discarded to tell us that every person discarded is a child of God.""
After the vote, thousands of the bill's opponents dispersed, wiping away tears as a speaker from a makeshift stage told them: ""We are witnessing a defeat of life. But our convictions do not change. We are going to make ourselves heard.""
One of them, Sara de Avellaneda, told Clarin newspaper: ""I came because I had to be here. We are not invisible. Not everything is a green tide. This law is unconstitutional and its implementation is not going to be easy.""
The ruling could set the tone for a wider shift in conservative Latin America where there are growing calls for greater reproductive rights for women.
""Adopting a law that legalizes abortion in a Catholic country as big as Argentina will energize the struggle to ensure women's rights in Latin America,"" said Juan Pappier, a senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch.
""Although there will certainly be resistance, I think it's fair to predict that, as it occurred when Argentina legalized same sex marriage in 2010, this new law could have a domino effect in the region.""
Until now, Argentine law had allowed abortion only when there was a serious risk to the health of the mother or in cases of rape. Pro-choice groups argued that criminalizing abortion harms women from the most vulnerable groups. Argentina's Health Ministry says more than 3,000 women died from illegal abortions from 1983-2018.

The Catholic church argues that abortion violates the right to life.

Navalny is convalescing in Germany after being poisoned in Russia with a Novichok nerve agent, an attack about which Britain and other Western countries have said Russia, which denies wrongdoing, has serious questions to answer.
The Kremlin has said it has yet to see evidence that Navalny was poisoned and President Vladimir Putin has suggested the way the incident has been presented in the West is part of a U.S.-backed plot to try to discredit him. 
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Wednesday it had been forced to respond to what it called unfriendly and unconstructive steps by Britain in October. It said it had handed Deborah Bronnert, Britain's ambassador to Russia, a note explaining its position. 
Britain and the European Union imposed sanctions on top Russian officials close to Putin in October in a response to Navalny's poisoning.
Moscow on Wednesday called those sanctions unacceptable and unjustified.

It did not publicly name the British officials, politicians and individuals it was banning from Russia, but said they were united by the fact that they had been complicit in whipping up what it called anti-Russian sanctions.

SUHKHIRIN, Thailand (Reuters) - As the yellowish mud swirls away in the waters of Thailand's Sai Buri river, Sunisa Srisuwanno lifts her wooden pan with a cluster of gleaming specks caught in the centre.
""That's 100 baht,"" she said, pointing to grains worth about $3.30 after little more than 15 minutes work with her gold panning partner, Boonsom Aeamprasert.
With global gold prices near an all-time high, the women are a rare bright spot for an economy hard hit by the collapse of tourism amid coronavirus travel restrictions.
""The gold panning business is doing well, especially during COVID-19,"" said Sunisa, a 37-year-old mother of two. ""Panning gold is our main staple. We sell gold today, we are able to buy food to feed the family.""
The area's name - Gold Mountain - indicates that mining has gone on longer than anyone can remember in Sukhirin District, on Thailand's southern border with Malaysia.
But it has been made more lucrative by rising gold prices, up nearly a quarter over the past year.
The rest of Thailand's economy is suffering, with the central bank forecasting a 6.6% contraction this year.
Thailand's deep south, scene of a decades-old Muslim separatist insurgency, lacks the beach resorts, nightlife or temples that draw so many tourists to the country.
But visitors who come to Sukhirin for hiking, kayaking and wildlife are still an important income source - at least until the pandemic struck. 
""As the community was forced to shut down the attractions, we had to switch from welcoming tourists to digging and sifting for gold,"" said Wari Bantakit, 40, who works for a community tourism group.
Some gold sifters use just a shovel, a pan and a plastic squeezy bottle to suck up the grains - and the occasional nugget. Others try to find the best prospects by scrabbling underwater with a snorkel mask.
There are men among the gold panners, but miners said the draw of gold is particularly appealing for women. Men traditionally gather wood and forage in the forests.

""Housewives who used to sell stuff, vegetables, food to tourists were forced to stop,"" said Wari. ""They had to turn to gold panning. It’s become the main job.""

More than 250 people were killed in the attempt to overthrow the government on July 15, 2016 when rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, helicopters and tanks and sought to take control of key state institutions.
Life sentences without parole were given to 12 defendants including some department heads of the land forces, Anadolu said.
Last month, a court handed separate jail sentences to leaders of the coup attempt, which Ankara blamed on supporters of the U.S.-based Muslim preacher Fethullah Gulen. He has denied having any role.
Some 292,000 people have been detained over alleged links to Gulen, nearly 100,000 of them jailed pending trial, Anadolu cited Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu as saying.

SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - A Chinese court sentenced 10 Hong Kong activists to between seven months and three years in jail on Wednesday for illegally crossing the border, in a case that has drawn international attention and concern over the defendants' treatment.
The group had all faced charges in Hong Kong over anti-government protests in the Chinese-ruled city and they have been held virtually incommunicado in a mainland prison since their boat was intercepted on Aug. 23 after leaving Hong Kong, allegedly en route to the democratic island of Taiwan.
The court in the city of Shenzhen, which borders the semi-autonomous former British colony of Hong Kong, found eight of the defendants guilty of the illegal crossing and sentenced them to seven months in jail and a 10,000 yuan ($1,533) fine. 
Tang Kai-Yin, 31, and Quinn Moon, 33, were found guilty of organising an illegal border crossing and sentenced to three years and two years, respectively, with fines of 20,000 and 15,000 yuan. The court said the pair had acted under the instruction of others, suggesting more arrests could follow.
The defendants' family-appointed lawyers, who were denied access to their clients, rights groups and relatives criticised the legal process.
""We have to remember that they were locked up in China cut off from the world, their families and lawyers of their choosing for four months before attending a mock trial where only CCP-approved players were allowed in,"" said Beatrice Li, the sister of Andy Li, 30, who was among those jailed, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.
Rights group Amnesty International expressed concern over the safety of the defendants in the mainland prison system. 
""This group of young Hongkongers will be at risk of torture and other ill-treatment in Chinese jails,"" the group's Asia-Pacific regional director, Yamini Mishra, said in a statement. 
All 10 had pleaded guilty to their crimes, the court said. The defendants all appeared for the verdicts and were taken away afterwards.
Their government-appointed lawyers were not available for comment. A Shenzhen public security bureau spokesman said the sentences would take into account the time the 10 had already spent in detention.
Two minors who were among the 11 males and one female - aged 16-33 at the time of their detention - had pleaded guilty to illegal border crossing and would not be charged, the prosecutor said.
POLICE WARNING
After the verdicts were announced, Hong Kong police said that the two youngest of the group, now aged 17 and 18, had been handed over and would appear in court in the financial hub after completing quarantine for coronavirus.
""Hong Kong police want to reiterate the seriousness of absconding; society will not tolerate criminals who are waiting for court hearing but choose to abscond,"" said Cheng Lai-ki, acting chief superintendent of the commercial crime bureau. 
The 10 who were sentenced could face additional charges on their return to Hong Kong, she added. 
The scene outside the court was quiet, with few media present. Diplomatic representatives from countries including the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, were not allowed to enter the hearing at Yantian District People's Court on Monday after authorities said the court was full.
A Reuters reporter and other media were also denied entry.
Security was tight as police checked media accreditation, asked reporters if they had arranged interviews and urged them not to linger in the vicinity due to the coronavirus. 
Self-ruled Taiwan is a popular destination for Hong Kong pro-democracy activists since Beijing imposed a national security law on its freest city in June that critics say is aimed at stamping out dissent and curbing freedoms. 
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and assembly. Democracy activists complain that Communist Party rulers in Beijing are whittling away at those freedoms, a charge Beijing rejects.

The United States and European Union have called for the 12 to be released and allowed to return to Hong Kong.

(Reuters) - One of the Louisville police officers who shot Black emergency medical technician Breonna Taylor, and the officer that prepared the warrant for the botched raid during which she was killed, were told on Tuesday that the department aimed to fire them.
Taylor's death when police entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, early on March 13 was one of a string of killings of African Americans that fueled mass protest demonstrations across the United States in 2020.
Taylor's boyfriend, who was with her when police burst into the home, fired once at what he said he believed were intruders. Three police officers responded with 32 shots, six of which struck Taylor, killing her.
Lawyers for Detective Myles Cosgrove, one of the officers who shot Taylor, and Detective Joshua Jaynes, who prepared the search warrant, said in a statement quoted by the New York Times that each had received notices of termination.
Their union, the River City Fraternal Order of Police, said it was ""aware that two of our members received pre-termination opportunity to respond notices today, outlining the chief's current intent to terminate their employment"".
Cosgrove and Jaynes have been on administrative reassignment during the investigation, the New York Times reported.
Jaynes' pre-termination letter, from interim chief Yvette Gentry, accused him of breaching department policies around truthfulness and preparing for a warrant's execution, according to the Washington Post.
""These are extreme violations of our policies, which endangered others,"" Gentry wrote in the letter. ""Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the Department.""
""We intend to show up to the pre-termination hearing on Dec. 31 and we're going to contest this action, although I'm not optimistic about Interim Chief Gentry changing her decision,"" Thomas Clay, Jaynes' lawyer, said in a statement to local media.

The Louisville Metro Police Department did not comment when contacted by Reuters.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said there had been ""no meaningful result"" from several rounds of diplomatic and military talks aimed at de-escalating the worst border confrontation between the nuclear armed neighbours in decades.
""If the status quo continues, it is obvious that the deployment won't come down,"" Singh said during an interview with Reuters partner ANI.
But, he said, both sides were still exchanging messages over the border situation and another round of military talks was in the offing.
Tensions soared in June, after troops clashed in hand-to-hand combat in the Galwan valley in Ladakh, abutting the Chinese-held Tibetan plateau.
Twenty Indian soldiers were killed, with China suffering an undisclosed number of casualties, and both sides ramped up their military presence, moving men, weapons and supplies to the high-altitude desert region.
Officials in New Delhi said last month that Indian and Chinese officials had held several parleys to discuss ways to implement a staggered withdrawal.
""Our expectation is that some positive result can be achieved through talks,"" Singh said.
India has positioned around 50,000 troops in the contested area, some at altitudes of over 15,000 feet (4572 m), where scarce oxygen and freezing winter temperatures can be life-threatening. 
India and China share an undemarcated 3,800-km long border, where their troops previously adhered to long-standing protocols to avoid the use of any firearms on the frontier.

But tensions have flared since the Galwan incident and both militaries, who fought a border war in 1962, accused each other of firing in the air in September.

Jonathan Pollard, 66, had long voiced a desire to emigrate to Israel, which granted him citizenship. The espionage affair strained U.S.-Israel relations for decades. 
Sentenced in 1987 to life imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage, Pollard was freed on parole in 2015.
A U.S. Justice Department decision last month to let the parole terms' five-year travel ban go unrenewed was seen by some as a parting gift to Israel by the Trump administration. 
Netanyahu met Pollard and his wife Esther as they disembarked in Tel Aviv, video distributed by the Israeli prime minister's office showed. The couple, both Orthodox Jews, kissed the tarmac.
After saying a Hebrew prayer of thanksgiving for the liberation of prisoners, Netanyahu presented Pollard with an Israeli identity card. ""Welcome home,"" the prime minister said. ""Now you are a citizen of the State of Israel.""

Israel Hayom newspaper, which first reported the couple's arrival, said they flew in aboard a private plane due to Esther Pollard's medical condition.

The group of four adults and the boy were driving west of Mount Isa in north-west Queensland, a 24 hour drive from Brisbane, the state capital, when their vehicle became bogged down in floodwater on Sunday evening, rescuers said.
After spending the night together in the ""ute"", the local term for a sport-utility vehicle, three trekked for about 12 hours to a police station at Mount Isa to raise the alarm at around 6 pm on Monday.
The father and son were rescued a short while later. Finding them had been relatively easy, helicopter pilot Russell Procter said, as their companions ""were able to pinpoint the location of the car within 100 metres"".
Australia's summer is being dominated by the La Nina phenomenon, typically associated with greater rainfall and more tropical cyclones - a sharp contrast to the massive bushfires that razed the country last summer.
""North Queensland is a very large are and very inhospitable at the best of times, and with the floodwaters ... it makes it very difficult to get around,"" said Procter. 
A separate couple of travelers were also rescued with the helicopter on Tuesday after getting stuck in a flooded road at a different location in the state, Procter added. None of the rescued were injured.

659,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 08:35PM ET</span>",Federal probe ends without charging Cleveland police in Tamir Rice shooting,"By Eric Beech and Rich McKay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday it has closed its civil rights investigation into the fatal 2014 shooting by Cleveland police of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old Black youth, and that no federal criminal charges would be brought in the case.
The announcement came five years after an Ohio grand jury cleared two Cleveland officers, Timothy Loehmann and Frank Garmback, of state charges of wrongdoing in the death of Rice, who was shot in a playground while holding a toy gun capable of shooting pellets.
The slaying occurred when Loehmann, then a rookie on the Cleveland force, rolled up to the park in a police cruiser with Garmback at the wheel, then sprung from the vehicle and fired his gun twice at the youth within seconds, killing the boy.
Both men are white. 
The incident was one of a flurry of high-profile killings of African-American people at the hands of U.S. law enforcement in recent years that have fueled protests giving rise to the Black Lives Matter movement against racial injustice.
The two officers in the Rice case had been dispatched in response to a 911-emergency call reporting a suspect with a gun near a recreation center. 
But crucial information the caller gave dispatchers - namely that the person in question was a juvenile and that the supposed weapon might be a toy - was never relayed to Loehmann and his partner before they reached the scene.
As a result, ""the officers believed they were responding to a playground where a grown man was brandishing a real gun at individuals, presumably children,"" the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said in its six-page statement.
Moreover, security camera video of the November 2014 episode was found to be too grainy and taken from too great a distance to conclusively detail circumstances of the shooting, the statement said.
In closing the case without bringing charges, the department said it lacked sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that either officer had willfully broken the law, as opposed to making a mistake or exercising poor judgment.
""Although Tamir Rice's death is tragic ... both the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney's Office concluded that this matter is not a prosecutable violation of the federal statutes,"" the department said.
Although no criminal charges have been brought, the city agreed to pay $6 million to the boy's family to settle a civil rights lawsuit filed in his death in April 2016.
Cuyahoga County prosecutors who previously investigated the killing have said Rice had either intended to hand over the toy weapon he was carrying - an Airsoft replica of a .45-caliber semiautomatic handgun - or show officers it was not real, but that the two policemen had no way of knowing that.
The Airsoft normally comes with an orange tip on its barrel to distinguish it from an actual firearm, but the one Rice was holding at the time did not, prosecutors said.
The family's attorney, Subodh Chandra, said Tamir's mother is profoundly upset by news of Tuesday's decision.

""Justice for the family would be to prosecute the officers who killed their child,"" Chandra said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un chaired a politburo meeting on preparations for a rare Congress that is expected to set new economic and political goals as the country faces growing challenges, state media said on Wednesday.
The Eighth Congress comes amid the presidential transition in the United States, which North Korea has yet to comment on. President Donald Trump had engaged in a number of historic meetings with the leader of the reclusive state during his administration and it is not yet clear what Joe Biden's presidency will mean for relations between Washington and Pyongyang.
North Korea has faced a number of challenges in 2020 with COVID-19 and a series of typhoons putting more pressure on an economy already battered by international sanctions aimed at stopping its nuclear programme.
The politburo meeting on Tuesday approved agendas and proposals to be presented at the congress and adopted a decision on holding it early in January next year, state news agency KCNA reported, without specifying an exact date.
In October, Kim called on his country to embark on an 80-day campaign to achieve its goals in every economic sector before the congress in January.
The politburo meeting appreciated that innovative achievements and progress had been made in all fields during the 80-day campaign, KCNA said.
""All the preparations for the Party Congress are going off smoothly,"" KCNA reported.
The congress last met in 2016, where Kim announced the first five-year economic plan since the 1980s and vowed to not use nuclear weapons unless the country's sovereignty was violated by others with nuclear arms. It was also when Kim was officially elected to the position of chairman of the ruling Workers' Party.

North Korea has not reported any coronavirus cases, but the economy took a further hit when the country closed its borders to nearly all traffic in a bid to prevent coronavirus outbreak.

SISAK, Croatia (Reuters) - An earthquake of magnitude 6.4 struck central Croatia on Tuesday, killing seven people, injuring more than 20 and rattling several neighbouring countries, officials and residents said.
Rescuers pulled people from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Petrinja and other towns, and army troops were sent to the area to help.
Tremors were also felt in Croatia's capital Zagreb and as far away as Austria's capital Vienna. Slovenia shut its only nuclear power plant as a precaution.
It was the second quake to strike the area in two days.
The GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences said it hit at 1119 GMT at a depth of 10 km (6 miles), with the epicentre in Petrinja, 50 km south of Zagreb. 
""By now, in the vicinity of the town of Glina we have five fatalities. Together with a (12-year-old) girl from Petrinja there are altogether six dead,"" Deputy Prime Minister Tomo Medved said while visiting Glina.
State news agency Hina, citing firefighters, later reported that a seventh victim had been found in the rubble of a church in the village of Zazina. 
Police said at least 20 people were slightly injured and six more severely wounded in the temblor. 
""The search through the rubble is continuing,"" police said in a statement.
Throughout the day many aftershocks occurred measuring 3.0 magnitude or slightly stronger.
Tomislav Fabijanic, head of emergency medical services in Sisak, said many people were wounded in Petrinja and Sisak and their injuries included fractures and concussions.
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic, who rushed to Petrinja, said: ""The army is here to help. We will have to move some people from Petrinja because it is unsafe to be here.""
The head of the hospital in Sisak said later it was treating 20 people, two with severe injuries.
The N1 television station showed footage of rescuers in Petrinja pulling a man and a child alive from the debris. Other footage showed a house with its roof caved in. The N1 reporter said she did not know if anyone was inside.
N1 also said a kindergarten was destroyed in the quake but that there were no children in it at the time. 
Piles of stone, brick and tiles littered Petrinja's streets in the aftermath of the quake, and cars parked in the road were smashed by falling debris. 
A worker who had been fixing a roof in a village outside Petrinja told N1 that the quake threw him to the ground. Nine of the 10 houses in the village were destroyed, he said.
WRAPPED IN BLANKETS
The quake was also felt in Zagreb, where people rushed onto the streets, some of which were strewn with broken roof tiles and other debris.
Patients and medical staff were evacuated from Zagreb's Sveti Duh Hospital, with many left sitting in chairs in the street wrapped in blankets. 
In Austria's second city Graz, about 200 km (130 miles) north of Petrinja, tall buildings wobbled for about two minutes, according to broadcaster ORF. In Carinthia province, about 300 km to the northwest of Petrinja, the earth trembled for several minutes and people described how their furniture, Christmas trees and lamps wobbled.
In Slovenia, the STA news agency said the country's sole nuclear power plant, 100 km (60 miles) from the epicentre, was shut down as a precaution.
Croatia's state news agency Hina said the quake was felt in a total of 12 countries.
Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic said Croatia was expecting help from the European Union as it had activated its emergency situation mechanism. 
A day earlier on Monday, a magnitude 5.2 earthquake hit central Croatia, also near Petrinja. 

In March, a temblor of magnitude 5.3 rattled Zagreb, causing one death and injuring 27 people.

The move is likely to be seen as the latest sign that the Kremlin does not want Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, to return to Russia after what Berlin and other Western nations say was an attempt in August to murder him with a nerve agent.
Navalny is one of President Vladimir Putin's leading critics and the Kremlin has said he is free to return home just like any other Russian citizen, something he has said he plans to do. 
It has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned however and has denied any involvement in the August incident which saw him collapse on a plane before being airlifted to Germany.
Russia's Investigative Committee, which looks into serious crimes, late on Tuesday accused Navalny and unnamed individuals of large-scale fraud, saying he and others had spent 356 million roubles ($4.81 million) donated to organisations he controls on their personal needs.
That, it said in a statement, included purchasing goods and services and covering personal expenses such as overseas trips.
Navalny responded to the case on Twitter, saying it was fabricated and looked like a hysterical action ordered by Putin. 
He said he had predicted that the authorities would seek to jail him after failing to kill him.
The Kremlin earlier on Tuesday declined to comment on other potential legal action against Navalny. 
Putin has said that media reports that Russian state security agents poisoned Navalny were part of a U.S.-backed plot to try to discredit him. He said Navalny was not important enough to be a target.
Russia’s prison service on Monday gave Navalny another potential legal headache in the form of a last minute ultimatum: Fly back from Germany at once and report early on Tuesday morning, or be jailed if you return after that deadline. 
Navalny was unable to return in time.
The prison service said a suspended sentence in an earlier and separate theft case Navalny says was politically-motivated could be changed to a real jail term.

Fire destroyed the camp in Lipa housing about 1,200 people last week. Police and UN officials have said the blaze was probably started by migrants unhappy at the temporary closure of the camp, scheduled for the same day. 
On Tuesday, media quoted Bosnia's security minister, Selmo Cikotic, as saying that the migrants would be moved to a military barracks in the town of Bradina, 320 km (200 miles) away. Finance Minister Vjekoslav Bevanda disputed that, saying that there had not been any agreement. 
Bosnian media showed pictures of buses parked for migrants to board. Residents gathered in Bradina to protest against migrants moving there, the portal klix.ba reported. 
About 10,000 migrants are stuck in Bosnia, hoping to reach wealthier countries in the European Union. 
The Lipa camp, which was opened last spring as a temporary shelter for the summer months 25 km away from Bihac, was due to shut on Wednesday for winter refurbishing.
The central government wanted the migrants to temporarily return to the Bira camp in Bihac, which was shut down in October, but local authorities disagreed saying that other parts of Bosnia should also share the burden of the migrant crisis.

The European Union, which had supported Bosnia with 60 million euros to manage the crisis and pledged 25 million euros more, has repeatedly asked the authorities to find an alternative to the unsuitable Lipa camp, warning of an unfolding humanitarian crisis.

A Chinese court handed down a four-year jail term on Monday to Zhang Zhan, who reported at the peak of the crisis in the city where the coronavirus first emerged. Her lawyer said Zhang was jailed on the grounds of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble"".
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that he strongly condemned Zhang's conviction and called for her immediate and unconditional release, accusing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of restricting and manipulating information about the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.
""Her hasty trial, to which foreign observers were denied access, shows how fearful the CCP is of Chinese citizens who speak the truth,"" Pompeo said, adding that the United States would always support the right of Chinese citizens to express themselves freely.
U.S.-China relations have plunged to their worst level in decades as the world's top two economies spar over issues ranging from the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing's national security law for Hong Kong, trade and espionage.
The EU also called for Zhang's immediate release, as well as for freedom for jailed human rights lawyer Yu Wensheng, and several other detained and convicted human rights defenders and individuals who engaged in reporting in the public interest.
""According to credible sources, Ms Zhang has been subject to torture and ill-treatment during her detention and her health condition has seriously deteriorated,"" an external affairs spokesman for the 27-nation EU said in a statement. 
Separately, the EU called on China to ""guarantee procedural fairness and due process of law"" for 10 Hong Kong activists on trial in China after being caught at sea and accused of trying to flee to Taiwan.
In a statement it called for the immediate release of the group and their swift return to Hong Kong from Shenzhen, where they went on trial on Dec. 28 in a closed court and without appointed lawyers of their choice. 
The EU criticism over the cases comes a day before EU and Chinese leaders are expected to clinch a deal to give European companies better access to the Chinese market.
Citizen-journalist Zhang was among a handful of people whose firsthand accounts from crowded hospitals and empty streets painted a more dire picture of the pandemic epicentre than the official narrative.
Critics say that China deliberately arranged for Zhang's trial to take place during the holiday season in the West, to minimize scrutiny.

""The restrictions on freedom of expression, on access to information, and intimidation and surveillance of journalists, as well as detentions, trials and sentencing of human rights defenders, lawyers, and intellectuals in China, are growing and continue to be a source of great concern,"" the EU spokesman said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon can ration $2 billion in reserves left for subsidies to last six more months, the caretaker prime minister said on Tuesday, as the country's financial meltdown raises fears of rising hunger.
Lebanon's worst crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war has crashed the currency and sent inflation soaring. A looming end to subsidies has triggered U.N. warnings of ""social catastrophe""..
In an interview with Reuters, Hassan Diab also said Western officials had told him there was ""an international decision"" not to help Lebanon because of Iran-backed Hezbollah's role the country.
Diab said he only learned there was $2 billion in foreign reserves left for subsidies from TV comments Central Bank Governor Salameh made last week. 
""I had asked him several times. Nothing official was received,"" he said. Diab said the amount was higher than anticipated and would last ""six months if we apply rationing"".
A central bank spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Diab, who took office a year ago with Hezbollah's backing, resigned in August over public fury at the port explosion that killed 200 people that month. His cabinet has since served in a caretaker role.
One of the biggest non-nuclear blasts on record, the disaster piled hardship on Lebanese already sinking into poverty.
As dollar inflows dried up, the central bank has drawn on foreign reserves to subsidise three key commodities - wheat, fuel and medicine - and some basic goods.
Diab, who cited dangerously low reserves when he declared Lebanon's default this year, said he hoped for agreement by February on a plan to cut subsidy spending while supporting the poor.
""IT'S NOT YOU,"" IT'S HEZBOLLAH
He said the cabinet sent parliament a week ago a report laying out four scenarios to replace subsidies with ration cards for 600,000 Lebanese families, or more than 2.5 million people. 
The import-dependent country has an estimated population of six million, including at least a million Syrian refugees.
One of the options in the report included scrapping subsidies on fuel and wheat, but not flour, to give families $165 a month instead. It also cited ""a need to ask for aid from donor states ... because 2021 will be a tough year"". 
Politicians, bickering for months over seats in the new government, have met rebuke, including from the World Bank, for failing to chart a way forward. 
The central bank and the state have traded blame for the economic collapse. In response to criticism that nearly a year had gone by without a plan, Diab said his government had since faced multiple crises. 
Foreign donors have made clear they will not bail out the state unless it launches reforms to tackle decades of graft, a root cause of the crisis. Gulf monarchies that once came to Lebanon's rescue have also grown alarmed by Hezbollah's expanding influence.
""They said it to me, the Americans and the Europeans: 'it's not you' ... but there's an international decision to stop helping Lebanon,"" Diab said. ""Because they have a problem with Hezbollah.""
Along with three ex-ministers, Diab has faced charges of negligence over August's explosion but has since declined to be questioned, accusing the investigating judge of overstepping his powers. 
The U.S. FBI said in October it had reached no firm conclusion about what caused the blast.
Earlier on Tuesday, Diab's office quoted him as saying the FBI probe had revealed that only 500 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had detonated out of the 2,750 tonnes stored unsafely at the port. 

""Where did the (rest) go?"" he said without answering his question.

Akufo-Addo was declared the winner of the Dec. 7 vote with 51.59%, ahead of the opposition National Democratic Party's (NDC) candidate, former President John Mahama, who received 47.37%. 
The contest witnessed heated rhetoric during campaigning and election-related violence that killed at least five people, a rarity in a country that has a reputation as one of West Africa's most stable democracies.
""The NDC will contest the results of the rigged election in the Supreme Court and other appropriate fora,"" the party's executive committee said in a statement on Tuesday.
The NDC, which has yet to produce evidence of fraud, provided no details about the case it would file. The court has 42 working days from when hearings begin to issue its decision.
Only one other Ghanaian presidential election, in 2012, was formally contested by the losing candidate. The court rejected Akufo-Addo's challenge to then-incumbent Mahama's victory in a case that dragged on for eight months.

If passed, the bill would make Argentina the first big country in predominantly Catholic Latin America to allow abortion on demand. The vote is expected to be close after what is likely to be a marathon debate, beginning at 4 pm (1900 GMT).
""For decades we have been waiting for this moment,"" said more than 1,500 prominent Argentine personalities in an open letter to senators.
""This is a time to make history. The world is watching."" 
On the other side of the debate is the Catholic Church, which is calling on senators to reject the proposal to allow women to end pregnancies up to the 14th week. Argentina is the birthplace of Pope Francis. 
Argentine law now allows abortion only when there is a serious risk to the health of the mother or in cases of rape. 
Feminist groups and other advocates of the bill called for people to demonstrate at provincial capitals around the country on Tuesday while the measure is debated in the Senate. Demonstrations by people against the bill are also expected.
Legal abortion is extremely rare in Latin America because of the long history of opposition by the Church. Across the region, abortions are available on demand only in Communist Cuba, comparatively tiny Uruguay, and some parts of Mexico.
The change in law has been rejected by Argentina's Congress before, but this is the first time that such a bill is being presented to lawmakers with support from the ruling government. In 2018, before President Alberto Fernandez was elected, a similar bill was rejected by a slim margin.

The measure is accompanied by side legislation aimed at assisting women who want to continue their pregnancies and face severe economic or social difficulties.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The discovery of the ruins of old Roman baths during the construction of a major drainage system in the heart of Jordan's capital has posed a dilemma: how to preserve the country's ancient past while providing for its modern future?
A government committee set up two weeks ago is expected to decide soon on whether to expand excavations at the site or go ahead with an underground canal that would divert flood water that descends on Amman from the surrounding hills.
Remnants of furnaces are a sign of an elaborate heating system which archaeologists believe is the first such discovery among the remains of the ancient city of Philadelphia on which Amman was built.
""We will balance the needs of the city - to protect it from flooding - to preserving antiquities under the streets,"" said Yazid Elayan, head of Jordan's Department of Antiquities.
""Amman was one of the biggest Roman cities and it has one of the largest baths ... Wherever one excavates in Amman, antiquities can be found,"" he told Reuters.
The work on the drainage system has been suspended while the decision is made.
Amman is an old city where many symbols of Roman civilisation are still visible, from the Amphitheatre that seated 6,000 spectators to the Nymphaeum fountains and the Hercules temple on one of Amman's highest hills.
Worsening infrastructure and haphazard urban planning have plagued the sprawling city of four million people built on layers of ancient civilisations spanning the Ammonites, Moabites, Romans, Greeks and the Islamic period.
Municipality officials have already expressed concern that delaying the drainage project could raise water levels in central Amman and again flood it during the winter.

Amman has seen rapid growth in the last few decades as a result of waves of refugees from the Arab-Israel conflicts and regional turmoil that transformed it from a sleepy city to one of the Middle East's largest urban centres.

BHASAN CHAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - As a Bangladeshi naval ship anchored off a remote Bay of Bengal island, some of the Rohingya Muslim refugees aboard clapped in anticipation of starting a new life on a piece of land that did not even exist two decades ago.
Carrying poultry and sacks of belongings, they are part of a second group of about 1,800 Rohingya that Bangladesh moved on Tuesday from cramped refugee camps on the mainland to the low-lying island despite opposition from rights groups.
""Welcome to Bhasan Char,"" read a banner as the refugees walked off the jetty on the island, nearly as big as Manhattan. Navy trucks and tractor trailers took them to multiple rows of concrete houses with their pinkish-red painted tin roofs.
A Reuters photographer was among a team of journalists given rare access to the island that is about three hours from the nearest port in Chittagong, and is fully exposed to nature's vagaries in a country with a tragic history of deadly storms.
Bangladesh says it has spent more than $350 million of its own money to ready housing and other infrastructure to voluntarily move some 100,000 Rohingya to the island in an effort to ease overcrowding in camps near the Myanmar border, even though rights groups said many were being coerced or paid to move. The government denies the charges.
""Mashallah! Wonderful place,"" one man, a father of six, exclaimed using an Arabic expression for appreciation at the arrangements at Bhasan Char. 
""We are so happy with the accommodation. The children are so excited to see the playground,"" he said, but added: ""We just pray floods don't kill us.""
CHEEK BY JOWL
The government said earlier this month that the housing was built on concrete foundation which could withstand natural disasters, noting it withstood cyclone Amphan in May which killed more than 100 people in Bangladesh and eastern India.
A middle-aged man who reached Bhasan Char with his wife and three children on Tuesday said his camp leader had convinced him that they were better off relocating than staying back in the dilapidated shelters on the mainland where one million of them live cheek by jowl.
Reuters is withholding the names of the Rohingya to protect their identity as some in the community are against the move to the isolated island from where they won't be allowed to leave without government permission.
The government has built a 2-metre (6.5 feet) high embankment for 12 kms (7.5 miles) to protect the island, where sheep grazed on its greenish-grey grass as the new arrivals were screened for coronavirus by health workers in white overalls.
Reuters was not allowed to meet with a previous group of some 1,600 Rohingya that was relocated early this month, but a Navy SUV drove journalists through the cemented lanes separating neat rows of grey-walled housing blocks with wide porches.
Journalists were also shown around an empty room with two steel-and-plastic bunk beds for four people, a community kitchen with multiple stoves separated by small concrete partitions and a fresh-water pond. A big white bungalow enclosed with a fence is reserved for VVIPs in case anyone fancies a visit.

""The Rohingya people who have shifted there are very happy with the arrangement,"" Foreign Minister Abdul Momen told Reuters.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2020 09:46AM ET</span>","Pierre Cardin, father of fashion branding, dies at 98","By Sarah White and Brian Love
PARIS -French couturier Pierre Cardin, who made his name by selling designer clothes to the masses, and his fortune by being the first to exploit that name as a brand for selling everything from cars to perfume, died on Tuesday aged 98. 
In a career spanning more than 60 years, Cardin drew scorn and admiration from fellow fashion designers for his brash business sense, and influenced catwalks with his space-age, futuristic bubble dresses and geometrical cuts and patterns. 
Cardin, who was a mentor to designers such as Jean Paul Gaultier, was active in fashion circles until the last, still taking young designers under his wing, attending parties and events and regularly visiting his Paris office by Jaguar. 
""Thank you Mr Cardin for opening me the doors to fashion and for making my dream possible,"" Gaultier wrote on Twitter.
Cardin was the first designer to sell clothes collections in department stores in the late 1950s, and the first to enter the licensing business for perfumes, accessories and even food - which later drove profits for many other fashion houses.
""It's all the same to me whether I am doing sleeves for dresses or table legs,"" a telling quote on his website once read. 
Hard as it may be to imagine decades later, Armani chocolates, Bulgari hotels and Gucci sunglasses are all based on Cardin's realisation that a fashion brand's glamour had endless merchandising potential.
Over the years his name has been stamped on razor blades, household goods, and tacky accessories - even cheap boxer shorts.
He once said it would not bother him to have his initials, PC, etched into rolls of toilet paper, and he was also the inspiration for a phallus-like perfume flask. 
His detractors accused him of destroying the value of his brand and the notion of luxury in general. But he seemed largely unaffected by criticism.
""I had a sense for marketing my name,"" Cardin told Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper in 2007. ""Does money spoil one's ideas? I don't dream of money after all, but while I'm dreaming, I'm making money. It's never been about the money.""
He maintained that he built his business empire without ever asking a bank for a loan.
Born near Venice on July 2, 1922, to French parents of Italian descent, Cardin was educated in the not-so-glamorous French city of Saint Etienne.
He went to work for a tailor in nearby Vichy at age 17 and dreamt for a time of becoming an actor, doing some work on the stage as well as modelling and dancing professionally.
'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST'
When he came to Paris in 1945, he made theatrical masks and costumes for Jean Cocteau's film, ""Beauty and the Beast"", and a year later joined the then-unknown Christian Dior.
His first big commercial venture, when he teamed up with the Printemps department store in the late 1950s, led to him being briefly expelled from the rarified guild of French fashion designers, the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture.
Couturiers in that club were forbidden at that time to show outside their Paris salons, let alone in department stores.
He also blazed a trail outside France long before other fashion multinationals in search of new markets.
He presented a collection in Communist China in 1979 when it was still largely closed to the outside world. And just two years after the Berlin Wall came down, in 1991, a Cardin fashion show on Moscow's Red Square attracted a crowd of 200,000.
Cardin also expanded into new businesses, buying fabled Paris restaurant Maxim's in the 1980s and opening replica outlets around the world. He leveraged the investment further by launching Minim's, a chain of fancy fast-food joints that reproduced the Belle Epoque decor of the original exclusive Paris eatery. 
His empire embraces perfumes, foods, industrial design, real estate, entertainment and even fresh flowers.
True to his taste for futuristic designs, Cardin also owns the Palais des Bulles, or Bubble Palace, a residence-cum-events-venue woven into the cliffs on one of the most exclusive strips of the French riviera.
Not too far away, there is also a chateau in the village of Lacoste that once belonged to the Marquis de Sade.
In February this year he teamed up with a designer seven decades his junior.
Pierre Courtial, 27, unveiled a collection at Cardin's studio on Paris's chic Rue Saint-Honore, with pieces that echoed some of the veteran designer's geometrical aesthetics.
Cardin said he still rated originality above anything else.

""I've always tried to be different, to be myself,"" he told Reuters. ""Whether people like it or not, that's not what matters.""

Pop star Bobi Wine has emerged as the strongest challenger to President Yoweri Museveni in the presidential election scheduled for Jan. 14. 
On Sunday Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said one of his bodyguards was killed when military police ran him over while Wine's convoy was taking a wounded journalist to seek medical help. Military police said the bodyguard had fallen from a speeding car.
""We are gravely concerned by the election-related violence, the excessive use of force by security personnel, as well as the increasing crackdown on peaceful protesters, political and civil society leaders and human rights defenders,"" the U.N. experts said in a statement.
Both the president's and government's spokesmen declined to take calls from Reuters seeking comment.
Wine says violence by security forces against his presidential campaign has escalated as popular support for it has grown.
In November, at least 54 people died after protests erupted following Wine's brief detention over alleged violations of COVID-related social distancing measures.
    Police said at the time they arrested nearly 600 people and accused protesters - who authorities deployed the military to help disperse - of rioting and looting.
Rights lawyer and government critic Nicholas Opiyo was charged with money laundering last week in a case his organisation said was part of a crackdown on dissent and which the U.N. experts said appeared to be ""strictly related to the electoral context"".
Opiyo heads watchdog Chapter Four Uganda, which has helped to defend leaders and supporters of opposition parties detained on political charges.

In the past five months, there have also been 16 attacks on journalists covering election-related events, according to the Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda.

Martin, who formally offered his resignation on his 75th birthday in April, will be replaced by Bishop Dermot Pius Farrell, the Vatican said in a statement. 
Archbishop of Dublin since 2004, Martin has been critical of the Church's handling of sexual abuse scandals and told the Irish Times last year that the Church was ""imprisoned in its past"" and needed renewal. 
Years of scandals have shattered the credibility of the Church, which until four decades ago had dominated Irish society. In the last five years of Martin's term, Irish voters approved abortion and gay marriage in referendums, defying the Church's wishes.
""It's not enough simply to say sorry. Structures that permit or facilitate abuse must be broken down and broken down forever,"" Martin told a Mass days before the 2018 visit of Pope Francis.
Martin recently named a 2011 service of repentance in which he washed the feet of abuse victims at Dublin's Procathedral as one of his strongest memories. 
The 66-year-old Farrell, currently the bishop of Ossory, praised Martin for taking ""very difficult and courageous decisions"" during his time as archbishop. In an interview with RTE Radio, he described his task as ""daunting"".
Farrell has spent almost all his clerical career in Ireland, apart from several years in Rome, where he received a doctorate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University.

Before becoming archbishop of Dublin, Martin had served as a diplomat at the United Nations in New York and Geneva and as secretary of the Vatican's Council for Justice and Peace.

BHASAN CHAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh moved a second group of Rohingya Muslim refugees to a low-lying island in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday, despite opposition from rights groups worried about the new site's vulnerability to storms.
The United Nations says it has not been involved in the relocation but urged the government to ensure no refugee is forced to move to Bhasan Char island, which only emerged from the sea 20 years ago.
The Bangladesh navy took the 1,804 Rohingya to the island in five ships, with the refugees sitting on wooden benches on deck, some clutching ducks, pigeons and chickens in bamboo baskets and wearing orange life vests and masks against the coronavirus.
A first group of 1,642 Rohingya, members of a minority group who have fled from violence in Myanmar, were relocated from their camps near the Myanmar border to the isolated island earlier in the month.
The move has faced opposition, especially from aid groups worried about a disaster in a country that regularly faces severe weather, especially along its coast.
In 1991, nearly 143,000 people were killed when a cyclone whipped up a 4.5-metre (15-foot) tidal surge.
The government has built a 2-metre (6.5 feet) high embankment for 12-km (7.5 mile) to protect the island along with housing for 100,000 people. It dismisses the risks.
""The island is completely safe,"" Foreign Minister Abdul Momen told Reuters in the capital, Dhaka.
Upon reaching the island, navy personnel on a jetty helped the refugees ashore, many of them with sacks of belongings slung over their shoulders.
""Bhasan Char is better,"" said one middle-aged man who arrived with his wife and three children from a refugee camp of bamboo and plastic shelters packed across muddy hills near the Myanmar border, where some one million Rohingya live.
The man said the head of his old camp had convinced him that the island was a better option.
Reuters is withholding the names of refugees going to the island because of the controversy surrounding the relocation with many refugees keen to stay on the mainland and opposed to the move.
'SUFFERING AND CONFLICT'
Tractor trailers and army trucks took the refugees to their new concrete homes and bunk beds. Navy officials took a Reuters photographer to a farm where sheep grazed on the greenish-gray grass overlooked by a watchtower.
The government says the relocation is voluntary but some refugees from the first group have spoken about being coerced to go. The human rights group Amnesty International also expressed concern.
""(A) lack of transparency in the consultation process with refugees, and allegations from within the community about cash incentives being offered to Rohingya families to relocate to Bhashan Char as well as use of intimidation tactics are making the relocation process questionable,"" the group said.
Foreign Minister Momen rejected such doubts.
""The Rohingya people who have shifted there are very happy with the arrangement. Some evil groups are spreading negative propaganda,"" he said.
Two Rohingya men told Reuters they moved to their new home voluntarily, one to join relatives, the other in ""hope of a better life"" with his wife and six children.
""There's so much suffering and conflict in the camp,"" said the father, referring to his old refugee-camp home.
A young Rohingya man, who moved in the first group, sent Reuters a phone video of his new room with bedding for four, and said he was urging friends back in the camps to consider the island.
""Happy with everything here but feeling anxious for my friends and teachers,"" the 18-year-old said. 

""They don't want to come here. They've got used to the camps.""

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Thousands of opponents of Nepal's Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli marched through the streets of Kathmandu on Tuesday urging him to reverse his decision to dissolve parliament and call for early elections.
The protesters, who say his decision on Dec. 20 was unconstitutional, rallied outside his office despite coronavirus curbs on gatherings.
Oli says internal squabbling and a lack of cooperation from his party have paralysed decision-making, forcing him to seek a new popular mandate.
Police officials overseeing security said at least 10,000 people were on the streets to participate in the march, one of the most intense protests the country has witnessed since Oli dissolved parliament. 
""We have tactfully managed the rally of about 10,000 protesters,"" said Basanta Bahadur Kunwar, a police spokesman.
The country's top court will in January continue hearing dozens of petitions filed against Oli's political move and his plans to press ahead with parliamentary elections next year on April 30 and May 10, less than two years before the scheduled date.

""The prime minister has no authority to dissolve the parliament under the constitution. Therefore, he should reverse his decision immediately,"" said 19-year-old student Rajesh Thapa, waving a flag with a red hammer and sickle printed on it, a symbol of the ruling Communist party.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Lawmakers in a central Indian state controlled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party approved legislation on Tuesday that would make pressuring a woman to convert to their husband's religion a crime punishable with imprisonment.
Although no religion is specified in the legislation, critics say it is aimed against the country's Muslim minority. Hardline Hindu groups have accused Muslim men of waging a campaign, dubbed a ""Love Jihad"", to lure Hindu women to Islam with promises of marriage.
The Freedom of Religion Bill, 2020 will be enacted in Madhya Pradesh once it receives approval from the state's governor, a leader in Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
""This law will prevent innocent girls being forcefully converted on pretext of marriage,"" said Narottam Mishra, home minister in the state's BJP-led government.
Virtually identical legislation was passed last month in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, a northern state also controlled by the BJP. Thirty Muslim men were arrested there earlier this month under the new law for allegedly compelling women to change their religion after getting married.
Other Indian states - Haryana, Karnataka and Assam - have said that they are planning to bring in similar anti-conversion laws. 
Under the new law, a man and woman belonging to different religions will have to give at least two months notice to the district magistrate before they get married and they will be given permission if there are no objections.
Politicians in Madhya Pradesh have also campaigned for years against Christian missionaries, accusing them of offering financial aid and free education to persuade people to convert to Christianity.

GAZA (Reuters) - An array of Palestinian militant groups launched rockets into the Mediterranean Sea off the Gaza Strip on Tuesday at the start of what they called their first-ever joint exercise, which Israeli media described as a show of force organised by Iran.
Gaza is run by Hamas and also home to other militant groups, including Islamic Jihad. The exercise was announced on behalf of a joint command set up by the groups in 2018.
Eight rockets streaked through a cloudless sky in Gaza towards the Mediterranean after Abu Hamza, spokesman for Islamic Jihad, delivered a speech launching the drill. It will include land and coastal exercises described by the groups as a test of their preparedness for any future confrontation with Israel.
Israeli media said the drill was organised by the militants' sponsors in Tehran to demonstrate risks Israel could face if Iran comes under U.S. or Israeli attack in the waning days of the Trump administration.
On the eve of the exercise, a large portrait of Iranian military commander General Qassem Soleimani, who was killed last January in a U.S. attack in Iraq, was erected along Gaza's main coastal road.
Tensions between Iran and Israel have risen since the Nov. 27 assassination of top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh. Iran has blamed Israel for his death; Israel has neither confirmed nor denied a role.
Tuesday's Gaza missile display did not trigger any sirens in Israel, whose drones keep a close eye on Gaza and which employs a sophisticated missile interception system.

Due to last 24 hours, the exercise included fighters from Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Popular Resistance Committees and smaller armed groups.

Father Sergiy, whose real name is Nikolai Romanov, gained prominence earlier this year after denying the existence of the COVID-19 pandemic, railing against church closures due to the lockdown, and criticising the Russian Orthodox Church.
He seized control of the Sredneuralsky women's monastery near Yekaterinburg in the Urals in June and refused to leave. 
Fond of wearing long dark robes, he was formally cast out of the church in September for openly ignoring a ban on him holding services and preaching. 
Footage posted online showed a melee of riot police and people shouting outside the convent during the raid. 
His lawyer confirmed his detention and said Father Sergiy had been charged with encouraging minors to commit suicide, the Kommersant newspaper reported. 
The case against him may relate to a YouTube video in which he called on his followers to die for Russia.

Up to last week, around 162,000 deaths were reported in the country of 17 million this year, 13,000 more than would have been expected in a regular year, the CBS said.
""Such an increase of the number of deceased has not been reported since World War Two,"" it said.
Around 9,000 people more than normal died during the first wave of the COVID-19 infections between early March and early May, the CBS said, while more than 6,000 extra fatalities have been reported since the start of the second wave mid-September.
The number of deaths was lower than normal in most other weeks, the statisticians said.
A total of 770,400 people in the Netherlands have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. More than 11,000 patients are known to have died from the disease. 

The actual number of infections and fatalities is likely to be significantly higher, as a shortage of testing and lab capacity meant only seriously ill patients were tested during the first months of the pandemic.

The Oakland Police Department said late Monday it was looking into the incident, although it had not identified any suspects or motives. The statue was found smashed on Saturday, about two weeks after it was installed.
Leo Carson, the artist who created the bust, told the media that he considered the smashing of Taylor's statue ""an act of racist aggression aimed at suppressing the fight for Black freedom.""
The ceramic bust depicted a smiling Taylor and was installed in downtown Oakland near City Hall. On its base is a plaque that reads ""Say her name: Breonna Taylor.""
Taylor, a Black emergency medical technician, was shot and killed during a botched police raid of her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, early on March 13.
Taylor's boyfriend, who was with her when the police burst into the home, fired once at what he said he believed were intruders. Three police officers responded with 32 shots, six of which struck Taylor, killing her. 
The case came back to light as demonstrations against racism and police brutality spread across the U.S. after the death in May of George Floyd, a Black man was killed when a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

(Reuters) - A white police officer in Columbus, Ohio, was fired on Monday for fatally shooting an unarmed Black man last week in what the city's police chief deemed an ""unreasonable use of deadly force,"" the city's public safety director said.
The dismissal of Adam Coy, a 19-year veteran of the Columbus police force, followed the recommendation of Chief Thomas Quinlan, who concluded that Andre Maurice Hill, 47, was the victim of an act of ""senseless violence"" when he was gunned down last Tuesday.
Hill was shot to death in the garage of a house where he had been staying as a guest in Ohio's capital.
""The actions of Adam Coy do not live up to the oath of a Columbus police officer, or the standards we, and the community, demand of our officers,"" Ned Pettus, the city's public safety director, wrote in a statement announcing his decision.
Pettus' decision capped a disciplinary hearing that came three days after Quinlan concluded his own expedited review, finding that Coy had engaged in ""critical misconduct"" that should cost him his job.
A separate state-level criminal probe of the shooting is ongoing.
In addition to calling the shooting ""an unreasonable use of deadly force,"" Quinlan faulted Coy for failing to immediately render medical aid to Hill after he was shot and for not activating his body-worn camera at the outset of the confrontation.
The shooting came after neighbors placed a non-emergency call to police in the early hours of Dec. 22 to complain that someone was repeatedly turning a car on and off in the middle of the night, authorities said.
Footage from Coy's body camera showed Hill emerging from the shadows of the garage holding up a glowing cellphone in one hand before the officer opened fire. 
Hill's other hand was obscured from sight, according to the initial police report, but no weapon was ever recovered.
Although neither Coy nor a second officer on the scene activated their bodycams until just after shots were fired, the moments before and during the shooting were captured on video without sound by way of an automatic 60-second ""look-back"" function.
Once the audio comes on, Coy is heard shouting at Hill to make his hands visible and roll onto his stomach as Hill lies moaning on the ground beside the car.
His death marked the second fatal shooting of an African American man in a month by Columbus law enforcement officers under questionable circumstances.

Casey Christopher Goodson, 23, was shot dead outside his home on Dec. 4 by a Franklin County sheriff's deputy assigned to a team of U.S. marshals searching for a fugitive in Goodson's neighborhood, authorities said.

A cluster detected in Sydney's northern beachside suburbs in mid-December has now grown to 129 cases and about a quarter of a million residents have been put under lockdown until Jan. 9 as authorities battle to stamp out the virus.
NSW reported three cases, all linked to the Sydney cluster, in the 24 hours to 8 pm on Monday - its lowest daily rise in coronavirus infections in nearly two weeks.
Three cases were detected after the 2000 daily deadline, which are under investigation, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.
""I am not ruling out they are linked to the (Sydney) cluster... but until those links are established all of us in Greater Sydney must be on high alert,"" Berejiklian said.
""We do not want people to think we're out of the woods, every time we get a couple of cases overnight which are not directly linked to the Northern Beaches it gives us concern."" 
Sydney, Australia's largest city, has scaled back its New Year's Eve celebrations by banning large gatherings outdoors to watch its popular fireworks display, and urged people to stay home and watch the event on television. 
Only residents with permits for hospitality venues will be allowed into the city on New Year's Eve and households across Sydney are only allowed to host 10 people. Outdoor gatherings are limited to 50 people. 
Australia has largely avoided the high infections and deaths from the novel coronavirus compared with many other developed countries. It has recorded just over 28,300 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began.

The National Assembly, overseen by opposition leader Juan Guaido, has declared Dec. 6 parliamentary elections in which allies of Maduro's ruling socialists won a majority as ""illegitimate"", and over the weekend voted to prolong its mandate.
Venezuela's mainstream opposition parties boycotted the vote on the basis that they would not be free and fair. Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup, has said the electoral conditions were as transparent as when the opposition won a majority in the parliament in 2015. 
""In the face of unconstitutional claims to self-proclaim term extensions that are not warranted, we trust that the justice system will do its job with an iron fist,"" Maduro said in a state television appearance with members of the military. 
The parliament's move to extend its term comes as dozens of legislators facing criminal investigation for alleged crimes like treason have fled the country. Others have expressed unwillingness to continue serving in congress due to what they describe as persecution the government. 
Guaido labels Maduro a corrupt dictator who has overseen the economic collapse of the once-prosperous OPEC nation. 

Guaido is recognized by dozens of Western democracies that have questioned the legitimacy of Maduro's 2018 re-election vote as Venezuela's rightful leader, due to his position as the National Assembly's speaker.

The storm, which chilled Los Angeles to a low 46 degrees Fahrenheit - about 5 degrees colder than the same December day in New York City, will not taper off until overnight, said Brian Hurley, a senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.
The storm arrived early on Monday, bringing winds, some hail and thunderstorms and some flooding, driven by a cold front pushing east off the Pacific Ocean and into Arizona, he said. 
""It's been dry. This is the first real, significant snow and rainfall event of the season in Southern California,"" Hurley said. ""That brings with it the risk of mudslides in the burn-scar areas left over in the foothills from all the wildfires this year. 
""That's a major risk and rain isn't expected to taper until after maybe, midnight,"" he added.
Local fire stations in Los Angeles County were offering sandbags for residents in the foothills near burn areas, ahead of potential mudslides, social media reported.
The Los Angeles County Fire Department reported the rescue of two motorists trapped by rising waters from the Los Angeles River whose vehicle was stranded. No injuries were reported.
The last heavy rain in Southern California was in April, the weather service said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday denied bail to Ghislaine Maxwell, citing the risk the British socialite might flee from charges she assisted in the late financier Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking of girls.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan said federal prosecutors persuaded her that Maxwell ""poses a flight risk"" despite her proposed $28.5 million bail package, and should remain jailed because ""no conditions of release"" reasonably assured she would appear in court.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom girls as young as 14 years old for sex in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for denying her involvement under oath.
She has been jailed at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn following her July 2 arrest at her New Hampshire home, where prosecutors said she was hiding out.
The proposed bail package included $22.5 million posted by Maxwell and her husband, as well as home confinement with electronic monitoring and 24-hour guard to ensure Maxwell remained safe and would not escape.
Maxwell said she wanted to stay in New York to clear her name, while her lawyers objected to jail conditions including invasive searches and surveillance by flashlight-toting guards who woke her every 15 minutes to ensure she was still breathing.
But Nathan, who rejected a $5 million bail package for Maxwell in July, said none of the new arguments had a ""material bearing"" on whether Maxwell was a flight risk.
In opposing bail, prosecutors cited Maxwell's abilities to hide her wealth and evade capture, and the prospect she might flee to France or the United Kingdom, where she holds citizenships and they said she might elude extradition.
Maxwell faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted. Her trial is scheduled for July 12, 2021.
Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr criticized errors by jail personnel that he said contributed to Epstein's death.
Nathan described her ""bottom line"" conclusions in a two-page order. A longer opinion explaining her reasoning will be filed after lawyers for Maxwell and the government propose redactions to account for potentially confidential information.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The federal appeals court in Manhattan on Monday blocked New York state restrictions on the size of religious gatherings put in place to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, the Orthodox Jewish group Agudath Israel of America and two synagogues in enjoining New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's Oct. 6 attendance caps at ""houses of worship.""
The governor limited attendance to the lesser of 10 people or 25% capacity in ""red"" zones where the coronavirus risk was highest, and 25 people or 33% capacity in slightly less risky ""orange"" zones, even in buildings that seat hundreds.
Circuit Judge Michael Park said the plaintiffs established irreparable harm by showing the restrictions impaired their free exercise of religion.
He also said ""no public interest is served by maintaining an unconstitutional policy when constitutional alternatives are available to achieve the same goal.""
Cuomo's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Monday's decision followed the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling on Nov. 25 against enforcing the caps.
The majority, comprising most of the court's conservative wing, said the restrictions ""strike at the very heart of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious liberty,"" and that ""even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten.""
Cuomo has said that ruling had no practical effect because some restrictions were lifted as COVID-19 flare-ups eased.
The appeals court returned Agudath Israel's case to a Brooklyn federal judge to decide, under a ""strict scrutiny"" standard, whether the 25% and 33% limits were constitutional.
Avi Schick, a lawyer for Agudath Israel, said Monday's decision ""will be felt way beyond the COVID context. It is a clear statement ... that government can't disfavor religious conduct merely because it sees no value in religious practice.""
Randy Mastro, the diocese's lawyer, said the diocese was ""gratified,"" and will welcome parishioners to mass ""under strict protocols"" that keep them safe.

692,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 03:06PM ET</span>",'He was not on our radar': authorities search for motive in Nashville blast,"By Nathan Layne and Mark Hosenball
(Reuters) -Federal, state and local law enforcement officers on Monday were searching for the motive behind a bombing that rocked Nashville on Christmas morning, with no concrete clues yet emerging as to why the 63-year-old suspect carried out his suicide mission.
The FBI on Sunday identified the suspect as Anthony Q. Warner and said he died in the blast, which damaged more than 40 businesses in downtown Nashville, Tennessee's largest city and the United States' country music capital.
Warner's motor home exploded at dawn on Friday soon after police, who were responding to reports of gunfire, heard music and an automated message emanating from the vehicle warning of a bomb. Police hurried to evacuate people in the area, and Warner is the only person known to have perished.
David Rausch, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, said on Monday that Warner's mother was cooperating with the multiagency investigation but that motive remained elusive. The TBI released Warner's criminal history, showing a single marijuana charge more than four decades ago.
""He was not on our radar,"" Rausch told a news briefing, explaining that the TBI was helping the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to interview neighbors and relatives. ""We are all taking pieces of the puzzle, working to determine what the motivation was for this individual."" 
The bombing took place in the early morning when there was little activity in the city. In addition to the warning, the audio on Warner's recreational vehicle played a recording of Petula Clark's 1964 hit ""Downtown"" before the blast. 
Nashville Mayor John Cooper has said that local officials felt there had to be some connection between the bombing, which occurred near an AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) transmission building on the city's bustling Second Avenue, and the company. At the briefing on Monday, Rausch said Warner's father had worked for AT&T but that it was unclear if that was in any way connected.
""So far the interviews conducted and evidence collected indicate he was the only one responsible for this act,"" FBI agent Jason Pack said in an interview, adding that it could take weeks before a motive could be determined.
One the avenues investigators are pursuing is the nature of Warner's suspected mental health problems, according to a person familiar with the investigation.
Nashville Councilman At-Large Bob Mendes said that while it seems Warner took steps with the warning to limit deaths, the bombing was likely to be labeled domestic terrorism once the suspect's agenda becomes clear. 
""You don't go out of your way to build a bomb this big,"" said Mendes, a lawyer. ""He had to have had a callous disregard for whether there would be a loss of life.""
The explosion injured three people and disrupted mobile, internet and TV services across central Tennessee and parts of four other states. AT&T said on Monday that it had restored services to nearly all impacted homes.
Among other steps, investigators searched Warner's home on Saturday and visited Fridrich & Clark Realty, a Nashville real estate agency where he had worked part-time, providing computer consulting services before retiring earlier this month.
""The Tony Warner we knew is a nice person who never exhibited any behavior which was less than professional,"" Steve Fridrich, owner of the real estate firm, said in a statement.

Speaking to Fox News on Monday, Tennessee Governor Bill Lee described the damage in Nashville as ""enormous"" and said he expected President Donald Trump would shortly grant his request to declare a state of emergency to assist the state.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government declared victory after seizing Mekelle from the former local ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), on Nov. 28. 
By mid-December, it was sending civil servants back to work and reopening air space, while some power and telecoms links were restored after a blackout.
Fana cited an interview conducted by state-run Ethiopia Press Agency with Mekelle's mayor Ataklti Haile Selassie, in which he said banks had opened their doors.
The conflict between federal forces and the TPLF is believed to have killed thousands and displaced around 950,000 people. 
World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is of Tigrayan descent and whom Ethiopia's military has accused of supporting the TPLF, spoke emotionally about the conflict in an end-of-year message on Monday. 
Tedros, who has denied accusations of trying to procure arms and diplomatic support for Tigrayan fighters, said he had many relatives including his younger brother in the region, but had heard nothing from them after communications were cut.
""I don't know where they are,"" he told a news conference about the coronavirus from WHO headquarters in Geneva.
""As if COVID is not enough, I have that personal pain also ... I worry about the whole country, I cannot worry about my younger brother or my relatives alone, because the situation is worsening ... So carrying all this is tough.""
Aid agencies have struggled to gain access to Tigray and are concerned about food running out, especially in refugee camps.
Abiy's government says the conflict is finished. 
Ethiopia has an election scheduled for June and is drafting a bill to create a stock market.

TPLF leaders have said they were fighting back from mountain hideouts, but there have been no reports of battles since earlier this month.

694,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 02:17PM ET</span>",Ethiopian police arrest Reuters cameraman,"NAIROBI (Reuters) -A Reuters cameraman, Kumerra Gemechu, was arrested in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on Thursday and will be kept in custody for at least two weeks, his family said. He has not been charged.
No reason was provided to the family for Thursday's arrest, and police did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Kumerra, 38, has worked for Reuters as a freelance cameraman for a decade. 
At a brief court hearing on Friday, where no lawyer was present, a judge ordered Kumerra's detention for a further 14 days to give police time to investigate, the family said.
In a statement on Monday, Reuters news agency strongly condemned Kumerra's detention. The arrest followed the beating of a Reuters photographer, Tiksa Negeri, by two Ethiopian federal police officers on Dec. 16.
""Kumerra is part of a Reuters team that reports from Ethiopia in a fair, independent and unbiased way. Kumerra’s work demonstrates his professionalism and impartiality, and we are aware of no basis for his detention,"" Editor-in-Chief Stephen J. Adler said in the statement. 
""Journalists must be allowed to report the news in the public interest without fear of harassment or harm, wherever they are. We will not rest until Kumerra is freed,"" Adler said.
Around 10 armed federal police officers arrived at Kumerra's home in Addis Ababa on Thursday evening and took him away in handcuffs in front of his wife and three children, his wife Hawi Desalegn said. She added that his eldest daughter, who is 10, clung to him screaming as he was led away.
Police also confiscated Kumerra's phone, a computer, flash drives and papers, according to the family. 
JOURNALISTS ARRESTED
Kumerra's arrest follows government pressure on journalists for some international news outlets which have been covering the conflict in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region, where government forces have been battling the former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
Kumerra covered the Tigray conflict, but Reuters was unable to determine whether his arrest was connected to his work. Government officials did not respond to questions from Reuters about whether his coverage was at issue.
Ethiopia's media authority, the Ethiopian Broadcasting Authority, accused Reuters and other international media outlets in a Nov. 23 statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of ""false"" and ""unbalanced"" coverage of the fighting in Tigray.
""We stand by our reporting on the conflict in the Tigray region and will continue to report on Ethiopia with integrity, independence, and freedom from bias, as we do all around the world,"" Reuters said in a separate statement.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said Kumerra's detention was ""the latest example of how press freedom is fast eroding under Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed after a short-lived hope of reform.""
When CPJ carried out its annual census of jailed journalists on Dec. 1, there were at least seven journalists in custody in Ethiopia for their work, CPJ said in a statement on Monday. 
Five of those arrests took place after the Tigray fighting broke out on Nov. 4, according to CPJ.
In a tweet linked to the Reuters report on Kumerra's arrest, Tibor Nagy, the top U.S. diplomat for Africa, said he was ""extremely concerned by continuing reports of intimidation of journalists in Ethiopia.""
""Freedom of the press is fundamental to any democratic society,"" said Nagy, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs. ""U.S. resolve to see media freedom respected remains unshaken.""
Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and around 950,000 displaced in the month-long conflict. The government says it is now in control of the restive region, but it tightly controls access, and some areas still do not have cell phone coverage.
Ethiopia's government, which the TPLF dominated for nearly three decades, frequently jailed critics, including politicians and journalists. 
When Abiy came to power in 2018 after protests against the government, he speeded up democratic reforms and oversaw the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners. 
However, local and international rights groups have expressed concern about the arrests of thousands of other people following outbreaks of deadly violence around the country. 
The government has said those arrested were suspected of fomenting the bloodshed.

""One of the government's primary roles and responsibilities is ensuring security and stability and that the rule of law prevails,"" Billene Seyoum, a spokeswoman for the prime minister, told Reuters in August after more than 9,000 people were arrested following deadly clashes in the capital and surrounding Oromiya region.

Felix Vasquez, a defender of environmental and human rights, died on Saturday night after the attack in the village El Ocotal, in central Honduras. 
A law enforcement spokesman told Reuters the killing was under investigation. 
""Police authorities immediately decided to initiate a corresponding investigation... we hope to have an answer soon,"" police official Kevin Hernandez told journalists. 
Honduras is one of the world's most dangerous countries for activists, with 14 land and environmental defenders killed last year, up from four people in 2018, according to data made available by advocacy group Global Witness.
Vasquez, a member of the indigenous Lenca community which lives in the mountainous region near the border with El Salvador, had intended to run for Congress as a member of the opposition LIBRE party in 2021 elections.
He had filed complaints to national authorities starting in 2017 over alleged political persecution due to his work in environmental activism, according to the Coalition against Impunity (CCI), a non-government organization. 
""The state is directly responsible for his murder due to its omissions in the face of the serious risks of which it was duly aware,"" the CCI said.
The Honduran government did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Vasquez's killing comes four years after the assassination of Lenca indigenous activist Berta Caceres, a veteran land rights defender who led a battle against a major dam on ancestral lands before she was shot to death at her home.

Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's leading critics, was airlifted to Germany for treatment in August after collapsing on a plane in what Germany and other Western nations say was an attempt to murder him with a Novichok nerve agent.
Russia has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned and has denied any involvement in the incident. 
The Federal Prison Service (FSIN) on Monday accused Navalny of violating the terms of a suspended prison sentence he is still serving out over a conviction dating from 2014, and of evading the supervision of Russia's criminal inspection authority.
Citing an article in the British medical publication The Lancet about his treatment, it said Navalny had been discharged from hospital in Berlin on Sept. 20 and that all symptoms of what it called his illness had vanished by Oct. 12. 
""Therefore the convicted man is not fulfilling all of the obligations placed on him by the court, and is evading the supervision of the Criminal Inspectorate,"" it said. 
Navalny is serving out a suspended three-and-a-half-year prison term over a theft case he says was politically-motivated. His probation period expires on Dec. 30. 
The prison service said in a statement late on Monday that it had summoned Navalny to report to the inspection authority and that his suspended sentence could be changed to a real jail term if his suspected violations of the terms of the suspended sentence were proven to be true. 
The prison service mentioned no deadline, but Navalny posted a screenshot of a message to his lawyer which said he had until 0900 on Tuesday to return and show up at a Moscow office. 
His spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said on Twitter, it was impossible for Navalny to return in time, that he was still convalescing after his poisoning, and accused the prison service of acting on orders from the Kremlin. 
""There's no way he could appear at the Moscow Criminal Inspectorate tomorrow. But does the FSIN really care about common sense? They were given an order, they are fulfilling it,"" she wrote. 

The Kremlin has said Navalny is free to return to Russia at any time like any other Russian citizen.

Taking advantage of Dec. 28, Day of the Holy Innocents, a celebration associated with practical jokes in Mexico, Lopez Obrador opened his news briefing by saying he would in future hold only one conference a week, at midday on Wednesdays.
Adopting a line in stark contrast to what he often argues, Lopez Obrador said with a straight face he had made the decision because the quality of public information was improving.
""The majority of the news media in the country are carrying out their duty professionally, there is accurate, real news, the media are objective,"" he said.
However, around 40 minutes later he returned to a familiar refrain, referring to ""conservative"" media as ""hypocrites"" - then noted with a smile that he would, in fact, continue to hold his morning news conferences as his right to reply.
""Do you really think we're not going to have the morning conferences? All the subsidized conservative press would be rubbing its hands,"" he said, adding that most of the traditional print and broadcast media in the country were against him.
On social media, skepticism had greeted the president's announcement that he was serious about ending the conferences.
Before he admitted it was a joke, many of Mexico's main newspapers did not carry a story on the front of their websites about what would have been a major change in policy.

Since taking office two years ago, Lopez Obrador has used the conferences, which begin at 7 a.m. and can last over two hours, to set the political agenda and take critics to task.

Russia first passed a law in 2012 allowing it to label foreign-funded non-governmental organisations and rights groups it viewed as engaged in political activity as ""foreign agents"", a term with negative Soviet-era connotations. 
The law was later expanded to label ""foreign agent"" media outlets and independent journalists and bloggers. Rights groups say the law is open to abuse and has been used to stifle dissent and harass civil society groups. 
On Monday, the justice ministry announced the addition of Ponomaryov, 79, a longtime critic of President Vladimir Putin, to its list of media foreign agents alongside four other people, including a journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 
Until now, the list had only contained the names of media outlets, including various regional services of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty as well as the Voice of America and a Czech outlet. 
Ponomaryov said he was unsure how the designation would affect him and that he was surprised that he, as a non-journalist, had been named, the Interfax news agency reported. 

Rights groups and other organisations designated by the justice ministry as foreign agents can be subjected to spot checks and face bureaucratic scrutiny.

Zhang Zhan, 37, the first such person known to have been tried, was among a handful of people whose firsthand accounts from crowded hospitals and empty streets painted a more dire picture of the pandemic epicentre than the official narrative. 
""I don't understand. All she did was say a few true words, and for that she got four years,"" said Shao Wenxia, Zhang's mother, who attended the trial with her husband.
Zhang's lawyer Ren Quanniu told Reuters: ""We will probably appeal.""
The trial was held at a court in Pudong, a district of the business hub of Shanghai.
""Ms Zhang believes she is being persecuted for exercising her freedom of speech,"" Ren had said before the trial.
Critics say that China deliberately arranged for Zhang's trial to take place during the Western holiday season to minimize Western attention and scrutiny. U.S. President Donald Trump has regularly criticised Beijing for covering up the emergence of what he calls the ""China virus"".
The United Nations human rights office called in a tweet for Zhang's release.
""We raised her case with the authorities throughout 2020 as an example of the excessive clampdown on freedom of expression linked to #COVID19 & continue to call for her release,"" it said.
Criticism of China's early handling of the crisis has been censored, and whistle-blowers such as doctors warned. State media have credited the country's success in reining in the virus to the leadership of President Xi Jinping.
The virus has spread worldwide to infect more than 80 million people and kill more than 1.76 million, paralysing air travel as nations threw up barriers that have disrupted industries and livelihoods.
In Shanghai, police enforced tight security outside the court where the trial opened seven months after Zhang's detention, although some supporters were undeterred.
A man in a wheelchair, who told Reuters he came from the central province of Henan to demonstrate support for Zhang as a fellow Christian, wrote her name on a poster before police escorted him away.
Foreign journalists were denied entry to the court ""due to the epidemic"", court security officials said.
A former lawyer, Zhang arrived in Wuhan on Feb. 1 from her home in Shanghai.
Her short video clips uploaded to YouTube consist of interviews with residents, commentary and footage of a crematorium, train stations, hospitals and the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
Detained in mid-May, she went on hunger strike in late June, court documents seen by Reuters say. Her lawyers told the court that police strapped her hands and force-fed her with a tube. By December, she was suffering headaches, giddiness, stomach ache, low blood pressure and a throat infection. 
Requests to the court to release Zhang on bail before the trial and livestream the trial were ignored, her lawyer said.
Other citizen-journalists who have disappeared in China without explanation include Fang Bin, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua.
While there has been no news of Fang, Li re-emerged in a YouTube video in April to say he was forcibly quarantined, while Chen, although released, is under surveillance and has not spoken publicly, a friend has said.

700,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Saudi court jails women's rights activist for more than five years,"By Raya Jalabi and Marwa Rashad
DUBAI (Reuters) - A Saudi court on Monday sentenced prominent women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul to five years and eight months in prison, her family and media said, after her conviction in a trial that has drawn international condemnation.
Hathloul, 31, has been held since 2018 following her arrest along with at least a dozen other women's rights activists.
The verdict poses an early challenge to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's relationship with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who has criticised Riyadh's human rights record.
Hathloul was charged with seeking to change the Saudi political system and harming national security, Sabq and al-Shark al-Awsat newspapers said. 
The court suspended two years and 10 months of her sentence - or most of the time already served since her arrest on May 15, 2018 - with a conditional release to follow, the newspapers and Hathloul's sister said.
She could therefore be released around end of February 2021, with a return to prison possible if she commits any crime, the newspapers said.
Hathloul was also given a five-year travel ban, her sister Lina tweeted, adding that both the public prosecutor and Hathloul could appeal.
United Nations human rights experts have called the charges ""spurious"" and along with leading rights groups and lawmakers in the United States and Europe have called for her release.
The U.N. human rights office wrote on Twitter that Hathloul's conviction was ""deeply troubling"" and called for her early release ""as matter of urgency"".
Rights groups and her family say Hathloul, who had championed women's right to drive and for ending the kingdom's male guardian system, was subjected to abuse, including electric shocks, waterboarding, flogging and sexual assault. Saudi authorities have denied the charges.
The criminal court last week cleared the prosecution of torturing Hathloul in detention, saying there was no evidence to support the allegations.
Hathloul's conviction and sentencing came nearly three weeks after a Riyadh court jailed U.S.-Saudi physician Walid al-Fitaihi for six years, despite U.S. pressure to release him, in a case rights groups have called politically motivated.
Foreign diplomats said the two trials aimed to send a message at home and abroad that Saudi Arabia would not yield to pressure on human rights issues.
Riyadh could also use the sentences as leverage in future negotiations with the Biden administration, one diplomat said.
Biden has said he will take a firmer line with the kingdom, an oil titan and a major buyer of American arms, than President Donald Trump, who was a strong supporter of Prince Mohammed.
CHARGE SHEET
Hathloul rose to prominence in 2013 when she began publicly campaigning for women's right to drive in Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi officials have said the arrests of women activists were made on suspicion of harming Saudi interests and offering support to hostile elements abroad. Some of the women detainees have been released while their trials continued.
Activist Nassimah al-Saadah was sentenced to five years in prison with two suspended in late November, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW).
Hathloul's family made her charge sheet public after her case was transferred to Riyadh's Specialised Criminal Court, originally established to try terrorism suspects but which has been used over the past decade to prosecute perceived dissidents.
The main charges against Hathloul, which carried up to a 20-year sentence, included: seeking to change the Saudi political system, calling for an end to male guardianship, attempting to apply for a U.N. job, attending digital privacy training, communicating with international rights groups and other Saudi activists. 
Hathloul was also charged with speaking to foreign diplomats and with international media about women's rights in the kingdom, including Reuters, which declined to comment. 
""The case against Loujain, based solely on her human rights activism, is a travesty of justice and reveals the depths to which they will go to root out independent voices,"" said Adam Coogle of Human Rights Watch.
The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

701,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Belarusian leader to gather delegates for reform plan critics call a sham,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko said on Monday that a National Assembly of unelected delegates would meet in February for the first time since 2016, part of a reform plan critics view as a stalling tactic to weather a political crisis.
Belarus has been rocked by mass protests since an Aug. 9 presidential election marred by voter fraud allegations. Lukashenko, in power since 1994, has rejected criticism while presiding over a sweeping crackdown in the ex-Soviet republic. 
Facing the biggest crisis of his rule, Lukashenko has suggested constitutional reforms, backed publicly by traditional ally Russia, that could clip presidential powers. 
He has given few details, but said that decisions to redistribute those powers could be taken at a meeting of the National Assembly, a political body with no formal power itself, but one that Lukashenko said could be given authority soon. 
The body usually meets every five years and brings together several thousand delegates whose candidacy is put forward by local state councils, pro-Lukashenko parties and groups of workers in the Soviet-style command economy. 
Lukashenko's political opponents, the most prominent of whom have been jailed or fled the country, have dismissed the reform proposals as a stalling tactic to help him ride out the protests. 
Lukashenko said the process of selecting delegates would begin on Tuesday: ""It should be people who represent all the layers and groups of the population, the whole Belarusian people,"" he said.
The National Assembly itself would meet on Feb. 11-12. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has publicly urged Lukashenko to engage in dialogue with opposing forces in Belarus. The two leaders met in September at a summit at which Lukashenko spoke publicly about initiating reforms. 

""It's possible Lukashenko will try with the help of this assembly to sabotage the constitutional reform that he appeared to promise the Kremlin in September,"" said Alexander Klaskovsky, a political analyst.

The total figure, at 241,193 more deaths in April-November 2020 than during the same period the previous year, is significantly higher than the preliminary pandemic death toll of 55,265 so far, reported on a cumulative daily basis by the government's coronavirus crisis centre. This figure includes deaths recorded in December. 
Though death tolls fluctuate year-to-year, tallies of what are referred to as excess deaths can illustrate the impact of the pandemic by including cases where the novel coronavirus was not a confirmed cause of death, as well as deaths from other causes that could be linked to the fact that national medical systems are over-stretched.
Rosstat data, tallied by Reuters, showed that less than half the total number of such excess deaths - at 116,030 since the start of the pandemic in Russia in April - can be attributed directly to the coronavirus. 
This is still more than double the preliminary death toll figure reported on a daily, cumulative basis by the Russian government coronavirus crisis centre, which is overseen by the health ministry and the consumer safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor. It stands at 55,265 so far, and includes deaths reported in December. 
Rosstat shared new data on Monday about the total number of deaths reported in Russia in November. 
The data showed the number of deaths was 55.6% higher compared to the same month last year, or 219,872 more deaths in total. 
Of these, the statistics service said, 35,645 deaths were directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Earlier this month, the service reported the number of deaths in October, which indicated deaths were up 30.3% on the same month the previous year.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>","After property scandal, Pope tightens money controls","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has issued a new decree making charity funds more transparent and tightening controls on Vatican finances after a scandal over a luxury London property deal. 
The main target is the Secretariat of State, the most important part of the Vatican administration, which must relinquish management of its funds, investments and real estate and submit to supervision by two other economic offices.
Published on Monday and signed by the pope on Dec. 26, the decree takes effect over two months from Jan. 1. 
In 2014, the Secretariat invested about 200 million euros ($244 million) as a partner in a deal to buy a luxury building in London. As the deal became onerous, it paid tens of millions of fees to middlemen in attempts to change the terms.
Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican's former treasurer, told Reuters earlier this month there had been ""enormous losses"". In September, the pope fired Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a former top Secretariat official.
An investigation into the London deal led to the suspension last year of five Vatican employees, four from the Secretariat. The Vatican has also accused the middlemen of extortion. 
'PETER'S PENCE'
The Secretariat of State's assets are being transferred to a department called Administration of the Patrimony of the Holy See (APSA) and will be overseen by the Secretariat for the Economy.
The Secretariat of State also loses control of ""Peter's Pence"", a fund which the faithful can contribute to and is aimed at helping the pope run the Church and finance his charities.
In past years, the Vatican has dipped into Peter's Pence to cover budget deficits. The fund's reputation has suffered from reports it may have been used for questionable investments, such as the London building.
The decree sets up three new accounts - one for Peter's Pence, another for a ""Papal Discretionary Fund"", and a third to hold funds which donors want used for a specific purpose. To guarantee transparency, they will become part of the Vatican's budget, the pope said in the decree.
A Vatican statement said the changes to Peter's Pence were meant to reassure donors that contributions were properly used.

On Dec 21, the Swiss government ordered people who had arrived from the United Kingdom and South Africa since Dec. 14 to undergo a 10-day quarantine to prevent the spread of more contagious variants of the coronavirus. It also halted flights before allowing them to resume a few days later so stranded visitors could return home. 
Swiss media reported on Sunday that about 200 British citizens left Verbier before the end of their quarantine.
Asked about the run-away tourists, Health Minister Alain Berset told reporters in Basel: ""We are aware of that. It is obviously a problem, there was an order to quarantine that has not been respected.""
He said he didn't know the current whereabouts of the tourists, but suspected that they had gone home.
""One shouldn't underestimate what an impossible situation it was,"" he said. ""We had to decide within hours what to do ... That things don't work perfectly in such a situation, that problems surface is a reality we have to live with.""
Simon Wiget, director of Verbier tourism, told Reuters that the sudden quarantine order had placed local authorities in a difficult situation. ""It's our role to pass on information, we're not the police,"" he said.

The March 23 parliamentary election, brought on prematurely due to a seemingly intractable political stalemate, is the country's second since the global coronavirus outbreak. It is also the fourth in two years.
Looking to improve the voting process, the national election committee said it would now open the drive-through ballot boxes for people diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Voters will pull up to a station, a ballot box will be rolled up to their window, and they then present their ID and pick a candidate without having to step outside.
""The station safeguards the secrecy of the vote,"" the committee's director-general, Orly Adas, told reporters.
Polling station workers will be wearing protective equipment and the committee is consulting with the Health Ministry to come up with the safest protocols. This could include staffing the stations only with those who have recovered from COVID-19 and those who have been vaccinated, she said.

Israel has reported more than 400,000 COVID-19 cases and 3,240 deaths.

TOKYO (Reuters) - A 53-year-old former Japanese minister has died of COVID-19, his party said on Monday, becoming the first incumbent lawmaker to succumb to the disease in a nation scrambling to shut its doors to foreign travellers.
Yuichiro Hata, who was transport minister in 2012 and is the son of former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hatawho, died on Sunday, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan said.
Japan on Monday started banning non-resident foreign nationals from entering following the detection of a new, highly infectious coronavirus variant linked to a rapid rise in infections in Britain.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga urged calm ahead of the New Year holidays, when hospitals tend to become understaffed, and instructed ministers to remain alert. 
""They say that no evidence is showing the vaccines that are already being administered overseas are not effective against this variant, and anti-infection steps for it are unchanged from those for the conventional virus,"" Suga said.
""The virus recognises no year-end or New Year holidays. I ask each minister to raise the level of their sense of urgency and thoroughly carry out counter measures,"" he told a meeting of the government's taskforce on coronavirus responses. 
Japan is facing a third wave of infections, with daily cases hitting a record 3,881 on Saturday, according to public broadcaster NHK.
A Japanese business traveller at Tokyo's Haneda airport, where people were sparse, said the government should do more.
""Even though Japan is doing things to counter the variant, there are still reports of cases in Japan,"" 56-year-old Seiji Oohira said on arriving from India, where he works for a construction-related company. 

""So I think it's better to tighten the restrictions even a little bit further.""

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Authorities in India's northern state of Punjab are investigating whether protesting farmers were disrupting power supply to hundreds of telecom towers, a state official said on Monday, amid protests over new farm laws.
""We have told the police to track all those involved in sabotaging the infrastructure,"" a senior official in the Punjab state government told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A senior Punjab state police official said the power supply was disrupted to several telecom towers in the state, mainly ones owned by Jio, the telecommunications arm of Reliance Industries.
A source close to Jio said more than 1,400 of its 9,000 plus towers were affected as power supplies and fibre to the towers were cut but could not confirm whether farmers were behind the damage. 
Some bundles of Jio's fibre kept for laying were also burnt at one location, the source said, declining to be named as the matter is private.
Jio did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
At least 1,600 towers were affected in total due to the power supply disruption and about 30 towers have been damaged, Tilak Raj Dua, director general of the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA), told Reuters. 
Dua said the association was trying to determine which companies were affected and had written to the police in Punjab asking for protection of the towers.
Representatives of two of the 31 farmers' unions protesting against the laws rejected the allegations when contacted by Reuters. They asked to remain unidentified pending a formal statement from all of the unions. 
Tens of thousands of farmers are camping out on highways near the capital New Delhi in protest at three new laws implemented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government that they fear will dismantle regulated agricultural markets, threaten their livelihood and benefit large companies.
But Modi and his ministers say the laws will increase farmers' income as it links potential bulk buyers such as WalMart Inc, Reliance Industries Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd directly with farmers, bypassing wholesale markets and commission agents.

Punjab's state government is opposed to the new farm laws and a seventh round of talks between farmer unions and federal government officials is scheduled on Tuesday.

""He influenced the witness in criminal proceedings by bribing him to refuse to testify or to give knowingly false testimony,"" the press service of Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said in a statement on Monday. 
The suspected incident took place in 2018, when Tupytskyi served as deputy chairman of the court, the press service said.
Tupytskyi did not appear at the prosecutor's office on Monday despite a request to do so. His office was quoted by Interfax Ukraine news agency as saying he had no intention of avoiding judicial proceedings, but that it was against Ukrainian law to dismiss a Constitutional Court judge. Reuters was not able to reach him for comment.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the Constitutional Court have been at loggerheads after the court in October struck down key anti-corruption legislation, hobbling the government's prospects of securing foreign aid loans. 
The office of Venediktova, an ally of Zelenskiy, declined further comment.
Zelenskiy in October had asked parliament to dissolve the court, prompting Tupytskyi to accuse Zelenskiy of a ""constitutional coup"".
The government, which is grappling with a sharp economic downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic, is trying to get its $5 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund on track and hopes to receive more money in February or March. 

It passed legislation this month to counteract the court's October ruling.

""You will be hearing some good news from the UK very soon,"" Serum's Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told reporters, adding that approval from the Indian regulator would likely follow shortly.
""By January, we should have the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine licensed.""
The company has already made 40 million to 50 million doses of the vaccine and will be able to ramp up capacity to around 100 million a month by March when a new facility comes online, Poonawalla said.
India wants to deliver 600 million coronavirus shots in the next six to eight months starting in January. The country's drug regulator is also considering similar approvals for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and another developed by India's Bharat Biotech.
VACCINATION DRILLS
Some Indian states on Monday began a trial run of COVID-19 vaccine delivery systems, with health authorities checking everything from their technology platforms to the storage infrastructure that will be required to inoculate millions.
""The exercise is basically a mock drill for our healthcare workers on how to run the whole vaccination process and system,"" Jaiprakash Shivahare, the commissioner for health in the western state of Gujarat, told Reuters.
State health officials had set up 19 vaccination centres, each with 25 dummy beneficiaries played by health workers, who would help test out the entire inoculation sequence, including online monitoring systems, Shivahare said.
""The cold chain infrastructure for distribution of the vaccine is also being tested as a part of the dry run,"" he said.
India has the second-highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world after the United States, and it has recorded 147,901 deaths so far.

On Monday, the federal health ministry reported a daily increase of a little over 20,000 infections, taking the country's total so far to 10.2 million cases.

Up to now, Sweden has relied mainly on voluntary social distancing measures, setting it apart from most other countries in Europe where enforced lockdowns have been used to fight the COVID-19 virus.
""In very serious situations, the government will be able to decide on more extensive measures to prevent crowding,"" Health Minister Lena Hallengren told a news conference.
""That includes the closure of shops, public transport, shopping centres, or other kinds of businesses that fall under the new law.""
While the government has stressed its faith in Swedes' individual sense of responsibility, it has also lacked the legal tools to take a tougher stance.
The law will only stay in force until September unless renewed.
The government had originally planned to introduce the law in March, but has moved up the timetable amid a second wave of infections that has put the health service under severe strain.
Sweden registered 6,609 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday last week - the most recent figures reported. 
It has now seen 8,279 COVID deaths, a rate per capita several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours, but lower than several European countries that opted for lockdowns.

MOSCOW/ANKARA (Reuters) - Russia said late on Sunday it had sent more military police to an area in northern Syria where fighters backed by Turkey have clashed with Kurdish forces near a strategic highway patrolled by Russian and Turkish troops.
The deployment comes ahead of talks in Russia on Tuesday between Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu. They are expected to focus in part on Syria, where Turkey backs rebels opposed to President Bashar al-Assad, while Russia supports Assad's forces.
Battles between Turkey-backed fighters and Kurdish forces erupted this month near the town of Ain Issa, which sits on the M4 highway that links major Syrian cities.
Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent allies seized territory in the region in an offensive last year against the Kurdish YPG militia, which holds swathes of northern and eastern Syria. 
A senior Turkish defence source said Ankara would use Tuesday's meeting to push its demand for the withdrawal of the YPG, which it calls a terrorist organisation.
""The YPG must definitely leave Ain Issa and there is a readiness to take every kind of step to this end,"" the source said, requesting anonymity.
The YPG forms the military backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance which in recent years defeated Islamic State in northeast Syria with the help of U.S. air power. Ankara says the YPG is close to militants fighting an insurgency in southeast Turkey.
The Russian defence ministry said it had sent more military police to the area on Sunday. 
""Earlier, during negotiations with the Turkish side, agreements were reached on the deployment of joint Russian-Syrian observation posts. Additional units of the Russian military police have arrived in the Ain Issa area today (Sunday) to step up efforts to stabilise the situation,"" it said.

It said it had not detected shelling from Turkish-backed fighters in the last 24 hours.

China has watched with growing alarm as the United States has stepped up its backing for Chinese-claimed Taiwan and its criticism of Beijing's rule in remote Tibet, further straining a relationship under intense pressure over trade, human rights and other issues.
The Taiwan Assurance Act of 2020 and Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 both contain language objectionable to China, including U.S. support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in United Nations bodies and regular arms sales.
On Tibet, which China has ruled with an iron fist since 1950, the act says sanctions should be put on Chinese officials who interfere in the selection of the exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama's successor.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was ""resolutely opposed"" to both acts.
""The determination of the Chinese government to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests is unwavering,"" he told reporters.
The U.S. should not put the parts of the acts which ""target China"" into effect in order to avoid harming Sino-U.S. relations, he said, adding they were an interference in China's internal affairs.

The company suffered an incident related to the control of temperature in the process of loading and sending out the vaccines, the minister said, adding the incident is now solved. 
""They (vaccines) will be available tomorrow first thing in the morning in vaccination points,"" Illa said in an interview to Cadena SER radio station. Spain started vaccinating people on Sunday. 
He expected around 70% of the country's population to be immunized by the end of the summer.
The delay in Spain comes after the vaccination campaign in Germany faced delays in several cities after temperature trackers showed that about 1,000 vaccine doses made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech may have not been kept cold enough during shipment.
In a presentation this month, BioNTech had said that once removed from the freezer, the vaccine could be stored for up to five days at 2-8C and for up to two hours at temperatures up to 30C, prior to use.
The cool boxes designed by Pfizer are fitted with GPS trackers so the companies can deal with potential storage issues en route.

The vaccine, which uses new so-called mRNA technology, must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of about -70 degrees Celsius (-112°F) before being shipped to distribution centres in specially designed cool boxes filled with dry ice.

The 12, who had all faced charges in Hong Kong linked to anti-government protests in the city, have been held virtually incommunicado in a mainland prison since they were detained.
Chinese officials, who have described the group as separatists, said two of them would have a separate hearing as they are minors. It was not clear if the 10 were appearing in the court or were attending via video link.
They face charges of illegal border crossing and organising an illicit border crossing, which could carry a sentence of up to seven years in jail, mainland authorities said. 
The case has attracted much attention in Hong Kong as a rare instance of Chinese authorities arresting people trying to leave the former British colony at a time of growing fears about prospects for the city's high degree of autonomy after Beijing imposed a draconian national security law in June. 
Diplomats from countries including the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, were denied entry for the much-anticipated hearing after authorities said the court was full.
""We've been denied entry. The official explanation given is that the case does not involve any foreign citizens,"" one Western envoy told Reuters. 
The detainees' plight has grabbed international attention, with human rights groups raising concern over their treatment after their families said they were denied access to independent lawyers.
""They try to say it's an open trial but they also say all the seats are occupied. The family members don’t have the right to attend the trial. That’s absurd,"" said Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China.
""They don't have the right to appoint their own lawyer. They don't even know the names of the government-appointed lawyers."" 
Earlier on Monday, the U.S. embassy in China urged authorities to release the fugitives and allow them to leave.
""Their so-called 'crime' was to flee tyranny. Communist China will stop at nothing to prevent its people from seeking freedom elsewhere,"" the embassy said in a statement.

Pro-democracy activists began fleeing Hong Kong for self-ruled Taiwan from the early months of anti-government protests last year, most of them legally, by air, but some by fishing boat, activists in Taipei who helped Hong Kong citizens get visas have told Reuters.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean officials are vowing to speed up efforts to launch a public coronavirus vaccination programme as the country on Monday announced it had detected its first cases of the virus variant linked to the rapid rise in infections in Britain.
The new variant, thought to be more transmissible than others currently circulating, was found in three people who had entered South Korea from London on Dec. 22, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Monday.
South Korea will extend a ban on direct flights from Britain for another week until Jan. 7, and will require any passengers arriving from that country or South Africa to undergo testing before departure, officials announced on Monday.
Overall the KDCA reported 808 new cases as of midnight Sunday, the lowest since a record 1,241 infections were logged on Friday.
Authorities cautioned that the drop may be due to less testing done over the weekend and the Christmas holiday, and said on Sunday they would be extending social distancing measures until early January.
South Korea's government has faced mounting domestic criticism over its vaccine procurement and rollout plans, which call for the first vaccinations to begin in the first quarter of next year, months after places such as the United States and the European Union.
Negative views of the vaccine plans was one of the leading reasons that drove President Moon Jae-in's disapproval rating to an all-time high of nearly 60%, pollster Realmeter said on Monday. 
Regulators will shorten the period required to approve vaccines and treatments from an average of 180 days to as little as 40 days, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety announced on Sunday.
An additional approval process for the distribution and sale of vaccines, which usually takes several months, will be shortened to around 20 days, the ministry said.
Medical workers and elderly residents will begin receiving the vaccinations in February, and plans to vaccinate the broader public are accelerating, Moon said on Monday.
""There are concerns that our country hasn't secured enough vaccines or that the vaccinations will be delayed. This is not true,"" Moon told a meeting with his top aides, according to a statement. ""We are making efforts to advance the timeline for adopting vaccines.""
South Korea's plans call for it to buy enough doses to eventually vaccinate 46 million people, or more than 85% of its population.
Authorities have said they expect South Korea's population to reach a level of herd immunity through the vaccines as fast or faster than many other countries.

South Korea has reported a total of 57,680 coronavirus cases, with 819 deaths.

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Indian police in Kashmir filed charges against an army officer and a civilian for allegedly killing three labourers and planting weapons to pass them off as militants, in a rare indictment of the military fighting an insurgency in the region.
The three labourers were killed in July after what the Indian army had initially said was a gun battle that started after militants fired at security forces in Amshipora village in southern Kashmir.
But Kashmir police, who come under the direct control of the central government in New Delhi, said in a press release on Sunday that their investigation showed the labourers ""were murdered"" by an army captain and two civilians - one of whom turned state's evidence.
""They planted illegally acquired weapons and material on their dead bodies after stripping them of their identities,"" police said, adding that the accused had ""deliberately and purposefully"" chosen not to follow standard operating procedures.
The Indian army declined to comment on the police statement on Sunday.
In an update last week, an army spokesman said that it was progressing with its own investigation, adding that the army was ""committed to ethical conduct of operations.""
Rights groups have long accused the Indian army of violating human rights in Kashmir, a Muslim majority region that is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, but ruled in part by both. The Indian army denies the charges.
Indian security forces have killed over 200 militants in Kashmir this year, officials said, many from groups allegedly backed by Pakistan. Islamabad denies providing material support for militants in Kashmir.
A month after the Amshipora incident, Kashmir police were informed of missing reports for three labourers who had left the neighbouring Rajouri district in July. 
Police said they had confirmed the identities of victims by matching their DNA with samples collected from their families in Rajouri.
On Saturday, police filed a 1,400 page charge-sheet against the army officer and one of the civilians.
A court in Kashmir has also asked army authorities whether the captain will be tried in civilian court or by military court martial, the police release said.

(Reuters) - The 63-year-old suspect in the bombing that rocked Nashville on Christmas morning was killed in the blast that destroyed his motor home and damaged more than 40 businesses, authorities said on Sunday.
FBI forensic experts matched DNA samples recovered from the scene to that of Anthony Q. Warner, whose home in nearby Antioch was searched on Saturday by federal agents. 
Late on Sunday, the FBI tweeted https:// a photo of Warner.
""We've come to the conclusion that an individual named Anthony Warner is the bomber and he was present when the bomb went off and that he perished in the bombing,"" Donald Cochran, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, told a news conference. 
Officials said it was too early in the investigation to discuss the suspect's motives. 
Warner's motor home, parked on a downtown street of Tennessee's largest city, exploded at dawn on Friday moments after police responding to reports of gunfire noticed it and heard music and an automated message emanating from the vehicle warning of a bomb. 
The explosion in the heart of America's country music capital injured three people and damaged businesses including an AT&T switching center, disrupting mobile, internet and TV services across central Tennessee and parts of four other states. 
As investigators followed up on hundreds of tips from members of the public, they searched Warner's home on Saturday and visited a Nashville real estate agency where he had worked on computers. 
The owner of Fridrich & Clark Realty, Steve Fridrich, told the Tennessean newspaper that for four or five years Warner had come into the office roughly once a month to provide computer consulting services, until this month when Warner told the company in an email that he would no longer be working for them. He gave no reason, according to Fridrich. 
""He seemed very personable to us – this is quite out of character I think,"" Fridrich told the newspaper. 
Nashville Mayor John Cooper said on CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" program on Sunday that local officials felt there had to be some connection between the bombing and the AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) building. 
Damage to the switching center was so extensive that AT&T teams had to drill access holes into the wreckage to connect generators to critical equipment, as well as pump three feet of water from the basement. The company said in a statement on Sunday that it made ""significant progress"" overnight and had restored power to four floors of the building.
AT&T said it was aiming to restore all its wireless service by the end of Sunday. 
""As of now, 96% of our wireless network is restored, 60% of our business services are restored, and 86% of our consumer broadband and entertainment services are restored"", AT&T Communications Chief Executive Jeff McElfresh said.
At a news conference on Sunday, five Nashville police officers who were on the scene early on Friday recalled the dramatic moments ahead of the explosion, as they scrambled to evacuate homes and buildings and called for a bomb squad, which was en route when the motor home blew up.
""I was thrown forward, knocked to the ground,"" officer Brenna Hosey told reporters about the moment of the explosion. ""But I was able to catch myself, I was fine."" 

The officers have been hailed as heroes by city leaders.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh will move a second group of Rohingya refugees to a low-lying island in the Bay of Bengal on Tuesday, officials said, despite calls by rights groups to stop the relocation on safety grounds.
More than 1,100 Rohingya refugees, members of a Muslim minority who have fled Myanmar, will be moved from a refugee camp near the Myanmar border to Bhasan Char island, two officials with the knowledge of the issue said.
Authorities moved the first batch of more than 1,600 early this month.
""Buses and trucks are ready to carry them and their belongings to Chittagong port today. Tonight, they will stay there. Tomorrow they will be taken by naval ships to the island,"" one of the officials said on Monday.
The officials declined to be identified as the issue has not been made public.
Humanitarian agencies and rights groups have criticised the relocation, saying the island, hours by boat from the mainland, is flood-prone, vulnerable to frequent cyclones and could be completely submerged during a high tide.
Bangladesh says it is only transferring people who are willing to go and the relocation will ease chronic overcrowding in camps that are home to more than 1 million Rohingya.
Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy government official in charge of refugees, said a 12 km long embankment had been built to protect the island from floods along with housing for 100,000 people. Relocation was voluntary, he said.
""No one is forced to go there,"" he said, adding that people can live a better life there with greater access to healthcare and education.
But refugees and humanitarian workers say some of the Rohingya had been coerced into going to the island, which emerged from the sea 20 years ago and has never been inhabited. 
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar in 2017 following a military-led crackdown that the United Nations has said was executed with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies genocide and says its forces were targeting Rohingya militants who attacked police posts.
Several attempts to launch a process to repatriate Rohingya to Myanmar have failed because the refugees refused to go back, fearing more violence. 

The United Nations has said it has not been allowed to conduct a technical and safety assessment of Bhasan Char and was not involved in the transfer of refugees there.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Sydney, one of the world's first major cities to welcome each New Year with a public countdown featuring a fireworks display over its well-known Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) House, has banned large gatherings that night amid an outbreak of the coronavirus.
A mid-December resurgence of COVID-19 in the city's northern beach suburbs has grown to 125 cases after five new infections were recorded on Monday. About a quarter of million of people there must stay in strict lockdown until Jan. 9
That has led to further restrictions of the already toned-down plans for the New Year's Eve. New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian banned most people from coming to Sydney's downtown that night and limited outdoor gatherings to 50 people.
""We don't want to create any super-spreading events on New Year's Eve, which then ruins it for everybody across the state moving forward,"" Berejiklian said at a news conference, adding that watching the fireworks from home was the 'safest' way to do so.
""On New Year's Eve we don't want any crowds on the foreshore around Sydney whatsoever,"" she said.
Only residents with permits for hospitality venues downtown will be allowed there on New Year's Eve. Households across Sydney are only allowed to host 10 people until further notice.
NSW Police have issued 15 notices in Sydney for breaking public health orders since Christmas Eve. 
""I would say to those people half contemplating doing anything stupid in the next few days, forget it,"" NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said.
Australia's health minister, Greg Hunt, backed the Sydney restrictions.
""What we have been doing is working,"" he said.
Because of swift border closures, lockdowns, widespread testing, social distancing and a high rate of public compliance with anti-virus measures, Australia has recorded just over 28,300 infections and 908 deaths related to the coronavirus.
Officials say this has given regulators time to evaluate vaccines without the pressure of mounting cases of COVID-19, as has been the case in much of Europe and the United States.

""Our approach is to under-promise and over-deliver,"" Hunt said, reiterating that the government is sticking to a March timetable to start vaccinations.

The state is part of the restive Darfur region, in the west of Sudan, which suffered a bitter conflict that erupted in 2003.
A dispute over a water source between members of the tribes of Masalit and Fallata in Gereida city ended with the killing of two people from the Fallata tribe, SUNA news agency said, citing two local leaders. 
One of the leaders said Fallata members responded by killing 13 people from Masalit and wounding 34 others.
Gereida is located 97 kilometres south of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state. 
The area witnessed several bloody clashes between the tribes over the last two years, SUNA said. The latest violence is the first since they reached a reconciliation in October, it added.
A meeting of the state security committee with military and local community leaders in Gereida decided to deploy troops ""in large numbers"" to pursue the perpetrators‮ ‬and collect arms, Mousa Mahdi, the governor of South Darfur told the agency.
They agreed also on forming an investigation committee, he added.
Conflict spread in Sudan's western Darfur region from 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against Khartoum. Government forces and mainly Arab militia that moved to repress the revolt were accused of widespread atrocities. An estimated 300,000 people were killed and 2.5 million displaced.
In October, Sudan's transitional authorities finalized a peace deal with some rebel groups from Darfur. But the agreement excluded the group that has been most active on the ground.
Last week, the U.N. Security Council decided to end the mission of a joint United Nations and African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur, known as UNAMID, on Dec.31, more than 13 years after it established the operation.

Many Darfuri residents say UNAMID has not effectively protected them, but they fear its withdrawal will leave them more vulnerable and have staged protests in recent weeks.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel began what officials hope will be its last coronavirus lockdown on Sunday as they ramp up vaccinations to a pace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said may allow an emergence from the pandemic by March.
If realised, that could help Netanyahu's re-election hopes after missteps that include lifting a first lockdown with a premature declaration of victory in May, inconsistent enforcement of curbs and sluggish economic relief.
Since beginning vaccinations a week before Sunday’s European Union roll-out, Israel's centralised health system has administered 280,000 shots, the world’s fastest rate. 
The opening of 24/7 vaccination stations is under consideration. Netanyahu wants the daily rate doubled to 150,000 shots by next weekend.
That could enable the vaccination of half of Israel's 9 million people by the end of January. The country has logged almost 400,000 COVID-19 cases and 3,210 deaths.
""As soon as we are done with this stage, within 30 days we can emerge from the coronavirus, open the economy and do things that no country can do,"" Netanyahu said in a televised address.
The conservative premier is running in a March 23 election called after his governing coalition collapsed this month.
An Israel Democracy Institute poll released on Sunday found that 40.8% of the public gave the government mostly positive ratings for its handling of the crisis' medical aspects, while 32.2% gave it mostly negative ratings. On the economic aspects, the government's ratings were 52.8% negative and 19.7% positive.
Sunday's lockdown - the country's third - will last at least three weeks and aims to tamp down contagions that are currently doubling in scale every two weeks, the Health Ministry said.

The vaccines mean ""there is a very high chance that this is our final lockdown"", Sharon Alroy-Preis, acting head of the ministry’s public health services division, told Army Radio.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Central African Republic residents turned out in huge numbers for presidential and legislative elections on Sunday, the head of the U.N. mission said, despite rebels opening fire in some areas to try to scare away voters.
Rebel groups hostile to President Faustin-Archange Touadera, who is seeking a second term, have carried out attacks and threatened to march to the capital and disrupt the election after the constitutional court this month rejected several candidates, including former President Francois Bozize.
Touadera is considered the favourite in the field of 17 candidates. Vote counting began on Sunday and full provisional results are expected by the end of the week.
The election will go to a second round if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote. 
After a slow start and sporadic gunfire in some towns, the head of the U.N. mission in the country said in a statement that there was a huge turnout. He did not provide details. 
""This morning, they (rebels) started firing, hoping to scare people away from voting. Yes, in certain areas, it is difficult but in many other areas, you can see people going out massively to vote,"" Mankeur Ndiaye said. 
There are concerns that a substantial number of the 1.8 million registered voters in the sparsely populated nation larger than France were not be able to vote in remote towns, some controlled by armed rebels.
Heavy gunfire was reported in the town of Bouar, around 435 km (270 miles) northwest of the capital, a resident said. Gunfire also disrupted voting in other towns including Bossangoa in the northwest, and Bria in the east. 
""The vote should not only take place in Bangui. I think that the elections should have been postponed. But as it is the law, it is my duty, I am coming to vote for my president,"" said 31-year old Thierry Yanga, who voted in the capital. 
The constitutional court on Saturday rejected an appeal from several opposition candidates for the election to be postponed. The government and a U.N. mission had rejected a postponement fearing a power vacuum.
WAVES OF VIOLENCE
The crisis has left many in the diamond- and gold-rich nation of 4.7 million exhausted, while stirring fears of a return to the worst violence of its recent past, which includes five coups and numerous rebellions since independence from France in 1960.
Touadera was first elected in 2016 following a rebellion three years earlier that ousted Bozize. He has struggled to wrest control of vast swathes of the country from armed militias. 
Successive waves of violence since 2013 have killed thousands and forced more than a million from their homes. 
Touadera and the United Nations, which has over 12,800 uniformed peacekeepers in CAR, have accused Bozize of being behind the rebel offensive, which briefly seized the country's fourth largest city last week and has led to a wave of desertions from the army. 
Bozize's candidacy was rejected because he faces an arrest warrant and U.N. sanctions for allegedly ordering assassinations and torture while president. Bozize has denied those charges. 

Touadera's international security partners have responded to the latest violence by sending additional troops and equipment, including 300 Russian military instructors and 300 Rwandan peacekeepers.

The military police said the bodyguard had fallen from a speeding car.
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the strongest challenger to President Yoweri Museveni, 76, in the presidential election due on Jan. 14. 
""I regret to announce the murder of my security team member Francis Senteza Kalibala aka Frank. He was deliberately run over by military-police truck, No. H4DF 2382, which blocked us in Busega on our way to Rubaga to get Kasirye Ashraf emergency medical attention."" 
The Ugandan military's spokeswoman wrote on Twitter late on Sunday that the bodyguard had not been hit by a military police vehicle.
""UPDF (Ugandan People's Defence Force) would like to clarify that the late Senteza...was not knocked by a Military Police Vehicle as purported, but rather fell off a speeding car...he tried to jump to (sic) but fell off.""
Police spokesman Fred Enanga did not respond to a request for comment on the bodyguard. He had earlier told Reuters that supporters of Wine had gathered on Sunday in Masaka, 125 km southwest of the capital Kampala. Wine had attended a church service in the town, he tweeted.
Enanga said the supporters were ""a violent group"" but gave no further details on what they were doing. 
""Teargas was used to quell the violence. The journalists were regrettably caught up during the process of dispersing the violent group,"" he said.
He said one of the journalists, from television station Ghetto TV, sustained a serious injury above his left eye ""allegedly from a (teargas) canister"". 
Ashraf Kasirye was hospitalised at Masaka Referral Hospital then transferred to Kampala, he said. 
""He is in a critical condition,"" Wine later wrote on Twitter of Kasirye's injury. ""We are hoping against hope that he will live.""
All three journalists who were injured were wearing bulletproof vests and helmets marked ""PRESS"", local reporter Culton Scovia Nakamya of BBS TV told Reuters. 
Masaka is one of 11 areas where campaigning has been suspended because of coronavirus risks - although government critics say the real reason is the opposition's popularity in these areas. 
Another presidential candidate, Patrick Amuriat, was arrested in the town of Jinja on Sunday, his Forum for Democratic Change party tweeted. Jinja, which is east of the capital, is one of the districts where the electoral board suspended campaigning.

In an offensive last year dubbed the Peace Spring Operation, Turkey seized a 120-km (75-mile) stretch of border territory in northeast Syria from the YPG, which it considers a terrorist organisation linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militia.
""Our heroic commandos dealt another heavy blow to the PKK/YPG terrorist organisation. Fifteen PKK/YPG terrorists trying to infiltrate the Peace Spring region from the south to carry out an attack were neutralised with the successful intervention of our commandos,"" Turkey's Defence Ministry said on Twitter.
Turkey halted its offensive, which was widely condemned by Ankara's Western allies as the YPG was a key U.S. ally in the fight against Islamic State, after striking deals with Russia and the United States.
Moscow has said the YPG withdrew to at least 30 km (18 miles) from Turkey's border, but Ankara has been sceptical and held out the possibility of new attacks if militants remain. U.S. support for the YPG has been among the main issues between Ankara and Washington, NATO allies.
Turkey backs rebels looking to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, while Russia and Iran support Assad's forces. Since 2016, Turkey has seized swathes of northern Syria in four cross-border offensives to drive back Islamic State and the YPG, and prevent a fresh influx of migrants from Syria.

Turkey is the main foreign backer of Libya's internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli, which for years has been fighting Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). The LNA is backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
In October, the GNA and LNA signed a ceasefire agreement and the United Nations has been pushing a political dialogue aimed at elections next year as a solution. Russia on Wednesday called for international efforts toward a peace settlement in Libya to be intensified.
Speaking during a visit to Turkish troops in Tripoli, Akar said Haftar had recently started making calls targeting Turkish forces in Libya and calling for attacks on Turkish troops, and also called on all parties to support political talks instead.
""This war criminal, thug Haftar and his backers should know that in the event of any attack attempt waged on Turkish forces, the killer Haftar's forces will be viewed as legitimate targets everywhere,"" Akar said. 
""They should get this in their heads. If they do something like this, they will have nowhere to run,"" he said. ""Everyone should contribute to reaching a political solution here. Any move other than this is wrong.""
Turkey has sent military personnel and equipment to the GNA, helping to turn the tide of the war in Libya, while engaging in talks with Moscow for a solution to the conflict between the GNA and LNA.
Both sides have stopped short of withdrawing forces from the frontline, as demanded by the truce. A panel of U.N. experts has cited the foreign supporters of both sides as breaching an arms embargo on Libya.
Last month, Turkey and Germany traded barbs over the search of a Turkish freight ship by a European Union military mission in the Mediterranean aimed at enforcing the Libyan arms embargo, in a move Ankara called illegal.
This month, the LNA also intercepted a Turkish ship, under a Jamaican flag, heading to the port of Misrata, prompting an angry rebuke from Ankara. The ship was later released.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain severed diplomatic ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of backing ""terrorist"" groups. Doha denies the charge and accuses its neighbours of seeking to curtail its sovereignty.
However, Riyadh has pushed for a resolution of the dispute as it seeks to soften criticism from U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who pledged to take a firmer stance with the kingdom than his predecessor.
Bahrain said in a statement the virtual meeting of foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) will prepare the ground for the 41st session of the GCC Summit which will be held on Jan. 5.
""Talks have been going on an eventual agreement but it is still work in progress,"" a Gulf official told Reuters. 
Sources have said they expected an agreement to be reached by the summit, and could result in a set of principles for negotiations or a more concrete move involving reopening airspace to Qatar. 
But Qatar has told Kuwait and the United States, the two mediators in the dispute, that any resolution should be based on mutual respect, including of foreign policy.
Doha had been set 13 demands, ranging from closing Al Jazeera television and shuttering a Turkish base to cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran.
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said this month that a resolution to the dispute with Qatar seemed ""within reach"" after Kuwait announced progress towards ending the row.

PANIQUI, Philippines (Reuters) - Hundreds attended the funeral on Sunday of a woman and her son shot dead by an off-duty policeman in the Philippines, a week after a video of the incident went viral on social media, sparking public outrage over police brutality.
Members of the public joined as relatives and friends in Tarlac province, north of Manila, paid their final respects to Sonya Gregorio, 52, and her 25-year old son Frank Gregorio, who were shot in the head after a row over noise. 
The shooting, which was recorded on a mobile phone by a member of the Gregorio family, triggered accusations from critics and human rights activists that President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs had created a culture of police impunity.
Policeman Jonel Nuezca was seen in the video engaged in a heated argument with the Gregorios over the use of a homemade noise-making device typically used to celebrate New Year, before he shot the mother and her son.
Nuezca surrendered to police on the night of the incident and faces two counts of murder. The government has promised a thorough investigation.
The victims' family has forgiven Nuezca but is still demanding justice, said Avelina San Jose, a relative of the Gregorios. ""He should face the consequences of the law"", she said.
Duterte, who has talked of killing criminals and issued promises to protect law enforcement while waging a war on drugs and crime, has condemned the shooting and warned ""There will be hell to pay"" for rogue officers.

739,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>",Turkish parliament passes associations oversight law that critics say will stifle NGOs,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament passed a law on Sunday that would ramp up oversight of foundations and associations and, according to rights groups including Amnesty International, risks limiting the freedoms of civil society organisations.
The law allows the interior minister to replace members of organisations who are being investigated for terrorism charges, while the interior ministry can also apply to courts to halt the groups' activities under the new law. International organisations will also be included under the law and penalised accordingly.
Parliament approved the bill - drafted by President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, which holds a parliamentary majority with its nationalist MHP allies - early on Sunday, the assembly said on Twitter.
Earlier this week, seven civil society organisations, including Human Rights Association and Amnesty, said in a statement that terrorism charges in Turkey were arbitrary, adding the law violates the presumption of innocence and punishes those whose trials are not finalised.
""Given that thousands of civil society activists, journalists, politicians, members of professional organisations are investigated within the scope of (anti-terrorism law), there is no doubt that this law will target almost all opponent associations,"" said the organisations. 
Investigations based on terrorism charges have been launched against hundreds of thousands of people under a crackdown following a failed coup in 2016. Members of Amnesty and other civil society groups have been investigated and tried, while hundreds of foundations were also shut down with decrees.
Critics say Erdogan's government has used the coup attempt as a pretext to quash dissent. The government says the measures are necessary given the security threats facing Turkey.
Under the law, foundations will be inspected annually by civil servants. Local governors or the Interior Minister can block online donation campaigns under a measure to prevent terrorism financing and money laundering. 
Fines of up to 200,000 lira ($26,500.60) can be levied, compared to a previous maximum of 700 lira, in a move the seven organisations said will ""in practice lead to the closure of many associations"".

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is set to move a second batch of Rohingya refugees from neighbouring Myanmar to the remote island of Bhasan Char in the Bay of Bengal this month, officials said on Sunday, despite calls by rights groups not to carry out further relocations.
Around 1,000 Rohingya refugees, members of a Muslim minority who have fled Myanmar, will be moved to the island in the next few days after Bangladesh relocated more than 1,600 early this month, two officials with the direct knowledge of the matter said.
""They will be moved to Chittagong first and then to Bhasan Char, depending on the high tide,"" one of the officials said. The officials declined to be named as the issue had not been made public.
Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said the relocation was voluntary. ""They will not be sent against their will.""
The United Nations has said it has not been allowed to carry out a technical and safety assessment of Bhasan Char, a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, and was not involved in the transfer of refugees there. 
Bangladesh says it is transferring only people who are willing to go and the move will ease chronic overcrowding in camps that are home to more than 1 million Rohingya.
But refugees and humanitarian workers say some of the Rohingya have been coerced into going to the island, which emerged from the sea 20 years ago. 
Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdul Momen told Reuters earlier this month the United Nations should first assess and verify how conducive the environment in Myanmar's Rakhine state was for repatriating the refugees, before carrying out an assessment of Bhasan Char.

Several attempts to kickstart repatriation of Rohingya to Myanmar have failed after refugees said they were too fearful of further violence to return.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger votes in an election on Sunday that is expected to lead to the first transfer of power between two democratically elected presidents in a country reeling from Islamist violence.
Former interior minister Mohamed Bazoum, the ruling party's candidate, is the overwhelming favourite to succeed President Mahamadou Issoufou, who is stepping down after two five-year terms leading the largely desert country of 23 million. 
Bazoum, 60, has promised continuity with Issoufou's policies, while also vowing to clean up pervasive corruption. 
""If I am lucky enough to win this election, you will have chosen someone who is ready from day one,"" he said in a campaign video. 
Niger faces twin security crises. It has suffered repeated attacks near its western borders with Mali and Burkina Faso from militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State. Near its southeastern border with Nigeria it faces attacks from Boko Haram. Hundreds of soldiers and civilians have been killed in the last year alone. 
The economic situation is also critical. More than 40% of the population lives in extreme poverty, and the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed growth to a crawl, compounding the effects of climate change and low prices for top export uranium.
Bazoum faces 29 other candidates, who will hope to force a second round by denying him an outright majority of the vote. 
Hama Amadou, who finished runner-up in the last election, was barred from running because of a criminal conviction, leaving the opposition without an obvious figurehead. 
But last week, Amadou's party called on its supporters to turn out for Mahamane Ousmame, who was president from 1993-1996. 
""After my candidate was disqualified, I didn't have the motivation to come out and vote,"" said Ali Hamma, an Amadou supporter. ""But with the new instructions, I am going to vote."" 
A peaceful transfer of power would be a milestone for Niger, which has experienced four coups since gaining independence from France in 1960. 
It would also stand in stark contrast to Ivory Coast and Guinea, whose presidents this year used constitutional changes to extend their tenures to three terms, raising fears of a democratic backslide in West Africa.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (Reuters) -Federal agents investigating the explosion of a motor home in Nashville were searching a two-story suburban house on Saturday for clues to the blast, which injured three people in the heart of America's country music capital on Christmas Day.
Federal agents were also trying to identify apparent human remains found near the exploded vehicle.
The motor home, parked on a downtown street of Tennessee's largest city, exploded at dawn on Friday moments after police responding to reports of gunfire noticed it and heard an automated message emanating from the vehicle warning of a bomb. 
The thunderous, fiery blast destroyed several vehicles, damaged more than 40 businesses and left a trail of shards from shattered windows.
Following up on what they said were more than 500 leads, local police and agents from the FBI and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) were searching a two-story, red-brick house on Bakertown Road in Antioch, Tennessee, 11 miles (18 km) southeast of Nashville, paying particular attention to its basement, according to a Reuters witness. 
Officials on Saturday declined to name a person of interest in connection with the explosion, but CBS News reported that the investigation has honed in on 63-year-old Anthony Quinn Warner, who recently lived at the Bakertown address, public records showed. According to a document posted online, on Nov. 25 he signed over the property to a woman in Los Angeles at no cost to her. The document was signed by Warner, but not by the woman.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Street View images of the house from 2019 show what appears to be a white motor home in the driveway. Neighbors told local TV station WKRN that the recreational vehicle had been parked there for years and is now gone. 
""Once we have processed the scene, we will look at the evidence and anything that we have recovered from this residence and see how that fits into this investigation,"" FBI spokesman Darrell Debusk, who was at the house on Saturday, told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""At this point we're not prepared to identify any single individual,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge Doug Korneski said at a news conference on Saturday.
Korneski told reporters that investigators were ""vigorously working on"" identifying what appeared to be human remains found in the wreckage. He declined to say whether investigators believe the remains belong to the person behind what officials say was ""an intentional act.""
Korneski said the FBI's Quantico, Virginia-based Behavioral Analysis Unit was helping determine the motivation of the person responsible. 
The vehicle was parked outside an AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) office, and the blast caused widespread telephone, internet and TV service outages in central Tennessee and parts of several neighboring states, including Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama and Georgia.
A RECORDING, THEN A BLAST 
Adding to the cryptic nature of Friday's incident was the eerie preamble described by police and witnesses - a crackle of gunfire followed by an apparently computer-generated female voice from the RV reciting a minute-by-minute countdown to an impending bombing.
Police scrambled to evacuate nearby homes and buildings and called for a bomb squad, which was en route to the scene when the RV blew up. 
Police later posted a photo of the motor home, which they said had arrived in the area about five hours prior to the explosion.
Officials said 41 businesses were damaged and three people were hospitalized with relatively minor injuries. City authorities hailed police officers who they said likely prevented more casualties by acting quickly to clear the area. 
Dozens of agents from the FBI and the ATF were surveying the scene on Saturday. Parked cars and trees were blackened and an exploded water pipe that had been spraying overnight had covered trees in a layer of ice.
""All the windows came in from the living room into the bedroom. The front door became unhinged,"" Buck McCoy, who lives on the block where the blast occurred, told WKRN. ""I had blood coming from my face and on my side and on my legs and a little bit on my feet."" 
Among those hit by communications problems as a result of damage to the AT&T building from the blast were police departments, emergency services and Nashville International Airport, which temporarily halted flights Friday afternoon. 
AT&T said on Saturday that a fire reignited at the building overnight, forcing it to be evacuated, but workers were able to drill access holes into the building to connect generators to critical equipment that it hoped to have back online in hours. 

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee visited the scene on Saturday and said in a Twitter post it was a ""miracle"" that no one was killed. In a letter to President Donald Trump, Lee requested a federal emergency declaration to aid relief efforts.

Health experts and some government officials say the real numbers are likely to be much higher due to the low rate of public PCR testing and the exclusion of private test results from the ministry's figures.

ROME (Reuters) - Archaeologists in Pompeii, the city buried in a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, have made the extraordinary find of a frescoed hot food and drinks shop that served up the ancient equivalent of street food to Roman passersby.
Known as a termopolium, Latin for hot drinks counter, the shop was discovered in the archaeological park's Regio V site, which is not yet open the public, and unveiled on Saturday.
Traces of nearly 2,000-year-old food were found in some of the deep terra cotta jars containing hot food which the shop keeper lowered into a counter with circular holes. 
The front of the counter was decorated with brightly coloured frescoes, some depicting animals that were part of the ingredients in the food sold, such as a chicken and two ducks hanging upside down.
""This is an extraordinary find. It's the first time we are excavating an entire termopolium,"" said Massimo Ossana, director of the Pompeii archaeological park.
Archaeologists also found a decorated bronze drinking bowl known as a patera, ceramic jars used for cooking stews and soups, wine flasks and amphora.
Pompeii, 23 km (14 miles) southeast of Naples, was home to
about 13,000 people when it was buried under ash, pumice pebbles
and dust as it endured the force of an eruption equivalent to
many atomic bombs.
""Our preliminary analyses shows that the figures drawn on the front of the counter, represent, at least in part, the food and drink that were sold there,"" said Valeria Amoretti, a site anthropologist.
Amoretti said traces of pork, fish, snails and beef had been found in the containers, a discovery she called a ""testimony to the great variety of animal products used to prepare dishes"".
About two-thirds of the 66-hectare (165-acre) ancient town has been uncovered. The ruins were not discovered until the 16th
century and organised excavations began about 1750.
A rare documentation of Greco-Roman life, Pompeii is one of
Italy's most popular attractions and a UNESCO World Heritage

Alireza Raisi, spokesman for the national coronavirus task force, said on state TV that a curfew running from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. -- already in place in 108 ""orange,"" or medium-risk, cities -- will be extended to lower-risk ""yellow"" areas on Sunday.
The curfew, under which the use of private cars is banned to reduce the level of contacts between people, resulted in nearly 100,000 fines on one night in the past week.
The Health Ministry said 134 people had died of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, the lowest since Sept. 13, taking total deaths to 54,574 in the Middle East's worst-affected country. There were 5,760 new cases, the lowest since Oct. 22, bringing the total to 1,194,964.
Iran said on Thursday it had received approval from U.S. authorities to buy coronavirus vaccines from the World Health Organization-led COVAX alliance. It did not say which vaccines it was buying.
The head of Iran's Red Crescent Society told state TV that, separate from the government, it was planning to import an unnamed Chinese vaccine. Asked about possible concerns over the drug's safety, the Red Crescent chief, Karim Hemmati, said: ""All imported vaccines and medicines undergo controls by (Iran's) Food and Drug Administration. ... So there is no problem there."" 
In televised remarks on Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani reiterated Iran's complaint that U.S. sanctions have made it difficult to make payments for vaccines. ""We arranged money from a bank to buy vaccines from COVAX but they said you need (U.S.) approval,"" he said. 

Food and medicines are exempt from sanctions that Washington reimposed on Tehran, but the U.S. measures have deterred some foreign banks from processing financial transactions for Iran deals.

The South American country's four main opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary vote, arguing conditions for a free and fair election were not met, and most Western democracies, including the United States, have said they do not recognize the election results. 
Saturday's vote paves the way for opposition leader Juan Guaido, recognized by dozens of countries as the crisis-stricken OPEC nation's legitimate leader, to retain his role as the parliament's speaker. Guaido's nearly two-year push to oust Maduro, who he labels a dictator, has been unsuccessful. 
""Despite threats from the dictatorship and intimidation from the regime, the parliament will continue in this extraordinary period,"" Guaido said on Saturday. 
The statute provides for a small group of legislators to carry out the National Assembly's functions. The change comes as dozens of legislators have fled the country, or have expressed unwillingness to continue serving in Congress next year, due to what they describe as threats from the government.
Members of one of the four major parties that make up Guaido's coalition, Democratic Action, abstained from the vote because they did not support delegating the functions of parliament to a small group. 
Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S.-puppet seeking to oust him in a coup, has said the election was transparent and points out that several opposition candidates participated. Guaido says those candidates are shadow allies of the government.

The socialist-controlled Congress is scheduled to be sworn in on Jan 5, 2021.

Tensions in the border region have flared since the outbreak of conflict in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region in early November and the arrival of more than 50,000 mainly Tigrayan refugees in eastern Sudan.
Disputes have been concentrated on agricultural land in al-Fashqa, which falls within Sudan's international boundaries but has long been settled by Ethiopian farmers.
There have been armed clashes between Sudanese and Ethiopian forces in recent weeks, with both sides accusing the other of instigating the violence. The two countries held talks this week in Khartoum over the issue.
""We believe in dialogue to solve any problem,"" Sudan's information minister, Faisal Salih, told Reuters. ""But our army will do its duty to take back all our land. Currently our army has taken back between 60% and 70% of Sudanese land."" 
Sudanese forces had acted defensively, and clashes had subsided in the past two days, Salih said. 
""Sudanese intelligence reports confirmed that the organisation, training and arming of the forces that attacked were not militias but regular forces,"" he added.
Ahead of the talks this week, Ethiopia's foreign minister, Ato Demeke Mekonnen said the Sudanese military had carried out attacks beginning on Nov. 9. 
""Agricultural products of Ethiopian farmers are looted, their camps are vandalized, and they are also hampered from harvesting their own farms. A number of civilians have been murdered and wounded,"" he said. 
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed blamed ""parties with hidden motives to create hostility and suspicion between peoples"" for the violence, in a statement issued on Thursday.
Sudanese officials say the border was demarcated in the first years of the 20th century, and that negotiations are limited to talks over placing additional markers on the land at 2km rather than 10km intervals.

During a religious celebration in a small city west of Buenos Aires, Bishop Oscar Ojea, president of the local bishops' conference and an outspoken opponent of abortion, suggested a ""no"" vote was supported by ""medical science and law.""
""Blessed Virgin, we ask you to pause your gaze on the legislators who will decide on a matter of such extreme delicacy,"" Ojea said during a prayer service, ""so that you can provoke a serene reflection in their minds and in their hearts.""
On Dec. 11, Argentina's lower house of Congress approved the measure to allow abortion until the fourteenth week of pregnancy. The coming Senate vote is expected to be close, and controversial.
A similar bill was defeated by Argentina's Congress in 2018. Current law allows for abortion only when there is a serious risk to the mother's health or in the event of rape.
Argentina’s abortion rights movement, backed by feminist groups galvanized in recent years to stop violence against women, argues that legalizing the practice would end unregulated abortions that government data has shown among the leading causes of maternal deaths.
Broad demonstrations are expected both for and against the bill when it is debated in the Senate on Tuesday. 
On the same day, the Senate will also debate a side project to provide assistance to women who want to move forward with their pregnancy and need help facing economic hardship.

“The Independent Electoral Commission has suspended campaign meetings in districts and cities categorised by the Ministry of Health as having high spread of Coronavirus. From December 26, 2020, no campaign meetings will be held in Mbarara, Kabarole, Luwero, Kasese, Masaka, Wakiso, Jinja, Kalungu, Kazo, Kampala City and Tororo,” said commission spokesman Paul Bukenya in a statement.
Uganda has reported 33,360 COVID-19infections and 245 deaths from the virus since the pandemic began.
Candidate and pop star Bobi Wine, 38, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the strongest challenger to President Yoweri Museveni, 76. The president has been in power since 1986.
Wine is popular among young people in the country. Many of his supporters say they are drawn to him by the criticism of Museveni’s government woven into his lyrics. Others say that as a young leader he is better positioned to tackle the challenges they face.
Last month, three people died in protests that erupted after police arrested Wine while he was campaigning in the country's east for violating anti-coronavirus measures.
Wine said the commission's action was ""cowardly"" in a tweet after the announcement, adding: ""The dictatorship is in panic.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Leaders of Indian farmers' unions have agreed to meet ministers on Tuesday, possibly paving the way for a seventh round of talks with the government which has so far failed to mollify growers who say three new agricultural laws threaten their livelihoods.
Worried over farmers' round-the-clock sit-ins on the outskirts of New Delhi, the government of Prime Minister Narendra had on Thursday invited protest leaders to further talks.
Farmers' unions still insist they want the laws repealed, a coalition of unions called Samyukta Kisan Morcha said on Saturday in a letter to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare.
The government says the laws, which came into force in September, will unshackle farmers from having to sell their produce only at regulated wholesale markets. It argues farmers will gain if large traders, retailers and food processors can buy directly from producers, bypassing antiquated wholesale markets.
But tens of thousands of farmers have camped out on national highways demanding the government withdraw the laws that they fear will eventually dismantle regulated markets and stop the government buying rice and wheat at guaranteed prices.
Farmers' leaders would also in Tuesday's meeting oppose plans to impose stiff penalties for the burning of crop stubble, a major source of air pollution, according to the farmers' letter seen by Reuters. 

Modi has dismissed the farmers' protests as motivated by his political opponents, while the main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi has accused the prime minister of introducing the laws to help a few business people.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Three United Nations peacekeepers were killed in Central African Republic, the U.N. mission there said on Saturday, as the government and its allies tried to fend off a rebel offensive ahead of Sunday's presidential and legislative elections. 
The Burundian peacekeepers were killed on Friday by unidentified assailants in Dekoa, about 200 km (125 miles) north of the capital Bangui, according to the U.N. mission, known as MINUSCA. Two more were injured, it said.
Peacekeepers were also attacked by unknown assailants in Bakouma in the southwest of the country, MINUSCA added. 
Central African Republic, which is rich in diamonds, timber and gold, has experienced five coups and numerous rebellions since independence from France in 1960. It has been gripped by insecurity since former President Francois Bozize was ousted by a rebellion in 2013. 
President Faustin-Archange Touadera is seeking a second term governing the country of five million on Sunday. On Saturday, the constitutional court denied opposition requests to delay the elections, ensuring they will go ahead as planned.
The court rejected Bozize's presidential candidacy earlier this month, saying he did not satisfy the ""good morality"" requirement because of an arrest warrant and U.N. sanctions against him for allegedly ordering assassinations, torture and other crimes when he was president.
The United Nations also accuses him of collaborating with a coalition of militias to prevent the elections from going ahead.
Bozize has denied ordering or committing crimes when he was president while his party, the main opposition, has denied the U.N. allegation, saying they have no links to militia or rebels. 
Reuters has not been able to reach Bozize for comment.
Attacks by rebel groups opposed to Touadera surged after the court rejected Bozize's candidacy. They briefly seized the country's fourth-largest city this week before being pushed back. 
Underscoring the fragility of the security situation, the army's chief of staff said on Friday that a number of soldiers had deserted and told them to immediately rejoin their units. 
President Touadera's international security partners, including Russia, France and Rwanda, have responded to the violence by sending troops and equipment.
Three hundred Rwandan peacekeepers arrived from South Sudan on Thursday, MINUSCA said, while two Russian military helicopters were offloaded from a cargo plane at Bangui airport on Friday, according to photos and government sources.

Russia has already granted Snowden permanent residency rights, lawyer Anatoly Kucherena said earlier this year, a vital step towards Russian citizenship.
U.S. authorities have for years wanted Snowden returned to face a criminal trial on espionage charges brought in 2013.
""As we expected, there is a new addition to his family. Edward and Lindsay have had a son. The mother and baby are in excellent health,"" Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Saturday, citing Kucherena.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>","George Blake, last in line of Cold War spies who betrayed Britain, dies at 98","By Timothy Heritage and Polina Ivanova
LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - George Blake, who died in Russia on Saturday at the age of 98, was the last in a line of British spies whose secret work for the Soviet Union humiliated the intelligence establishment when it was discovered at the height of the Cold War.
Britain says he exposed the identities of hundreds of Western agents across Eastern Europe in the 1950s, some of whom were executed as a result of his treason. 
His case was among the most notorious of the Cold War, alongside those of a separate ring of British double agents known as the Cambridge Five.
Unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1961, Blake was sentenced to 42 years in London's Wormwood Scrubs prison. In a classic cloak-and-dagger story, he escaped in 1966 with the help of other inmates and two peace activists, and was smuggled out of Britain in a camper van. He made it through Western Europe undiscovered and crossed the Iron Curtain into East Berlin.
He spent the rest of his life in the Soviet Union and then Russia, where he was feted as a hero.
Reflecting on his life in an interview with Reuters in Moscow in 1991, Blake said he had believed the world was on the eve of Communism.
    ""It was an ideal which, if it could have been achieved, would have been well worth it,"" he said. 
""I thought it could be, and I did what I could to help it, to build such a society. It has not proved possible. But I think it is a noble idea and I think humanity will return to it.""
In a condolence message published by the Kremlin, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Blake was a professional of particular vitality and courage who made an invaluable contribution to global strategic parity and peace. 
""The memory of this legendary person will be preserved forever in our hearts,"" he wrote.
BECOMING A COMMITTED COMMUNIST
Blake was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands on Nov. 11, 1922, to a Dutch mother and an Egyptian Jewish father who was a naturalised Briton.
He escaped from the Netherlands in World War Two after joining the Dutch resistance as a courier and reached Britain in January 1943. After joining the British navy, he started working for the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, in 1944. 
After the war, Blake served briefly in the German city of Hamburg and studied Russian at Cambridge University before being sent in 1948 to Seoul where he gathered intelligence on Communist North Korea, Communist China and the Soviet Far East. 
He was captured and imprisoned when North Korean troops took Seoul after the Korean War began in 1950. It was during his time in a North Korean prison that he became a committed Communist, reading the works of Karl Marx and feeling outrage at heavy U.S. bombing of North Korea.
After his release in 1953, he returned to Britain and in 1955 was sent by MI6 to Berlin, where he collected information on Soviet spies but also passed secrets to Moscow about British and U.S operations.
""I met a Soviet comrade about once a month,"" he said in a 2012 interview published by Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
Blake described how, for these meetings, he had travelled to the Soviet-controlled sector of Berlin on a rail link joining different parts of the divided city. His contact would be waiting for him in a car and they would go to a safe house.
""I handed over films and we chatted. Sometimes we had a glass of Tsimlyansk champagne (Soviet sparkling wine).""
Blake was eventually exposed by a Polish defector and brought home to Britain, where he was sentenced and jailed.
When he escaped from Wormwood Scrubs, he left behind his wife, Gillian, and three children. After Gillian divorced him, Blake married a Soviet woman, Ida, with whom he had a son, Misha. He worked at a foreign affairs institute before retiring with her to a dacha, or country house, outside Moscow.
SIPPING MARTINIS WITH PHILBY 
Blake, who went by the Russian name Georgy Ivanovich, was awarded a medal by Putin in 2007 and held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the former KGB security service, from which he received a pension.
""These are the happiest years of my life, and the most peaceful,"" Blake said in the 2012 interview marking his 90th birthday. By then, he said, his eyesight was failing and he was ""virtually blind"". He did not voice regret about his past.
""Looking back on my life, everything seems logical and natural,"" he said, describing himself as happy and lucky.
Though he worked separately from the Cambridge Five - a spy ring of former Cambridge students who passed information to the Soviet Union - Blake said that during his retirement he got to know two of them, Donald Maclean and Kim Philby.
He reminisced about drinking martinis, the preferred cocktail of fictitious British spy James Bond, with Philby but said he was closer in spirit to Maclean. 
Maclean died in Russia in 1983, and Philby in 1988. Of the rest of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess died in Russia in 1963, and Anthony Blunt in London in 1983.

John Cairncross, the last to be publicly identified by investigative journalists and former Soviet intelligence officers, died in England in 1995.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai protesters demonstrated on Saturday to demand more action to help seafood sellers hit by a COVID-19 outbreak as the government urged people to eat more shellfish.
Thailand's worst outbreak of the new coronavirus was reported just over a week ago, with more than 1,500 infections now linked to a shrimp market outside Bangkok. Most of those infected have been migrant workers from Myanmar.
Seafood sellers say business has fallen in a country whose economy had already been badly hit by a collapse in tourism.
""We want the government to create confidence in shrimp consumption,"" said Piyarat Chongthep, among the scores of protesters at Government House, some of whom briefly scuffled with police.
The issue is the latest seized on by protesters who for months have been demanding the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a new constitution and reforms of the monarchy.
At a seafood-eating event in a nearby province, government ministers said they were trying to promote seafood.
""We are building confidence that you can have seafood without getting infected,"" Anucha Nakasai, minister for the prime minister's office, told reporters.
A major shrimp exporter, Thailand sold 36 billion baht ($1.2 billion) worth in the first 10 months of 2020, industry association data showed.
""The problem now is there is no market,"" said one shrimp seller at Government House.
COVID-19 task force spokesman Taweesin Wisanuyothin reported 110 new coronavirus infections, of which nearly all 94 were connected to the seafood market.

Thailand has a total of 6,020 confirmed cases and 60 deaths, low rates for a country of 70 million people.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - India's government detained at least 75 Kashmiri political leaders and activists to forestall political unrest after an alliance of Kashmir's regional political parties won a local election, leaders and a police official said on Saturday.
The District Council election, concluded early this week, was the first such exercise since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government last year revoked the special status of the Muslim-majority, Indian-controlled region. New Delhi then cracked down on the opposition and rounded up hundreds of people to preempt protests and violence.
The new detentions, including separatist leaders and members of the banned Jamat-e-Islami group, were for preventive custody, said a senior police official, who asked not to be identified in line with official policy.
India and Pakistan have claimed all of the Kashmir region since the partition of British-ruled India into Muslim Pakistan and Hindu-majority India in 1947. Two of the three wars they have fought have been over the Himalayan region.
The detentions undermine the verdict of the people, said Imran Nabi Dar, spokesman for the National Conference, a regional party and a key member of the alliance.
The alliance's victory shows that Kashmiris have not accepted Modi's decision to end Kashmir's special status, said Omar Abdullah, a former chief minister and head of the National Conference.

After their release from lengthy detention, Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, chief of the Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party, announced the alliance in October to seek a peaceful restoration of Kashmir's autonomy.

It said Abdulhamid Mir Baluchzehi, known as Owais, one of the perpetrators of the 2015 operation, “was hanged this morning after legal procedures” in Zahedan in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province.
It said Mir Baluchzehi was a principle members of the Sunni extremist group Jaish al-Adl, or the Army of Justice, and was charged with “armed action against the country and membership in anti-regime groups.”
The impoverished Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, has long been the scene of frequent clashes between security forces and Sunni militants and drug smugglers. The population of the province is predominantly Sunni Muslim, while most Iranians are Shi'ite.
Jaish al-Adl, which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for ethnic minority Baluchis, has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent years on Iranian security forces in the province.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea posted its second-highest daily number of coronavirus cases on Saturday as outbreaks at a prison, nursing homes and churches continued to grow, prompting authorities to plead for a halt to all year-end gatherings. 
The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said there were 1,132 new coronavirus cases on Friday, not far off the record 1,241 logged a day earlier.
""The virus is spreading whenever and wherever it wants,"" Health Minister Kwon Deok-cheol told an intra-agency meeting, adding that people were also being infected at small gatherings with friends and acquaintances. 
""As we stand at the crossroads of the third wave, how we stop the spread hinges on how we spend this year-end and New Year period."" 
KDCA chief Jeong Eun-kyeong urged that all private gatherings be cancelled and public and religious events be held online. 
The government plans to hold a meeting on Sunday to discuss whether it will tighten distancing rules to the toughest level for the greater Seoul area.
That would shut another 1.2 million stores and allow only essential workers into offices. Curbs currently in place have closed night clubs, karaoke bars and other night entertainment venues as well as banned on-site dining after 9 p.m.
Ahead of Christmas and New Year holidays, the government also banned gatherings of more than four people in the greater Seoul area and closed ski resorts and other tourist spots. 
South Korea had largely managed to control early major outbreaks with aggressive testing and contact tracing. But critics have faulted authorities for being over-confident and failing to properly prepare for the third and largest wave.
The current largest cluster is at a prison in eastern Seoul, where 520 inmates, workers and their family members have been infected, prompting health authorities to test all 650 people there. The virus likely spread easily as the prison consists of five, high-rise buildings and suffers from over-capacity, a health official said. 

South Korea's total infections now stand at 55,902, with 793 deaths, KDCA data showed.

762,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2020 11:00PM ET</span>",U.S. judge again delays execution of lone woman on federal death row,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge said that the Justice Department broke the law when it rescheduled the execution of the only woman on federal death row last month, potentially pushing her execution into Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's new administration.
U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss on Thursday vacated an order from the Federal Bureau of Prisons, which is part of the Justice Department, that had rescheduled convicted murderer Lisa Montgomery's execution to Jan. 12. 
Her execution had originally been scheduled for Dec. 8, but Moss agreed last month to delay after Montgomery's attorneys fell ill with COVID-19 and were unable to file a timely clemency petition on her behalf.
Moss on Nov. 19 gave Montgomery's lawyers until Dec. 24 to file the clemency request and granted Montgomery a stay of execution until Dec. 31. On Nov. 23, the Bureau of Prisons announced it was rescheduling her execution to Jan. 12, 2021. 
Moss on Thursday sided with Montgomery's lawyers, who argued that federal regulations bar the Bureau of Prisons from rescheduling an execution during a stay period. Under Moss's Thursday order, the Bureau of Prisons cannot set a new date for Montgomery's execution until Jan. 1. 
Justice Department rules require inmates be notified of their execution date at least 20 days beforehand, except when the date follows a postponement of fewer than 20 days. That means Montgomery's execution could be pushed to after Biden, who opposes the death penalty, takes office on Jan. 20.
The Justice Department, under Attorney General William Barr, who stepped down earlier this week, resumed the use of the federal death penalty earlier this year following a 17-year hiatus.
Montgomery, now 52, was convicted in 2007 of kidnapping and strangling Bobbie Jo Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant. Montgomery then cut the baby, who survived the attack, out of the womb. Her lawyers had said that Montgomery has long suffered from severe mental illness and was the victim of sexual assault. 
""Given the severity of Mrs. Montgomery’s mental illness, the sexual and physical torture she endured throughout her life, and the connection between her trauma and the facts of her crime, we appeal to President Trump to grant her mercy, and commute her sentence to life imprisonment,"" Sandra Babcock, an attorney for Montgomery and clinical professor of law at Cornell Law School, said in a statement. 

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately provide comment on the Christmas holiday.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Sydney residents were urged not to head to the shops for Boxing Day bargains, while those in some northern beach suburbs prepared to re-enter a strict lockdown for three days from Sunday as the city seeks to stamp out a coronavirus outbreak.
The state of New South Wales recorded nine new coronavirus cases, eight of them directly linked to the northern beaches outbreak, which now stands at 116 confirmed cases. Lockdown measures for some suburbs were first imposed on Dec. 19 but were eased slightly for the Christmas break. 
""Our strategy is to make sure we nip this in the bud as soon as we can,"" the state's premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said at a televised news conference.
""And in the next few days we will let the community know what New Year's Eve will look like and what January looks like for the northern beaches and the rest of Sydney."" 
She encouraged Sydneysiders to switch to online purchases for Boxing Day shopping.
Australia's National Retail Association this week forecast a record A$2.75 billion ($2.1 billion) Boxing Day splurge, up 5% from last year. Online shopping is expected to jump 42% to A$930 million.
Victoria, which on Saturday saw its 57th-consecutive day of no new coronavirus infections and no related deaths, is expected to account for about a quarter of the forecast spending.
Residents in Victoria's capital Melbourne, which endured a 111-day harsh lockdown earlier this year, have been embracing increasing freedom of movement.
On Saturday, a 30,000-strong crowd flocked for the first time in nearly 300 days to the city's cricket grounds for the sport's Boxing Day Test, although attendance was capped at a third of normal levels.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (Reuters) -A motor home parked on a street exploded in downtown Nashville at dawn on Friday, moments after a recorded message emanating from the vehicle warned of a bomb, in what police called an ""intentional act"" in the heart of America's country music capital.
Three people were injured in the Christmas morning blast, though none critically. Authorities said it was uncertain whether anyone was inside the recreational vehicle when it exploded, but police reported hours later that investigators had found possible human remains nearby.
Nashville Mayor John Cooper ordered a curfew imposed around the blast site through the holiday weekend as FBI investigators comb the scene, though police said they were aware of no further threats to Tennessee's most populous city. 
Authorities offered no explanation as to a possible motive, and there was no claim of responsibility. 
The blast came just moments after officers responded to reports of gunfire in the area and discovered the recreational vehicle parked outside an AT&T (NYSE:T) building in downtown Nashville at about 6 a.m. CST (1200 GMT). 
Police heard a recorded voice warning that a ""bomb would detonate in 15 minutes,"" Nashville Police Chief John Drake told reporters. 
The message, as captured in a recording broadcast later by local television news stations, said: ""This area must be evacuated now. This area must be evacuated now. If you can hear this message, evacuate now. If you can hear this message, evacuate now.""
Officers quickly went door-to-door in nearby buildings to hustle people to safety, and called for dispatch of the police bomb squad, which was on its way to the scene when the vehicle blew up, police spokesman Don Aaron said.
The Metro Nashville Police Department posted a photo of the recreational vehicle on its Twitter feed and said that the vehicle had arrived in the area at 1:22 a.m.
COMPUTERIZED-GENERATED VOICE
An area resident, Betsy Williams (NYSE:WMB), told CNN that she was awakened by the sound of gunfire and looked out her window to see an RV parked across the street as it began playing a message delivered by a ""computerized"" female voice. She said the voice warned the vehicle contained a bomb and started a minute-by-minute countdown to the actual explosion.
""Everything shook, it was quite a blast,"" she told CNN.
The fiery blast destroyed a number of other vehicles parked nearby, shattered windows and heavily damaged several adjacent buildings, sending a pall of black smoke into the sky that could be seen for miles. The mayor said a total of 41 businesses were damaged.
Fire officials said three people were taken to local hospitals with relatively minor injuries, and they were listed in stable condition. Authorities said quick action by police to begin evacuating the area before the blast likely prevented more casualties.
""Obviously, they heard the announcements coming from this vehicle,"" Aaron told reporters. ""They took them seriously. And worked to seal the streets to protect folks and we think it worked."" He called the blast ""an intentional act."" 
Shops and other buildings were closed given the early hour of the day, the Christmas holiday and prevailing COVID-19 restrictions on public gatherings, also helping to keep injuries to a minimum. 
At an early evening briefing, Drake, the police chief, told reporters there were ""no fatalities we know of,"" but said investigators were examining ""tissue that we believe could be human remains"" found in the vicinity of the blast.
Police said they had not ascertained whether anyone was in the motor home when it exploded.
MOTIVE UNCLEAR
Damage to AT&T facilities from the explosion caused widespread disruptions of telephone, internet and fiber optic TV service in central Tennessee and parts of several neighboring states, including Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama and Georgia, the company said.
Drake said authorities had received no threats of an attack prior to the reports of gunfire at the outset of the incident, describing the blast as a ""total surprise."" 
""We had no pre-warnings at all,"" he said.
The explosion occurred about two blocks from Lower Broadway, where some of Nashville's famous live music venues are located. The Ryman (NYSE:RHP) Auditorium, former home of the Grand Ole Opry and just three blocks from the blast scene, was undamaged. The Gaylord Opryland and current Grand Ole Opry complexes, which sit outside the downtown area, were not impacted. 
""It’s a startling thing to have it happen in Nashville so close, and on Christmas, but we understand that America is in very tumultuous times right now,"" country singer John Rich, who owns a honky-tonk club a block from the explosion, told Reuters. 
The blast could be heard for miles and was felt at least nine blocks away, knocking one officer off his feet, Aaron said.
Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were assisting in the probe, agency officials said.
Nashville's vice mayor, Jim Shulman, told CNN the incident appeared to have been a solitary act, though bomb-sniffing dogs were being led through the downtown area as a precaution.

The move against Sobol is the latest in a clampdown on the Kremlin's opponents before next year's parliamentary election. Sobol aims to run for office, although outspoken critics of the Kremlin are often prevented from standing.
Sobol was detained for 48 hours after questioning, Navalny, one of the Kremlin's fiercest opponents, wrote on Twitter.
Russia's Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, said on its website on Friday it had launched a criminal case against Sobol. It did not mention any detention.
Sobol's supporters and the authorities gave different accounts of events leading up to Friday's actions.
Her supporters said she rang the doorbell on Monday of an apartment owned by the family of a man who Navalny has said was an FSB security service officer involved in a bungled attempt to poison him using a nerve agent.
The FSB has dismissed Navalny's account of the poisoning.
In its account, the Investigative Committee said Sobol and several others tried to gain entry to an old woman's flat in Moscow, wearing uniforms used by the state consumer health watchdog. 
It accused her of tricking a delivery courier to enter the apartment block before barging into the woman's flat when she opened the door. It said Sobol was suspected of using violence to enter illegally, an offence that can carry a jail term of up to two years.
Navalny wrote on Twitter: ""They are locking up the mother of a small child for two days to tell everybody: don't dig into this case. Don't dare to mess with our killers and poisoners and knock on their doors. These killers are untouchable.""
Germany and other Western nations say Navalny was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in a murder attempt. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the accusations.

Ferry services between Dover and the French port of Calais resumed on Thursday, ending a blockade France had imposed for several days following the discovery of a new coronavirus variant in England.
British transport minister Grant Shapps said on Twitter on Friday that more than 10,000 coronavirus tests had been carried out on lorry drivers and only 24 of them had tested positive.
""Over 4,500 HGVs (heavy goods vehicles) are back over the Channel,"" Shapps said.
Britain deployed additional troops to help clear the queues of lorries waiting for COVID-19 tests before being allowed to board cross-channel ferries. British media said 800 extra soldiers were sent to support 300 initially deployed.
Soldiers checked vehicles and drivers' documents at the entrance to the port. In one case, French officials, who were in Dover to help clear the backlog, were seen administering a nasal swab to a driver.

The French and British governments agreed to end the blockade on Tuesday but the British authorities had said it would take days to clear the long lines of trucks.

TOKYO (Reuters) -A top Japanese defence official on Friday urged U.S. President-elect Joe Biden to ""be strong"" in supporting Taiwan in the face of an aggressive China, calling the island's safety a ""red line.""
""We are concerned China will expand its aggressive stance into areas other than Hong Kong. I think one of the next targets, or what everyone is worried about, is Taiwan,"" State Minister of Defense Yasuhide Nakayama told Reuters.
In an interview, Nakayama, Japan's deputy defence minister, urged Biden to take a similar line on Taiwan as outgoing President Donald Trump, who has significantly boosted military sales to the Chinese-claimed island and increased engagement.
Japan's engagement with Taiwan has also flourished in recent years on a largely non-governmental basis. Tokyo maintains a ""one China"" policy, delicately balancing its relationships with neighbouring giant China and its longtime military ally in Washington.
Japan shares strategic interests with Taiwan, which sits in sea lanes through which much of Japan's energy supplies and trade flow.
""So far, I haven't yet seen a clear policy or an announcement on Taiwan from Joe Biden. I would like to hear it quickly, then we can also prepare our response on Taiwan in accordance,"" Nakayama said.
During the presidential campaign, Biden called for strengthening ties with Taiwan and other ""like-minded democracies.""
Decades ago as senator, Biden questioned whether the United States had an ""obligation"" to defend Taiwan. But many in his foreign policy circles acknowledge that U.S. imperatives have changed as a rising, authoritarian China has become more assertive and sought to shape global institutions.
An official in Biden's transition team said the president-elect believes U.S. support for Taiwan ""must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan.""
""Once in office, he will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan,"" the official said.
Beijing has been angered by increased U.S. support for Taiwan, including arms sales and visits to Taipei by senior U.S. officials, further straining already poor Sino-U.S. ties. China considers democratically run Taiwan one of its provinces and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control.
'RED LINE'
    ""Taiwan is China's internal affair,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Friday. ""We firmly oppose interference in China's internal affairs by any country or anyone by any means.""
In Taipei, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou noted the strong bipartisan U.S. support for Taiwan based on the ""shared language"" of freedom and democracy.
""Taiwan looks forward to working closely with the Biden team, to continue to steadily improve Taiwan-U.S. relations on the basis of the existing solid friendship,"" she said.
U.S. officials in Tokyo could not be reached as the embassy was closed for Christmas.
""There's a red line in Asia - China and Taiwan,"" Nakayama said, citing a red line that former President Barack Obama declared over Syria's use of chemical weapons - a line Damascus then crossed. Biden was Obama's vice president.
""How will Joe Biden in the White House react in any case if China crosses this red line?"" said Nakayama, who attended a memorial for the late former Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui in August, before taking his defence position. ""The United States is the leader of the democratic countries. I have a strong feeling to say: America, be strong!""
Chinese fighter jets in recent months have conducted waves of forays, including crossing the sensitive mid-line between China and Taiwan, ratcheting up pressure tactics to erode Taiwan's will to resist, say current and former senior Taiwanese and U.S. military officers.

Taiwan deployed its navy and air force on Sunday as a Chinese aircraft carrier group led by the country's newest carrier sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, a day after a U.S. warship transited the same waterway.

The attack occurred in the village of Bekoji in Bulen county in the Metekel zone, and the state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission initially estimated more than 100 people had been killed.
More than 40,000 people fled their homes due to the fighting, Bulen county spokesman Kassahun Addisu said. He said the county had buried 207 people. 
Wednesday's attack by unidentified gunmen was the latest deadly assault in an area bedevilled by ethnic violence.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed called the attack a ""massacre"" and deployed federal troops there the next day. The military killed 42 armed men accused of attacking the village.
Ethiopia has been grappling with outbreaks of deadly violence since Abiy was appointed in 2018 and accelerated political reforms that loosened the state's iron grip on regional rivalries.

LONDON (Reuters) - All many people want for Christmas this year is a simple hug, Britain's Queen Elizabeth said in her annual festive message, saying it would be hard for those who lost loved ones to COVID-19 pandemic or were separated by curbs on social mixing.
In her traditional pre-recorded Christmas Day address to the nation, the 94-year-old monarch repeatedly spoke of hope for the future whilst acknowledging millions of Britons would be unable to have their usual family celebrations this year. 
""Of course for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness; some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety when all they really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand,"" Elizabeth said. 
""If you are among them, you are not alone. And let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers."" 
The queen herself has had to eschew her traditional Christmas celebrations, and is spending the festive season quietly at Windsor Castle with her husband Prince Philip, 99.
Usually, all the Windsors gather at her home on the Sandringham estate in eastern England, the walk to a nearby church for a Christmas Day service is a staple of the royal calendar.
However, Britain is currently battling to curb the spread of a new variant of the novel coronavirus, with the number of new infections reaching record levels this week and the number of hospital admissions and death soaring.
Much of the country has been placed under tight restrictions, and for London and the surrounding areas, households are not allowed to mix at all over Christmas, while for other areas there are strict curbs limiting contact to just a single day.
""Remarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has in many ways brought us closer,"" said the queen, adding the royals had been inspired by stories of those who volunteered to help others in need.

""In the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnificently to the challenges of the year and I'm so proud and moved by this quiet indomitable spirit.""

776,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Turkey debates law that would increase oversight of NGOs,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament began debating a draft law on Friday that would increase oversight of non-governmental organisations and which, according to rights campaigners, risks limiting the freedoms of civil-society groups. 
The bill would allow the interior minister to replace members of organisations who are being investigated for terrorism charges. The interior ministry could also apply to courts to halt the groups' activities under the draft bill. 
The government says the measure, covering ""foundations and associations"", aims to prevent non-profit organisations from financing terrorism and to punish those who violate the law.
Civil-society groups, including Amnesty International and the Human Rights Association, said terrorism charges in Turkey were arbitrary, and that the draft law would violate the presumption of innocence and punish those whose trials were not finalised.
The bill was drafted by President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party (AKP), which holds a majority in parliament with nationalist MHP allies, suggesting it is likely to pass.
Investigations based on terrorism charges have been launched against hundreds of thousands of people under a crackdown following a failed coup in 2016. Hundreds of foundations were also shut down with decrees following the coup attempt.
Critics say Erdogan and the AKP have used the failed coup as pretext to quash dissent. The government says the measures were necessary given the security threats facing Turkey.
Under the draft law, foundations would be inspected annually by civil servants who could request any documents from them.
Local governors or the interior minister could block online donation campaigns to prevent terrorism financing and money laundering, under the draft law. 
Fines of up to 200,000 lira ($26,200) could be levied for any group found to be engaged in illegal online donation campaigns, compared with a current maximum of 700 lira.

Flooding was also possible, with snow from earlier storms melting or morphing into globs of icy slush and up to 5 inches (13 cm) of rain forecast for some upstate New York areas, said Rich Otto, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -Pope Francis in his Christmas message on Friday said political and business leaders must not allow market forces and patent laws to take priority over making Covid 19 vaccines available to all, condemning nationalism and ""the virus of radical individualism"".
In a sign of the times, Francis delivered his traditional ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message virtually from a lectern inside the Vatican instead of from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica before tens of thousands.
The pandemic and its social and economic effects dominated the message, in which Francis called for global unity and help for nations suffering from conflicts and humanitarian crises.
""At this moment in history, marked by the ecological crisis and grave economic and social imbalances only worsened by the coronavirus pandemic, it is all the more important for us to acknowledge one another as brothers and sisters,"" he said.
Stressing that health is an international issue, he appeared to criticise so-called 'vaccine nationalism', which U.N. officials fear will worsen the pandemic if poor nations receive the vaccine last.
""I beg everyone, heads of state, companies and international organisations to promote cooperation and not competition, to find a solution for everyone - vaccines for all - especially for the most vulnerable and needy in all areas of the planet,"" he said.
""The most vulnerable and needy must be first,"" he said, in the Vatican's Hall of the Benedictions, with only about 50 Vatican staff wearing masks sitting along the long walls.
""RADICAL INDIVIDUALISM""
""We can't put ourselves before others, putting market forces and patent laws before the laws of love and the health of humanity,"" he said. ""We cannot let closed nationalisms block us from living like the true human family that we are.""
Francis also appeared to criticise people who have refused to wear masks because it violates their freedom, an attitude that has become widespread in nations such as the United States.
""And neither can we allow the virus of radical individualism to triumph over us and make us indifferent to the suffering of other brothers and sisters,"" he said.
Italians are under a nationwide lockdown for much of the Christmas and New Year holiday period. The restrictions mean people are not able to go to St. Peter's Square or the basilica for papal events, all of which have been moved indoors.
Christmas is above all a time to help others because Jesus himself was born a poor outcast, Francis said on Thursday night at his Christmas Eve Mass, which started two hours early so the few participants could get home in time before a 10 p.m. curfew.
""May the Child of Bethlehem help us, then, to be generous, supportive and helpful, especially towards those who are vulnerable, the sick, those unemployed or experiencing hardship due to the economic effects of the pandemic, and women who have suffered domestic violence during these months of lockdown,"" he said in his Friday address.
He then called for peace and reconciliation in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Nagorno-Karabakh, South Sudan, Nigeria and Cameroon and Iraq, which he is due to visit in early March.

He also asked to comfort those suffering from humanitarian crises or natural disasters in Burkina Fasso, Mali, Niger, the Philippines and Vietnam.

779,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Ethiopia sets national election for mid-2021,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) -Ethiopia will hold a parliamentary election on June 5, 2021, the National Electoral Board said on Friday, as Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed tries to quell outbreaks of deadly political and ethnic violence in several regions.
Abiy's Prosperity Party, a pan-Ethiopian movement he founded a year ago, faces challenges from increasingly strident ethnically-based parties seeking more power for their regions. 
Africa's second most populous nation has a federal system and 10 regional governments, many of whom have border disputes or face low-level unrest. 
In the northern Tigray region, thousands of people are believed to have died and 950,000 have fled their homes since fighting between regional forces and the federal government erupted on Nov. 4. Tigray held its own elections in September in defiance of the federal government, which declared the polls illegal. 
The election board said its calendar for next year's polls does not include an election in Tigray. It said it would announce a date for elections there once the interim government established during the conflict is able to support the opening of election offices there. 
For nearly three decades until Abiy's appointment, Ethiopia was ruled by a coalition of four ethnically-based movements dominated by the party from Tigray. That administration ruled in an increasingly autocratic fashion until Abiy took power in 2018 following years of bloody anti-government street protests. 
The initial months after Abiy's appointment saw a rush of political and economic reforms, including the release of tens of thousands of political prisoners. 
Last year Abiy merged three of the old parties to form the Prosperity Party - only the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) refused to join. 
Voter registration will take place from March 1 to 30, the election board said.
'POLITICAL CATASTROPHES'
Abiy's peace deal with Ethiopia's arch-enemy Eritrea helped earn him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. But loosening the government's iron grip was also followed by outbreaks of violence as regional powerbrokers jostled for resources and power.
On Thursday, Abiy said he was sending forces to the western Benishangul-Gumuz region, which borders Sudan, the day after unidentified attackers torched homes and killed more than 100 people in a village there. 
There is also a long-running insurgency in Oromiya region, Ethiopia's most populous region. 
The Oromo Liberation Front, an opposition party from the Oromiya region which was once declared a terrorist movement before it was unbanned by Abiy, said on Dec. 12 that the government was using the prospect of an election to divert attention away from the myriad security problems.
""Even though the ruling party wants to conceal the existing problems and divert attention towards the national election, it is obvious that the country has descended into complex security crises and political catastrophes,"" it said
""We recommend that repairing the fractured administrative regions and restoring peace and security must be undertaken before the election takes place.""
Many Oromo politicians are in jail, such as Jawar Mohammed, a prominent media mogul and member of the Oromo Federalist Congress party. 
He and other party leaders were in September charged with terrorism offences following the killing of the popular Oromo musician Haacaaluu Hundeessaa. The death of Haacaaluu sparked protests that killed at least 178 people in Oromiya and the capital. 
Ethiopia's parliamentary vote was postponed from August this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The two countries have had a bitter falling out in recent years, despite strong commercial ties, expelling ambassadors in 2018. Ankara has repeatedly condemned Israel's occupation in the West Bank and its treatment of Palestinians.
Speaking to reporters after Friday prayers in Istanbul, Erdogan said Turkey had issues with ""people at the top level"" in Israel and that ties could have been ""very different"" if it were not for those issues.
""The Palestine policy is our red line. It is impossible for us to accept Israel's Palestine policies. Their merciless acts there are unacceptable,"" Erdogan said.
""If there were no issues at the top level, our ties could have been very different,"" he added. ""We would like to bring our ties to a better point.""
Turkey and Israel, former allies, expelled each other's top diplomats in 2018 over clashes when dozens of Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces on the Gaza border. Ankara and Tel Aviv continue to trade with one another.
In August, Israel accused Turkey of giving passports to a dozen Hamas members in Istanbul, describing the move as ""a very unfriendly step"" which his government would raise with Turkish officials.
Hamas seized Gaza from forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007, and the group has fought three wars with Israel since then. Turkey says Hamas is a legitimate political movement that was elected democratically.
Israel, which has formalised ties with four Muslim countries this year, said on Wednesday it was working towards normalising ties with a fifth Muslim nation, possibly in Asia. Tunisia said on Tuesday it did not intend to normalise ties.
Ankara has slammed the U.S.-brokered rapprochements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, with Erdogan previously threatening to suspend diplomatic ties with the UAE and withdraw its envoy. It also slammed Bahrain's decision to formalise ties as a blow to efforts to defend the Palestinian cause.
Palestinians have censured the U.S.-brokered deals, seeing a betrayal of a long-standing demand that Israel first meet their statehood demand. Egypt and Israel established full relations in 1979 and Jordan in 1994.

Israel will hold a snap election in March after parliament failed on Tuesday to meet a deadline to pass a budget.

The health ministry, Department of Home Affairs and South African police Local did not respond immediately to Reuters' requests on Friday for confirmation of fatalities that local media outlets attributed to exhaustion and ill health owing to a lack of facilities while waiting to cross the border, sometimes for days.
Images and videos on local news channels and circulated on social media showed lines of stationary cars, mainly trucks, stretching for kilometres on the narrow road leading to the inland Beitbridge port that serves as the main crossing point between the countries, and is more busy than usual at this time of year because of a seasonal return of migrants to Zimbabwe.
South Africa, which the United Nations says is host to an estimated 1.5 million Zimbabwean migrants, is suffering a second wave of COVID-19 infections.
Authorities suspect the surge in cases has been triggered by a genetic mutation of the disease. Total positive cases are now near the 1 million mark, by far the most on the continent.
Asked about the border delays in an interview on news channel eNCA, the director-general of South Africa's Health Department, Sandile Buthelezi, said that coronavirus screening for outgoing traffic had now been suspended but proof of a negative COVID-19 test performed within 30 days would be required upon re-entry.

Cisse, a former finance minister who finished runner-up in the 2013 and 2018 presidential elections to Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, was considered among the favourites in a vote expected in early 2022 after Keita's overthrow in an August military coup.

Cisse was kidnapped in March by gunmen while campaigning for legislative elections in the northern region of Timbuktu. He was released in October alongside French aid worker Sophie Petronin and two Italian hostages.
While he was being held, a military junta overthrew Keita, blaming him for persistent insecurity caused by jihadists linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State as well as high-level corruption. 
Under pressure from regional states, the junta officially ceded power in September to a transitional government that will govern for 18 months. However, military officers retain sweeping influence across the government.

Fractious politicians have been unable to agree on a new administration since the last one quit in the aftermath of the Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion, leaving Lebanon rudderless as it sinks deeper into economic crisis.
Veteran Sunni politician Saad al-Hariri was named premier for a fourth time in October promising to form a cabinet of specialists to enact reforms necessary to unlock foreign aid, but political wrangling has delayed the process.
If the reasons for not forming government are internal than ""the problem is great"" because it shows lack of responsibility, but if they are external ""it is greater"" because it exposes loyalties beyond Lebanon, Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai said at Christmas Mass.
His repeated calls for the nation to be free from regional influences are widely understood as references to Lebanon’s Shi’ite Hezbollah movement that is backed by Iran.
""What conscience allows for Lebanon to be tied to struggles it has no relation to?"" he added. 
Prime Minister-designate Hariri and President Michel Aoun aired their differences over the government in statements on Dec. 14.
Under a sectarian power-sharing system, Lebanon’s president must be a Maronite Christian and the prime minister a Sunni Muslim. Aoun is an ally of Hezbollah, listed as a terrorist group by the United States.

The financial crisis came to a head last year after decades of corruption and bad governance, sinking the currency by some 80%, freezing savers out of their deposits and causing poverty to soar.

Thousands of farmers from several Indian states have been camped on the outskirts of New Delhi for over a month, blocking highways to demand that Modi's government repeal the farm laws passed in September that they say threaten their livelihoods.
But Modi's virtual public address on Friday was not focused on the laws under contention.
Instead, he spoke via video conferencing to seven farmers from different states, asking them how they had benefited from 'PM Kisan' - a cash transfer scheme his government launched in February, 2019, under which farmers get minimum income support.
The farmers Modi spoke with on Friday praised his scheme - but none were among the thousands who have been protesting.
Modi repeatedly said ""some people"" were spreading lies and rumours about farmers' troubles, and dismissed the protests as motivated by political opponents. 
""All these people who are protesting in support of farmers, what did they do when they were in power?"" he said, referring to opposition politicians. ""Those with political motives...are firing the gun from the farmers' shoulders.""
Modi also said he was open to discussions with farmers. ""I ask even those opposing me today, that my government is ready to talk to them on farmer issues...I urge our farmers to not be misled by anyone.""
At least six rounds of talks between Modi's government and farmer leaders on the new laws have failed.
Modi used his address to also to take a dig at his political rivals, chiefly the fiery leader of the eastern state of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, ahead of legislative assembly elections in the state in 2021. Modi alleged that Banerjee's government was not allowing the farmers in its state to benefit from Modi's federal scheme.

The chapel, whose towering dome is modelled after St Peter's basilica in the Vatican, sits on the edge of Ivory Coast's administrative capital, surrounded by flat savannah. 
After nightfall on Thursday, worshippers descended on the church, observing anti-virus measures, including social distancing and hand washing before attending midnight mass. 
""My message during these Christmas festivities is to remind our dear compatriots once again that we have one religion, one ethnicity, which is peace, which is a platform for the progress of this nation,"" said Franck Allatin, rector of the Basilica.
The economy of Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer, has been hit hard by the coronavirus as world demand for chocolate falls and trade slows. 
President Alassane Ouattara's decision to run for a third term in an October election sparked deadly violence along ethnic lines that brought back memories of a 2010-11 civil war in which 3,000 people died.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday corrected statements he had made in parliament, apologising for what he said were mistakes regarding a political funding scandal that has also cast a pall over the current premier.
Abe said he felt deeply responsible for making repeated false denials that his political funding group had subsidised cherry blossom viewing parties for his supporters, in possible violation of the country's strict political funding laws.
Japan's longest-serving leader said he had known nothing about the payments and pledged to work to regain public trust. The apology came after his secretary was on Thursday summarily indicted over the issue and fined 1 million yen ($9,650).
""Even though the accounting procedures happened without my knowledge, I feel morally responsible for what happened,"" Abe told a parliamentary committee. ""I reflect on this deeply and apologise from my heart to the citizens and to all lawmakers.""
Abe also filed corrected political funding reports for the last three years.
The public apology marks a sharp reversal of fortune for Abe, a political blue-bloods whose grandfather and great-uncle also served as premiers. He quit as prime minister on health grounds in September after serving nearly eight years as prime minister.
The scandal threatens to damage his successor, Yoshihide Suga, who was Abe's right-hand man throughout his term and has defended his former boss in parliament. 
Suga, who has been beset by other controversies and seen his support ratings slide less than a year before the next lower house election must be called, has apologised for making inaccurate statements.
Abe did not respond to questions from opposition MPs about whether he would take political responsibility for the scandal by resigning as an MP. He struggled to explain why he was able to file detailed updated funding reports even though he says his office does not have the underlying receipts for the parties.
Abe's statements to parliament from the end of 2019 contradicted the findings of the prosecutors at least 118 times, several domestic media reported, citing a parliamentary research bureau.

The case has attracted great interest in Hong Kong and abroad as a rare instance of the Beijing authorities arresting people trying to leave the financial hub at a time of growing concern about the prospects for the city’s high degree of autonomy.
The families had asked this week for 20 days' notice to allow them to attend the trial, given a 14-day COVID-19 quarantine upon entering mainland China.
Instead, the families of seven detainees were notified of the trial date by government-appointed lawyers, a support group said.
""Obviously (the Chinese authorities) are rushing during the Christmas period so as to minimise international backlash,"" said Beatrice Li, sister of detainee Andy Li. 
Beijing's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Twelve Hong Kongers were intercepted by the Chinese coastguard on Aug. 23 on a boat believed to be bound for Taiwan. Two underage suspects will undergo private hearings on a separate date, Chinese authorities said earlier this month.
All were facing charges in Hong Kong linked to anti-government protests in the former British colony, including rioting and violation of a national security law Beijing imposed on the city in June.
In their mainland trial, they face charges of illegally crossing the border and organising an illegal crossing, which could carry sentences of up to seven years.

The Hong Kong government has said the defendants must face justice on the mainland before returning to Hong Kong, where they are expected to be further investigated for the suspected protest-related crimes.

Authorities also banned all people who have stayed in South Africa in the past 21 days from boarding for Hong Kong. 
Hong Kong has already banned all flights arriving from the United Kingdom from Monday and the city said on Wednesday two students who returned from the UK were likely to be infected with the new super-virulent strain of COVID-19.

In a concession to the fact that the Gothic cathedral is still being rebuilt, the choristers wore construction hard hats and boiler suits, and there was no audience.
The concert was recorded at the cathedral earlier this month, and was broadcast on French television just before midnight on Thursday.
The choristers performed classical pieces by composers Mozart and Schubert, but also a more light-hearted repertoire, including ""Jingle Bells.""
""It was very moving,"" said cellist Gautier Capucon, describing the experience of recording the concert. Along with an organist, he provided the musical accompaniment for the choir. 
""It was the first time we had all been back at Notre-Dame cathedral since the fire, so it was a moment full of emotion,"" he said in an interview with television station franceinfo. 
The cathedral, a landmark of Gothic architecture dating to the 13th century and a major tourist attraction, caught fire on April 15, 2019. The blaze destroyed the spire and roof.
French President Emmanuel Macron undertook to restore the cathedral within five years. 
But to date, most work on the site has focused on making the building safe, including clearing up toxic lead from the roof and spire that melted in the fire.
In the meantime, Notre-Dame is closed to the public and masses are cancelled.

In April this year, seven people were allowed to attend a religious ceremony in the cathedral to mark Good Friday, when Christians commemorate the death of Jesus Christ.

Central Bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said an Iranian bank had received backing from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control to transfer the money to a Swiss bank to pay for the vaccines.
""They (Americans) have put sanctions on all our banks. They accepted this one case under the pressure of world public opinion,"" Hemmati told state TV.
There was no immediate U.S. reaction to Hemmati's remarks.
Hemmati said Iran would pay around $244 million for initial imports of 16.8 million doses of vaccines from COVAX, a multi-agency group dedicated to assuring fair access to vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. 
Iranian officials have said repeatedly that U.S. sanctions are preventing them from making payments to COVAX, to which some 190 economies have signed up.
Iran's Shifa Pharmed began registering volunteers this week for human trials of the country's first domestic COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Iranian media reported, as a factional dispute appeared to be brewing over the use of imports.
""We do not recommend injecting foreign coronavirus vaccines to the personnel of the Revolutionary Guards and the basij (voluntary militia),"" Iranian news outlets quoted Mohammed Reza Naqdi, a deputy head of the hardline Guards, as saying.
Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari told state TV earlier that 152 people had died of COVID-19 in Iran in the past 24 hours, the lowest number since Sept. 18, taking total deaths to 54,308 in the worst-affected country in the Middle East.
The fall in deaths comes after more than a month of night traffic curfews and other restrictions in major cities. Police said 96,000 fines were issued nationwide on Wednesday for drivers breaking the curfew. 
Officials have cautioned that the danger of a resurgence in infections looms large.
U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers in 2018 and imposed new sanctions on the country.

President-elect Joe Biden's coming to power has raised the possibility that Washington could rejoin the agreement.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis celebrated a low-key Christmas Eve Mass made sombre by the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday and said people should feel obliged to help the needy because Jesus himself was born a poor outcast.
The Mass was held in a rear section of St. Peter's Basilica with fewer than 100 participants and only small number of cardinals and bishops. It is usually held in the main section of the basilica and attended by up to 10,000 people, including the diplomatic corps representing nearly 200 countries.
Everyone except the pope and the small choir wore a mask during the Mass, which began two hours earlier than usual so that even the limited number of people who attended could return home by a 10 p.m. curfew.
""The Son of God was born an outcast, in order to tell us that every outcast is a child of God,"" Francis said in his homily.
Francis said Christmas should make everyone reflect on ""our injustice towards so many of our brothers and sisters"" instead of pursuing ""our endless desire for possessions"" and ephemeral pleasures.
""God came among us in poverty and need, to tell us that in serving the poor, we will show our love for him,"" said the 84-year-old pope, celebrating the eighth Christmas of his pontificate.
On Friday, the pope will read his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message from a hall inside the Vatican instead of from the central balcony of St. Peter's Square, an event that usually attracts tens of thousands of people.
Italians are under a nationwide lockdown for much of the Christmas and New Year holidays. Non-essential shops will be shut between Dec. 24-27, Dec. 31-Jan. 3 and Jan. 5-6. On these days, people are allowed to travel only for work, health or emergency reasons.

The restrictions mean people will not be able to go to St. Peter's Square or the basilica. All papal events between Dec. 24 and Jan. 6 are taking place indoors with little or no public participation and being live streamed on the internet and broadcast on television.

In a departure from longstanding U.S. policy, Washington agreed to recognize Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara, a desert region where a decades-old territorial dispute has pitted Morocco against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, a breakaway movement that seeks to establish an independent state.
The recognition was part of a U.S.-brokered deal in which Morocco became the fourth Arab country after the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan to normalize ties with Israel in the past four months.
""Effective immediately, we are inaugurating a virtual presence post for Western Sahara, with a focus on promoting economic and social development, to be followed soon by a fully functioning consulate,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
""This virtual presence post will be managed by the U.S. Embassy in Rabat,"" Pompeo said, adding that Washington would be continuing to support  political negotiations  to  resolve  the issues between Morocco and the Polisario within the framework of Morocco's autonomy plan. 
Washington's support for Moroccan sovereignty over the desert territory represents the biggest policy concession the United States has made so far in its quest to win Arab recognition of Israel.
The series of normalization deals have been driven in part by U.S.-led efforts to present a united front against Iran and roll back Tehran's regional influence. 
President-elect Joe Biden, due to succeed Trump on Jan. 20, will face a decision whether to accept the U.S. deal on the Western Sahara, which no other Western nation has done. Western nations and the U.N. have long called for a referendum to resolve the dispute.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's indigenous communities have been prioritized for the COVID-19 vaccine but distributing it across difficult and remote terrain will be a challenge, as authorities deploy small planes and boats to ship the drug.
Canada approved drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s vaccine on Wednesday, which most indigenous communities are expected to use because it remains stable at 2-8 Celsius (36-46 Farenheit) for 30 days, unlike  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s, which needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius and is only stable for a few days after thawing. 
Even with more transportable vaccines, getting the doses and medical staff to the country's indigenous communities living far from major cities will be a challenge, Shannon McDonald, acting chief medical officer for British Columbia's First Nations Health Authority, said.
While many communities are accessible by logging roads or plane, some are reachable only by boat. Some airports are so remote that dog sleds and snowmobiles must transport deliveries to local hospitals.
""This is winter storm season, and some of those communities are difficult to access,"" McDonald said. ""We've had conversations with transportation providers who are willing to fly into communities, helicopter into communities.""
This will be complicated by the fact that both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines need two doses to be fully effective.
""It's really going to be a matter of figuring out how to zoom across a complex geography in a limited amount of time but also complicated by the fact that you have to do it twice,"" said Tobey Meyer, a senior policy analyst with the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, which represents 49 indigenous nations in northern Ontario. ""How the heck are we going to do that?""
Each community currently has varying abilities to host vaccination clinics - some have robust health centres with the storage infrastructure needed while others do not, Meyer said.
Authorities are looking at using the Red Cross, military and ""non-traditional immunizers"" like dentists and physical therapists to help dispense the vaccine, Dany Fortin, the retired Canadian general in charge of Canada's vaccine rollout, said on Wednesday.
Ottawa has said that the indigenous population should be a top priority, due to limited medical care available in remote communities, higher rates of preexisting conditions, and poor access to the clean drinking water or safe housing that make regular hand washing and social distancing effective.
Ontario has added an indigenous sub-committee to its vaccine deployment task force. Manitoba, which bought 20 portable ultra-cold freezers for use in a small number of ""super sites"", said it has secured an additional 9,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine due to the high number of indigenous people in the province.
With strict travel restrictions in place, Canada’s indigenous people – who make up about 5% of the population – had initially avoided the worst impacts of the pandemic. But cases in their communities began trending upwards in late September, according to government data.

That indigenous people are at the top of the vaccination list at all is a mark of how much progress Canada has made towards reconciliation, said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has vowed to fix Canada's relationship with indigenous communities since coming to power, with mixed results.
""Twenty years ago, governments would not have prioritized indigenous people. As usual we would have been last on the list,"" Phillip said. ""I'm happy to say I'm encouraged that reconciliation - which we know is not a destination, it's a journey - is beginning to show results.""

The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled on Tuesday that Selahattin Demirtas, former leader of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), must be freed immediately.
The court said Turkey's justification for his detention longer than four years on terrorism-related offences was a pretext for limiting political debate - a ruling dismissed by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
""The issue is not only about Selahattin. The whole judicial system needs to be fixed,"" Basak Demirtas told Reuters. 
""I expect Selahattin to be released of course because Turkey is one of the signatory countries to the European Convention on Human Rights. Furthermore, it is one of the founding members of the ECHR,"" she said.
Turkey's constitution now required it to abide by the court ruling, but more needed to be done, she added. 
""We knew both Selahattin and his friends have been kept in jail unlawfully, unjustly. It made us happy that the ECHR made this official.""
Opposition members and rights groups have accused the government of pressing the judiciary to silence Erdogan's opponents, particularly since an attempted coup in July 2016. 
Erdogan and his ruling AK party have regularly denied such charges and said courts make independent decisions.
Demirtas faces a sentence of up to 142 years in prison if convicted of being the leader of a terrorist organisation over his speeches during protests in 2014 that turned violent and led to 37 deaths. He denies any wrongdoing.
Ankara accuses the HDP of links to the Kurdistan Workers Party, which has waged an insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast since 1984 and is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and the United States.
The HDP, the third-largest in Turkey's parliament, denies links to terrorism, yet has seen thousands of its officials and members arrested in recent years, mainly on terrorism charges.
Basak Demirtas said she persevered despite difficult times during her husband's detention such as when he had heart problems, when she had an car accident on the way to see him and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

""People can stay strong as long as they fight for what they believe in,"" she said.

BIHAC, Bosnia (Reuters) - More than a thousand migrants from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa were left to sleep in the cold after their camp in northwestern Bosnia burned down amid a dispute among Bosnian politicians over where to house them.
On Wednesday, a fire destroyed the camp in Lipa housing about 1,200 people. Police and UN officials have said the blaze was probably started by migrants unhappy at the temporary closure of the camp, scheduled for the same day, and uncertainty about where they would be relocated in Bosnia. 
Dozens of men spent the night at a damaged metal container near the site of the fire, where only a ghostly steel construction remained. Smoke was still rising from some burned patches of ground on Thursday morning.
Other migrants tried to erect nylon tents and slept fully dressed on the frozen ground. Most of them walked through the woods towards the town of Bihac, near the Croatian border, avoiding areas marked with warnings about landmines remaining from the Bosnian war in the 1990s.
About 10,000 migrants from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa are stuck in Bosnia, hoping to reach wealthier countries in the European Union. 
""I couldn't sleep last night, I sat all night,"" said Bylal from Pakistan, adding that he would wait to see if the government would provide them with a new shelter.
The Lipa camp, which was opened last spring as a temporary shelter for the summer months 25 km away from Bihac, was set to be shut on Wednesday for winter refurbishing. But Bosnia's authorities failed to find alternative accommodation for residents. 
The central government wanted the migrants to temporarily return to the Bira camp in Bihac, which was shut down in October, but local authorities disagreed saying that other parts of Bosnia should also share the burden of the migrant crisis.
""Please open the Bira camp so everybody goes there, it's very good there,"" said Yasin, also from Pakistan. ""Here it's cold, we can't stay here, we don't have food, we are hungry.""
The European Union, which had supported Bosnia with 60 million euros to manage the migrant crisis and pledged 25 million euros more, has repeatedly asked the authorities to find an alternative to the unsuitable Lipa camp, warning of an unfolding humanitarian crisis. 

""We urge ... the authorities to rise above political considerations and temporarily reopen the centre Bira in Bihac,"" the EU said in a statement on Wednesday.

The poll, released by the Levada-Center, shows how hard it remains for Navalny to shape public opinion in Russia even as his case attracts wide media attention in the West and his own slickly-produced videos of what happened to him this summer rack up millions of views online. 
Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, was airlifted to Germany for medical treatment in August after collapsing on a plane in Russia. Germany has said he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him, an assertion many Western nations accept.
A joint media investigation last week named agents from Russia's FSB security service it said were behind the plot to kill him. Navalny on Monday released a recording of him speaking by phone to a man he described as a state security agent who told him, among other things, that the poison had been placed in his underpants. 
The FSB has called that recording a fake designed to discredit it, however, and has said that foreign intelligence services helped Navalny make it while the Kremlin has mocked Navalny and tried to call his sanity into question.
The poll by Levada, which is regarded as more independent than state counterparts, showed only 15% of Russians believed what happened to Navalny was an attempt by the authorities to rid themselves of a political opponent.
By contrast, 30% thought that the incident was stage-managed and that there was no poisoning, and 19% said they believed it was a provocation orchestrated by Western intelligence services. 
The same poll, which canvassed 1,617 Russians aged 18 or older, showed that 7% thought it was revenge by someone he had targeted in one of his anti-corruption investigations. 
Denis Volkov, Levada's deputy director, said the results showed a split in opinion between older and younger Russians, whom Navalny has targeted with high-profile online investigations and by speaking to them directly in live internet broadcasts. 
""Older generations receiving news on TV and trusting TV news, and supporters of the authorities mostly consider what happened as a stage-managed event and provocation of the West,"" Volkov wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""Young people, active internet users and critics of the authorities are much more likely to blame Russian authorities for the poisoning,"" he said.

Navalny is still convalescing in Germany, but has said he wants to return to Russia.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Thursday ordered the immediate release of four men accused of orchestrating the 2002 kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl, including the main suspect earlier sentenced to death for masterminding the killing.
In April the same court - the Sindh High Court - commuted the death sentence of the main suspect, British-born Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, and acquitted three others citing a lack of evidence against them.
Despite the decision, Pakistani authorities have kept the four in custody for the last eight months, citing reasons of law and order.
“All the petitioners ... shall be released from jail forthwith on the receipt of this order, unless they are wanted in any other custody case or any order against their release has been passed by the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan,” Thursday's court order read.
The April order has been challenged by the government at the Supreme Court, and Pearl's parents have also petitioned the country's highest judicial forum seeking the overturning of the decision to acquit the suspects.
The appeals are still being heard.
Pearl, 38, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was investigating Islamist militants in Karachi after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States when he was kidnapped. 
His case grabbed headlines globally, after a video of his beheading emerged weeks after he was abducted.

“It is a very disappointing judgment,” Salman Tablibuddin, Advocate General of Sindh province, told Reuters, adding that the provincial government has yet to decide if it wants to challenge the decision.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's main opposition party pressed the government on Thursday to call a special parliamentary session to withdraw new agricultural laws that farmers say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations.
Rahul Gandhi, a senior leader from the opposition Congress party, handed the president a copy of a petition that he said had attracted 20 million signatures online.
""The prime minister wants to help two, three business people"" by introducing the farm laws, said Gandhi, the great-grandson of India's founding prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
The government says the reforms passed in September are meant to overhaul antiquated procurement procedures and open up the market.
Tens of thousands of farmers have camped out on national highways for weeks demanding the government withdraw the laws that they fear will eventually dismantle regulated markets and stop the government buying wheat and rice at guaranteed prices. 
Six rounds of talks between government officials and farmer union leaders have failed to resolve the deadlock. Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week offered to ""very humbly"" hold further discussions.
On Thursday, the government again invited protesting farmers to further talks.
Farmers union leaders have accused the government of trying to weaken and discredit them by describing protesting farmers as ""anti-nationals"".
""You are dealing with protesting farmers in a manner as if they are not aggrieved citizens but political rivals,"" Samyukta Kisan Morcha, or United Farmers' Front, a coalition of farmers unions, said in a letter addressed to the farm ministry on Thursday.

""Farmers would be compelled to intensify their agitation further for their survival if the government continued to treat them in this manner,"" the letter said.

""I am deeply troubled to see the suffering and anguish that has sapped the native resilience and resourcefulness of the Land of the Cedars,"" Francis said, referring to Lebanon, which has been struggling with a deep economic crisis and the aftermath of the Beirut port explosion on Aug. 4 that killed about 200 people.

The message was addressed to South Sudan's leaders, former rivals who formed a national unity government in February after years of civil war ravaged the oil-producing yet poor nation.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - From doctors weary of seeing patients die to relatives who lost their loved ones, thousands of Brazilians have volunteered for COVID vaccine trials in one of the world's worst-affected countries in the hope their quiet heroism will save lives.
Latin America's largest country has become a major testing ground for vaccines because of the scale of its outbreak, which has seen more than 7.3 million people infected and over 180,000 killed by the coronavirus. 
Denise Abranches, 47, coordinator of dentistry at a Sao Paulo hospital, was the first volunteer outside Britain to receive the trial vaccine from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc.
""I witnessed many lonely deaths here: patients who could not say goodbye to their relatives; relatives who could not say goodbye to their loved ones. When the vaccine trial came, I joined immediately,"" she told Reuters.
""This global effort of volunteers in search of a vaccine will be remembered and will go down in history,"" she said. ""The gesture of love from volunteers. That's how I'd like to be remembered.""
In addition to the AstraZeneca vaccine, Brazil has also hosted trials for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ),  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and partner BioNTech, and China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd.
While President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been widely condemned for his handling of the pandemic, has pledged not to take any coronavirus vaccine even if its approved by Brazil's health authorities, many volunteers are convinced inoculations are the only way to end the crisis.
Some, such as Monica Aparecida Calazans, a Brazilian nurse who participated in the Sinovac trial, felt a personal obligation to contribute. 
""My brother, who is 47 years old had COVID-19,"" she told Reuters. ""If I don't take the vaccine, we will never know if it works or not. For him, but for everyone else too, I had the drive to take part in the trial."" 
The biomedical center running Sinovac's late-stage trials in Brazil, the Butantan Institute, said on Wednesday the vaccine met the 50% threshold for efficacy set by Brazilian health regulator Anvisa. It pledged to would release more detailed information within two weeks as part of global trials. 
Bolsonaro, a right-wing nationalist who is an outspoken critic of China's influence in Brazil, has opposed Sinovac's vaccine for political reasons. 
More broadly, he has sought to curtail lockdown measures and minimized the severity of the virus, actions that critics say have increased its spread and the death toll among Brazil's 210 million people. 
Amid the severe economic impact and a faltering political response, some volunteers said the opportunity to participate in the trials gave them a sense of regaining control of their own destiny.
""The hardest thing in the pandemic has been ... the sense of powerlessness that you can’t resolve the situation,"" said Ana Hial, a doctor who is also part of the AstraZeneca trial. ""This global push to resolve the situation is a very special moment."" 
Trial volunteers do not usually know if they are receiving the actual vaccine or a placebo, meaning that even if the vaccines are ultimately successful, they may not have been protected from the disease all this time. 
Some shrugged off what they said were mild side effects from the inoculation.

""The first days after I took (the vaccine), I had a few symptoms – shivers and pain in my body,"" said Antonia Santos, a nurse who participated in the AstraZeneca trial. ""My daughter was desperate. She said 'Mom, you are crazy.' I said, 'No, crazy would be not to take it.'""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday apologized for denying allegations that his office may have possibly violated Japan's strict political funding laws and admitted he was unaware what his office had done.
Abe said he will correct his false statements in parliament on Friday, marking a stunning reversal of fortunes for Japan's longest-serving premier and one of its political bluebloods, whose grandfather and great-uncle also held the post.
Abe repeatedly denied the allegations that his office helped cover the costs of dinner parties for supporters under questioning by opposition lawmakers last year. 
During the news conference on Thursday, he said he was unaware of how his office handled the funds, but felt ""heavy responsibility"" for the situation.
""I can't help but explain the facts and correct my statements to the parliament,"" he said. ""I am taking seriously my political responsibility for causing this situation,"" he told reporters. 
""Although accounting was handled without my knowledge, I feel moral responsibility. I am deeply reflecting on myself, and I apologize to the people,"" said Abe.
Japan has strict political funding laws that prevent politicians from giving money or gifts to supporters.
Tokyo prosecutors on Thursday handed a summary indictment against Abe's secretary, Hiroyuki Haikawa, but had decided not to press charges against Abe, domestic media reported.
Prosecutors had been building a case against the 61-year-old over unreported funds involving as much as 40 million yen ($386,210).
Haikawa was not immediately available for comment.
Abe had appeared for voluntary questioning by the prosecution on Monday about the issue and again denied his involvement, media said.
The scandal risks hurting current Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who was Abe's right-hand man during his 2012-2020 tenure and defended him in parliament.
Suga, who has been best by other controversies and whose support ratings have fallen in recent weeks, is slated to hold a news conference on Friday at 6 p.m. Japan time (0900 GMT).

The coastguard rescued five people and was searching for about 20 others who were still unaccounted for, the official told Reuters.
The coastline near the Tunisian port city of Sfax has become a major departure point for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa and the Middle East and searching for a better life in Europe.
""The boat sank about six miles from the coast of Sfax. Twenty bodies were recovered, five others were rescued, and all are from sub-Saharan Africa,"" the security official, Ali Ayari, said. 
Around 45 people were on the boat when it sank, he added.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he was sending more soldiers to secure the region bordering Sudan, the day after unidentified gunmen killed more than 100 people in a village there.
Ethiopia has been grappling with outbreaks of violence since Abiy was appointed in 2018 and accelerated democratic reforms that loosened the state's iron grip on regional rivalries. 
""The massacre of civilians in Benishangul-Gumuz region is very tragic,"" Abiy said on Twitter. ""The government, to solve the root causes of the problem, has deployed a necessary force.""
Fana TV reported the military had killed ""42 anti-peace elements"", without saying when the clash took place or identifying the armed men. It said the armed group had taken part in Wednesday's attack in Bulen county, citing regional officials. 
The dawn raid on the village of Bekoji killed more than 100 people, the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said. Residents told Reuters they had seen dozens of dead bodies. Medics said they treated people with gunshot and knife wounds. 
State-run Ethiopian News Agency reported that five senior officials, including a state minister of the federal government, have been arrested in connection with security issues in Benishangul-Gumuz.

Ethiopia's military has been fighting rebels in the separate northern Tigray region for more than six weeks in a conflict that has displaced more than 950,000 people. The deployment of federal troops there has led to fears of a security vacuum in other restive regions.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",'Like water eroding rocks': Thai protesters prepare for long fight,"By Patpicha Tanakasempipat, Chayut Setboonsarng and Matthew Tostevin
BANGKOK (Reuters) - As they paraded through a Bangkok shopping mall in crop tops to mock Thailand's king, protesters made an incongruous sight among the festive decorations.
They brought stares, smiles and some muted cheers, but the few dozen activists were far short of the tens of thousands who joined earlier anti-government protests that broke the taboo on criticising King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
After months of street demonstrations that have shaken Thailand's establishment, the best-known figures of a movement that drew tactics and inspiration from protests in Hong Kong told Reuters they are at a critical juncture.
There are disagreements over strategy, fatigue, scores of charges brought in a royalist backlash and now a coronavirus outbreak that could make mass gatherings hard. 
""I think most people are exhausted,"" said Parit 'Penguin' Chiwarak, 22, who helped lead the crop top protest, noting that exams at the end of the university term made it hard for students to join. 
""We'll try again next year,"" he told Reuters. ""We won't stop no matter what.""
Government spokeswoman Rachada Dhnadirek said authorities were not against protesters expressing their views, but a rise in coronavirus cases meant there should be no large gatherings for any reason at the moment.
The crop top protest, however, showed just how far discussion has shifted in Thailand, with its defiance of the royal insult law by openly lampooning a king who has been pictured wearing a crop top in European tabloids.
But divisions between protesters have become more evident as they discuss how best to maintain their push next year to unseat former junta leader and Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, to rewrite the constitution and to curb the king's powers.
The main factions are student protesters linked to the Thammasat University, including Parit and Panusaya 'Rung' Sithijirawattanakul, and the Free Youth group, which kick-started the protests in July. Both have been allied, calling themselves the ""People"" movement.
But Parit and Panusaya, 22, have distanced themselves from the launch of Free Youth's Restart Thailand movement, with a logo whose RT letters resemble a hammer and sickle.
Critics of Restart Thailand say it risks putting some people off with apparent communist symbolism in a Southeast Asian country where a two-decade long communist insurgency ended in the 1980s.
""A lot of people are confused,"" said protester Kent Ruqsapram, who brought a sign to one event that said ""We fight for democracy, not communism"" to make his point. 
DIFFERENT MEANS
Meanwhile, Free Youth's Jutatip Sirikhan, 22, said the group will focus on its own campaign next year despite the earlier alliance with the student leaders.
""We want to create more participation from all groups, whether labourers, farmers or those without access to social welfare,"" she told Reuters.
It is not the first time that divisions have surfaced and both groups say they have the same goals of breaking the decades-old hold on power of the army and palace.
""Both still go in the same direction, just use different means,"" said Arnon Nampa, 36, a rights lawyer who said he aimed to step up the push for reforms to the monarchy next year as the campaign for change continues.
""The longer this goes on, the more people will understand the problems and side with us - like water eroding rocks,"" he told Reuters.
There is little to show yet on the core demands.
Prayuth has dismissed calls to stand down, discussion on the constitution will only proceed on the government's terms and the Royal Palace is ramping up a PR campaign rather than entertaining any possibility of change.
""The protests are weakening,"" Warong Dechgitvigrom, 59, of royalist group Thai Pakdee told Reuters. ""The government can just let the movement die on its own.""
The royalists are behind a surge of lese majeste charges against protest leaders - with a coordinated effort described by Warong to bring complaints to police on charges that can lead to up to 15 years in prison.
Anyone can bring such a royal insult complaint. Grounds have included everything from using the king's own words disrespectfully to dressing in clothes that parody the royals.
At least 35 activists now face lese majeste charges - many of them multiple charges, according to data from Thai Lawyers for Human Rights: Parit alone faces eight. Total charges against all activists now number in the hundreds including those for sedition, computer crimes, illegal assembly and flouting coronavirus restrictions.
""It can drain a lot of time, resources, and energy,"" said Free Youth's Tattep 'Ford' Ruangprapaikitseree, 23, who faces six charges, including lese majeste and sedition. ""It would be a lie if I said I didn't lose heart sometimes.""
Like other prominent protesters, he is not currently detained, but is under police investigation to see if there is enough evidence for trial.
PROTESTS IN PANDEMIC
Thailand currently faces a new outbreak of coronavirus, with hundreds of cases reported among migrant seafood workers - a discouragement to mass gatherings if not the full lockdown the country went through early in 2020.
""We fought during the pandemic and did it without spreading the virus,"" said Parit. ""We can do more online.""
As in Hong Kong, online mobilisation has been a hallmark of Thailand's youth-driven demonstrations.
Demonstrating enough support to force change in the real world, however, is a bigger challenge. Provincial elections on Dec. 20 largely returned establishment politicians despite being contested for the first time by a movement with youth support.
And the Royal Palace's fightback is growing.
King Vajiralongkorn, 68, has begun an intensive public relations counter-offensive with Queen Suthida, 42, as a driving force in the campaign at visits around Thailand.
Also joining lavish public events have been the king's daughters and his 35-year-old royal consort, Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi.
Sometimes spoken to the crowds, sometimes signed on royal pictures, the mantra is one of national unity under the monarchy - whose power and prestige were strengthened during the seven-decade reign of the monarch's late father King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
""The monarchy and the people are inseparable,"" the king told crowds at one recent stop.
And while the numbers have rarely been as big as the tens of thousands who have joined the protests, the appearances play every night on the royal television news that remains popular with older Thais.
""This has won them many hearts and minds,"" said Termsak Chalermpalanupap, a visiting fellow with Singapore's ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute.
Having been absent in Europe for most of 2020, the king's return to Thailand in October marked the start of an intense round of appearances. A Reuters tally showed over 40 events, including more than a dozen at which the king spoke individually to members of the public - previously unheard of.
For protesters that is also a sign that they are having an impact and need to keep going even if it takes years.
""You think the government hasn't responded, but it has,"" said Arnon, the rights lawyer. ""The king making unusual trips is a response. The government using the law to suppress or silence expressions is a response.""

""Fire has caught. It will keep burning,"" he said.

807,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 05:01AM ET</span>","Nigeria school abductions sparked by cattle feuds, not extremism, officials say","By Alexis Akwagyiram
LAGOS (Reuters) - The kidnap of 344 schoolboys in northwest Nigeria had the appearance of an Islamist militant attack. There was even a video purporting to show some of the boys with members of Boko Haram, the extremists behind the 2014 kidnapping of more than 270 schoolgirls in the northeast.
But four government and security officials familiar with negotiations that secured the boys’ release told Reuters the attack was a result of inter-communal feuding over cattle theft, grazing rights and water access – not spreading extremism.
The mass abduction of children in Katsina state would mark a dramatic turn in clashes between farmers and herders that have killed thousands of people across Africa's most populous nation in recent years, posing a challenge to authorities also battling a decade-long Islamist insurgency in the northeast.
Officials in Katsina and neighbouring Zamfara, where the boys were released after six days, said the attack was carried out by a gang of mostly semi-nomadic ethnic Fulanis, including former herders who turned to crime after losing their cows to cattle rustlers. 
""They have local conflicts that they want to be settled, and they decided to use this (kidnapping) as a bargaining tool,"" said Ibrahim Ahmad, a security adviser to the Katsina state government who took part in the negotiations through intermediaries.
Such groups are known more for armed robberies and small-scale kidnappings for ransom. 
Cattle herders in the northwest are mainly Fulani, whereas farmers are mostly Hausa. For years, farmers have complained of herders letting their cows stray on to their land to graze, while herdsmen have complained their cows are being stolen. 
NEGOTIATIONS
Dozens of gunmen arrived on motorcycles at the Government Science Secondary School on Dec. 11 in the town of Kankara in Katsina. They marched the boys into a vast forest that extends from Katsina into Zamfara.
Officials in both states told Reuters they established contact with the kidnappers through their clan, a cattle breeders' association and former gang members who participated in a Zamfara amnesty programme. 
The intermediaries met the kidnappers in Ruga forest on several occasions before they agreed to release the boys, according to Zamfara Governor Bello Matawalle and security sources including Ahmad. 
The gang accused vigilante groups, set up to defend farming communities against banditry, of killing Fulani herders and stealing their cows, Matawalle and Ahmad said. They also made similar accusations against members of a Katsina state committee set up to investigate cattle theft, Ahmad added.
He said he was not aware of any such incidents, but said a police investigation had been launched. No ransom was paid for the boys' release, according to officials in both states.
Reuters could not reach the gang for comment. A spokesman for the herders’ association, the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders' Association of Nigeria, declined to discuss the negotiations. 
BOKO HARAM? 
Gangs such as these have carried out attacks across the northwest, making it hard for locals to farm, travel or tap rich mineral deposits in some states. They were responsible for more than 1,100 deaths in the first half of 2020 alone, according to rights group Amnesty International.
Boko Haram, based in the northeast, has sought to forge alliances with some of them and released videos this year claiming to have received pledges of allegiance, said Jacob Zenn, a Nigeria expert at the U.S.-based Jamestown Foundation think tank. 
A man identifying himself as Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau claimed responsibility for the schoolboys' kidnappings in an unverified audio recording. Soon after, the video started circulating on social media.
However, one boy who spoke in the video later told Nigeria’s Arise television that he did not believe the kidnappers when they told him to say he was being held by Boko Haram.
""Sincerely speaking, they are not Boko Haram... They are just small and tiny, tiny boys with big guns,” said the boy, who did not give his name. 
Nigerian Information Minister Lai Mohammed also dismissed Boko Haram's claim at a Dec. 18 news conference, saying: ""They just want to claim that they are still a potent force. 
""The boys were abducted by bandits, not Boko Haram,"" Mohammed said.
Independent security experts said the kidnappers appeared to have drawn inspiration from the militants and may have received advice, but most were sceptical of any direct involvement. 
Cheta Nwanze, lead partner at Lagos-based risk consultancy firm SBM Intelligence, said direct Boko Haram involvement was unlikely because of the ""logistics of getting to an area that is unfamiliar"" to them.
""It’s beyond their current capabilities,"" he said. ""The northwest is an ungoverned area controlled by other groups.""
SECOND KIDNAP
Tension between farming and herding communities has been growing in the northwest, where population growth and climate change have increased competition for resources, analysts said. 
The day after the boys were returned to their families in Kankara and other towns, another gang briefly abducted some 80 students who were returning from a trip organised by an Islamic school.
The kidnappers released the children after a gunfight with police and a local vigilante group, state police said.
""All the bandits were Fulanis and are over 100 in number,"" Abdullahi Sada, who led the vigilantes, told Reuters. 
He said some of his men were armed with bows and arrows while others had guns made by local blacksmiths. 
He denied any knowledge of attacks by vigilantes against Fulani herders, saying: ""I have no idea of any such thing happening in my area."" 
Nastura Ashir Shariff, who chairs the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), an influential civil society group, blamed a scarcity of police for such clashes, saying communities were taking law enforcement into their own hands. 
Whoever was responsible for the Kankara kidnappings, Ummi Usman, whose 14-year-old son Mujtaba was among those captured, said she was not sure whether to send him back to school.
""He is still in extreme fear whenever he remembers what they went through at the hands of their abductors,"" she said. ""Some of them were threatening the students that they will be back.""

808,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","Taiwan fines EVA Air $35,000 after pilot blamed for COVID infection","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Transport Ministry on Thursday fined EVA Airways Corp T$1 million ($35,000) after the government blamed one of its pilots for a rare locally transmitted case of COVID-19 because he failed to follow disease prevention rules.
Taiwan had until this week not reported domestic transmission since April 12, thanks to early and effective moves to stop the virus, including mass mask wearing and strict quarantines for all arrivals.
But the government was jolted by Tuesday's announcement of the domestic infection of a woman who is a friend of a New Zealand pilot confirmed to have been infected earlier this week having flown routes to the United States.
EVA Air has sacked the pilot, who has not been named and is being treated in hospital.
The case has ignited public anger after the government said he had not reported all his contacts and the places he had been, nor worn a face mask in the cockpit when he should have. 
In a statement referring to the ""uproar"" caused by the case, the Transport Ministry cited its minister Lin Chia-lung as saying the airline had not fully put in place epidemic prevention measures.
For breaching rules related to COVID-19, the ministry will fine the airline T$1 million, the maximum statutory fine it can make, it added.
The ministry will require airlines tighten their epidemic prevention measures for air crew while also issuing its own new rules, it said.
EVA Air, which has already apologised for the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has not been possible to reach the pilot for comment. EVA Air, like most airlines, is operating a very reducedschedule due to border restrictions globally.

810,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 24, 2020 03:37AM ET</span>",The blast that blew away Lebanon's faith in itself,"By Samia Nakhoul
BEIRUT (Reuters) - They gather in groups, wearing black, in the shadow of buildings gutted by the explosion that shook this city on Aug. 4. Men, women and children from Christian and Muslim sects cradle portraits of their dead.
Beirut has been blown back to the vigils of its 1975-1990 civil war. Then, families demanded information about relatives who had disappeared. Many never found out what happened, even as the country was rebuilt. Today's mourners know what happened; they just don't know why.
Four months on, authorities have not held anyone responsible for the blast that killed 200 people, injured 6,000 and left 300,000 homeless. Many questions remain unanswered. Chief among them: Why was highly flammable material knowingly left at the port, in the heart of the city, for nearly seven years?
For me, the port explosion rekindled memories I've spent 30 years trying to forget. As a reporter for Reuters, I covered the civil war, the invasion and occupation of Lebanon by Israel and Syria – and the assassinations, air strikes, kidnappings, hijackings and suicide attacks that marked all these conflicts.
But the blast has left me, and many other Lebanese, questioning what has become of a country that seems to have abandoned its people. This time, the lack of answers over the catastrophe is making it difficult for an already crippled nation to rise from the ashes again.
""I feel ashamed to be Lebanese,"" said Shoushan Bezdjian, whose daughter Jessica – a 21-year-old nurse – died while on duty when the explosion ripped through her hospital.
FALSE HOPE
It took 15 years of sectarian bloodletting to destroy Beirut during the civil war. It then took 15 years to rebuild it – with lots of help from abroad. In 1990, billions of dollars poured in from Western and Gulf Arab countries and from a far-flung Lebanese diaspora estimated to be at least three times the size of the country’s 6 million population.
The result was impressive: Beirut was reincarnated as a glamorous city featured in travel magazines as an exciting destination for culture and partying. Tourists came for the city’s nightlife, to international festivals in Graeco-Roman and Ottoman settings, to museums and archaeological sites from Phoenician times.
Many highly educated expatriates – academics, doctors, engineers and artists – returned to take part in the rebirth of their nation. Among them was Youssef Comair, a neurosurgeon who had left Lebanon in 1982 to pursue a specialization in the United States.
Comair had then worked as assistant professor of neurosurgery at UCLA and head of the epilepsy department at the Cleveland Clinic, where he pioneered the use of surgery as a therapy for epilepsy. When he landed back in Beirut to work as head of surgery at the American University of Beirut, Comair believed the country had turned a corner. Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, the industrialist-turned-politician who had rebuilt post-war Beirut, was in power and promised a renewed age of prosperity.
""I was yearning for a life and a place ... receptive to all kinds of civilizations. This is what we were in Lebanon before the war,"" recalled Comair.
Behind the splendor of Beirut, however, post-civil war Lebanon was being built on shaky political ground.
At the end of the war, militia leaders on all sides took off their fatigues, donned suits, shook hands after the 1989 Saudi-brokered Taif peace accord and largely disarmed. But the nation’s political leaders, it seemed to many here, continued to pay more attention to a revolving door of foreign patrons than to the creation of a stable state.
The country’s Shi'ite Muslims turned to Iran and its Arab ally Syria, whose troops entered Lebanon in 1976 and stayed for three decades. The Sunnis looked to wealthy oil producers in the Gulf. Christians, whose political influence was heavily curtailed in the post-war deal, struggled to find a reliable partner and shifted alliances over the years. Domestic policy was dictated, at different times, by the foreign power with the deepest wallet.
Comair’s return to Beirut was propitious for me, too. While I was covering the U.S. invasion of Baghdad in 2003, I was badly wounded in the head by shrapnel from a U.S. tank shell fired at the Reuters office in the Palestine Hotel. After emergency surgery in Baghdad, I was evacuated by U.S. Marines to neighboring Kuwait and then on to Lebanon for further treatment. Beirut had become a medical center of excellence for the region – and Comair was my doctor. For years, during my sojourns in Dubai and London, I regularly returned to Beirut and Comair to ensure I was healing.
But my country was once again under strain. After the Iranian-backed Hezbollah drove out Israeli forces in south Lebanon in 2000, the group was steadily increasing its military and political influence. In 2005, Hariri was assassinated, once more dealing a blow to those who thought Lebanon had a bright future. Once again, Lebanese top professionals emigrated. Comair took up a position at St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital in Houston in 2006. I settled in London.
Both of us were determined to return, however. For me, a return home was a way to expose my children, who were in elementary school at the time, to my family and culture. The Arab Spring in 2010 provided the moment. While protests erupted and dictators were toppled in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Libya, Bahrain and Yemen, Lebanon seemed like an oasis in a troubled region. Beirut was once again bustling. By 2012, both Comair and I were back in Beirut.
We were lulled into a sense of security: traditional Sunday lunches with family; sunset drinks on the decks of Beirut beaches; music and film festivals; wine tasting in the vineyards of Mount Lebanon’s foothills, skiing on its slopes. Friends and family began visiting in greater numbers, as Lebanon’s wartime reputation began to be forgotten. Tourism peaked in Lebanon in 2010, when the number of visitors reached almost 2.2 million, a 17% increase from 2009, according to official statistics.
LIFE STOPPED
Yet again, however, Lebanon’s foundations were weak. The country was living beyond its means, with successive governments piling up debt, which rose to the equivalent of 170% of national output in March 2020, according to Lebanon's finance ministry. This time, national banks bore the brunt of the nation’s spending. By early last year, their losses on loans to the state totaled $83 billion, considerably more than Lebanon’s annual gross domestic product. The banks reacted by shutting their doors, freezing all accounts – effectively shutting down Lebanon’s economy.
For more than a year now, people in Lebanon have not been able to transfer money or withdraw more than $500 a week. The closure of the banks blocked another key stream of income for Lebanon’s economy – money from the diaspora.
Even before the coronavirus pandemic, Lebanon’s economic output had shrunk by 6.7% in 2019. In 2020, the economy is projected to shrink by another 20%. More than 50,000 children have left private schooling and enrolled in state education over the past year, government figures show, a trend that underscores the erosion of the country's middle class. Nearly 700 doctors have left Lebanon over the past year, according to Sharaf Abou Sharaf, head of the doctors’ union.
What many Beirutis didn’t know before August is that an even bigger threat lay in their midst.
In 2013, a ship had docked at the Beirut port with a stash of the highly flammable chemical ammonium nitrate. It wasn’t – and isn’t to this day – clear why the ship had headed to Lebanon. But the arrival and storage of the material was known to a revolving door of port and national security officials – installed by various government factions – who were never able to agree on how to remove the chemical shipment. It lay untouched for more than six years in a warehouse at the Beirut port, a short walk from the busy city center.
When I covered the civil war, I chronicled the deaths of dozens of victims overlooked amidst the bigger events: two sisters who drowned at sea in a desperate attempt to flee shelling; three brothers immolated in a supermarket; young school children hit in shelling that targeted their bus. One morning in 1989 I found myself walking into a morgue with a mask that could not stifle the suffocating stench of 20 army soldiers shot in the head, their hands still tied behind their backs.
But I will never forget the terror in the eyes of my twin children on that afternoon in August when our car was suddenly thrown toward the side of the road as an orange and white mushroom cloud of dust and debris rose over our heads. “Duck and cover,” I yelled, instantly thrown back to the bombs of my conflict-zone reporting days. Glass and bricks from collapsing buildings fell near the car; uprooted trees blocked the roads. People ran everywhere; wailing ambulances struggled to reach the wounded.
""Life stopped on August 4,"" said Rita Hitti, whose son Najib was a firefighter who was killed along with two other family members as they battled the flames that ignited the explosives at the port.
""I no longer have any feeling towards anything – my country or anything else.""
After the blast, the government resigned in the face of popular anger. But Lebanon’s different ruling factions remain too divided to create a new government that can help rebuild the city – and Lebanon’s economy. Their loyalties are split between the United States, Europe and the Gulf states on one side and Iran and Syria on the other. Attempts by France’s President Emmanuel Macron to help cobble together a new administration have thus far failed.
A SOCIETY DIVIDED
Today, the split between Lebanon’s elite and the wider population is wide. Lebanese tycoons regularly feature on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people. Among the six listed in 2020 were members of the family of al-Hariri, the assassinated prime minister, and another former premier, Najib Mikati, and his brother Taha. Other leaders, many of them former militia heads, now live in grand villas, surrounded by security, in Beirut’s wealthy suburbs or secluded hilltops.
In 2019, the richest 10% owned about 70% of the country's personal wealth, according to a report by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia. More than half the population is in poverty, the report added.
Samia Doughan, 48, recently joined a protest at the Beirut port against the nation’s leaders. She sobbed as she held a picture of her dead husband. ""Every day, we wake up crying and we sleep crying,"" said Doughan, the mother of twin girls. ""These leaders should have been toppled a long time ago. They ruled us for 30 years, it's enough.""
In contrast to the post-civil-war period, when overseas support flowed in, foreign donors say they will not finance Lebanon until a new administration can show that their money will not be squandered.
During the civil war, many Lebanese emigrated. This time, too, people are starting to look for an exit. Information International, a Beirut-based research firm which has done extensive research about migration, said an estimated 33,000 people left in 2018 and 66,000 left in 2019. 
Immediately after the August blast, searches in Lebanon for the word ""immigration"" on Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends hit a 10-year peak, and a recent search by the Arab Opinion Index revealed that four out of five Lebanese aged 18 to 24 are considering emigration. Sharaf, head of the doctor’s union, says he receives between five and 10 requests a day for recommendations from doctors seeking jobs in foreign hospitals.
The heart of the capital, ordinarily packed over Christmas, is deserted. Stores and restaurants are closed. Martyrs Square, which during the Civil War was the frontline between Muslim west and Christian east Beirut before being rebuilt, is no longer lit up at night.
Comair and I are both now thinking of leaving Lebanon again. My doctor spends his days trying to rebuild his hospital, which was destroyed during the explosion. But he has little faith in the country’s long-term revival.

""We are witnessing the annihilation of Lebanon,"" he told me. ""I have no hope that this country can rise up.""

CREMA, ITALY
At the start of 2020, Elisa Dossena had turned 23 and was looking forward to getting an undergraduate degree and pursuing a masters from one of Italy's most prestigious universities.
    Then Italy became the first European country to be hit by the pandemic. It turned her world upside down, putting her plans on hold and forcing her to become the de facto head of a stricken household.
    While Dossena was studying in Milan, COVID-19 began ravaging her family and relatives in the town of Crema about 50 km (30 miles) away in Italy's first ""red zone"" in the northern Lombardy region. She returned home to help.
    Both her 59-year-old aunt and her 90-year-old grandmother succumbed to other illnesses and died after the virus weakened them. Her father had severe breathing difficulties, although it was never determined if COVID-19 was the cause.
    ""I had to take care of the house, I had to manage everything for everyone because my mother was busy looking after my father, busy with my grandma, helping my cousin when her parents were ill. So I felt a lot of pressure, a lot of responsibility,"" she said.
    ""It was a very negative period for me. But it also made me grow a lot,"" said Dossena, sitting in the living room of her family home in Crema.
    After a three-month lockdown in June, restrictions were lifted and Dossena could see her friends again.
    But a constant fear of catching the coronavirus loomed like a dark cloud over them all, eliminating the tactile culture of hugs and kisses for which Italians are famous.
    ""People don't trust shaking hands, hugging or meeting new people,"" she said. ""When I entered a closed space. I could feel the palpitations, the anxiety ... surely something changed.""
    A new spike of the virus in late autumn meant her graduation ceremony was held via webcam, denying her the extended family celebration that usually accompanies the personal milestone.
    She is now studying remotely for a masters degree in management and hoping for just a bit of normality in 2021.
    ""I hope people can leave their homes freely. I hope it will be possible to go for a coffee with friends at the bar. I hope it will be possible to return to school desks, places of work and university,"" she said.
    ""I don't ask a lot but I hope for this.""

NAIROBI, KENYA 
Kenyan teenager Jackline Bosibori wore baggy sweatshirts to hide her pregnancy from her mother as long as she could, reluctant to add to her family's troubles. 
    ""If I was in school, I could have not been pregnant,"" the 17-year-old said. 
    For Bosibori, who gave birth in November, school closures defined 2020. Many Kenyan advocacy groups fear adolescent pregnancies increased as girls were forced to stay home while parents still went to work. 
    The father of her little girl – an adult – has avoided Bosibori's family since learning of the pregnancy. Kenya's president in July ordered an investigation into rising reports of sexual abuse, including statutory rape, amidst the lockdown. 
    For Bosibori, school closures have made her dream of becoming a lawyer seem far away. 
    ""I feel I have not progressed in any way this year,"" laments Bosibori. ""If I was in school, I could have improved in my goals."" 
    The situation makes her anxious, she said from the one-room home where she lives with six other family members. 
    ""There are people who lost jobs. There are students who will not go back to school; they have stayed out for a long time and have adapted to being at home,"" Bosibori explained as she took a break from studying while her baby slept. 
    Kenyan schools have been shut since March. Bosibori wants to return when they reopen in January, but she worries about the fees. 
    ""My mom lost her job ... at this time, we don't have rent,"" she said. ""I am stressed."" 
    ""2020 was a bad year to me and it was a good year to me,” Bosibori said. ""It was a bad year to me because I got pregnant unexpectedly."" 
    ""But it was a good year to me because I delivered my baby and she is OK.""

CHEONAN, SOUTH KOREA
Lee Ga-hyeon has a big wish for 2021 - to finally escape her bedroom in a city about 100 km (60 miles) from Seoul and see her pop idols BTS in person at a live event. 
    ""BTS is like a vitamin for me, but the coronavirus took it from me which made me really angry,"" said 17-year-old Lee, in her room adorned with BTS photographs, lookalike dolls and a blanket with band member Jin's face on it.
    The pandemic forced BTS to cancel a world tour in 2020 that would have taken the seven-member band through Asia, Europe and the United States, and its New Year's Eve concert will be online. 
    For Lee, there were no more trips to Seoul to see concerts and hang out with friends, and instead life has gone largely online, where South Korea's hyper-connectivity helped her host a YouTube channel showcasing BTS events from the past three years.
    ""It's very sad that this room is the only place where I can meet BTS,"" she said. 
    While the country had early successes fighting the pandemic, the third and strongest wave of infections has forced pop fans to embrace the digital world in this ""lost year."" 
School is also online, making things even tougher for those preparing for the annual university entrance exam, a rite of passage seen as a life-defining event in South Korea.
    Lee hopes the test will be held on time next year, free of the coronavirus. It was delayed by a month in 2020 when nearly half a million candidates sat for the eight-hour exam wearing face masks at desks divided by screens. 
    It was a year that reminded her how special it was to have friends even though they remained apart. But it left her hoping that the new year will allow her to pursue her dream of studying mass communications and law at university.
    ""Last year I spent a lot of time chatting with friends face-to-face on break time and lunch time, but I couldn't do it at all this year,"" said Lee. ""I finally realized how precious that time was.""

MCFARLAND, CALIFORNIA
Valeria Murguia was finishing her junior year at California State University, Fresno, studying communications and working part time at the campus health centre when the pandemic hit. 
All of a sudden, classes went online and her modest income from crafting social media messages to help students stay healthy evaporated. Living in Fresno, a fast-growing city where housing costs were rising, became too expensive, so within a few weeks Murguia found herself back home with her parents in the small farming town of McFarland.
Like many college-age adults in the United States, Murguia's young life took a sombre turn as the pandemic raged on. She and her friends started taking their health more seriously, working harder at part-time jobs or on homework, and being more open to serious personal relationships.
At home, Murguia concentrated on schoolwork, and on skills she would need after graduation: she learned how to build websites, improved her graphic design proficiency and studied event planning. She also worked with her parents, both immigrants from Mexico, picking grapes in California's Central Valley vineyards.
""It made people more serious,"" she said of the pandemic, ""not so loosey-goosey ... It's going to for sure leave a mark on our generation.""
Murguia, now 21, will graduate in May into a tight job market. While the advertising business lost relatively fewer jobs than most other sectors, it has shown effectively no job growth since wider employment began recovering in May. And, employment in the civic and social organizations industry remains 30% below what it was in February.
She has no student debt, so will not bear that burden, however. And economists are increasingly optimistic about the outlook for 2021 and beyond, thanks to the rollout of vaccines for COVID-19. Still, the job market that awaits Murguia and others like her is nothing like it was before the pandemic, when the lowest unemployment rate in half a century meant many graduates had their pick of jobs.
Even so, Murguia is optimistic about her post-pandemic future.
""I'm really staying positive, because if I start looking at the negative things, I just start playing games in my head,"" she said. ""And I don't want to end in that space.""

WUHAN, CHINA
Xiong Feng, a 22-year-old graduate, teaches Wuhan's only class in Voguing, a highly stylized dance form popularised in U.S. gay and transgender communities in the late 1980s. 
Wuhan's surprise 76-day lockdown, which cut the city off from the rest of China overnight on Jan. 23, began long before other countries began to feel the pain of the pandemic. 
Xiong, like many other Gen Z people in Wuhan, saw his life, education and business thrown into turmoil. The pandemic meant he was unable to graduate alongside his classmates, and lockdown meant he lost the opportunity to form tight friendships at a formative time in his life. 
""I think I've lost some friends. The relationship faded away because we didn't get in touch with each other during the epidemic,"" he said. 
The city has now largely returned to normal though, after strict controls meant it has not reported a case since May.
For Wuhan's Gen Z, the economic outlook is perhaps better than for some of their peers abroad, as businesses and offices have reopened and China is set to become the only major economy to grow in 2021.
Local businesses in Wuhan this month told Reuters that the crowds were slowly but surely coming back, and young people – cooped up for months – were looking to spend more on hobbies and social experiences. 
For those like Xiong embarking on a first solo business, the post-pandemic flurry has helped attract new customers. For others, including Chinese who study abroad, the pandemic has proved difficult despite China’s comparatively strong control over the disease. 
Looking forward, Xiong hopes he can still be a trailblazer in the city's growing LGBT dance scene in 2021. His Voguing class has attracted more students since the lockdown was lifted, as people emphasise lifestyle and leisure.
""I hope I can establish the first (ballroom event for Vogue dancing) in Wuhan in my spare time. Because I see cities in China like Shanghai and Chengdu have developed a very good ballroom culture, and I believe Wuhan can do it too."" 
As the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, Wuhan suffered deep trauma during the first quarter of 2020, locals agree. But Xiong says the experience has yielded important lessons for young people in China and elsewhere. 
""I think the world should have more peace and love, and people should not be fighting against each other anymore,"" he said.

DIEPKLOOF TOWNSHIP, SOUTH AFRICA 
When South African fencer Nomvula Mbatha finished top in a national women's sabre competition in 2019, she seemed set for the Olympics via the African Championships in Egypt, scheduled for April 2020.
    Then COVID-19 hit. All competition was suspended and a strict lockdown at the end of March seriously curbed training for the 23-year-old and her team.
""The pandemic has been disastrous for us,"" said Mbatha at her home in the Diepkloof township, southwest of Johannesburg. ""We basically didn't get to accomplish anything. This year was cancelled in our lives.""
    Even when competition resumed, Mbatha, ranked number one with 17 gold medals, faced enormous difficulties raising funding to attend the international events that would secure her a berth at the Tokyo Olympics, postponed to 2021. 
A member of the Soweto Fencing Club, she is just one of the country's next generation of star athletes struggling to raise cash to compete in an economy hit by low growth and high unemployment, especially for young people.
Between July and September, unemployment among 15- to 24-year-olds rose to 61.3% from 52.3% in the previous three months, according to Statistics South Africa.
    As officials look to programmes that can stimulate employment, Mbatha's focus is on the next African Championships. Once again, though, the pandemic looms. A recent spike in infections has prompted new restrictions.
""What if we go back to lockdown?"" she said. ""I don't have a resolution for 2021 ... I don't have anything because I am scared.""

PARIS, FRANCE
    Alone in a tiny studio apartment in Paris, unable to leave the country to see her boyfriend, cut off from friends, and uncertain about her future, Solene Tissot felt the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic building up inside her.
""You quickly find yourself overwhelmed by all this. You quickly feel suffocated,"" said the 19-year-old.
Tissot, who moved to Paris two years ago to study at the Sciences-Po university, is now seeing a psychologist.
    She has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder, conditions she says were triggered by the loneliness brought on by COVID-19 lockdowns.
    Such restrictions have taken a toll on the mental health of French youth. Between September and November this year, when a fresh lockdown was imposed in France, the proportion of 18- to 24-year-olds with depression went up to 21% from 11%, according to the French public health authority.
    Tissot no longer attends lectures in person because her university has cancelled them. Movement restrictions often make it unlawful for her to visit friends at home.
    She has not seen her grandparents in a year. Her course requires her to do an internship. But with many firms operating remotely, she is struggling to find somewhere to take her.
    Next year, she was due to do a study year in Lebanon - where her boyfriend lives - but it's unclear if travel restrictions will allow it.
    Once she graduates, finding work will be harder because of COVID-19. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 22% of French people aged 15 to 24 were neither in work nor education in the third quarter of this year, up from 19% the year before.
    Tissot though, is looking to the future. She is learning Arabic, in preparation for the trip to Lebanon she hopes will go ahead.
    ""What I hope for is also that we can go back to a life that is a bit more normal, and that means being able to see friends without it being illegal to go to their place,"" she said.
    ""It's true that 2020 didn't leave much room for good cheer,
and I would like to have that again.""

CAIRO, EGYPT
Abdullah El-Berry, a 22-year-old trainee sports journalist, entered 2020 thinking life would be tough. A severe knee injury needed daily physiotherapy and seriously affected his three-hour commute to Cairo from his home in the Delta city of Shebine al-Qanatir.
After the pandemic hit, he could not continue physiotherapy as Egypt's hospitals were overrun with patients. He could not present his graduation project or attend his long-awaited graduation ceremony. The suspension of sports made it near impossible to do his job. And his daily commute was thrown in disarray by night curfews.
Now, he believes 2021 will be even tougher. Paid very little as a trainee at a state-owned newspaper, the young graduate worries he will struggle to find a proper job.
""We already suffer to find a job,"" he said. ""Now, many people lost their jobs due to coronavirus and the economic crisis. It will definitely impact us all.""
Egypt's population has been growing fast and just over half of its 102 million people are under 25, according to U.N. data.
Unemployment is high among young people, women and graduates. In the first quarter of 2020, the jobless rate for those aged 15-19 stood at 19.7% and for those aged 20-24 at 13.9%, against an overall rate of 7.7%, according to statistics agency CAPMAS. For women aged 20-24 and graduates it was almost 50%.
Having survived years of tough economic reforms and austerity measures, many Egyptians are unsure how to weather the coronavirus storm. Lockdowns have paralysed tourism and other vital sectors, hitting the economy hard and cutting growth forecasts.
Berry believes social distancing and wearing masks will continue to control lives in 2021, and make young people of his generation less likely to travel and explore new opportunities.
His wishlist for 2021 includes advancing his career and resuming work on a YouTube channel he abandoned due to his studies and coronavirus.

MOSCOW, RUSSIA
In early 2020, Galina Akselrod-Golikova, 23, was preparing to travel from Moscow to Italy for a marketing and PR job at the Venice biennale's Russian pavilion. She couldn't wait to start. 
    The dream never happened: the whole event was postponed, the job disappeared and, instead of travelling abroad, she ended up isolated from her friends and family in an apartment in Moscow as a tough lockdown suddenly began in April. 
    The shock upset her deeply. She fretted so much that she developed stress-induced health issues. In time though, she said she was relieved to have a chance to refocus her life and have time to think. 
    She said she slowed down for the first time and put her energy into decorating the apartment where she lives with her boyfriend with stylish ornaments, antique furniture and flower arrangements. 
    ""This year was the first time I started to devote so much time to my home, to buying some little things, and to stay there and to think about my space and to express myself through it,"" she said. 
    She has not rushed to get a new job, and with time to reflect she has realised that she wants to enrol for a masters degree in food studies in Rome next year.  
    Russia has resisted a second lockdown in order to soften the economic blow of the pandemic. Unemployment during the health crisis peaked at 6.4% in August, with young people making up 22% of that total. 
    Despite the upheaval, Akselrod-Golikova believes that the pandemic has brought many positive things into her life, though she acknowledges it was easier for younger people to adjust quickly. 
    ""I've started to appreciate my time as a resource and to devote it to my family, to my friends and to spend more time with them, including getting to know my parents and friends in new ways,"" she said.

SAO PAULO, BRAZIL
Joao Vitor Cavalcante, 19, had trained hard throughout 2019 for his budding career as a professional cyclist. He thought 2020 would be his best year so far. 
    But the pandemic upended that dream, prompting him to take a job at a car repair shop and give up his plans for a career in cycling. 
    ""Cycling is not easy, it is cruel, although I enjoyed that cruelty,"" Cavalcante told Reuters. ""Now I don't want to live off of that anymore. Instead I want to live to do it.""
    Cavalcante is one of millions of Brazilian Gen Zs who have had to drastically adjust their aspirations due to the pandemic's effect on the economy. 
    According to a survey financed by several Brazilian nonprofits, about 23% of Brazilians aged between 15 and 29 looked for new ways to make up lost income during the pandemic. About 60% signed up for emergency government payments, which handed out more than half of Brazil's minimum wage to any citizen without a formal job. 
    For Cavalcante, there was no other option. His parents were forced to shut down the family clothing store during the first few months of the pandemic and his sponsor left him when cycling competitions were cancelled. 
    His uncle, aware of the economic constraints, asked him to work at his car repair shop. 
    ""He was my salvation,"" Cavalcante said. ""Either I took that job or I would be working for nothing. Last year, I sort of had a future (in cycling), but that time has passed."" 
    Cavalcante now works eight hours a day repairing cars, although he says he dislikes washing dirty auto parts. But it is a job that helped support his family during a rough time. 
    He wants to compete again in 2021, but only as an amateur. 
    ""For 2021, I hope that things return to normal and that people can see their friends and family again and that they value their affection,"" he said.

“Putting your own citizens at risk abroad won't divert attention from catastrophic failures at home,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted. 
Trump, without giving evidence, said on Twitter on Wednesday that the rockets that landed in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone on Sunday, in an attack targeting the U.S. Embassy, were from Iran and “we hear chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq.”
“Some friendly health advice to Iran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over,” Trump said. 
The Iraqi military blamed the attack, which caused some minor damage, on an “outlaw group.” 

Top U.S. national security officials agreed on Wednesday on a proposed range of options to present to Trump aimed at deterring any attack on U.S. military or diplomatic personnel in Iraq, a senior administration official told Reuters without describing the content of the options or say whether they included military action.

814,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 10:25PM ET</span>",'Balloon boy' parents pardoned by Colorado governor over 2009 hoax,"By Keith Coffman
DENVER (Reuters) - The husband and wife who pleaded guilty to criminal charges for staging the 2009 ""balloon boy"" hoax, creating a global media sensation with a false report that their son had floated away in a makeshift dirigible, were pardoned on Wednesday by Colorado's governor.
In granting executive clemency to Richard Mayumi Heene, essentially a forgiveness of their crimes, Governor Jared Polis said the couple, now 59 and 56, had paid their debt to society for a ""spectacle"" that wasted law enforcement time and resources.
The couple drew worldwide attention when they reported on Oct. 15, 2009, that their 6-year-old son, Falcon, had been carried aloft by a homemade helium balloon that had become untethered from the family's backyard in Fort Collins, Colorado.
News footage showed the silver balloon, resembling a flying saucer, soaring over northeastern Colorado for 90 minutes, trailed by National Guard helicopters as authorities scrambled to reroute aviation traffic around Denver International Airport.
Millions were riveted to live coverage on television and the internet, watching as the balloon craft finally landed in a wheat field, with no one found aboard.
Falcon, the youngest of the couple's three children, ultimately turned up in the attic of the family's garage.
Investigators said the mother later admitted the stunt was aimed at gaining the family their own reality TV show. 
The Heenes' account unraveled after an appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" program, in which Falcon was asked why he stayed in hiding so long. Looking first to his parents, the boy answered: ""You said that we did this for a show."" 
Richard Heene pleaded guilty to one count of attempting to influence a public servant, a felony, and was sentenced to 30 days in jail. His spouse pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense of filing a false report and was ordered to perform 20 hours of supervised community service.
The husband's lawyer, David Lane, told Reuters that the family, who now live in Florida, were ""very grateful"" to Polis, but he took a swipe at prosecutors in the case.
Lane said prosecutors told Richard Heene that unless he pleaded guilty to a felony, they would move to deport Mayumi, who was a Japanese citizen. 
""Richard had absolutely no choice, so he took it.""

The ""balloon boy"" case was among 18 pardons and four sentence commutations granted on Wednesday by Polis, a first-term Democrat.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Millions of Sydney residents were asked to limit their mobility over the Christmas holidays, with some families in lockdown and festive gatherings limited to 10 visitors indoors, as officials try to contain a COVID-19 outbreak which now totals 100.
Australia's most populous city has been virtually isolated from the rest of the country with state border closures or mandatory 14-day quarantine for Sydney arrivals.
""Please limit your mobility,"" New South Wales (NSW) state Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney on Thursday.
""Apart from those close family gatherings, which we have allowed over the Christmas break, we don’t want people moving around unless you absolutely have to.""
The neighbouring state of Victoria on Thursday advised its residents not to ""hug or kiss"" any visitors who had been in Sydney in the past 10 days.
More than a quarter of a million people in Sydney's northern beach suburbs remain in some form of lockdown on Christmas Eve after a new coronavirus cluster emerged there last week.
Authorities are concerned infections may spread city-wide and are daily issuing an ever growing list of potential transmission sites across the city and calling on people to be tested and isolate. 
NSW Health said a record 60,000 coronavirus tests were carried out in the 24 hours to 8.00 p.m. (0900 GMT) Wednesday.
Sydney recorded nine new local COVID-19 cases on Thursday, up from eight the previous day as a lockdown and social restrictions seem to be containing the fresh outbreak.
Berejiklian said a decision on whether to extend restrictions will be made on Dec. 26.
Before the Sydney cluster, NSW had gone a month without any locally acquired infections, and officials are still struggling to determine the source of the outbreak. Genomic testing found the virus strain came from the United States.
All arrivals in Australia undertake a mandatory hotel quarantine, though some aviation workers are able to self-isolate without stringent supervision.
Two international airline crew have tested positive and been placed in Victoria's hotel quarantine programme this week, said the state's commander of COVID testing programme Jeroen Weimar.
In Queensland state, a crew member of a luxury super yacht recently arrived from the Maldives has tested positive in the port of Cairns.

Australia has reported just over 28,000 coronavirus cases and 908 deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Top U.S. national security officials agreed on Wednesday on a proposed range of options to present to President Donald Trump aimed at deterring any attack on U.S. military or diplomatic personnel in Iraq, a senior administration official told Reuters.
The meeting was spurred by an attack on Sunday in which rockets landed in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone compound targeting the U.S. Embassy and causing some minor damage, the Iraqi military and the embassy said.
The so-called principals committee group, including acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security adviser Robert O'Brien met at the White House, said the official, who requested anonymity.
A ""range of options"" would be presented soon to Trump, said the official, who would not describe the content of the options or say whether they included military action.
""Each one is designed to be non-escalatory and to deter further attack,"" the official said. 
After the meeting, Trump, without giving evidence, said on Twitter that the rockets on Sunday were from Iran and ""we hear chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq.""
""Some friendly health advice to Iran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over,"" Trump said.
The Iraqi military blamed Sunday's attack on an ""outlaw group.""
U.S. Central Command said that Sunday's attack was ""almost certainly"" conducted by an ""Iranian-backed Rogue Militia Group.""
""While this 21 rocket attack caused no U.S. injuries or casualties, the attack did damage buildings in the U.S. Embassy compound, and was clearly NOT intended to avoid casualties,"" it said in a statement. 
Another U.S. official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that after the meeting of senior leaders, the strategy was to be vocal about Sunday's attack but there was not a move towards using military force. The official added that the calculus could change if there were future attacks, especially if they harmed Americans.
In recent days there has been increased concern and vigilance about what Iranian-backed forces might do in the lead up to the anniversary of a Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike in Iraq that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, the official said. 
Washington blames Iran-backed militia for regular rocket attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq, including near the embassy. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility.
The senior administration official said the aim of the White House meeting was ""to develop the right set of options that we could present to the president to make sure that we deter the Iranians and Shia militias in Iraq from conducting attacks on our personnel.""
An array of militia groups announced in October that they had suspended rocket attacks on U.S. forces on condition that Iraq’s government present a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops.
But a rocket strike on the U.S. Embassy on Nov. 18 was a clear sign that Iranian-backed militias had decided to resume attacks on U.S. bases, according to Iraqi security officials.

Washington, which is slowly reducing its 5,000 troops in Iraq, threatened to shut its embassy unless the Iraqi government reins in Iran-aligned militias.

Representative Luiz Felipe Baleia Tenuto Rossi, 48, a businessman and president of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, will run in a February election for the house speakership with the backing of 11 parties that could deliver 281 votes, according to the bloc’s estimates. The group comprises a wide range of ideologies, from the communists to the Social Liberal Party, under whose banner Bolsonaro swept to election in 2018.
While barred from running himself, Maia is leading a campaign to mitigate Bolsonaro’s influence in the lower house. The government is backing another centrist candidate, Arthur Lira, who heads a coalition of about 200 legislators.

Both candidates are reaching out to leftist parties, which, with about 130 lawmakers in the house, are essential for any candidate seeking to reach the 257 votes needed to win the election. Most leftist parties have sided with Maia’s bloc, but dozens of lawmakers are expected to quietly switch sides ahead of the vote, which makes it difficult to predict the election outcome.
‘Free and Independent’
At stake is the power to effectively control the legislative agenda by deciding which bills go to a vote and when. A leadership independent from the executive branch may block at least part of the president’s conservative agenda. Most candidates say they back the agenda of economic reforms, which include a revamp of the tax system and other measures to cut spending.
“We want to make sure the house continues to be free and independent,” Rossi told reporters after the announcement.

Rossi is in his second consecutive term as a federal representative for Sao Paulo state, the country’s richest and most populous.
The Senate will also pick its president in February. With a dozen potential candidates, the race is wide open in the upper chamber.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker plans to sign a police reform bill after lawmakers on Wednesday approved a compromise measure that included concessions on police training and facial recognition technology needed to garner his support.
The Democratic-led state House of Representatives and Senate approved a reform package they redrafted after Baker, a Republican, sent an earlier version back that had provisions he opposed and that he said he would not support.
Baker told a news conference he would be ""honored"" to sign the latest version, which lawmakers pushed forward after nationwide racial justice protests that followed George Floyd's death in Minneapolis under a police officer's knee in May. The governor said he expected to sign the measure next week.
The bill's passage follows efforts by other states and cities nationally to adopt law enforcement reforms. Democratic House Speaker Robert DeLeo said the compromise bill ""lays the groundwork for continued improvement.""
A central provision is the establishment of an independent commission that would have the authority to certify and decertify officers and oversee misconduct investigations.
After Baker opposed giving the civilian-controlled panel authority over training standards, the legislature approved his proposal to keep training oversight within the municipal police training committee, which his administration oversees.
The bill limits legal protections for officers the commission decertifies for misconduct, bars officers from using ""chokeholds"" and places restrictions on ""no-knock warrants.""
The revised legislation also scales back restrictions on the use by public agencies of facial recognition technology, after Baker said he opposed a proposed moratorium on its use by law enforcement.
Police unions opposed the legislation. Supporters welcomed it.
""This bill represents meaningful progress for Massachusetts, even as more work remains to be done,"" Carol Rose, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in a statement.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",Mexican president offers defiance to major opposition alliance,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president responded defiantly on Wednesday to a major opposition alliance that aims to wrest control of the lower house of Congress in legislative elections next year.
Late on Tuesday, the center-right National Action Party (PAN), the centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) said they would form coalitions for 180 of 300 lower house seats up for grabs via majority vote in the June 6, 2021 elections.
The historic accord will allow the three to get behind whichever party's congressional candidate has the best chance of defeating President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) in those seats. 
Ever since taking office two years ago following a landslide election win, Lopez Obrador has tried to lump the opposition together as part of what he casts as a corrupt ruling elite. He called the opposition pact a ""moral victory"" for him.
""It's a source of pride, of great happiness, that they're uniting against us,"" he told a regular news conference.
While the pact plays to the narrative that his adversaries are cut from the same cloth, analysts say it would likely be easier for MORENA and its allies to defend their majority in the lower house if they kept the opposition fragmented.
Opinion polls show Lopez Obrador still enjoys robust support, and he is significantly more popular than MORENA, many of whose elected officials once belonged to the other parties.
A voter survey by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky this week showed that combined support for MORENA and its allies was fairly evenly matched with that for the main opposition parties. 
In a joint statement announcing their alliance, the PAN, PRI and PRD did not mention Lopez Obrador, but gave notice of where they believed he could be vulnerable in 2021.
They criticized his administration's management of the economy and the coronavirus pandemic, its relationship with companies, and pledged to promote renewable power sources, which have been sidelined by Lopez Obrador's oil nationalism. 
Control of the 500-member lower house is vital for passing the federal budget. The chamber also has 200 seats distributed among the parties via proportional representation.

Until the late 1980s, Lopez Obrador was a member of the PRI, which dominated Mexican politics for most of the 20th century. He then helped found the PRD, before breaking with the party after his unsuccessful 2012 tilt for the presidency.

The national elections authority said on Wednesday that applications to be included on the ballot were submitted electronically due to coronavirus restrictions.
Among the candidates are Keiko Fujimori, leader of a right-wing party in her third attempt to govern the Andean country once presided over by her father, former nationalist President Ollanta Humala, left-wing candidate Veronica Mendoza and moderate economist Julio Guzman.
The candidate leading in the opinion polls is former national soccer team goalkeeper George Forsyth, with 18% support. He is followed by Guzman with 8%, Mendoza with 7% and Fujimori with 7%. 
The previous record high number of Peruvian presidential candidates was the 20 that ran in 2006. The country has had four presidents since 2016 due to a series of corruption scandals and political battles between the executive branch and Congress.

821,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 04:31PM ET</span>",Challenging police violence ... while Black,"By Andrea Januta, Andrew Chung, Jaimi Dowdell and Lawrence Hurley
(Reuters) - Luke Stewart was sleeping in his car in Euclid, Ohio, when police came upon him. Moments later, he lay dying from gunshot wounds to his chest and neck.
Clayton Dobbins looked suspicious to the Irving, Texas, officer who saw him riding his bike in his own neighborhood. He was chased down, shocked with a Taser and jailed.
Shase Howse raised cops' suspicions by fumbling for his keys while standing on his front porch in Cleveland. He was slammed to the ground, handcuffed and jailed.
None of these three men were breaking the law when they drew the attention of police. None were armed. All were black.
Encounters like these, occurring across the United States, inform persistent complaints that racial bias poisons policing in the country — complaints that coalesced into a mass movement for policing reform after the May 25 death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis cop. 
A growing body of research supports the perception that police unfairly target Black Americans. They are more likely to be stopped, searched and arrested than their white compatriots. They also are more likely to be killed by police.
The aftermath of each of the three incidents examined for this article followed a common pattern. The officers who killed Stewart and roughed up Dobbins and Howse said the force they used was appropriate because the men ran, resisted or otherwise didn’t follow orders. The officers – all of them white – were cleared of wrongdoing by their departments. Local prosecutors brought no charges against them.
But Stewart’s family, Dobbins and Howse all felt wronged and hoped to hold the police accountable. The men didn’t comply, they said, because they had no idea why police engaged with them in the first place, and as Black men, they were justifiably frustrated or afraid or both. As Stewart’s mother, Mary, put it: “Luke wasn’t doing anything illegal, and now he’s dead … It was racism. It was police brutality.”
She and the others sued the police, accusing them of excessive force, a civil rights violation. The lawsuits they filed were made possible under an act of Congress passed 150 years ago for the purpose of protecting Black Americans from abuses by state and local authorities in the post-Civil War years.
Yet judges tossed out all three claims — before any jury had a chance to review the evidence — because the police involved were protected by a once-obscure legal doctrine that has become a flashpoint in this year of racial unrest: qualified immunity.
Crafted by the U.S. Supreme Court half a century ago, qualified immunity was meant to protect officials from costly and frequent litigation. In the view of critics across the political spectrum, it has evolved into a powerful defense that shields police from being held accountable for excessive force.
In effect, they say, qualified immunity denies Black people the recourse to justice provided by the 1871 law and enables violent police behavior that has a disproportionate impact on them.
Civil rights laws are meant “to protect Black people specifically or just people who are marginalized more generally, so the burden of qualified immunity will fall more heavily on those groups,” said Scott Michelman, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, D.C. “If there was accountability, that might act as a significant check on police behavior. Qualified immunity prevents that.”
Michelman recently represented a homeless Black man whose claim that cops used excessive force when they set a police dog on him after he surrendered was thrown out based on qualified immunity.
In May, Reuters revealed how qualified immunity has made it harder in recent years for plaintiffs to win excessive force lawsuits, even when courts determine police actually used such force. The main reason: the Supreme Court’s directive that police be granted immunity unless the specific circumstances of the incident were “clearly established” as illegal in a previous case, regardless of whether police actually violated the plaintiff’s rights. Lack of such precedents is what sank the Stewart and Howse lawsuits.
Law enforcement professionals and political conservatives argue that qualified immunity is essential for police to make quick decisions in dangerous situations. Without it, they say, police couldn’t do their jobs. Data on policing, they say, doesn’t show racial bias, but rather, law enforcement’s focus on areas with higher crime rates, which also happen to have larger minority populations.
“I do not support any contention there is systemic bias in policing,” Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police, the largest U.S. police union, told Reuters. “Unfortunately, because of the historic racism within government in the United States, we have gotten to a point where the economic disparities between white America and Black America are dramatic. With the poverty that’s sadly part of the Black experience in many parts of the United States comes a higher level of criminal activity.”
A 2016 study by the Center for Policing Equity at Yale University, however, showed that police use force disproportionately on African Americans even after taking racial disparities in crime into account. And in a Pew Research Center national survey of police in 2016, 92% of white cops said the country had done enough to ensure equal rights for Black people, compared to 57% of whites overall who said so.
The steady stream of headlines about Black Americans killed by police has fueled demands for broad reforms, including ending or revising qualified immunity. So far, reform initiatives have stalled in Congress amid partisan gridlock, and the Supreme Court has batted away several cases challenging qualified immunity. In the absence of action, lower-court judges, legally bound by the doctrine, have become some of its most vociferous critics — particularly for its effect on the Black community.
In August, Judge Carlton Reeves of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi tore into qualified immunity in a scathing 72-page opinion that began by listing George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans recently killed by police. He was ruling on a lawsuit against an officer who pulled over a Black man in a Mercedes, detained him for nearly two hours while tearing up the car in a fruitless drug search, and then left him on the side of the road.
Reeves granted immunity to the cop because no precedent clearly established his actions as illegal, but the judge made it clear that he felt the doctrine was unjust. “Just as the Supreme Court swept away the mistaken doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ ” – the concept the court used for decades to justify racial segregation laws – “so too should it eliminate the doctrine of qualified immunity,” Reeves wrote. “Let us waste no time in righting this wrong.”
“WHY ARE YOU IN MY CAR?”
In the cold, predawn gloom of March 13, 2017, Luke Stewart was sleeping in his car along a residential street in Euclid, Ohio, when a loud rapping startled him awake.
No one knows exactly why the 23-year-old was there, parked near a friend’s house where he sometimes stayed. He had been drinking, and family and friends assume that when he couldn’t reach his friend, he decided that his car was probably “the safest place to be,” his sister Terra told Reuters.
Stewart opened his eyes to bright lights shining in on him and quickly started the 2003 Honda Accord. As he moved to put it in gear, two men, without identifying themselves, opened the doors on either side.
The two men were Euclid Police Department Officers Louis Catalani and Matthew Rhodes, who later recounted the incident to investigators and in depositions.
On the driver’s side, Catalani grabbed Stewart and tried to pull him out of the car. Rhodes slid in on the passenger side to help Catalani just before the car started creeping forward. Catalani followed on foot.
“Why are you in my car?” Stewart asked Rhodes.
Rhodes punched Stewart repeatedly in the face to get him to stop the car. Stewart didn’t comply. Nor did he fight back. With each blow, he just said, “Naw n—a.” Rhodes shocked Stewart with a Taser and then struck him with the stun gun, opening a gash in Stewart’s head. Stewart still did not fight back.
Only after Rhodes took out his Glock 17 pistol and shot Stewart twice in the chest did the young man take a swing at the cop. Rhodes shot Stewart again, this time in the neck. Stewart slumped backward, his eyes glazing over. A fourth shot pierced Stewart’s wrist. The car came to a stop.
“Fuck!” Rhodes yelled as he got out. “He wouldn’t fucking stop!”
The Accord had traveled less than two blocks in a little more than a minute.
When the two cops first engaged with Stewart, they were responding to a report from an area resident of a “creepy looking car” parked near her house.
Catalani, arriving first, had spotted inside Stewart’s car a bottle cap for some “cheap gas station” wine, a digital scale, and what he thought was a marijuana blunt — later identified by investigators as a cigarette. Based on what he saw, Catalani said in his deposition, he suspected that, though Stewart wasn’t doing anything illegal, he could be impaired or in possession of marijuana. The officers agreed they had to pull Stewart from the car.
The medical examiner’s report said Stewart had a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit when he died. A Euclid Police Department investigation cleared the officers of any wrongdoing in Stewart’s death. After hearing an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation report on the incident, a grand jury declined to indict them.
Stewart’s family and friends weren’t satisfied. “He wasn’t perfect, but he was perfect enough for me,” Stewart’s mother, Mary, a 65-year-old U.S. Postal Service retiree, said of her son, the father of two young children who got by on landscaping, snow removal and other odd jobs.
In October 2017, Mary Stewart filed suit in federal court in Cleveland, accusing the officers of using excessive force in violation of her son’s rights under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.
The lawsuit alleged that the “unconstitutional policies and practices of the Euclid Police Department have resulted in the use of excessive and unconstitutional force against too many people, in particular African American people, including Luke Stewart.” In addition to financial damages, it sought a change to department practices “to bring them into compliance with constitutional standards.”
A TIME OF TERROR
After the Civil War ended, whites unleashed a wave of murder, torture and property destruction against millions of newly freed Black Americans. In the 12 years after the war, more than three Black Americans were lynched every week, on average. Often, local officials enabled and participated in white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.
To address local officials’ complicity in racial terror, Congress in 1871 passed the Ku Klux Klan Act. Among other things, the law allowed civilians to sue government officials in federal court to hold them liable for civil rights violations.
Nearly a century later, at the height of the civil rights movement, a group of activist clergymen filed one of these lawsuits against police who arrested them after they entered a “whites only” section of a bus station in 1961. When the case ended up at the Supreme Court, the justices ruled in 1967 that cops could not be held liable for civil rights violations if they were found to be acting in “good faith” in following what they thought to be the law. Qualified immunity, as the doctrine would come to be called, was born.
As Mary Stewart’s federal excessive force case proceeded, it yielded troubling revelations supporting her allegations about Euclid Police Department practices. A training presentation that both Rhodes and Catalani had received included an illustration of an officer in riot gear striking a person lying on the ground, alongside the caption, “protecting and serving the poop out of you.” There was also a link to a video by comedian Chris Rock, titled “How to not get your ass kicked by the police.”
In 2018, Judge James Gwin decried the department’s “tasteless, irresponsible frivolity with regard to the use of force.” He nonetheless granted the officers immunity. He accepted Rhodes’ claim that he was justified in killing Stewart because he feared for his life — in case Stewart crashed the car or kidnapped him.
Gwin dismissed all of Stewart’s claims. The judge did not respond to a request for comment.
Mary Stewart appealed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. In August this year, that appellate panel partly disagreed with the lower court, saying a jury could find that Rhodes’ use of deadly force did violate Luke Stewart’s rights. But it still upheld immunity for Rhodes on “clearly established” grounds: No prior case affirmed that it was illegal for an officer to use deadly force while riding in a suspect’s vehicle.
One of Stewart’s lawyers, Sarah Gelsomino, said the case illustrates how qualified immunity enables police brutality. “The police create the danger. They create a situation that they rely upon to justify the use of force,” she said. “Then the law protects them … It’s really an impediment to justice.”
The Euclid Police Department declined to make Rhodes or Catalani available for comment. Captain Mitch Houser, a department spokesman, said each officer remains in good standing and has an “excellent service record.” Houser said the department’s training materials have since been modified.
Citing the Stewart case and others, local activists last year asked the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate the Euclid Police Department for its “pattern of excessive and deadly force, police brutality, and intimidation.” They never received a response.
The DOJ did not respond to requests for comment.
Under President Barack Obama, the DOJ entered into agreements with at least eight cities and counties, including New Orleans and Baltimore, that compelled them to address racial discrimination and other abuses found in its investigations of their police departments. Such investigations all but ended after the election of President Donald Trump. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to expand the department’s power to address police misconduct.
“I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING”
Black Americans are more heavily policed than their fellow citizens. In a study published this year, researchers at Stanford University and New York University found that Black drivers were more likely to be stopped while driving – but less so at night, when their skin color wasn’t as apparent. The same study found that Black drivers were more likely to be searched after a stop, though searches turned up illegal contraband more often for white drivers. A 2019 study published by the National Academy of Sciences found that Black men were about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men.
For Black men, in particular, their mere presence attracts police suspicion — for appearing out of place in tranquil, low-crime communities, or for being perceived as part of the problem in high-crime areas, said Rod Brunson, professor of criminology at Northeastern University. “Black men find it difficult if not impossible to present themselves as law-abiding, regardless of the context,” he said.
The outsize presence of police in Black lives has inspired an American idiom: driving, or walking, or shopping — or any harmless everyday activity — “while Black.” 
When Clayton Dobbins was stopped for riding his bicycle while Black, he already had several police encounters under his belt.
When he was a boy of about 12 in Chicago, Dobbins said in an interview, a cop put a gun to his head and demanded information about a murder Dobbins knew nothing about. Later, while living in the Portland, Oregon, area, he filed two complaints of excessive force against local law enforcement, according to his deposition in his excessive force lawsuit. In 1982, he alleged an officer twisted his arm behind his back during a stop. And in 1991, he alleged an officer pulled him over and roughed him up after mistaking him for a suspect in a shooting. He said he received no response to either complaint.
Dobbins and his wife had been living in their house in a quiet subdivision in Irving, Texas, for seven years when the then-59-year-old slung on a backpack and set out on his bike that hot, sunny July day in 2014 to make a mortgage payment.
He hadn’t gone far when Irving Police Department Officer Craig Martin pulled his patrol car over to block Dobbins. Martin rolled down his window, rested his sunglasses on the top of his head, and looked at Dobbins with an “impish smile,” according to Dobbins’ deposition in the lawsuit he later filed.
Dobbins greeted Martin, who then asked if Dobbins lived in the area.
“What do you mean?” said Dobbins, an electrician between jobs.
“I’ve never seen you before,” Martin said.
Dobbins, now afraid that Martin had targeted him because he was Black, pedaled away.
Martin’s dashboard camera video shows the cop car following Dobbins along the street in bright summer sun. “Pull over,” Martin demands from the car. “You ran a stop sign,” he shouts.
Dobbins keeps pedaling.
Martin yells: “You’re under arrest.”
“What for?” Dobbins shouts back.
Martin speeds up, stops and chases Dobbins out of the dashcam’s view. Martin is then heard ordering Dobbins to get on the ground. “I’m not doing anything. You asked me where I live,” Dobbins says. He then cries out as Martin shocks him with a Taser.
Martin initiated the encounter after he spotted Dobbins “at a suspicious place at a suspicious time,” according to the officer’s deposition. “It’s not normal to see an individual on a bicycle with a backpack leaving the area of an open garage where I’ve had property crimes.”
Martin charged Dobbins with evading the police and running a stop sign with his bike. Dobbins spent several days in jail before his wife posted bond.
Dobbins told Reuters that when he later went to the Irving Police Department to file a complaint, officers told him he couldn’t submit one because of the charges against him. Reuters could not independently confirm Dobbins’ account of the exchange.
Les Moore, a lawyer for the Irving police, disputed that. “We routinely receive and investigate complaints from persons who have been arrested and charged with criminal offenses.” Moore noted that supervisors reviewed Martin’s incident report and evidence and “determined the use of force to be lawful.”
The Irving Police Department declined to make Martin available for comment. 
Local prosecutors dropped the evading arrest charge, and Dobbins pleaded no contest to the traffic violation. But Dobbins felt he had been racially profiled and decided to sue. 
“I’ve got to be able to leave my own house and not look suspicious. What suspicious nature would I have leaving my own house, locking my door?” he said. “I was hunted.”
Dobbins filed a federal excessive force lawsuit against Martin in February 2016 in the Northern District of Texas.
Martin requested immunity, and in May the following year, Judge David C. Godbey granted it. “The Court acknowledges the frustration Dobbins felt upon being stopped while leaving his own home,” the judge wrote, but he ruled that the officer’s use of force was reasonable, given Dobbins’ failure to stop and obey commands.
Godbey declined to comment.
Dobbins’ lawyer, Scott Palmer, wasn’t surprised. “We let the clients know that the law is not on our side. Qualified immunity – in part – makes it almost impossible” to get justice, he said.
In an analysis of excessive force lawsuits in which cops requested immunity in federal courts in California and Texas, the two most populous U.S. states, Reuters found no significant differences in outcomes by the plaintiff’s race. In fact, white plaintiffs had a slightly harder time clearing the immunity hurdle than Black plaintiffs.
However, the same data underscores the disproportionate burden that violent interactions with police place on Black citizens. Black plaintiffs made up 22% of cases involving a death or severe injury — more than twice their share of the combined population of California and Texas. White plaintiffs made up 33% of such cases, slightly less than their share of the states’ population.
“THIS IS MY HOUSE. I LIVER HERE.”
Opponents of qualified immunity fault the Supreme Court for diminishing Americans’ Fourth Amendment protections against excessive force with a series of rulings that have favored police. Similarly, they say, the high court has chipped away at Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable stops and searches.
The U.S. government’s decades-long “war on drugs” has spawned several cases challenging cops’ ability to stop and search civilians on suspicion of carrying contraband. Taken together, the justice’s rulings have only expanded police officers’ right to stop and search people without probable cause or a warrant.
In the span of just a few minutes on the night of July 28, 2016, Shase Howse was stopped twice, by two different sets of Cleveland cops.
Then 20 years old, the slightly built self-described homebody spent his time working at a pizza shop and playing video games in the house he lived in with his mother, in a poor, mostly Black neighborhood dotted with boarded-up houses along streets with broken pavement.
Around 10 p.m., Howse decided to take a break from his PlayStation to go “grab a Mild”– referring to Black & Mild, a brand of cigar — at Moe’s, a convenience store around the corner.
As he left the shop, two cops pulled up beside him and asked him if he had any weapons on him.
“No,” Howse replied.
One officer got out of the car, patted Howse down, reached in his pockets, and sent him on his way. Howse headed home.
Standing on his front porch, he thought he had forgotten his key. He phoned his mother, who was out on a bike ride, as he fumbled in his pockets.
“Is that your house?” a voice called out.
It was Detective Brian Middaugh, on patrol with two other Cleveland police officers in an unmarked car idling at the curb.
“Yes, this is my house. I live here,” Howse responded calmly, though still upset from his earlier encounter with police.
Middaugh questioned him again. Howse snapped back: “Yes, I live here. What the fuck?”
Middaugh and another officer, Thomas Hodous, got out of their car and walked onto the porch. Howse’s and the officers’ accounts of the ensuing encounter differ.
Howse testified that he was yelling to the officers that they had no right to stop him from entering his own home just as Middaugh slammed him to the concrete. Pinned down, Howse held himself rigid to prevent the officers from handcuffing him, he said, and that’s when Middaugh delivered two powerful blows to his neck. Howse’s mother, who had returned moments earlier, backed her son’s account in her testimony.
Middaugh told investigators that Howse became irate and refused to put his hands up, and when the two officers tried to grab him, he fought back, pushing them and grabbing for their handcuffs and flashlight holders. Middaugh said that’s when they took down Howse — but never struck him.
The officers testified that they initiated the encounter when they saw Howse milling about a house that looked abandoned. Howse raised their suspicions, they said, because he was taking too long to open the door, and he seemed nervous, glancing back and forth.
Howse was charged with assault and spent two nights in jail before his mother posted bond. The charges were later dropped — at Middaugh’s suggestion. Though “I was the victim in this circumstance,” Middaugh later testified, “I just kind of felt like this was an opportunity to give this kid a second chance and do something right.”
Middaugh, who resigned from the Cleveland Division of Police last February, declined to comment. A department spokeswoman declined to comment or to make Hodous available for an interview.
James Hardiman, a lawyer for Howse, filed a misconduct complaint against the officers with the city’s Civilian Police Review Board. When he got no response, Hardiman filed suit on July 21, 2017, alleging that Middaugh and Hodous used excessive force, and that the incident reflected a pattern of misconduct against African Americans in the Cleveland Division of Police.
Not until last year did the review board conclude that the case lacked enough evidence for a determination, said Roger Smith, administrator for Cleveland's Office of Professional Standards, which handles such complaints.
“The fact that nothing was done absolutely was part of the inspiration for pursuing the lawsuit,” Hardiman told Reuters. Howse is “just another Black man in a high crime area who got mistreated by the police.”
Howse’s lawsuit noted that Cleveland was one of the cities operating under a consent decree with the DOJ, which had found widespread use of excessive force by the city’s police.
Last year, Judge Donald Nugent granted the officers’ request for immunity, saying that they used no more force than was needed. He also rejected the claim of racial bias in the Cleveland police.
Two years earlier, Nugent ruled in favor of Middaugh in another excessive force case. In that one, a Black plaintiff alleged that Middaugh and other officers choked him, put a gun to his head and forcefully handcuffed him after responding to a call about a group of armed men. Middaugh denied any wrongdoing in that encounter.
Nugent did not respond to a request for comment.
Howse appealed Nugent’s ruling to the 6th Circuit. In March, the court chose not to consider whether the police violated Howse’s rights, but only whether there was any “clearly established” precedent confirming that it was illegal for Middaugh to tackle someone who disobeyed an order and refused to be handcuffed. There wasn’t, the court decided.
The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund has appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court – a long shot, based on the court’s recent record of declining to take up such cases.

Howse now lives with cousins in a different part of Cleveland. He said he meditates daily, partly to ease the trauma that lingers from that night four years ago. As is too often the case, the police saw a threat in him that did not exist, he said, but “I was just going into my own house.”

822,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",Right-wing challenge to Netanyahu builds ahead of Israeli election,"By Rami Ayyub
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - A right-wing challenge to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a March Israeli election gained momentum on Wednesday with the defection of a long-time ally to an upstart rival party. 
In a letter announcing his resignation from Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and parliament, Zeev Elkin, a minister in successive Netanyahu governments, accused Israel's longest-serving prime minister of putting his own interests ahead of those of the country.
""I can't ask Israelis to vote for you (Netanyahu) and to be satisfied that you are not putting your personal interests ahead of theirs,"" Elkin said in a speech broadcast live by Israeli television channels. 
The election will be Israel's fourth in two years, and comes as Netanyahu faces criticism over his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and battles corruption allegations, which he denies.
Elkin will join a new party led by fellow former Likud legislator Gideon Saar, who earlier this month announced a breakaway bid aimed at defeating Netanyahu. Saar announced Elkin's move to his party in a tweet, though Elkin made no mention of it in his speech. 
The defections pose a new challenge to Netanyahu ahead of a March 23 snap election. Parliament's failure to pass a national budget on Tuesday triggered the early ballot.
Until his resignation, Elkin served as Israel's minister of higher education and water resources. Born in Ukraine, Elkin is fluent in Russian and has long served as Netanyahu's interpreter and adviser in strategic talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Earlier on Wednesday, Sharren Heskel, a junior Likud lawmaker, also announced she was defecting to Saar's new party, writing in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that Netanyahu's government ""has lost the moral mandate to continue to govern"".

823,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",Gunmen kill more than 100 in attack in Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Gunmen killed more than 100 people in a dawn attack in the western Benishangul-Gumuz region of Ethiopia on Wednesday, the human rights commission said, as residents described fleeing the latest deadly assault in an area bedevilled by ethnic violence.
The attack occurred in the village of Bekoji in Bulen county in the Metekel zone, the state-run Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said in a statement, an area where multiple ethnic groups are living. 
Africa's second-most populous nation has been grappling with regular outbreaks of deadly violence since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was appointed in 2018 and accelerated democratic reforms that loosened the state's iron grip on regional rivalries.
Elections due next year have further inflamed simmering tensions over land, power and resources. 
In a separate part of the country, Ethiopia's military has been fighting rebels in the northern Tigray region for over six weeks in a conflict that has displaced close to 950,000 people. The deployment of federal troops there has raised fears of a security vacuum in other restive regions.
Ethiopia is also fighting an insurgency in the Oromiya region and faces long-running security threats from Somali Islamist militants along its porous eastern border. 
Gashu Dugaz, a senior regional security official, said authorities were aware of the Benishangul-Gumuz attack and were verifying the identities of the attackers and the victims, but did not give further information.
The region is home to several ethnic groups including the Gumuz people. But in recent years farmers and businessmen from the neighbouring Amhara region have begun moving into the area, prompting some Gumuz to complain that fertile land has been taken. 
Some Amhara leaders are now saying that some of the land in the region - especially in the Metekel zone - rightfully belongs to them, claims that have angered Gumuz people. 
""In previous attacks it was people who came from 'the forest' who were involved but, in this case, victims said they knew the people involved in the attack,"" the rights commission said in its statement.
82 BODIES COUNTED IN FIELD
Belay Wajera, a farmer in the western town of Bulen, told Reuters he counted 82 dead bodies in a field near his home after Wednesday's raid. He and his family awoke to the sound of gunshots and ran out of their home as men shouted ""catch them"", he said. His wife and five of his children were shot dead, he was shot in the buttocks while four other children escaped and are now missing, Wajera told Reuters by phone late on Wednesday.
Another resident of the town, Hassen Yimama, said armed men stormed the area around 6 a.m. (0300 GMT). He told Reuters that he counted 20 bodies in a different location. He grabbed his own weapon but assailants shot him in the stomach. 
A local medic said he and colleagues treated 38 injured people, most suffering from gunshot wounds. Patients told him of relatives who were killed with knives and told him that gunmen set houses on fire and shot at people trying to escape, he said.
""We weren’t prepared for this and we are out of medicine,"" a nurse at the same facility told Reuters, adding that a five-year-old child died while being transferred to the clinic. 
The attack came a day after Abiy, the military chief of staff and other senior federal officials visited the region to urge calm after several deadly incidents in recent months, such as a Nov. 14 assault in which gunmen targeted a bus and killed 34 people.
""The desire by enemies to divide Ethiopia along ethnic and religious lines still exists. This desire will remain unfulfilled,"" Abiy tweeted on Tuesday along with photos of his meetings that day in the town of Metekel, near where the Nov. 14 attack occurred. 
He said residents' wish for peace ""outweighs any divisive agenda"".

Yousuf Rasheed, executive director of the Free and Fair Elections Forum of Afghanistan Organization (FEFA), was shot dead while his driver was wounded, Kabul police spokesman Ferdaws Faramarz confirmed.
No one has claimed responsibility.
Rasheed was on his way to office when his car was ambushed, according to FEFA Programme Manager Naeem Asghari. The organisation had been scheduled to hold a press conference on Wednesday on the creation of a proper system to monitor peace talks between the Afghan government and the insurgent Taliban, he added.
The two sides began talks in September in Qatar, but recently took a break to consult their leaderships as negotiations enter a critical phase at the start of next year.
Violence in Afghanistan has risen, with an uptick in unclaimed bombings and shootings targeting activists, journalists and government officials.
The Taliban have denied involvement in most of the attacks, including the one on Rasheed.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the killing and praised Rasheed's work in promoting democratic values and transparency of electoral processes, according to statement from his office.
Rasheed's assassination was also condemned by the United States, which has been pushing the Taliban and the Afghan government to end a war that has kept western forces in Afghanistan for over 19 years.
""His voice will not be silenced. The future of Afghanistan cannot be foreclosed by murder but must be resolved at the negotiating table,"" the U.S. State Department said on Twitter, adding that Rasheed was a ""tireless advocate for democracy.""

Dundar, the former editor-in-chief of Turkish daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, and a colleague, Erdem Gul, were both sentenced in 2016 to five years in prison for publishing a video purporting to show Turkish intelligence trucking weapons into Syria. They were later released pending appeal.
Now a resident of Germany, he had faced up to 35 years in jail for allegedly supporting terrorism and military or political espionage. 
Dundar's lawyers refused to attend the final hearing. ""We do not want to be part of a practice to legitimize a previously decided, political verdict,"" they said in a written statement ahead of the hearing.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas criticised the ruling as a ""hard blow against independent journalistic work in Turkey"" which he called a fundamental right. 
""Journalism is not a crime but an indispensable service to society - even and especially when it looks critically ... on the fingers of those in power,"" Maas told RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland. 
Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency's communications director, said on Twitter Dundar's sentence does not violate freedom of expression. Writing in German, he said Turkey expects its partners to accept the court's decision and extradite him.
Germany will not extradite Dundar to Turkey as it views the trial and verdict as politically motivated, a diplomat in Berlin told Reuters.
Compliance with international standards for democracy, human rights and the rule of law is a key requirement for Turkey to have good and sustainable relations with Germany and the entire EU, the diplomat added.
For critics of President Tayyip Erdogan, Dundar has become a symbol of what they say is Turkey's sweeping crackdown on press freedom, especially since a failed coup in 2016. The government says the courts are independent and that it is responding to threats facing the country. 
The court earlier this month delayed its verdict after Dundar's lawyers asked for the judges to be replaced to ensure a fair trial, a request that was rejected. 

An Istanbul court had declared Dundar a fugitive and seized all his assets in Turkey.

""I’m very happy to be home and actually I’m going to .. go and see my mum and dad, put on a mask and give them a hug,” she said on arrival at the Gare du Nord station in Paris.
Cabral recalled her reaction when she realised the ban, imposed by the French authorities late on Sunday, could torpedo her Christmas travel plans and leave her stranded in Britain, where she has no family.
""I said to myself , 'Oh my God.'""
She said she ate some foie gras, a traditional French delicacy consumed at Christmas, for consolation, but added that nevertheless ""I was a bit scared"".
France and many other countries halted passenger traffic from Britain because of an outbreak of a new variant of the COVID-19 virus identified by British authorities. 
Traffic started flowing again across the Channel from Britain to France on Wednesday morning after London and Paris negotiated a deal.
Under the agreement, only certain categories of people are allowed to travel from Britain to France, and they need to prove they have tested negative for COVID-19.
Another French expatriate arriving in Paris on Wednesday, Albert Khayat, described the scramble to try to comply with the new rules.
""I was trying to get out of London. We got the news at 7 p.m."" on Tuesday evening. He said he was advised to get tested at the train station in London, which he did on Wednesday morning before boarding.
""The scandal is ... tests in Britain, which cost 160 pounds ($216) for each test,"" said Khayat. ""Not everyone has that luxury.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Wednesday expanded sanctions on Belarus, targeting four entities and 40 individuals over their roles in a disputed presidential election and the government's subsequent crackdown on protesters.
Belarus, a country of 9.5 million, which Russia sees as a security buffer against NATO, has been hit by repeated mass protests after the Aug. 9 vote that veteran President Alexander Lukashenko said he won. His opponents say the vote was rigged and have been demanding his resignation.
More than 30,000 people have been detained in Belarus since the start of the protests in August, opposition leaders say.
""The Belarusian people continually seek to peacefully exercise their basic democratic rights, and the state repeatedly responds with violent crackdowns,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a Treasury Department statement. 
The new sanctions target Belarus' central election commission which the Treasury said managed a vote that ""included a myriad of irregularities that made it neither free nor fair, including barring opposition candidates, denying access to poll observers, and certifying inaccurate vote tallies"". 
Also blacklisted were the Minsk Special Purpose Police Unit in the capital, the Main Internal Affairs Directorate of the Minsk City Executive Committee, and KGB Alpha, which the Treasury said was involved in attacking protesters. 
The Treasury also slapped sanctions on the deputy interior minister and national police chief, Henadz Arkadzievich Kazakevich.
The move freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
The U.S. State Department also identified 39 people it said were responsible for undermining democracy in Belarus and imposed visa restrictions on them, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. The 39 were not identified.
""The United States continues to support international efforts to independently investigate electoral irregularities in Belarus, the human rights abuses surrounding the election, and the crackdown that has followed,"" Pompeo said.

Washington previous slapped sanctions in October on the interior minister of Belarus and seven other officials of the former Soviet Republic, echoing measures by the European Union, Britain and Canada.

Galyamina, who took part in an opposition campaign against constitutional reforms this year that could allow President Vladimir Putin to remain in power until 2036, had dismissed the charge as politically motivated. 
Russian authorities opened the case against Galyamina in July, accusing her of having ""repeatedly violated"" the rules for organising and staging protests.
Galyamina, who was greeted by cheers and claps from her supporters outside the courthouse, tweeted that she would appeal against her conviction and sentence. The prosecution had asked the court to jail her for three years. 
Although she avoided prison time, the conviction bars her from running for office in next year's parliamentary election and also means she loses her city councillor status, according to Dmitry Gudkov, an opposition politician. 
Galyamina, 47, was involved in a campaign that planned a protest against constitutional reforms on July 15 in Moscow. Police detained dozens of people at the rally.
Adopted in July, the reforms allow Putin to seek two more six-year terms as president instead of stepping down in 2024 and, if re-elected, to stay in power until 2036. Other changes grant former presidents immunity from prosecution.
Human rights groups say Russia's protest legislation criminalising repeated protest violations is designed to stifle dissent and dissuade the opposition from taking to the streets. 

Amnesty International has said the charges against Galyamina were a travesty and amounted to ""using the justice system to criminalise peaceful protests.""

SOJEVE, Kosovo (Reuters) - Like many Kosovars, cattle seller Xhelal Terstena hopes incoming U.S. President Joe Biden will help the small Balkan country's push for United Nations membership.
    Biden is respected in Kosovo for his active support of the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in its then southern province. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 but Belgrade refuses to recognise it.
    ""For Albanians God comes first, America is second,” says Terstena, who sells live cattle on a 35-km (22 mile) road in the southeast of the country named after Biden's late son Beau.
    Terstena echoes similar sentiments all over the country of which Washington remains the biggest financial and political supporter. 
Many hope that a Biden administration, which is likely to take more of a multilateral and diplomatic approach aimed at repairing Washington's relationships with its key NATO allies, will actively help Kosovo's bid for a U.N. seat. 
Some analysts, however, warn that expectations may be too high as Serbia's traditional allies Russia and China are also blocking Kosovo's U.N. membership. 
    ""It all depends how much political capital the U.S. could spend in supporting Kosovo taking into consideration all other crisis the US has to deal with,"" said political analyst Agon Maliqi.
    Biden last vistaed Kosovo in 2016 when he was vice president to unveil a memorial of his son Beau who had worked in the country after the 1998-99 war ended, helping train local prosecutors and judges.
    The memorial is in front of the U.S. military base Bondsteel, home to some 700 American soldiers who help maintain the fragile peace in Kosovo.   
    Naming streets after U.S. officials is a tradition in Kosovo. In the capital Pristina, the biggest boulevard is named Bill Clinton and it is linked with a road named after his successor George W. Bush.

    There was even talk of naming a lake after Trump.

The civil lawsuit, which the plaintiffs said they would present to a Rome court in the next few hours, is against Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Health Minister Roberto Speranza and the governor of the northerly Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana.
The spokespeople of all three politicians did not respond to a request for comment.
Italy, the first Western country hit by the coronavirus, has seen almost 70,000 deaths from COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February, the highest toll in Europe and the fifth-highest in the world. The hardest-hit region is Lombardy, where the first COVID-19 patient was detected on Feb. 20.
The lawsuit is being brought by members of a committee called ""Noi Denunceremo"" (we will go to court), set up in April to represent the relatives of people who died in Bergamo, one of Lombardy's worst-affected cities.
""This case is our Christmas gift to those who should have done what they were supposed to do, but didn't,"" the group's president Luca Fusco said in statement.
The committee said when the outbreak erupted in Lombardy local authorities and the central government failed to take rapid action which could have avoided the need for a national lockdown and the economic damage it has brought.
They also decried an alleged lack of preparedness, with neither Rome nor the Lombardy region having an updated plan in place to deal with a possible pandemic.
""The authorities will be asked for an average compensation of 259,000 euros per person for a total outlay of around 100 million euros,"" the group's statement said.
In June, ""Noi Denunceremo"" asked prosecutors in Bergamo to investigate possible criminal responsibility in the management of the pandemic.
Conte was questioned by the prosecutors during the summer as a witness but is not under criminal investigation.

GAZA (Reuters) - A leaked Hamas memo showing Gaza's ruling Islamist group wanted to curb Christmas celebrations among Gaza's Muslim majority has upset the enclave's tiny Christian community in the run-up to the holiday.
The ministry of religious affairs document, dated Dec. 15, called for ""activities by the directorate of preaching and spiritual guidance to limit interaction with Christmas"".
The leak went public last weekend, upsetting Palestinian Christians.
""We set an example for the world in not having any sectarian problems, therefore, we were very upset,"" said Samer Tarazi, a Christian journalist in Gaza. He said Christians just wanted life to continue ""as normal"".
Jerusalem's Greek Orthodox Archbishop, Atallah Hanna, called the memo ""inflammatory"", but said it ""will not harm our unity and good relations"".
Hamas said the reaction was exaggerated and that it only wanted to ensure Muslims marked Christian holidays in accordance with Islamic law.
""There was never any intention to offend Christians or limit their ability to celebrate and perform their religious rituals,"" said Bassem Naim, a Hamas official.
The ministry, which is tasked with running Gaza’s mosques and looking after Muslim and Christian affairs in the coastal strip, quickly released a statement saying Christians ""have the right to hold their religious celebrations and they can't be offended or be restricted"". 
The statement added: ""Just as Muslims are commanded to avoid violations of (Islamic law) on Muslim holidays, it is all the more reason for them to avoid (such violations) during the holidays of others.""
It is rare for religious tensions in Gaza to spill over into the public domain.
While around 1% of the population of the Palestinian Territories as a whole are Christian, the percentage is small in Gaza, where there are around 1,000 mostly Greek Orthodox Christians among nearly 2 million Muslims.
The Christian community was already upset that celebrations will be limited because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Gaza Christians cannot make their usual Christmas trips to Bethlehem this year due to increased COVID-19 travel restrictions imposed by Israel - which has for years imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip citing security concerns about Hamas - and Palestinian curbs on movement to prevent the spread of infection.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel is working towards formalising relations with a fifth Muslim country, possibly in Asia, during U.S. President Donald Trump's term, an Israeli cabinet minister said on Wednesday.
The White House has brokered rapprochements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco this year. Rabat hosted an Israeli-U.S. delegation on Tuesday to flesh out the upgrade in relations.
Asked if a fifth country could sign up before Trump steps down on Jan 20, Regional Cooperation Minister Ofir Akunis told Israel's Ynet TV: ""We are working in that direction.""
""I believe ... there will be an American announcement about another country that is going public with the normalisation of relations with Israel and, in essence, with the infrastructure for an accord - a peace accord,"" he said. 
Administration officials have said they are trying to get more countries to recognise Israel or warm existing ties to it.
Akunis said there were two main candidate countries to become the next to move towards normal ties with Israel. 
He did not name either but said one is in the Gulf and could be Oman but would not be Saudi Arabia. The other, further to the east, is a ""Muslim country that is not small"" but is not Pakistan, Akunis said. 
Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country, said last week it would not recognise Israel as long as Palestinian statehood demands remain unmet. Malaysia has signalled a similar policy.
""Malaysia's firm stance on the Palestinian issue will not change,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Kamarudin Jaffar told the country’s senate on Wednesday, adding that Kuala Lumpur would not interfere in other nations' decisions on Israel.
In Dhaka, a foreign ministry official said Bangladesh was not interested in establishing diplomatic ties with Israel. ""Our position remains the same,"" he told Reuters.
Oman has praised the U.S.-brokered diplomatic drive but has not commented on its own prospects of forging Israel ties.

The Palestinians, whose negotiations with Israel stalled in 2014, fear being sidelined by the normalisation process.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's military on Wednesday named nine soldiers as suspects in the killing in April of two civilians in the country's Papua region, as part of a state probe into violence this year in an area beset by separatist conflict. 
The military is conducting an internal investigation as part of a fact-finding mission that started in October into several incidents in the Intan Jaya district, including the fatal shooting of a Christian pastor in September. 
Lieutenant General Dodik Wijanarko in a statement said the nine soldiers had committed ""acts beyond the limits of propriety"" while interrogating two Papuans suspected of being separatist rebels, who later died. 
The suspects burned their bodies and threw their ashes into a river, according to the military. 
West Papua, the easternmost region of the archipelago nation, has been riven by separatist conflict since the former Dutch colony was incorporated into Indonesia, following a controversial United Nations-backed referendum in 1969.
Dodik said the suspects faced a maximum 12 years in prison if found guilty of violence leading to death, among other violations.
Usman Hamid, director of Amnesty International Indonesia, said the admission by the military that its personnel may have engaged in illegal acts in Papua was rare, although he cast doubt over its sincerity and transparency. 
Colonel Gusti Nyoman Suriastawa, a military spokesman in Papua, said there was ""no tolerance for soldiers who commit these violations"". 
Reuters was unable to immediately reach the victims' families for comment. 
In September, a Christian pastor, Yeremia Zanambani, was fatally shot in the same region. Indonesia's military has denied allegations by church groups that soldiers were responsible.
Mahfud MD, Indonesia's chief security minister, said in October that state forces or ""a third party"" may have been involved.

An immediate appeal by the prosecution was then denied on the same day.
Lai is one of the financial hub's most ardent critics of Beijing, while his Next Media group is considered one of the key remaining bastions of media freedom. He was arrested in August when about 200 police officers raided the newsroom of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid. 
Lai, 73, who had been in custody since Dec. 3, is also charged with fraud related to the lease of a building that houses Apple Daily. 
The security law - which punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail - has been condemned by the West and human rights groups as a tool to crush dissent in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city. 
Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing say the law is necessary to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub last year. 
Under the new law, the onus is on the defendant to prove they would not be a national security threat if released on bail. Under Hong Kong's common law-based legal system, the onus has traditionally been on the prosecution to prove its case.
Under his bail terms, Lai is not allowed to meet with foreign officials, give any interviews, publish any articles or post on social media, and will have to remain at home and surrender his travel documents. 
The tycoon has been a frequent visitor to Washington, meeting with officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor"".

DOVER, England (Reuters) - Truck drivers trapped along hundreds of miles of roads near the southern English port of Dover (NYSE:DOV) are facing a riddle: to travel to France they must have a COVID-19 test but they say there are no tests to be had. 
After turning parts of southern England into a vast truck parking lot by closing the border to incoming freight, France opened its border on Wednesday to truckers who have a negative COVID test that is less than 72 hours old.
On the ground at the port of Dover - for centuries one of the main arteries for trade with the rest of Europe - there was little sign of any tests - or much other support for stranded drivers. 
""They talk about some COVID test but there are no COVID tests,"" Blazej Pankiewicz, a trucker from Torun, Poland, told Reuters in Dover surrounded by angry drivers.
Pankiewicz said he was extremely sad to be missing Christmas back home with his family which had already gathered. 
Britain said it would hand out tests to some of the 8,000-10,000 truckers stranded in the area and that it would take time to roll out. A testing unit was supposed to be on its way to the port, according to local officials.
Truck drivers scuffled with police and sounded their horns in protest around Dover. Many have been eating through their last provisions on the side of the road while families gather for Christmas thousands of miles away. 
In interviews with Reuters, truckers repeatedly expressed anger at their fate, a lack of support and absence of information. 
Many suspect European leaders are playing politics over Brexit by closing the border to send a message to Prime Minister Boris Johnson about just how disruptive failure to secure a trade deal by Dec. 31 could be.
""They asked for a PCR COVID-19 test and we don't have anywhere to do that,"" Stella Vradzheva, a van driver from Strelcha in Bulgaria, told Reuters. ""The roads are closed so if we go we can't come back so we are stuck here.""
Vradzheva said that she and others in her van had been waiting for three days and had been given only some bottled water and a pack of crisps.

The ministry responded to a report by the Dutch veteran, who said he had been ordered to fire heavy artillery at a cluster of houses in the Chora valley because his superiors suspected a Taliban presence there.
In an interview with Dutch newspaper Trouw, published on Wednesday, the veteran said the action was based only on intercepted radio communications and that the people who were fired on during the attack did not shoot back.
This would appear to be in violation of the Dutch army's rules of engagement in Afghanistan, under which force can be used only in self-defence.
The ministry said in a statement that it took the report very seriously and was looking into every known violent incident in Uruzgan at the time. It also said it was considering improvements in the ways veterans can report incidents.
The investigation follows a report published in Australia last month which found Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said last month he had seen no indication that Dutch soldiers had also committed such crimes, but the Defence Ministry has started an investigation similar to the one in Australia to check this.
Dutch prosecutors could not be reached for comment on Wednesday morning.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - When lawyer Shadrack Wambui was growing up in one of Nairobi's slums, he vented his frustration at abusive police through boxing, cultivating discipline that helped him avoid confrontations that could have derailed his studies. 
Now the 29-year-old is turning to the sport again to help young people in poor Nairobi neighbourhoods, combining his passion for the sport with informal lessons on the law and legal clinics to resolve marital disputes.
Wambui says he hopes his boxing sessions will help young people believe in themselves despite the challenges they face.
""We want to use boxing to advance other causes in our society, to help these young men channel their energies somewhere else so as to avoid criminal temptations,"" he said at a training session in the Kayole slum. 
After he was admitted to the Kenyan bar in 2018, Wambui convinced 50 young lawyers to join him in devoting part of their time to pro bono work in the slums and has now registered ""Sheria Mtaani"", which means ""Law in the Streets"" in KiSwahili. 
In a community hall, Wambui cracked jokes with young men in Sheng, a local slang that mixes KiSwahili and English. 
The men listened attentively as he helped them hone their punching techniques, mixing in information on their rights with instructions on what to do if a policeman asks for a bribe: stay calm and call him.
""He advises us not to be rude to the police,"" said Gilbert Omondi, 27.
""We look up to him and I want to succeed in life just like he has,"" said Newton Mwatabu, 22. ""He advises us on how to avoid misconduct and avoid going against the law.""
Demands from police for bribes and more serious offences by officers such as assaults or killings are common in Nairobi’s slums and despite a government watchdog dedicated to investigating alleged abuses, victims almost never get justice, a Reuters investigation https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-police-watchdog-specialreport-idUSKCN1G7178 published in 2018 found. 
Rights groups have made similar allegations since, including about incidents during coronavirus curfews, for which President Uhuru Kenyatta apologised.
Kenyan police spokesman Charles Owino said the police’s internal affairs unit and the government’s watchdog, known as IPOA, thoroughly investigate all complaints from citizens. 

""If anybody has grievances against Kenyan police, they should report the matter to the two institutions for help,"" he said.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - In a year marked by setbacks for West African democracy, Niger is poised to hold an election on Sunday that will lead to the country's first transition of power between two freely elected presidents.
President Mahamadou Issoufou is stepping aside after two five-year terms, in contrast to leaders in Ivory Coast and Guinea who used constitutional changes to extend their tenures to three terms.
That represents a milestone for Niger, which has experienced four coups since gaining independence from France in 1960. The practical significance, however, is less clear. Mohamed Bazoum, Issoufou's handpicked successor and the favourite in the race, is campaigning on a message of near-total continuity.
The 60-year-old former interior minister has vowed to continue Issoufou's policies for combating Islamist violence and tackling poverty. His policy platform, dubbed Renaissance 3, is named after Issoufou's Renaissance 1 and Renaissance 2 governing agendas. Bazoum's campaign manager is Issoufou's son. 
""We are going to consolidate the gains of the past 10 years,"" Bazoum said on the campaign trail. ""We are going to continue in the direction set by President Mahamadou Issoufou."" 
The new president will inherit a security crisis. Twice the size of France, Niger touches two of Africa's bloodiest conflicts - one near its western border with Mali and Burkina, where jihadists linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are active, and another near its southeastern border with Nigeria, where Boko Haram operates. 
In the past year alone, hundreds of Nigerien soldiers and civilians have been killed in attacks. The latest, blamed on Boko Haram, killed 28 people on Dec. 12. 
Pervasive corruption has undermined the fight. A government audit this year found almost 40% of the $312 million Niger spent on defence contracts in the past three years was lost through inflated costs or materiel that was not delivered.
The economy will be another challenge. More than 40% of the population lived in extreme poverty in 2019, according to the World Bank. The COVID-19 pandemic, low prices for top export uranium and the impact of climate change have all further hit the economy this year.
Bazoum will face 29 other candidates, including Mahamane Ousmame, who was president from 1993-1996, and Seini Oumarou, a former prime minister. The runner-up in the last election, Hama Amadou, is barred from running because of a criminal conviction. 
Only Bazoum has waged much of a campaign so far, owing to the ruling party's vast financial advantages. The election will go to a second round if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote. 

""We think a transfer of power is a good thing, but if Bazoum is elected, he will need to combat many ills, including corruption and the politicization of the civil service,"" said Bibata Garba, a nurse in the capital Niamey.

PARIS (Reuters) -Three French police officers were shot dead by a man when they arrived at a home in Saint-Just, a remote commune in central France, to respond to a domestic violence call, police said on Wednesday.
A woman who was the reported victim of the domestic violence had sought refuge on the roof of the house and was subsequently rescued by police, France's BFMTV broadcaster reported.
The house caught fire, and the suspected gunman was later found dead in his car, police said. The incident took place in a small hamlet in Saint-Just, about 500 km (310 miles) south-east of Paris.
It was not immediately clear how he died or where the car was located. Police had previously said the man was armed and they were trying to track him down.
The three gendarme officers killed in the incident were aged 21, 37, and 45, the interior ministry said in a statement. A fourth officer was wounded and his injuries were not life-threatening, it said.
French President Emmanuel Macron offered condolences to the families of the dead officers. 
""To protect us, our forces act putting their lives at risk. They are our heroes,"" Macron wrote on Twitter. 
Officials did not comment on the motive. France's interior minister described the attacker as a ""maniac."" 
The suspected gunman was 48 and was known to law enforcement because of at least one past judicial case involving non-payment of child maintenance, according to an official in the prosecutor's office in the nearby city of Clermont-Ferrand. 
The officers from the local gendarme police service, who were responding to a call about domestic violence, arrived at the house in the hamlet early in the morning, before daylight.
When the officers arrived, a man starting shooting at them before setting the house on fire, according to BFMTV. The house was burned to the ground, it said.
After the shootings, police commanders sent in a rapid-response unit, deployed reinforcements to seal off the area, and launched a manhunt for the suspected attacker.
""The maniac has been found dead,"" Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin wrote on Twitter on Wednesday morning, adding he was heading to the scene of the attack.

842,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 05:06AM ET</span>",Explainer-Why can't Israel keep a government together?,"By Stephen Farrell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - For the fourth time in two years, Israelis head to elections amid unprecedented political deadlock.
The coalitions change but one constant remains: debate about whether Israel should continue to be led by Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for nearly a fifth of the country's 72-year-history.
The veteran right-winger universally known as ""Bibi"" is the dominant political figure of his generation. So why is he unable to hold a government together?
BUDGET
The immediate cause was arguments over the budget - failure to pass a fiscal package by midnight on Tuesday automatically forced a poll, to be held on March 23.
A budget was key to implementing a deal in which Netanyahu, 71, was to have handed power in November to his main rival, centrist former general Benny Gantz, switching places as ""alternate prime minister.""
WEAK COALITION
Gantz went from opposition leader to Netanyahu coalition partner after agreeing to form a unity government last May. He argued a power-sharing deal was in the national interest after three inconclusive elections had left the country paralysed.
But Gantz's followers were furious, his party split and Netanyahu believed his Likud Party would benefit, picking up seats.
Instead, Netanyahu's own party suffered a defection earlier this month. Gideon Saar, 52, shares many of Netanyahu's right- wing views but said Likud had become a ""personality cult.""
An opinion poll on Israel's Kan public TV on Tuesday showed Saar was drawing even with Netanyahu in popularity ratings. 
""CRIME MINISTER""
In May, Netanyahu became the first serving Israeli prime minister to go on trial, appearing in court on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
The indictment alleges that he received gifts from millionaire friends and sought regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage. 
Netanyahu denies all wrongdoing and his Likud Party faithful have stayed loyal, accepting his claim to be the victim of a political witch hunt.
But he faces a series of hearings in the New Year, and protesters have refused to let the issue fade away, staging demonstrations outside his Jerusalem residence with banners saying ""Crime Minister"".
Critics believe Netanyahu only agreed to the deal with Gantz because he hoped the ""alternate"" premiership would stop him having to resign under rules that allow a prime minister to remain in office even if charged with a crime.
COVID-19
Although Netanyahu gained plaudits for his early handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the spring and has secured vaccinations for Israelis, public anger has flared amid a series of national lockdowns and economic hardship for business owners.

Critics accused him of being distracted by less pressing issues, such as legal manoeuvering, and pleasing his right-wing base with promises to annex the occupied West Bank.

Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has held a chokehold on power since 2010, faces his toughest election in 2022 as the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects linger and as opposition parties grouped together against him.
Fidesz has been embroiled in conflicts at home and in the European Union as the premier vetoed the 27-nation bloc's 1.85 trillion euro ($2.25 trln) budget and recovery package, ignoring criticism from his domestic opposition.
Fidesz also suffered as it was hit by a major scandal with a senior EU lawmaker resigning after he fled a Brussels orgy in violation of lockdown rules and in possession of illegal drugs, according to Belgian authorities.
Following months of talks, six major Hungarian opposition parties agreed on Sunday to hold primary elections for the first time in a national vote and challenge Fidesz one-on-one in all voters districts, behind a single leader and a single programme.
Their cumulative support has grown to 35% of all voters in the December 8-15 poll from 32 percent in November, Republikon found, while Fidesz slipped to 30% from 32%.
Other pollsters have measure similar trends. Fidesz support fell by 6 percentage points in a single month to 34% in December, Median said last week, while the opposition added 2 percentage points and took over Fidesz at 36%.
Zavecz Research also said earlier this month that Fidesz support fell to 30% among all voters while the opposition had the backing of 34%.
Even pro-government pollster Nezopont said last week that while support for Fidesz was at 42% of all voters, up from 40% in its last public poll in July, the opposition narrowed the gap to score 40%, up from 31% in July.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 23, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>","Senators Cruz, Rubio warn Pacific ally on Chinese bid for undersea cable project - letter","By Jonathan Barrett
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. lawmakers warned a Pacific ally that China risked undermining the security of a sensitive undersea cable project if a cut-price, state-backed bid wins a tender process overseen by development agencies, a letter reviewed by Reuters shows.
In the letter, dated Sept. 18, Republican senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio told the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) that China could leverage its way into the project to wage ""campaigns of espionage and geopolitical coercion"". Beijing recently imposed symbolic sanctions on both Cruz and Rubio. 
Reuters reported last week that Huawei Marine, recently divested from Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and now majority-owned by another Chinese firm, submitted bids priced at more than 20% lower than two rivals for the $72.6 million project funded by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Washington has pressed governments around the world to squeeze Huawei Technologies Co Ltd out of supplying critical infrastructure, alleging the company would hand over data to the Chinese government for spying, a charge consistently denied by the company.
The cable project is designed to improve communications to the remote Pacific island nations of FSM, Nauru and Kiribati, although it has reached an impasse at the bid assessment stage, two sources with direct knowledge of the project details told Reuters. All parties involved have input on the selection of the tender winner. 
The people with knowledge of the situation declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the project. 
Following Reuters' report last week, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said that the United States was smearing Chinese companies.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to additional questions for comment on Wednesday.
Huawei Marine and its new majority owner, Shanghai-listed Hengtong Optic-Electric Co Ltd, did not respond to Reuters' questions. Huawei Tech. Investment Co retains a small stake in Huawei Marine, company filings show.
GRAPHIC: Map of Submarine cables in the Pacific https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-PACIFIC/dgkvlqbmmpb/SUBMARINE-CABLES.jpg 
The interjection by Cruz and Rubio builds on earlier communiques sent to Pacific nations by U.S. embassies warning against awarding Huawei Marine the contract.
Signed by Cruz and Rubio, the letter said that awarding Huawei Marine the contract would ""deeply complicate relations between our countries and hinder the ability of U.S. diplomats and personnel to interact with your government"".
""The Chinese Communist Party subsidizes companies such as Huawei to ensure they are able to undercut all competitors, and then uses infrastructure installed by those companies to advance the CCP's campaigns of espionage and geopolitical coercion,"" the letter said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
Cruz's office did not respond to questions. Rubio's office could not be immediately reached for comment outside business hours.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement to Reuters that Huawei and its current and former subsidiaries, including Huawei Marine, posed ""economic and national security risks"".
Under the Compact of Free Association, a decades-old agreement between the United States and its former Pacific trust territories, Washington is responsible for FSM's defence.
FSM said in a statement that the procurement process was a ""complicated endeavour"" involving the cooperation of the three Pacific nations and two development agencies.
The Nauru government, a Pacific ally to Taiwan, which is viewed by China as a wayward province, was the first to raise concerns about Huawei Marine's bids, the two sources said.
The Nauru government said in a statement the bid process was confidential. The Kiribati government, which last year severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China, did not respond to questions.
A World Bank spokesman said the tender for the ""complex, multi-country project"" was ongoing and could not provide specific comments on the process. The ADB referred questions to the World Bank.
The cable project, which offers far greater data capacity than satellites, is particularly sensitive because it is designed to connect to the HANTRU-1 undersea cable, which is primarily used by the U.S. government and lands at Guam, a U.S. territory with substantial military assets.
Rival bidder Alcatel Submarine Networks, part of Finland's Nokia (NYSE:NOK), said in a statement it was ready to start the project if selected. The third bidder, Japan's NEC, did not provide information on its proposal.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -An Australian writer detained in Beijing on spying allegations has told his readers to ""pursue democracy, rule of law and freedom"" in a Christmas message from prison that said 300 interrogations had not yielded any evidence.
Pro-democracy blogger Yang Hengjun, who is facing trial on espionage charges that he denies, has been unable to receive visits from his wife or family since he was arrested in January 2019 after he arrived at Guangzhou airport from New York. 
Yang said in his message that after ""torture, more than 300 interrogations and a lot of verbal abuse, I am now in a place of deeper retrospective and introspective meditation"", according to his former teacher, Feng Chongyi, who is based in Sydney. 
Feng also confirmed the authenticity of the message to Reuters.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was a country with the rule of law and the case was being handled independently by judicial bodies.
""All of Yang Hengjun's lawful rights have been fully guaranteed, and there is no so-called torture or abuse,"" he told reporters. 
Yang, 55, had revealed in a 2011 letter to Feng that he had previously worked for China's state security agency for a decade in Hong Kong and Washington, and left the service before moving to Australia in 1999. 
He later wrote spy novels that were published in Taiwan, and amassed a large online following in China as a democracy blogger, before moving to New York.
He had denied revealing any state secrets in his novels during an earlier, brief detention in 2011 on suspicion of involvement in the Jasmine Revolution democracy protests.
Australian diplomats visited Yang on Dec. 17, one of the few visits permitted by Chinese authorities this year.
Yang's trial, which had been due to proceed by January, has been delayed by three months.
In the message, Yang said he was ""waiting for court"", and still had ""some confidence in the court"". 
""Whether or not they judge me guilty will say a lot about whether the court is governed by rule of law or by pure absolute power,"" he said in the message.
""I have strong faith in humanity, in righteousness, justice and God.""
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last year it was ""absolutely untrue"" Yang had acted as a spy for Australia.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in October that Yang's treatment in detention, with no family visits and limited legal representation, was not compatible with international norms. 
Diplomatic relations between major trading partners Australia and China have worsened this year after Canberra called for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, and Beijing imposed a series of trade reprisals.

Sturgeon, the leader of the nationalist Scottish National Party, was pictured talking to a group of women in a pub following a funeral in Edinburgh last week without a face covering. The photo was published in Wednesday's Scottish edition of the Sun newspaper.
""Last Friday, while attending a funeral wake, I had my mask off briefly. This was a stupid mistake and I'm really sorry,"" Sturgeon said in a statement.
""I talk every day about the importance of masks, so I’m not going to offer any excuses. I was in the wrong, I’m kicking myself, and I'm sorry.""
Under the law in Scotland, people are required to wear masks in most indoor venues including pubs and restaurants and on Tuesday Sturgeon reminded the public of the importance of wearing masks when she spoke to the Scottish parliament.
The Scottish Conservatives, Scotland's arm of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ruling party, said Sturgeon should have known better and she had undermined the public health message.
""There cannot be one rule for Nicola Sturgeon and another for everyone else,"" the Scottish Conservatives said on Twitter.
However, British housing minister Robert Jenrick was more forgiving.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Wednesday sentenced the wife of a former justice minister to four years in prison and nearly half a million dollars in fines in a family investment and university admissions case that led to her husband's resignation last year.
The Seoul Central District Court ruled that Chung Kyung-shim should face prison time and pay a fine of 500 million won ($451,000), a court spokesperson said.
She was accused of fabricating documents to help her daughter get into medical school, as well as various charges related to family investments and a consulting contract.
Chung has denied the charges and the sentence can be appealed. Calls to her lawyer's office were not answered.
Her husband, Cho Kuk, was a former close aide to President Moon Jae-in. The scandal forced Cho to resign his position as justice minister after just one month in office, and he too faces criminal charges related to the case.

Cho's resignation and indictment were a spectacular downfall for the former star legal scholar known for progressive thinking who was one of Moon's closest political allies and viewed by some as a potential presidential successor.

BANGASSOU, Central African Republic (Reuters) - Ismail Dicky says he is afraid of political tensions and violence ahead of Sunday's general election in Central African Republic (CAR), a sentiment that reflects the anxious mood of a country desperate for an end to years of bloodshed.
Rwanda and Russia have sent military aid to help the government restore calm, as security forces and United Nations peacekeepers battle rebels who have occupied towns and roads outside the capital Bangui.
Russia, seeking to increase its influence in Africa, is an ally of President Faustin-Archange Touadera, a relationship often seen as a threat to the influence of former colonial power France in the French-speaking country.
""We are scared of the elections,"" said Dicky, who lives in Bangassou, a town marked by a brutal mass killing in 2017.
""We want peace. We want security,"" said Dicky, in his late 20s, adding the country cannot afford more of the tit-for-tat ethnic and religious violence that has plagued it since 2013.
In some of the worst bloodshed, mostly Christian and animist militia known as the Anti-Balaka attacked Bangassou in May 2017. 
During a three-day siege, they assaulted the town's Muslims, who sought refuge in the mosque. The Muslims were held hostage under heavy gunfire until the intervention of U.N. peacekeepers. The Red Cross counted at least 140 dead when the siege ended.
Walking around the ruins of what was once the mosque, Dicky pointed to heaps of rubble where women of the town used to pray. The men's section was also destroyed.
""We lost our parents, our belongings, our homes,"" he said. 
FIVE COUPS, NUMEROUS REBELLIONS 
Central African Republic, rich in diamonds, timber and gold, has been racked by five coups and numerous rebellions since independence from France in 1960.
Slightly larger than France, but with a population of only about five million, it has been gripped by insecurity since the 2013 ousting of then-President Francois Bozize by mainly Muslim Seleka fighters.
Heavy-handed rule and alleged human rights abuses by the Seleka government prompted reprisal killings from Anti-Balaka militias drawn from the Christian minority.
The country has failed to stabilise, despite the signing of several peace deals between warring militias, the election of Touadera in 2015, and the presence of over 12,800 uniformed U.N. peacekeepers.
Touadera, seeking another mandate, is favourite to win the presidential election in a field of 17 candidates. Electors will also vote for a new parliament.
The latest crisis flared after the country's top court rejected several candidacies for the election, including that of former president Bozize. The government has accused Bozize of plotting a coup with several militia groups, an accusation Bozize's party has denied.
Some opposition parties have called for the election to be postponed due to the latest violence. This has been rejected by the government, and also by the United Nations, which has placed its troops in the capital and other regions on high alert and has promised to protect civilians and secure the vote.
But for another Bangassou resident, Ali Idriss, the insecurity was worrying.
""We are not safe because we know that yesterday's perpetrators are still strong. They're there in the neighbourhoods, they're bragging, they're still destroying our buildings under construction, it's scary,"" he said. 

""You meet the former executioners regularly. Yes, we are together,"" he laughs nervously.

Reuters reported last week that 27-year-old Nepali worker Yubaraj Khadka was fired after raising concerns about the lack of social distancing at the factories.
Khadka took two photos in May of fellow employees crowding into a Top Glove factory, which he shared with a worker rights activist.

Lee said Khadka did not give the company feedback on the working conditions, but it has since improved its processes. 
""We actually spoke to him and he admitted his intention was to pass the photo to someone so that basically that someone will use it to discredit Top Glove,"" he said. 
Top Glove became the site of Malaysia's biggest virus cluster this month after more than 5,000 workers were infected, while two other glove manufacturers have also reported outbreaks.

Germany finishes a two-year term on the 15-member council at the end of this month and Ambassador Christoph Heusgen plans to retire after more than 40 years as a diplomat. 
""Let me end my tenure on the Security Council by appealing to my Chinese colleagues to ask Beijing for the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. Christmas is the right moment for such a gesture,"" Heusgen told the council session, whose official agenda topic was Iran. 
Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who was working as an adviser for the International Crisis Group think tank, and businessman Spavor were detained by Beijing in 2018 shortly after Canadian police picked up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.
China's deputy U.N. ambassador, Geng Shuang, accused Heusgen of abusing the Security Council to launch ""malicious"" attacks on other members ""in an attempt to poison the working atmosphere"".
""I wish to say something out of the bottom of my heart: Good riddance, Ambassador Heusgen,"" Geng said. ""I am hoping that the council in your absence in the year 2021 will be in a better position to fulfil the responsibilities...for maintaining international peace and security.""
Heusgen also used the Security Council meeting to advise Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador, Dmitry Polyanskiy, to read certain articles about Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who said he had tricked a Russian secret agent into disclosing details of a botched plot to kill him.

Many of them construction labourers or farmers, they wear knee-high rubber boots, down jackets, thick gloves and hats with flaps to protect their ears from the frigid air.

""We come to mine ice at 6 a.m. every day,"" said Zhang Wei, 40. ""We need to work overtime sometimes, until 8 or 9 p.m., even late after midnight.""
Lunch is brief - a bowl of piping-hot noodles, dumplings or steamed buns. Makeshift canteens built with wooden poles and see-through sheets offer a little warmth. 
Every day since early December, tens of thousands of ice blocks have been prised out of the river and moved by truck to the venue of Harbin's annual winter festival, where they are used to build life-sized castles, pagodas, bridges and even a functioning hotpot restaurant. 
Ice from the river is essential. 
""Artificial ice isn't that thick, and isn't strong enough to stand in the wind,"" said Wang Qiusheng, who has been carving ice for the festival for 20 years. 
Organisers are racing to complete the sculptures at the festival venue - a busy scene of forklifts, cranes and scaffolding. 
The ice blocks are painstakingly laid on top of one another while workers shape, trim and cut them to size with chainsaws, pickle forks and tooth chisels. 
The 37th Harbin International Ice Snow Festival is due to begin on Jan. 5, and will feature skiing, sledding, mass weddings, winter swimming and a theme park of ice sculptures bathed by coloured lights.

With China's international borders heavily restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic, domestic tourists are expected to account for the bulk of visitors marvelling at the ice sculptures next month in temperatures below minus 35 Celsius (minus 31 Fahrenheit).

The new laws follow sweeping reforms of Russia's political system initiated by Putin this year. Among other things, these allow him to run for two more six-year terms in the Kremlin if he chooses. He would otherwise have had to step down in 2024. 
The reforms are being parsed for clues as to what Putin, 68, may do at the end of his current term, which is his second consecutive term and his fourth overall. 
Former presidents were already entitled to immunity from prosecution for crimes committed while in office, but the new law grants them lifelong immunity and says they cannot be arrested, searched, questioned or prosecuted.
The new legislation also makes it harder to revoke a former president's immunity.
Among other things, the process involves the upper house of parliament voting overwhelmingly to revoke it on the strength of accusations by the lower house that the president has committed treason or another serious crime.

The other laws signed by Putin allow presidents to name up to 30 senators to the Federation Council, Russia's upper house, and to join the Council themselves once they have left office.

KAHALEH, Lebanon (Reuters) - When Joe Bejjany was shot with a silencer as he got ready to take his two daughters to pre-school, it shocked not only his mountain village but a country already on edge.
No clear motive has so far surfaced for the murder of the 36-year-old Lebanese telecoms employee and freelance photographer on Monday. But that did not stop local media and people wondering aloud whether it was linked to an ongoing investigation into August's devastating blast at Beirut port.
Residents of Kahaleh, some 13 km (8 miles) from Beirut, say they want a swift investigation into what they believe was a planned operation of some kind or another.
""This is not just about our village. Because today it's Joe, tomorrow it's someone else,"" said Jean Bejjany, the head of the municipal council and a distant relative. ""Are we going to have to protect our own houses and villages?""
A number of recent murky deaths have fuelled similar rumours of links to the explosion, even as security officials say they have no evidence of a connection.
Nearly five months since the huge stockpile of chemicals, stored unsafely for years, detonated at the port, that inquiry has yet to yield public results. The blast killed 200 people and ravaged swathes of the capital, compounding a financial meltdown that has also triggered generalised fears over security.
Earlier this month, authorities pledged to probe the death of a retired customs officer who was found dead in his home.
Jean, Kahaleh's municipal chief, said none of Joe's friends or family were aware of any threats or enemies and made no mention of anything that might link him to the explosion.
The two hooded gunmen took Joe's phone before sneaking away, he said. His daughters, aged two and four, found the dead body in the car minutes later.
Mounir Bejjany, Joe's godfather, described it as ""an assassination"".
Relatives said Joe, who worked at a mobile service provider, had also photographed military events such as parades as a freelancer. Other photographers said they often saw him at such events.
Two security sources said the murder was carried out in a professional manner but the motive was unclear. The caretaker interior minister has vowed to find the culprits. 
At the funeral on Tuesday, neighbours wept and threw rice as men in suits carried a white coffin to the church.

Joe's cousin, Gaby Feghali, said he had planned to emigrate with his family, like many others who are leaving Lebanon to escape the crisis. He said Joe got approval to leave for Canada about a week ago.

MILAN (Reuters) - An investigation into a data theft at Leonardo has found that a hacker working inside the Italian defence group appeared to target details of Europe's biggest unmanned fighter jet programme and aircraft used by the military and police, an arrest warrant shows.
The inquiry, which is ongoing, was undertaken by Italian police's cybercrime divisions in Rome and Naples and Naples prosecutors. It began in January 2017 when Leonardo told police of an abnormal outflow of data from some of its computers.
Details of the parts of Leonardo's business that the hacker allegedly targeted have not been reported before.
The warrant does not say whether the hacker was acting independently or at the behest of others, or the goal of the alleged activity.
In the 108-page warrant seen by Reuters, the judge leadingthe preliminary inquiry cites evidence that one of the computerswhich was hacked belonged to a Leonardo technician who worked on the electronic system of the nEUROn, an experimental unmanned military aircraft which was designed in 2012 under a European defence programme led by France.
Other computers belonged to Leonardo workers involved in theproduction of C27J military transport aircraft and ATR commercial and military turbo-prop planes used by Italy's taxpolice and coastguard, the November-dated document said.
Asked about the details in the court document, Leonardo repeated that classified, strategic information was notheld on the computers that were violated. Leonardo does notstore top secret military data at the group's plant in Pomigliano d'Arco, near Naples.
Leonardo said on Dec. 5 that it was the injured party andthat it had first reported the hacking, adding it would continueto cooperate fully with the police.
Data security is critical for the reputation of Leonardo, which as well as offering its own cybersecurity services, is involved in several European defence programmes to produce military aircraft and equipment, defence sector analysts say.
Italian police said on Dec. 5 that at least 10 gigabytes ofconfidential data was stolen from Leonardo between 2015 and 2017through a malware installed on targeted machines.
The police also said on Dec. 5 they had arrested Arturo D'Elia and Antonio Rossi who had both worked at Leonardo, over their alleged role in hacking 94 computers, 33 of which were located at the group's Pomigliano plant.
D'Elia is accused of having installed the malware on thecomputers to steal the data, while Rossi is accused of trying tothrow the subsequent inquiry off track.
In the arrest warrant for preliminary investigations against the two men, the judge cited several possible reasons behind the hacking.
These included ""the use of data for industrial andcommercial purposes, blackmail and military espionage activitiesor simply the intention to damage the image of the company bydemonstrating ... its organisational and IT vulnerability.""
D'Elia did not have any ""intent to spy"", his lawyer, Nicola Naponiello, told Reuters, adding that the aim of the hack was ""to show off his skills"" and that D'Elia would cooperate with police to allow them inspect his hard disks and laptops.
A lawyer for Rossi said he had nothing to do with D'Elia, adding also that his client, who is currently under house arrest, had not damaged or destroyed any evidence of the crime.
Italy's Review Court on Friday rejected appeals by lawyersfor D'Elia and Rossi against their arrests. The two men havenot been charged.
The investigation was complicated because the two men hadcovered up their actions, the document said.
D'Elia, who at the time of the alleged crime was aconsultant for a small IT company called Open eSSe, was sent to Pomigliano as an ""incident handler"" to help police at the endof 2017 while working with Leonardo's cybersecurity team.
This gave D'Elia the opportunity ""to alter and conceal directly the evidence and traces of the crimes he had committed on the affected computers"", the arrest warrant said.
Open eSSe did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.

Rossi, who served as head of Leonardo's Cyber EmergencyReadiness Team, is alleged to have covered up the crime byfailing to report the real quantity and importance of the stolendata. He is also accused of reformatting a computer containingevidence and data from the cyber-attack.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is likely to approve Oxford/AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine for emergency use by next week after its local manufacturer submitted additional data sought by authorities, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
This could be the first country to give the regulatory green light for the British drugmaker's vaccine as the British medicine regulator continues to examine data from the trials.
India, the world's biggest vaccine-making country, wants to start inoculating its citizens next month and is also considering emergency use authorisation applications for vaccines made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and local company Bharat Biotech.
Getting vaccines to the world's second-most populous country with one of the highest infection rates will also be a big step in the battle against the pandemic.
The AstraZeneca-Oxford shot is considered vital for lower-income countries and those in hot climates because it is cheaper, easier to transport and can be stored for long periods at normal fridge temperatures.
India's Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) first reviewed the three applications on Dec. 9 https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/system/modules/CDSCO.WEB/elements/common_download.jsp?num_id_pk=MTI3NQ== and sought more information from all the companies, including from Serum Institute of India (SII), which is making the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) shots.
SII, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, has now provided all the data, the two sources said. The authorities were still waiting for more details from Pfizer, a government health adviser told https://in.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-india-cases/india-to-track-down-arrivals-from-britain-to-try-to-stop-new-virus-strain-idINKBN28W0DC?il=0 a news briefing on Tuesday, while one of the sources said additional information was expected from Bharat Biotech.
Both sources said Indian health officials were in direct contact with their British counterparts over the AstraZeneca shot and that there were ""strong indications"" an approval would come by next week.
The expected approval comes after data from AstraZeneca's late-stage trials in the UK and Brazil released earlier this month showed the vaccine had efficacy of 62% for trial participants given two full doses, but 90% for a smaller sub-group given a half, then a full dose.
The Indian regulator is only considering the two full-dose regimen of the shot despite it showing a lower success rate, the sources said.
""Serum is ready,"" said one of the sources. ""Initially, we may get around 50 million to 60 million doses.""
The sources declined to be named as deliberations were ongoing and the timeline could change.
CDSCO chief V.G. Somani did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bharat Biotech and Pfizer declined to comment, while SII did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

India has not yet signed a vaccine supply deal with any company, but SII has already stockpiled more than 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot and plans to make a total of 400 million doses by July.

Livatino, who was a devout Roman Catholic, was gunned down after a Mafia hit squad ran his car off the road as he was driving on a Sicilian highway.
Known as the ""boy judge"" because he looked younger than his 37 years, Livatino had led many investigations into the mob at a time when Sicilian clans were involved in a full-blown war.
The decree of martyrdom proposed by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints and approved by the pope means there is no need for a miracle to be attributed to Livatino's intercession with God for him to be beatified. 
A miracle would have to be attributed to Livatino in order for him to be declared a saint.

The Roman Catholic Church teaches that only God performs miracles, but that saints who are believed to be with God in heaven intercede on behalf of people who pray to them. A miracle is usually the medically inexplicable healing of a person.

By Ben Makori and Gerhard Mey
DOVER, England (Reuters) - Dan Jinca, a Romanian truck driver stranded in England after much of the world shut its borders to Britain, is angry, and he is not alone.
The 47-year-old will miss Christmas at home and he thinks the official excuse for the border closures - a new variant of the novel coronavirus spreading fast across southern England - is nonsense.
""We are upset and we don't know why we have to be in this situation,"" Jinca told Reuters, speaking English. ""They say it is about corona. We don't know. We think ... it is bullshit, big, big bullshit.""
Hundreds of trucks are lined up, snaking into the horizon across southern England after the border closures. Many drivers have been stuck for days, eating up their reserves of food along roads that now stand silent.
No matter what is decided in London, Paris and Brussels, Jinca, a father, will miss Christmas at home in Bumbești-Jiu, about 186 miles (300 km) west of Bucharest, because he has too far to drive.
""Now it is done, it is finished. From here to go home we have about 2,000 miles,"" he said. ""It is about 45 hours to drive non-stop - no sleep, just drive. We can't make it.""
After 7 years in trucking, it has never happened to him before.
Sergio Robles, a 41-year-old Spanish truck driver, said the conditions - stuck on a road in December for three days and counting - were a disgrace.
And he wants a solution - and information - fast.
""They don't give us food, they don't give us drinks, they don't give us sanitation, they don't offer us anything,"" he said in Spanish. ""The situation is basically inhumane, so what we are asking for is a solution.""
""I think and believe that this happening now isn't due to coronavirus or anything, it's due to Brexit, due to internal politics or something of that manner.""
Robles will also miss Christmas with his family in Madrid. 
""We are the transport that moves the world, so to say. And they treat us badly,"" he said. 

""They treat us as if we are garbage. We don't get to spend Christmas at home, not with family or children or anything. I think there's nothing right in all of this.""

Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, who had angered Lukashenko by defending the rights of anti-government protesters, was barred from entry in August as he tried to come home from a ceremony in neighbouring Poland.
Mass protests demanding Lukashenko leave power erupted after an Aug. 9 presidential election and are still being staged weekly, though their size has diminished amid a crackdown. 
A special envoy from Pope Francis met Lukashenko last week. Vatican diplomats have been working for nearly five months to persuade Lukashenko to allow Kondrusiewicz to return, and a senior Vatican source said the Holy See was trying to get him back in time for Christmas.
Foreign Minister Vladimir Makey said Lukashenko was responding to an appeal made in a letter handed to him by the special envoy. 
""Out of deep respect for the Pope and their good relations, (Lukashenko) considered it possible to grant the Pope's request and to give the appropriate instruction to find a solution,"" Makey said in comments published on the ministry's website.

RABAT (Reuters) - Israeli envoys arrived in Morocco on Tuesday to meet its king and hammer out an upgrade of ties that was forged by the White House in a parting foreign policy push by U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Led by National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat, the Israeli delegation was accompanied by Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and architect of pan-Arab rapprochement with Israel.
They took El Al Israel Airlines in the first direct flight by a commercial plane from Tel Aviv to Rabat. Both countries anticipate a surge in tourism aboard such connections, mainly among the hundreds of thousands of Israelis of Moroccan descent.
Morocco followed the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan in moving toward normal relations with Israel. Palestinians have censured the U.S.-brokered deals, seeing a betrayal of a long-standing demand that Israel first meet their statehood goals. 
As the Trump administration has sought to isolate Iran, the deals have been sweetened with promises of business opportunities or economic aid. Israel's new partners have also enjoyed bilateral benefits from Washington - in Rabat's case, U.S. recognition of its sovereignty over the Western Sahara.
""This type of agreement (with Israel) will help have a better interaction between communities and people,"" Moroccan Tourism Minister Nadia Fettah Alaoui told I24 television.
During the visit, Ben-Shabbat and Kushner will see Morocco's King Mohammed VI, Israeli officials said. Moroccan and Israeli officials are also scheduled to sign accords on linking up aviation and financial systems, on visas and water management.
The delegates' plane, painted with the Hebrew, Arabic and English words for ""peace"" and a Maghreb good-luck talisman, had a low-key reception at Rabat airport. Moroccan officials describe their deal with Israel as a restoration of mid-level ties that Rabat cooled in 2000 in solidarity with Palestinians.
Israel and Morocco now plan to reopen mutual ""liaison offices"". Israel hopes these will be upgraded to embassies.

Asked if the countries might establish full diplomatic relations before Trump steps down next month, Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Ynet TV: ""My understanding is that the likelihood is not high.""

PANIQUI, Philippines (Reuters) - Relatives of a woman and her son shot dead by an off-duty policeman in the Philippines called for justice at their wake on Tuesday amid public outrage over an incident that went viral on social media after it was caught on camera.
Sonya Gregorio, 52, and 25-year old son Frank Gregorio, were shot in the head on Sunday after a row over noise, triggering accusations from activists that President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs had created a culture of police impunity.
""I lost a mother who was the most loving mother to us. I lost a brother who was also a very loving and caring brother. It's very hard for us,"" said Tasha Delos Santos. 
""I hope our family gets justice.""
Duterte on Monday condemned the Tarlac shooting and said he only defends police who do their duty, warning ""there will be a hell to pay"" for rogue officers.
In a video recorded on a family member's mobile phone, policeman Jonel Nuezca was seen engaging in a heated argument with the Gregorios over the use of a homemade cannon in Tarlac province, north of Manila. The devices, which make a booming sound, are typically used to celebrate New Year.
When Sonya wrapped her arms around her son as the row intensified, Nuezca shot her in the head before doing the same to Frank. Before fleeing, Nuezca shot Sonya Gregorio again.
Nuezca surrendered to police that night and faces two counts of murder. The government has promised a thorough investigation.
""They weren't criminals, they were the nicest family here,"" said neighbour Gonyong Liwanag.
Critics and rights groups say Duterte's talk of killing criminals and promises to protect law enforcement have emboldened police to commit and cover up murder. Police reject that.
Government data show that 5,942 suspected drug dealers have been killed by police since 2016. Rights group say that number is an understatement and accuse police of summarily executing users and pushers. Police say those killed had resisted arrest.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",Venezuela opposition lawmakers go into survival mode after election boycott,"By Brian Ellsworth and Vivian Sequera
CARACAS (Reuters) - The hush over Venezuela's parliament at the start of proceedings last week was broken by background noise that would last throughout the session - the clatter of construction equipment remodeling the park where the legislature had convened. 
The Caracas park is among the few places opposition lawmakers can meet without being harassed by President Nicolas Maduro's government, which not only banned them from congressional headquarters but pushed dozens of lawmakers into exile.
The opposition legislators' terms expire in two weeks and a new congress will convene after Maduro allies swept a Dec. 6 parliament vote boycotted by the opposition on the grounds it was fraudulent.
Maduro dismisses the idea that the election was unfair, and has celebrated the vote as a turning point that will put the legislature under Socialist Party control despite U.S. sanctions on the OPEC nation's oil industry aimed at driving him from power.
Opposition lawmakers are discussing how to maintain a stripped-down version of parliament after their terms end, a strategy that could put them at risk of arrest, while not providing any clear path to hastening Maduro's departure. 
But many insist the plan will help maintain international recognition of congress chief Juan Guaido - whom 50 nations see as Venezuela's legitimate president - while ensuring the opposition does not disappear.
Washington has said it will maintain support for Guaido following the Dec. 6 parliamentary vote, which it disavowed, and other Western nations may follow suit.
""It's our obligation to continue and maintain the National Assembly until there are new elections and until constitutional order is restored in our country,"" said Nora Bracho of the western state of Zulia. 
She was one of just over a dozen legislators who sat in plastic picnic chairs under an awning for the Dec. 15 session at Morichal Park in the affluent Prados del Este neighborhood of southern Caracas. 
Others spoke in a Zoom call shown on a television set up in front of a column of bamboo. 
A dozen metres (40 feet) away, workers were building rebar and wooden retention walls, while a backhoe opened up what appeared to be a new path. The hammering and sawing continued even as parliament held a minute of silence for Venezuelan migrants who had died attempting to reach Trinidad by boat.
Bracho and others who spoke with Reuters said they expected parliament would be left in the hands of a group of 33 lawmakers, while some 90 others elected in 2015 would keep a lower profile. 
SCALING BACK 
The group is considering reducing the number of ambassadors who represent Guaido abroad and scaling back the bureaucracy associated with the opposition interim government, legislators told Reuters this month.
But they do not appear to have reached a consensus on the rules for the new arrangement, which requires altering a ""transition statute"" passed in 2019 amid euphoria that Maduro was on his way out.
Legislators since last week have twice suspended sessions to finalize the reform of the transition statute and have not yet convoked a new one.
The opposition won control of parliament in 2015 in a landslide rejection of the ruling Socialist Party, but the pro-Maduro supreme court shot down nearly every measure it approved.
Maduro, who maintains the support of the military, accuses the lawmakers of supporting U.S. sanctions, and has mocked the idea that they would extend their term past Jan. 5. 
""For Guaido to continue saying he is president would be a terrible cartoon that would produce more shame than laughter,"" Maduro said in an interview with state television. 
Opposition lawmakers during the course of their terms have been accused of crimes ranging from treason to instigating violence. 
Some were arrested or spent months living in embassies, dozens are now in exile and nearly all have stories of abuse by government supporters and harassment by security forces.
Bracho recounted being ""dragged by my hair, doused in urine and excrement, having bottles thrown at me,"" as well as getting angry phone calls from relatives who said her work as a legislator was threatening their safety.
Alfonso Marquina, who represents the western state of Lara, acknowledged that legislators would face security concerns going forward, but added that most lawmakers had already faced those problems during their terms.

""The people of Venezuela were consulted ... and they disavowed the fraud on Dec. 6,"" Marquina said of the boycotted election as he waited for the session to begin in the park. ""I see myself as being strongly legitimized.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations is striving to get a team on the ground to investigate alleged human rights violations including a mass killing in Ethiopia's Tigray, described by the U.N. rights chief as one of many ""appalling"" human rights abuses that could amount to war crimes. 
Ethiopia's army has been fighting rebellious forces in the northern Tigray region for over six weeks in a conflict that has displaced close to 950,000 people. Access for humanitarian workers has until recent days been impossible and rights workers are now seeking access on the ground to verify reports.
""If civilians were deliberately killed by a party or parties to the conflict, these killings would amount to war crimes and there needs to be, as I have stressed previously, independent, impartial, thorough and transparent investigations to establish accountability and ensure justice,"" U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said on Tuesday, describing incidents there as ""heart-breaking"" and ""appalling"".
One of the events she mentioned was the alleged killing of several hundred people, mainly Amharans, in the northwestern town of Mai Kadra on Nov. 9.
She also described other incidents including artillery strikes on populated areas, the deliberate targeting of civilians, extrajudicial killings and widespread looting.
U.N. rights office (OHCHR) spokeswoman Liz Throssell later told a Geneva virtual briefing that her office had been holding talks with the Ethiopian government and was aiming to prepare a team to verify rights abuses as soon as possible.
She said that some of the incidents of individual killings of civilians were blamed on the ""Fano"" militia from the province of Amhara, thought to be aligned with the government. Reuters also received similar reports from displaced Tigrayans.
However, information obtained by the U.N. consistently pointed to violations by all parties to the conflict, she added.
Until now, the U.N. has been monitoring the situation remotely and has obtained some of its information from refugees among the tens of thousands who have fled to neighbouring Sudan.
Both sides deny their forces have committed atrocities, and blame other forces for the killing of civilians. Accounts on all sides are difficult to verify because telecommunications links were down for most of the conflict and the government tightly controls access to the region.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - When a major healthcare organization asked A.R. Bernard, the Black head of a Brooklyn megachurch, to sit on a committee tasked with boosting acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines in communities of color in New York City, he demurred. 
Bernard, who leads the Christian Cultural Center, the largest church in the city, said he turned down the offer because he worried some members of his congregation could view his participation as ""joining forces with the system"" to use African Americans ""as guinea pigs"" for vaccines that have been developed in record time. 
Like most of the dozen Black faith leaders Reuters interviewed, Bernard did not yet want to show public support for an inoculation he feels he does not know enough about and risk jeopardizing his community's trust. 
""We're concerned about it being tested on persons of color,"" said Bernard, referring to people who would get the vaccine early in its public rollout. Black people comprised about 10% of the vaccine trial volunteers compared to 13.4% of the U.S. population.
The pastor was hospitalized with the virus in March and said he wanted to ""wait and see"" more information on the vaccine side effects. 
The hesitation to recommend vaccination is striking because Black pastors have been playing a key role in educating their communities about the risks of COVID-19 for African Americans, who are 2.8 times more likely to die from it than white Americans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Public health officials hope Black faith leaders and other Black role models will help alleviate strong skepticism among African Americans about the safety of the vaccine, which is being distributed across the country. The shots are crucial to ending a pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 Americans so far, health experts say.
Just 49% of Black Americans would be interested in taking it, compared to 63% of white Americans, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll this month. The poll showed that Black people, like white people, are deterred by the speed of the COVID vaccine's development and the Trump administration's muddled coronavirus response. The Black pastors also cited deep-seated distrust in the medical establishment among members of their communities.
""What we're dealing with right now is the byproduct of ... generations of distrust, suspicion and fear with regard to how medical systems work,"" said Edwin Sanders, head of Metropolitan International Church in Nashville, Tennessee, who has been involved with public health education since HIV/AIDS struck in the 1980s. 
The distrust is rooted in decades of unequal healthcare access and treatment, under-representation in clinical trials and a record of being used as unwitting test subjects, such as in the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study that continued through 1972 and withheld syphilis treatment from infected Black men without their knowledge. 
Pastors said this history has fed fears that the COVID-19 vaccine may not work in Black Americans, or that they may be given a different shot than the rest of society.
""I can't in good faith tell my people to accept this wholesale, but I also am not trying to support any type of baseless conspiracy theories. It's a tightrope that I have to walk here,"" said Earle Fisher, pastor at Abyssinian Missionary Baptist Church, a congregation of about 50 in Memphis, Tennessee. 
Of the dozen Black church leaders interviewed, all said that they thought the vaccine was necessary to end the crisis, but only one was willing to endorse it outright at this time. 
Most said they wanted more information to be able to inform their parishioners of how the vaccine works in the body, where they could get it and about possible side effects. 
   ""As a pastor and as a healthcare worker, I can see why people should take it, because of the devastation that I've seen. But I also understand why the African American community does not trust it because of how we've been treated in the past,"" said Reginald Belton of First Baptist Church of Brownsville in Brooklyn, who also performs pastoral care at a hospital.
Belton said he planned to take the vaccine and wants to provide his members with more information about it, but he stopped short of saying he would endorse it.
The importance of Black religious leaders in the vaccine promotion effort was underscored by a CDC report this month, which found health officials had success when they partnered with African American churches to educate medically underserved communities.
Black churches have long played a critical role in the social well-being of Black Americans, perhaps most famously during the civil rights movement. 
BUILDING TRUST
The pastors interviewed by Reuters said local government and other public officials need to build trust with their faith communities to increase vaccine acceptance among Black Americans. 
Elijah Hankerson III, head of the Life Center International, Church of God in Christ in St. Louis, Missouri, said the clinical trial results, which show the Pfizer/BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines to be more than 90% effective, are not enough for him to promote a vaccine. 
But if St. Louis officials vouch for the vaccine, and his legal team and church health unit say it is OK, Hankerson said he would promote it on his webcasts and social media, which reach a combined audience of about 70,000.
""Data is one thing,"" said Hankerson, who lost his uncle and two colleagues to the virus. ""If there are people that we trust that can vouch and say, 'Hey, this is for the benefit of the people, get this out,' then we wouldn't mind doing it.""
The National Medical Association, an organization of Black healthcare providers, sought to provide that assurance to Black Americans on Monday, when it announced support for the U.S. government's emergency approval of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and Moderna shots after an independent review of the clinical trial data. 
Anthony Evans, the president of the National Black Church Initiative, a coalition seeking to decrease healthcare disparities, said he anticipated Black churches would eventually get on board to mobilize to get people vaccinated. 
Some faith leaders are encouraging the vaccine despite their own hesitance because they see little alternative.
Pastor George Waddles of Second Baptist Church in Ypsilanti, Michigan, a congregation of about 400, has doubted vaccines before. He got the flu shot for the first time in 2019 because he previously believed it could make him sick.
But seeing the suffering caused by COVID-19 has motivated him to encourage his parishioners to take a leap of faith and get vaccinated. 
""We have three options,"" Waddles recalled saying on a virtual prayer call this month. ""Vaccination, isolation or decimation.""

India, whose cities top global pollution lists, faces a growing economic as well as human toll from bad air quality, which was linked to 1.24 million, or 12.5% of total deaths in the previous such study for 2017.
The analysis (https://secure.jbs.elsevierhealth.com/action/getSharedSiteSession?rc=1&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flanplh%2Farticle%2FPIIS2542-5196%2820%2930298-9%2Ffulltext) found pollution led to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infections, lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, neonatal disorders and cataracts.
Land-locked New Delhi, the world's most polluted capital whose winter skies are often obscured (https://in.reuters.com/article/us-india-pollution/new-delhis-poisonous-air-a-perennial-crisis-of-its-own-making-idUSKBN28609N) by its filthy air, recorded the highest per-capita economic hit, the journal said.
The fatalities in 2019 led to a total loss of $36.8 billion, or 1.36% of India's gross domestic product (GDP), with the poor and populous states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar experiencing the highest economic loss as a percentage of their GDP. 
Although the death rate due to household air pollution fell 64.2% from 1990 to 2019, that due to ambient particulate matter pollution more than doubled, The Lancet said.
""The improvements in air quality across India during the COVID-19 lockdown period, and its upsurge again with the easing of restrictions, provide interesting pointers to the extent of air pollution reduction that is possible with reduced human activity,"" it added.
The government said in a statement that India would need to invest more in state-specific pollution control programmes if it were to meet its goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2024, from around $2.9 trillion now.

India's three main cities, New Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbai, were on the list of the world's 20 worst polluted cities, Swiss air quality technology company IQAir reported on Tuesday.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Near the wreckage of Beirut's port, a charity is bringing Christmas cheer to a city hammered by a devastating explosion, rising coronavirus infections and the worst economic crisis since Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war.
The Solidarity Christmas Village, decked out with flashing fairy lights and glittering trees, has been offering visitors free entry to watch concerts and pick up drinks and snacks, lifting the mood of families who can't afford seasonal luxuries.
People dressed in giant polar bear costumes and others in Santa Claus outfits offer some festive spirit to a country that is a patchwork of Christian and Muslim sects.
""We need to make our children happy .... even if we are tired,"" said Toni Hossainy, who had brought her son.
The Christmas village has been set up in a temporary warehouse near the port, flattened by a huge explosion on Aug. 4 which also ruined a swathe of the capital.
Near the port's shattered entrance, an artist erected a towering Christmas tree decorated not with shiny baubles but with grimy protective clothing and hard hats worn by firefighters who had battled the port conflagration.
The blast left tens of thousands homeless in a nation already crushed by a mountain of debt.
Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) singer Elias Francis gave a concert to open the Christmas village, bringing his own microphone as a precaution against the fast-spreading coronavirus.
""No matter how negative things are around us, like the blast, like the coronavirus, like the economic situation which is very bad, there is still a glimmer of hope,"" he said.
In a predominantly Christian quarter of Beirut, Nina said her shop selling Christmas trinkets had been packed in previous years but now closes early because there are so few customers.
Tears welled up as Georgette Suleiman, 63, who looks after a Beirut school damaged by the blast, remembered the challenges of 2020. ""God willing, this Christmas will bring us joy and hope, and Lebanon will return to how it was,"" she said.

Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, was airlifted to Germany for medical treatment in August after collapsing on a plane in Russia.
Germany has said he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him, an assertion many Western nations accept.
The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that Russia tried to kill Navalny.
Navalny on Monday released a recording of him speaking by phone at length to a man he described as a state security agent who told him, among other things, that the poison had been placed in his underpants. Navalny said he had posed as an aide to a senior Russian security official to gain the man's confidence.
Russia's FSB security service dismissed the recording as a fake. 
Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday he was speaking in a personal capacity, but thought Navalny was suffering from psychological issues.
""We can say that the patient (Navalny) has a pronounced persecution mania. You can also clearly identify certain signs of megalomania,"" said Peskov.
Kira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, said on Twitter that it looked like Peskov had been forced to improvise and mocked what she portrayed as the Kremlin's attempts to obscure the truth. 

She pointed out that Putin himself had recently confirmed that state security agents had kept an eye on Navalny, something she suggested sat oddly with the Kremlin now accusing him of having persecution mania.

NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - The political head of Tibetans in exile on Tuesday welcomed legislation passed by the U.S. Congress that reaffirms the rights of Tibetans to choose a successor to their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, a move that infuriated China.
China regards the exiled Dalai Lama as a dangerous ""splittist"", or separatist, and the latest show of support from the U.S. Congress could increase already tense ties between the two countries. 
Lobsang Sangay, president of the Tibetan Central Administration (CTA), which is known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, told Reuters Monday's passing by the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate of the Tibet Policy and Support Act (TPSA) was historic.
The Chinese foreign ministry accused the U.S. of meddling in its internal affairs and warned the U.S. against signing the legislation into law, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular briefing on Tuesday.
""We urge the U.S. side to stop meddling in China's internal affairs and refrain from signing into law these negative clauses and acts, lest it further harms our further cooperation and bilateral relations,"" Wang said.
China seized control of Tibet after its troops entered the region in 1950 in what it calls a ""peaceful liberation"". Tibet has since become one of the most restricted and sensitive areas in the country.
The Dalai Lama fled into exile in India in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
The legislation calls for the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Tibet's main city of Lhasa, the absolute right of Tibetans to choose a successor to the Dalai Lama and the preservation of Tibet's environment.
The legislation also proposes a ""regional framework on water security"" and greater participation from the community in dialogue with China on monitoring the region's environment.
""The People's Republic of China has already completed water transfer programmes diverting billions of cubic metres of water yearly and has plans to divert more waters from the Tibetan plateau in China,"" the bill said. 
Environmental groups and Tibetan rights activists have expressed concern about China's hydropower ambitions in the region, saying they could affect downstream water supplies.
China has said its leaders have the right to approve the Dalai Lama's successor, which many see as a coercive attempt to control Tibet, where ethnic Tibetans make up about 90% of the population.
""By passing the TPSA, Congress has sent its message loud and clear that Tibet remains a priority for the United States and that it will continue its steadfast support for His Holiness the Dalai Lama and the CTA,"" Sangay said. 
""This is a victory for the Tibetan freedom struggle.""
China accuses the U.S. of destabilising the region by interfering in its internal affairs.
Relations between China and the United States have deteriorated to their worst in decades over a range of issues, including trade, Taiwan, human rights, Hong Kong, the South China Sea and the coronavirus. 

The U.S. bill also proposes dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama.

Russia's foreign ministry did not name the officials, but called in senior diplomats from the German, Swedish and French embassies to notify them of the move following EU sanctions imposed in mid-October, the TASS news agency reported. 
""...we will continue to respond appropriately to unfriendly actions by western countries,"" the ministry said in a statement on its website.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - When businesswoman Marina Wessolowski arrived in Cape Town on Dec. 12 she was looking forward to spending Christmas with family and friends before flying back to Germany early next month.
But the emergence of a new, fast-spreading strain of the coronavirus in South Africa means that she, her husband and two daughters are now uncertain when they will be able to return home.
That's because a growing number of countries, including Germany, have barred travellers from South Africa while they assess how much danger the new variant poses. 
""We found out this morning that we won't be able to go home, so that is quite a shock to us,"" Wessolowski, who runs a cosmetics distribution firm in Berlin, told Reuters on Monday outside her rental flat overlooking the city.
There had been no notification yet from airline Lufthansa on their Jan. 12 return flight to Frankfurt. ""We haven't heard from anybody specifically on what is the next step, so we are waiting,"" she said.
At OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg on Tuesday, there were fewer passengers than normal, most flying domestic routes.
South Africa's health department said last week the new virus mutation might be behind a recent surge in infections. The variant is different from one identified in Britain, though both carry mutations that make them more transmissible than previously circulating dominant strains.
Having not seen her 76-year-old mother for a year, Wessolowski - a South African-born German - said their inability to interact more to due COVID-related restrictions has been the hardest part of her visit.
""She has been very lonely ... but we are all following the rules and keeping our distance with her. It's very difficult to see your mom after a year and you can't hug her,"" a tearful Wessolowski added.

South Africa's tourism department said it had no information on numbers of flights cancelled or rescheduled due to the bans, but that it was working with the foreign ministry and foreign embassies to facilitate contact between foreign citizens in South Africa and their governments.

Tsang Chi-kin, 19, was shot and wounded on Oct. 1, 2019, during protests on China's national day, the first of two people who police shot during months of pro-democracy protests in the former British colony.
Tsang did not show up for a court hearing earlier on Tuesday and a British-based, anti-China advocacy group, Friends of Hong Kong, said he and some fellow protesters had left the city.
""Kin ... is now formally declaring that they are in exile,"" the group said in a statement. It did not say how he had left or where he was.
At his previous court appearance in October, Tsang said he intended to plead guilty to the charges against him.
But he also feared being investigated for breaking a new national security law that punishes colluding with foreign forces.
That concern stemmed from a failed bid to seek asylum at the U.S. consulate together with some of his friends in October this year, the group said.
The U.S. consulate said at the time, without naming Tsang or giving any details, U.S. policy worldwide was that asylum could only be requested upon arrival on American soil.
China imposed the sweeping security law on semi-autonomous Hong Kong in June. The law, along with coronavirus restrictions on group gatherings, effectively ended the protests.
The group said Tsang's 15-year-old girlfriend suspected she was also being investigated by Hong Kong authorities and she was in Britain, settling down and looking to resume her studies.

""Kin and his friends do not worry about safety,"" the group said.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A former minister in Somalia whose hotel was damaged in a bomb attack by the Islamist group al Shabaab says he is rebuilding and expanding, in an unusual show of business confidence in a country where violence is a daily challenge.
The car bomb in August blew out the windows of the beachfront Elite Hotel in Mogadishu and partially destroyed its perimeter wall. Attackers then stormed the building, setting off grenades and shooting their way through rooms and staircases.
""I have to invest in reconstruction. To stop reconstruction for fear of what may happen in future means to give up business,"" hotel owner and former finance minister Mohamed Abdullahi Nur, 38, told Reuters. 
Al Shabaab, which is allied with al Qaeda, has been fighting to topple the Somali government for more than ten years. The group wants to establish its own rule based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law.
The militants have frequently targeted hotels, restaurants and cafes in Mogadishu, which are patronised by the political and security elite.
Nur told Reuters he had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on reconstructing and repairing the hotel that cost him $2 million to build.
Just a month after the attack, well-heeled customers were back in the five-story hotel, enjoying seafood and cappuccino, and taking in views of the ocean while beachgoers swam and speedboats cruised by. 
Nur plans to add another 120 deluxe rooms at a cost of $8 million dollars.
""I am alive and healthy, I am determined to reinvest and reconstruct even if it might be bombed again,"" he said.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian court convicted two rappers and sentenced them to up to a year and a half in prison on Tuesday on charges of incitement over their rhymes about social injustice and loss of sovereign territory.
Yin Srang, a spokesman for the Siem Reap provincial court, told Reuters that rapper Kea Sokun, 23, was found guilty of incitement to commit a felony and sentenced to a year and a half in prison, of which six months were suspended. 
Another rapper, Long Putheara, who was 17 when arrested last year, received five months in jail, about six weeks of which was suspended, Yin Srang said. 
Their convictions come during a wave of arrests of activists and opponents of the government, which started in July with the detention of a unionist who accused it of ceding land to neighbouring Vietnam. 
Others held include members of environmental groups, a politician and a Buddhist monk, according to human rights group Licadho, which tracks arrests of dissidents and activists.
Several Western nations have condemned that crackdown as well as treason charges against scores of opposition party supporters, warning that Cambodia's democracy is under threat. 
Kea Sokun's father Kea Phal said the conviction of his son was an injustice and the two rap songs - ""Khmer Land"" and ""Sad Race"" - had positive meaning. 
""The songs were educational and just remind youths to be loving of own nation,"" Kea Phal told Reuters.
Kea Phal said his son had made no apology during court proceedings because he did nothing wrong.
Lyrics in Khmer Land and Sad Race - which have over 2 million and 700,000 views respectively - say Cambodians are starving and the country is losing territory to its neighbours. 
They urge people to stand up against oppression and unite to bring the country greatness.
Cambodia's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the convictions.

BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Reuters) - Walk out of Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, across Manger Square and along Star Street and you come to a part of town where few pilgrims venture.
    Behind a discreet plaque saying 'Crèche' is a children's home - the only one that many illegitimate and abandoned children brought up there have ever known.
    Run by Catholic nuns from the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul and Palestinian staff, it is a refuge for around 50 children, including those born out of wedlock, at risk of violence and even rescued from garbage bins.
    There are children's refuges all over the world, all dealing with similar issues.
    But the Crèche bears the emotional weight of being in the traditional birthplace of Jesus, where the focus of the Christian world turns once a year to a story from Bethlehem that celebrates birth, family and hope.
    Although a Christian institution, the children are raised as Muslim according to local law, unless the staff know the religion of the family that gave them up.
    In 95% of cases Iskandar Andon, the social worker who oversees the children's welfare, gets advance warning of a child conceived out of wedlock or from an incestuous relationship, but sometimes the first he knows is when he gets a call from the police that a baby has been found abandoned.
    ""For me as a social worker that lives with these children on a daily basis, I have the honour to be responsible for them, or to be part of their lives,"" Andon, 52, told Reuters. 
    But he does not underplay the emotional difficulties. Relatives may be violent, or drug addicts, or the children and mothers at risk from honour killings.
    ""It involves an ethical and moral responsibility, a professional responsibility,"" he said.
    Founded at the turn of the 19th century, the institution's echoing halls are a home from birth until the age of five.
    But the Crèche is short of money - especially this year - amid donor fatigue and the coronavirus which struck Bethlehem first in the Palestinian Territories, just before Easter.
    The pandemic cut the number of visitors who could bring aid or cheer to the children, and forced Bethlehem into lockdown that devastated its tourist-reliant economy.
    The Crèche's quiet charitable work has won it respect and recognition, however, including a visit in January by Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, who called it an ""utter manifestation of humanity.""
Some of the staff grew up in the home and, knowing the hardships the children will face in later life, came back to help others like them.
""I worked in various jobs, but in the end I decided to work in this institute for two reasons. To have a job and to build relationships, because I understand the nature of the kids,"" said Mariam Ayyesh, a 39-year-old teacher who now works alongside the nanny who raised her.
    Ayyesh has never met her parents and has no interest in finding them or knowing who they are.
    ""When you grow up, at school graduations, and at university graduations, you see everyone around you, it is a bit difficult ... But in the end, if the child gets an education, and if he was brought up well, these things all help,"" she said.
    Most years volunteers dress up as Santa Claus to bring some festive cheer, and teddy bears are piled up around the Christmas tree. But this year there are fewer decorations and fewer visitors.
However, there was at least one happy ending, a few days before Christmas.
    One of the children who was born out of wedlock is starting a new life after her parents married and set up home together - albeit far from their own home town to avoid scrutiny.
    ""At least today we started on a solid foundation that we can build a solid house upon, that can provide this child with support and protection,"" Andon told Reuters, as he sat in the garden with models of reindeer and Santa Claus around him.

    ""We were very happy that this girl started with us,"" he said. ""And this is similar to the story of the child that was born, (at) Christmas 2020 years ago, in a house with difficult conditions with a father and mother that didn't know where best to be, under hard conditions. And we saw later how this turned out.""

890,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 04:06AM ET</span>","On Congo's muddy trails, lessons for a global COVID vaccine rollout","By Hereward Holland
KINSHASA (Reuters) - When Ebola hit the city of Mbandaka in northwest Congo in 2018, health officials had to act fast - the city was connected via regular boat service to the sprawling capital Kinshasa, where the deadly virus could spread out of control. 
Unlike in previous outbreaks, they had a new weapon - an experimental vaccine that could revolutionise the fight against Ebola - if they could keep the vials between minus 60-80 degrees Celsius in tropical humidity and across rough terrain. 
As the world embarks on an unprecedented campaign to bring ultra-cold COVID-19 vaccines to billions in remote areas, Democratic Republic of Congo's experience holds vital lessons in distributing the vaccine and gaining the trust of those receiving it.
Congo itself will aim to use the technology and local expertise to get its people vaccinated against COVID-19. The country has recorded over 15,000 cases and 369 deaths from the virus, and faces a second wave of infections. 
Between 2018-20, health workers inoculated more than 400,000 people in three Ebola outbreaks, lugging vials colder than an Antarctic winter across warm forests and along mud-clogged mountain roads. When cars could not pass, they drove motorbikes. If water was the only way, they used canoes. 
""These roads are often flooded during the rainy season. A lot of times you have to cross rivers that may not have bridges,"" said John Johnson, an immunisation and outbreak response advisor for French medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).
It was the largest ever roll-out of an ultra-cold chain vaccine, said a spokesperson for GAVI, an alliance of governments, drug companies and charities that arranges global vaccination campaigns. 
In Mbandaka, full-scale crisis was averted. The vaccine, and well drilled health protocols, contained the virus.
GIANT THERMOS
Key to the roll-out was a high-tech thermos that could fit on a motorbike or in a canoe and keep vials cold for a week - essential in Congo where fewer than one in 10 people have access to electricity. 
The Arktek device works like a giant coffee thermos that can be filled with hundreds of vaccines, and special ice packs made of various materials.
Produced in China by Aucma and retailing for around $2,300 per unit, it was developed in 2014 to store polio vaccines at 2-8 degrees Celsius, and tweaked when Merck's Ebola vaccine was approved for use in Guinea and Sierra Leone during a 2013-16 outbreak.
""Like most thermoses designed to keep your coffee hot or a cold drink cold, they use a vacuum to shield the product from the environment,"" said Daniel Lieberman from the Global Health Labs (GHL), a non-profit research organisation created by the Gates Foundation which helped design it.
In Congo, they found the best ice packs used salt water, which kept the vaccine frozen for up to a week without power. 
Health teams in Congo set up a network of deep freezers from which the Arktek was deployed. That helped medics reach remote areas and end an epidemic in the east that killed over 2,200 people in two years, the second-worst Ebola outbreak in history.
GHL is now retuning the Arktek for use with dry ice, which could keep up to 1,500 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine frozen for several weeks. 
WINNING TRUST
Advances in cold chain technology mean little if health workers do not earn public trust and dispel misinformation about vaccines. 
WHO officials say that during Congo's 2018-20 Ebola outbreak, they made the mistake of not employing local health workers.
Rumours spread that the vaccine would make men weak, woman infertile and children less intelligent. More than 300 attacks on health workers were recorded, leaving six dead.
""They need to understand what they're getting and the risks and the benefits. The mistake that's often made is in watering down the message and making it too simple,"" MSF's Johnson said.
The WHO used only local healthcare workers to distribute the vaccine in a subsequent outbreak in the west, which ended in six months with 55 deaths.
Vaccine scepticism is not confined to central Africa. A 2018 study of 140 countries by the London-based Wellcome Trust medical charity found that low-income regions tend to have higher confidence that vaccines are safe than high-income ones.
A third of people in the United Kingdom say they have seen messages discouraging the public from getting a coronavirus vaccine, according to research by King’s College London and British research company Ipsos MORI.
It is essential to address doubts now, before mass COVID-19 vaccination campaigns begin, said Touré Alhassane, who led the WHO's vaccine rollout during Congo's latest Ebola outbreak, which ended in November.

""Even if you have all the money in the world, and you have everything to implement it, if the community are not with you, you are not going to succeed,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government on Tuesday appealed to farmers to hold further talks to break a nearly month-long deadlock over their demand for the repeal of agricultural reform laws, but farmers' leaders declined to relent unless these laws are withdrawn.
Thousands of protesters have camped on the outskirts of New Delhi and blocked national highways for over three weeks to protest against new laws that the government says would increase farmers' income through more private investments. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has urged the farmers to engage in talks to end the deadlock over the three reform laws introduced in September, but the farmers insist the laws would hit them economically while benefiting big retailers.
""We assure our farmers that we'll listen to them with an open mind,"" Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said on Tuesday. 
The government was ""open"" to amend the new laws, Tomar told foreign journalists. 
He, however, declined to say whether the government could consider withdrawal of these laws as demanded by protesters. 
Urging India's diaspora to help the government to convince farmers, Tomar said new policy changes would make agriculture more attractive for farmers.
Protesters have been getting support from tens of thousands of overseas Indians mainly from Punjab, who have organised demonstrations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia in support of the protests.
Farmers' leaders have decided to continue with protests. 
""Farmers have decided they won't go back till the government takes back all three farm laws,"" said Rakesh Tikait, spokesman for Bhartiya Kisan Union, one of over 30 protesting unions. 
""It will take more than a month to resolve all issues. Government will come to us,"" he said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel on Tuesday was on course for a fourth national election in two years after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main governing partner, Benny Gantz, failed to resolve a dispute over the budget.
Parliament voted late on Monday against an attempt by both men to delay a deadline of midnight on Tuesday for approval of the fiscal package.
Under law, failure to pass it by then would mean Israel going to the polls in March, and neither lawmakers nor the cabinet have passed it yet, a process near impossible to complete in a single day.
Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party and defence minister Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White faction, established a unity government in May after three inconclusive elections held since April 2019.
Their pact involved Gantz taking over from Netanyahu as prime minister in November 2021, and passing a bi-annual budget for 2020 and 2021.
But even as that power-sharing pact was being inked, many analysts argued that Netanyahu, on trial for alleged corruption which he denies, would not relinquish his powerful post, and Likud has since demanded to pass the budgets separately while Blue and White insisted Netanyahu stick to their deal.
Israel has so far this year managed its finances on the basis of a pro-rated version of the 2019 budget.
The current fiscal deadlock has plunged Israel into more economic uncertainty at the end of a year when a coronavirus-induced slump is expected to shrink gross domestic product by 4.5% with the jobless rate standing at 12.1%. 
Israel, also preparing for a new U.S. administration led by President-elect Joe Biden, kicked off its vaccination campaign this week. 
Analysts had seen Netanyahu pushing for an election in May or June next year, after the coronavirus crisis was expected to ease and the economy to begin to recover.
A March vote would be riskier for Israel's longest serving leader, who has been facing a wave of street protests against his alleged corruption, which he denies, and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Though polls show Netanyahu's party emerging as the largest faction in parliament, surveys also predict a strong showing for a bloc of factions from across the political spectrum seeking to unseat him.

896,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 22, 2020 12:50AM ET</span>","U.S. reinstates Sudan's sovereign immunity, authorizes funds to help pay debt","By Nafisa Eltahir and Humeyra Pamuk
CAIRO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday reinstated Sudan's sovereign immunity, as the U.S. Congress passed legislation formalizing the move, following the ending of Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terror. 
    However, the legislation includes an exemption allowing lawsuits by the families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States already underway in U.S. courts to move forward, although experts say Sudan is unlikely to lose those cases.
    The state sponsor of terror designation, which was in place for almost three decades, had weighed on Sudan's economy and restricted its ability to receive aid. For investors, the reinstating of sovereign immunity removes another layer of financial risk.
    Sudan had been engaged in talks with the United States for months, and paid a negotiated $335 million settlement to victims of al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 who had been awarded much higher damages by U.S. courts. 
    The process to release the settlement money and restore Sudan's sovereign immunity - protection against being sued in American courts - had been stalled in the U.S. Congress as it had been tied to the $892 billion coronavirus aid package.
    Late on Monday, the wider package was passed in the U.S. Congress after a deal has been worked out in a rare weekend session, and sent to President Donald Trump to sign into law.
    According to the bill, Washington will be authorizing $111 million to pay off part of Sudan's bilateral debt, and $120 to help pay off its debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) while making another $700 million available until September 2022 for assistance to the country.
Last week, Sudan's finance minister announced a U.S. ""bridge loan"" that would allow Sudan to clear $1 billion in arrears to the World Bank.
    A U.S. source familiar with the matter said the debt assistance would help kick off Sudan's debt relief on a global level, helping make it eligible for the IMF's Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) programme.
    With the reinstatement of sovereign immunity and the financial aid, Khartoum will now be ""on the hook,"" to normalize ties with Israel, a U.S. source familiar with the matter said, a move it has agreed to under U.S. pressure.
    In a joint statement in October, Israel and Sudan said they had agreed to normalize relations and end the state of belligerence between the two countries, but Sudan's civilian leaders have said the final decision would be in the hands of a yet-to-be-formed transitional legislature.
The normalization would make Sudan one of the four Arab countries along with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, over the past several months, to establish relations with Israel in deals brokered with U.S. help.
    The bill also appropriates an additional $150 million for Sudan's settlement payment, in order to redistribute the funds in a way the bill's sponsors say is more equitable.
    The United States designated Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism in 1993 on the grounds that former President Omar al-Bashir's regime was supporting militant groups including al-Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah.
    In the 1990s, the regime became a pariah, hosting Osama bin Laden and positioning itself as a fulcrum for Islamist movements, although experts still say Sudan's liability for the Sept. 11 attacks is questionable.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Staying overnight at an airport isn't unheard of, especially if you miss a flight. But choosing to spend your holidays there in a tent is something entirely different.
With the coronavirus pandemic severely limiting trips abroad, some in Singapore this holiday season are going ""glamping"", or glamourous camping, staying overnight in luxury tents at the retail and leisure wing of the city-state's Changi Airport.
""Usually we go out of the country every holiday but since we can't travel much and it's a school holiday, I thought why not do something different for the children,"" said Fadlina Musa, standing under twinkling fairy lights.
Her husband, Khairil Anuar Malek, said it was nice to get out of the house. ""It has been very tough for all of us, so we wanted to experience closeness at a different level,"" he said.
Glamping isn't cheap. Guests spend up to S$360 ($269) a night for queen-sized beds, shopping discounts, a cool box for picnics and plenty of festive Christmas lights. Private bathroom facilities are not provided.
Air-conditioned gardens, walking trails and an indoor waterfall provide a sense of the great outdoors, minus the bugs, rain and humidity. 
Serene Beh, an accounting manager visiting the mall with her family, said she liked the idea, at the right price.
""I will look at the package,"" she said. ""If it's worth it, then I think it's a good experience for the children who have never been camping before.""
The 'glamp-cations' at Changi Airport were sold out until Dec. 28, reflecting appetite among Singapore residents for creative distractions that have included flights and cruises limited to the country's airspace and waters.

The Law in Defense of the Rights of the People to Independence, Sovereignty and Self-Determination for Peace was backed by 70 votes from Ortega's ruling Sandinistas in the 92-member assembly.
Critics of the government see the legislation as an attempt to muzzle opposition to Ortega, who in November 2021 will seek his third consecutive term in office. The law does not specify how the ineligibility of candidates will be determined.
""Those who ask for international sanctions against Nicaragua or its officials should be candidates in the empire,"" the speaker of the national assembly, Gustavo Porras, said in reference to the United States during debate on the bill.
Porras is one of 27 Nicaraguan officials who have been sanctioned by the United States in the past three years.
Ortega's government accuses the opposition of attempting to launch a coup, and of pressing for sanctions against officials after protests against him erupted in April 2018.
According to human rights groups, more than 320 people were killed in the ensuing clashes as the government and armed groups loyal to Ortega sought to quell the unrest.
Eliseo Nunez, a former opposition lawmaker, said Ortega wanted to shut down the competition in the 2021 election and would only relent if there were sufficient pressure from the incoming Biden administration in the United States.
The Organization of American States (OAS) urged lawmakers to repeal the legislation, saying the initiative ""would deny the Nicaraguan people the right to freely choose their representatives"" and turn the 2021 election into ""an imposition."" 

Ortega faces pressure from the United States, the European Union and the OAS to make the electoral system more open and transparent by May 2021 to defuse criticism that electoral authorities are under his control.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Senior U.N. officials briefed the U.N. Security Council behind closed doors on Monday on Western Sahara after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed region in return for the kingdom normalizing ties with Israel.
Trump's announcement this month was a departure from longstanding U.S. policy on Western Sahara. The United States had supported a 1991 ceasefire between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, a movement that seeks to establish Western Sahara as an independent state. 
The ceasefire is monitored by U.N. peacekeepers. The 15-member Security Council was briefed on Monday by U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Africa Bintou Keita and Colin Stewart, head of a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara.
""There are no major operational changes from our part,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said ahead of the council briefing, which was requested by Germany. 
""Our position on the announcements regarding Western Sahara is unchanged and that ... we continue to believe that a solution can be found through dialogue based on the relevant Security Council resolutions,"" he added. 
The region has effectively been split by an earthen wall separating an area controlled by Morocco that it claims as its southern provinces, and territory controlled by the Polisario with a U.N.-mandated buffer zone between them.
U.N. talks have long failed to broker an agreement on how to decide on self-determination. Morocco wants an autonomy plan under Moroccan sovereignty. The Polisario wants a U.N.-backed referendum including on the question of independence.
President-elect Joe Biden, due to succeed Trump on Jan. 20, will face a decision whether to accept the U.S. deal with Morocco on the Western Sahara, which no other Western country has done. 
Without naming the United States, South Africa's U.N. Ambassador Jerry Matjila told reporters after the council briefing that ""decisions contrary to multilateral collective decisions must be discouraged and unequivocally disregarded.""
""We believe that any recognition of Western Sahara as part of Morocco is tantamount to recognizing illegality as such recognition is incompatible with international law,"" he said.

The 467 page report, seen by Reuters, said the main critical issues with the collapsed section of the bridge were design deficiencies in some details and execution flaws.
But the report added it was ""surprising"" how few inspections had been carried after 1993 on two pillars of the bridge, which was managed by Autostrade per l'Italia, the toll-road unit of infrastructure group Atlantia.
Autostrade per l'Italia declined to comment on the report.
During the bridge's lifetime no maintenance action aiming at arresting the deterioration process or fixing flaws has been taken, it said.
The Genoa bridge disaster caused a political storm around Autostrade and its parent Atlantia, controlled by Italy's powerful Benetton family, and the state of the motorway network it runs.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The incoming Biden administration is considering a plan to shield more than a million immigrants from Honduras and Guatemala from deportation after the countries were battered by hurricanes in November, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's transition team is weighing whether to grant them Temporary Protected Status (TPS). The program allows people already in the United States at the time of the designation to stay and work legally if their home countries have been affected by natural disasters, armed conflicts or other events that prevent their safe return. The designations last six to 18 months and can be renewed.
TPS covers both immigrants in the United States illegally and those on legal visas. The program bars certain applicants with criminal convictions and those deemed security threats. 
The sources stressed that no decisions were expected until after Biden takes office on Jan. 20 and staff are in place to conduct formal evaluations. 
""They’re looking into TPS the same way they’re looking into a number of things to decide on the right course of action,"" said one of the people, all of whom requested anonymity. ""Circumstances on the ground certainly warrant that.""
A transition team spokesman declined to comment.
If Biden's Democratic administration does grant TPS to Hondurans and Guatemalans, it would represent a major expansion of the program and the biggest use of that authority in decades.
The discussion of the TPS humanitarian protections represents a sharp departure from the administration of Republican President Donald Trump.
Trump attempted to phase out most enrollment in the TPS program, arguing the countries had recovered from natural disasters that happened years or decades ago, but the terminations were slowed by federal courts and the protections will remain in place at least until October 2021.
Biden’s campaign website called Trump attempts to roll back TPS ""politically motivated"" and Biden has said he would not return enrollees to unsafe countries. 
If the Biden administration ultimately offers new TPS protections to Hondurans and Guatemalans, it could enthuse liberal Democrats but would risk criticism from Republicans who back Trump's tougher approach to immigration, making it more difficult for Biden to pass the immigration bill he plans to introduce at the start of his term.
DEADLY STORMS
U.S. border officials are also concerned about the effects of a major surge in migration in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. The situation could be exacerbated by talk of new TPS designations, said Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a union for Border Patrol agents.
The two hurricanes that powered through Central America in November, named Eta and Iota, killed more than 100 people in Honduras and forced more than 300,000 to be evacuated from their homes, with more than 125,000 still displaced in shelters, according to the Honduran government.
In Guatemala, the storms killed dozens of people, destroyed roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, and inundated swaths of farmland while it already had a growing hunger crisis.
More than a quarter of a million families in Guatemala have been affected by the agricultural destruction, according to the agricultural ministry. The World Food Programme warns the damage will create a high risk of food insecurity for subsistence farmers and their families throughout the next 10 months, until the next harvest occurs.
The governments of both Honduras and Guatemala have called on the United States to issue new TPS designations for their nationals in the United States.
A group of four Democratic senators from the states of Virginia and Maryland sent a letter on Friday to Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's nominee to become homeland security secretary, urging Mayorkas to ""promptly"" issue new TPS designations for Honduras and Guatemala, as well as for El Salvador and Nicaragua.
In Texas, 42-year-old Margarita Rivera, a Honduran immigrant living in the United States illegally and working at a cake shop, said flooding was so devastating in her hometown along the northern coast that many of her neighbors lost their homes and had to be rescued by boat. 
""I would love if TPS were approved,"" she said, explaining that it would be extremely difficult for her to survive and make ends meet in Honduras if she were deported.
Roughly 411,000 people of different nationalities have TPS protections, according to a 2019 report by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). 

Some 79,000 Hondurans are already enrolled in the program under a 1999 designation issued by Democratic President Bill Clinton's administration following hurricane damage. However, to be eligible, Hondurans must have been residing in the United States on or before Dec. 30, 1998.

LIMA (Reuters) - Workers from agricultural export companies in Peru renewed protests on Monday after Congress failed to reach an agreement to reform the sector and address their complaints over poor pay.
Footage from local television showed hundreds of agricultural workers blocking the Panamerican highway that runs along the coast in the southern Ica region and the northern La Libertad region.
During a similar, five-day protest in early December, hundreds of passenger buses and trucks loaded with food were stranded by road blockades.
One person died after clashes between protesters and police. So far, the latest protests have been peaceful.
The previous protests ended after Congress repealed an old agriculture promotion law that workers complained put the rights of big companies over workers, leaving them receiving salaries as low as 39 soles ($11) daily.
Over the weekend, however, after a two-day debate, Congress failed to reach consensus on the law's replacement, specifically a clause around higher base salaries for workers, sending it back to a legislative commission instead.
The Association of Agricultural Producers Guilds of Peru (AGAP), which brings together companies in the sector, has said that a call by some legislators to increase the base salary by up to 50% would drive up costs and force them to re-evaluate their investments.
On Monday AGAP called on Congress to work ""responsibly"" to create a new legal framework.
""Violence agitated by a few hundred cannot again put the jobs of hundreds of thousands of formal farm workers at risk,"" the guild said in a statement.
Agro-exports in recent years have become Peru's second-biggest generator of foreign exchange.
Peru is the world's leading exporter of blueberries, but also ships fresh grapes, asparagus and avocados to China, the United States and Europe.

CALAIS, France (Reuters) - Ali Kansu, a 54-year-old truck driver from Turkey, was on Friday hunkering down for another night sleeping at a truck stop near Calais, one of the many truckers stranded by the halting of traffic flows from Britain to France.
Kansu arrived in Calais with a cargo from Germany, in preparation for a planned handover on Monday to a colleague who would take the consignment the rest of its journey, across the Channel and into Britain.
But with France - along with many other countries - stopping arrivals from Britain because of fears of a new strain of COVID-19 there, the colleague did not show up, and is now incommunicado. 
Kansu now has to wait near Calais. He arrived on Thursday, and already spent the weekend at the truck stop, so Monday will be his fourth night there, sleeping in his cab.
""But it's not a problem,"" he told Reuters. ""I'm okay in the truck.""
When the border was shut, thousands of Europe-bound truck drivers were left stranded in Britain, some worried they would miss Christmas with their families. 
Even though trucks are still allowed to cross from the French side to Britain, in many cases they are unable to make the trip because the complex logistics chain that keeps the goods moving has been thrown out of kilter. 
Dmitri, a Ukrainian truck driver, had already given up waiting at Calais and was preparing to head back to Germany with his cargo undelivered.
He too had been due to swap his cargo with a driver coming across to Calais from Britain, but the border closure stopped the colleague arriving.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States on Monday unsealed criminal charges against a third alleged conspirator in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people, mostly Americans. 
The suspect, Abu Agila Mohammad Masud Kheir Al-Marimi, a former senior Libyan intelligence official, was charged with two criminal counts related to the bombing. He is in Libyan custody, U.S. Attorney General William Barr said, adding that U.S. officials are hopeful that Libya will allow Masud to be tried in the United States.
""No amount of time or distance will stop the United States and our Scottish partners from pursuing justice in this case,"" Barr told a news conference Monday.
The Justice Department said Masud carried the bomb that eventually blew up the plane from Libya to Malta in a suitcase and then set the device's timer.
It said that from around 1973-2011 Masud worked for Libyan intelligence, including as a bomb-making expert. It alleged Masud was involved in the 1986 bombing of the LaBelle Discotheque in West Berlin, Germany that killed two U.S. service members.
In 1991, two other alleged Libyan intelligence operatives were charged in the Lockerbie bombing: Abdel Baset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah. 
Megrahi was found guilty of the Lockerbie bombing in 2001 by a Scottish court which convened in the Netherlands. He was jailed in Scotland but later was allowed to return to Libya on compassionate grounds before dying of cancer in 2012. The Scottish court found Fhimah not guilty.
Barr said the breakthrough that led to charges against Masud came after the U.S. learned in 2016 that he ""had been arrested after the collapse of the Qaddafi regime and interviewed by a Libyan law enforcement officer in September 2012.""

The Justice Department said late Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi personally thanked Masud and Fhimah for attacking the American target, and that Qaddafi described the operation as a total success.

Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's most outspoken critics, was airlifted to Germany for treatment in August after collapsing on a plane in Russia. Germany has said he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him, an assertion many Western nations accept.
Navalny declared his poisoning case solved earlier this month when a joint media inquiry said it had identified a team of assassins from Russia's FSB security service.
In a video published on his website on Monday, Navalny said he had phoned up some of his alleged poisoners' before the joint investigation was released and posed as an aide to the secretary of Russia's Security Council.
One of the men, named by Navalny as an employee of Russia's FSB security service, spoke to him for 49 minutes and appears to have been part of the clean-up team, he said. Navalny published a recording and transcript of the conversation. 
Reuters could not independently verify the fact of the phone call or the identity of Navalny's interlocutor. 
The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that Russia tried to kill Navalny. The FSB did not immediately comment. 
In the video, Navalny can be heard asking a voice on the phone. ""Why did nothing work out?"" 
""Well, I've asked myself this question more than once,"" the voice responds. 
When asked why Navalny survived, the voice says it was probably because the plane he was on at the time made an unplanned emergency landing and he was treated professionally and quickly by Russian medics. 
""If it had been a bit longer, then it's possible it would all... have ended differently,"" the voice says. 
Putin last week dismissed media reports about Navalny's poisoning, saying they were made up of information provided by U.S. intelligence services and were an attempt to smear Putin himself and make Navalny seem more important than he really was.

Navalny is convalescing in Germany, but has said he plans to return to Russia at an undisclosed date.

LONDON (Reuters) - Two people smugglers were found guilty on Monday of the manslaughter of 39 Vietnamese men, women and children who suffocated to death in the back of a refrigerated truck as they tried to make their way to Britain.
The discovery of so many dead people - some as young as 15 - shocked Britain and Vietnam, and shone a spotlight on the illicit global trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
As oxygen levels fell in the back of the truck, some tried desperately to escape, but in vain. Others used mobile phones to say their last farewells to devastated relatives on the other side of the world.
""This is an unimaginably tragic case: 39 vulnerable people desperate for a new life were driven to put their trust in a network of unscrupulous people smugglers,"" said Russell Tyner, a prosecutor in the Organised Crime Division.
""They died through lack of oxygen, desperately trying to escape from the container. Some were able to express their last words to their families on their mobile phones when they knew their situation was hopeless.""
Eamonn Harrison, a 24-year-old lorry driver from Northern Ireland, and Gheorghe Nica, 43, from Essex, were found guilty of 39 counts of manslaughter and one count of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, following a 10-week trial at England's Central Criminal Court in London.
Two of the smuggling team had overseen two similar journeys earlier that month. 
""The men who were found guilty today made their money from misery,"" said Ben Julian Harrington, the chief constable of Essex Police. 
Most of those who died, aged between 44 and 15, were from Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial reward abroad fuel migration.
British police released tributes from the relatives of those who had died, including the parents of football fan Nguyen Huy Hung, one of the youngest on the truck at 15, and from the young son of Phan Thi Thanh, a 41-year-old mother. 
His poem ""Beloved Mommy"" included the line: ""For the people who still have a mommy, Please don’t make her cry. Please love her, and be kind. It's our mommy, my friend.""

The guilty will be sentenced at a later date.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis promised Vatican employees on Monday that none of them will lose their jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic, which has severely damaged Vatican finances. 
""You are the most important thing here. No one is to left out, no one will lose their jobs,"" Francis told workers and their children at a special audience held to exchange Christmas greetings.
The pandemic has wreaked havoc with the Vatican's finances, forcing it to dip into reserve funds and implement some of the toughest cost-control measures ever in the tiny city-state.
""No one should suffer from the ugly economic effects of this pandemic...We have to work harder to resolve this problem, which is not easy. There is no magic wand. We have to move forward as in the same family,"" Francis said in improvised remarks.
Lay employees work in all of the Vatican's administrative departments and also as gardeners, firefighters, police, maintenance workers and in its world-famous museums. 
The pandemic has drastically slowed the flow of funds from the Vatican Museums, which received some 7 million visitors last year and amount to the city's most reliable cash cow.
The museums, which generate an estimated $100 million yearly, closed for three months in the spring during the first wave of the pandemic, reopened for a limited number of visitors during the summer, and closed again as a second wave hit Italy.

Earlier this year, top Vatican administrators ordered a freeze on promotions and hirings and a ban on overtime, travel and large events in an attempt to contain costs.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Rwanda and Russia have sent troops and supplies to the Central African Republic to help counter a surge in violence by rebel groups ahead of Sunday's election, officials and a security source in Bangui said.
Security forces and U.N. peacekeepers have been battling rebels who have occupied towns and roads outside the capital.
The authorities accuse former president Francois Bozize, whose presidential candidacy was rejected by the courts, of plotting a coup with several militant groups. A spokesman for Bozize's KNK party has denied the accusations.
President Faustin-Archange Touadera, who is seeking re-election, came to office in 2016 after Bozize was overthrown in a rebellion three years earlier. He has struggled to restore stability and swathes of the country remain beyond government control. 
The CAR government said in a statement late on Sunday that Rwanda and Russia ""took steps to provide effective support which arrived on Central African territory today"". 
The Rwandan Defence Ministry confirmed in a statement that it had sent troops. 
Russia, which has previously sent arms and military contractors to CAR as it seeks to increase its influence in Africa, has not commented on reports in the media it had sent in troops and military aid. 
But a security source in Bangui said over the past few days, Russian planes have landed carrying military personnel and supplies.
On Monday, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists Russia considered the situation in CAR ""a matter of serious concern"". Touadera has friendly ties with Moscow and has a Russian national as a security adviser.
U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSCA said on Monday that there was a ""slight lull"" near the town of Yaloke following an attack over the weekend by armed groups. A security and humanitarian source also said the town of Mbaiki, about 100 km (60 miles) from Bangui was calmer following recent clashes. 
The United States, France and Russia have also accused Bozize of seeking to disrupt the election. 

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said last week rival French and Russian disinformation campaigns had sought to deceive Internet users ahead of the presidential and parliamentary vote.

918,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 21, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Special Report-Leaving Hong Kong: A family makes a wrenching decision,"By Pak Yiu and Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - In the tiny kitchen of a Hong Kong high-rise apartment, the air was heavy with the aromas of a mother making her daughter's favorite childhood dishes.
It was the mid-autumn festival, a harvest celebration that brings families together for a cherished meal, and the last one they would share before the daughter took her family away to a land far from home.
""I'll miss her soy chicken,"" Asa Lai said as her mother cooked plate after plate of Cantonese cuisine.
""I'll miss my grandchildren,"" her mother, Ada, said after her daughter left the kitchen. ""I'll miss my daughter. I don't want to see them go. I feel helpless.""
She teared up. ""I don't like to think about it. When I do, I cry.""
It had been more than a year since Asa, 41, and her husband, Willie, decided to emigrate to Scotland, leaving the city where they had both grown up, the city where their three daughters had been born. On this evening in late September, the prospect finally felt all too real.
At dinner, Asa brought out a bottle of King Robert Scotch and gave it to her father, saying, ""If you like it, you'll have to come to Scotland for more.""
Hands clasped, sitting around a dinner table laden with stir fries, stews and a steamed seabass, Asa led grace.
""As we are going to be leaving Hong Kong soon, we don't know where the road will take us, but I believe that you, Lord, will guide us and take care of us. We are thankful. Amen.""
They all raised their glasses.
Asa tried to break the silence that followed, asking: ""Isn't grandma's chicken just so delicious? Won't you miss it?"" But her mother looked away and hurriedly changed the topic to the rising cost of groceries.
Awkward dinner conversations and painful family separations echo ever louder in Hong Kong, which the Chinese government has set on a more authoritarian path with the imposition of a sweeping national security law in June that has seen a relentless crackdown on dissent.
The Lais are among hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers who are expected to emigrate, according to a study by Britain's Home Office and visa applications elsewhere, as Beijing tightens its grip over its most restive city, a former British colony that was promised wide-ranging freedoms upon its return to Chinese rule in 1997.
Unlike protesters and activists who have fled the country facing charges related to the often-violent anti-government demonstrations of 2019, the Lais are a typical middle-class, politically moderate Hong Kong family. They're leaving simply because of disillusionment with a city they love but no longer recognise.
A few days after the family celebration, Asa talked about the moment she and her husband decided to emigrate. At first, she remembered taking part in a 2-million-strong march in June 2019, a turning point in the city that launched the season of mass protests, but then she paused. It wasn't just one moment, she said.
""It's a buildup of many things, all of these things that have happened – it seems to get worse and worse. So it's hard to really pick an exact moment. I guess I would say it was the moment when freedom of speech began to shrink.""
WRENCHING DECISIONS
The Lais' wrenching decision to uproot their family, which Reuters has documented for the past five months, provides a glimpse of the deep societal wounds that mass emigration could inflict on Hong Kong, separating families and communities as people move elsewhere hoping to find the freedoms they have lost.
Officials in Hong Kong are adamant that rights and freedoms are intact. They say the national security law is needed to maintain public safety and order in the wake of last year's protests. The demonstrations saw protesters hurling bricks and Molotov cocktails at the police, setting train station exits on fire and ravaging bank branches and shops perceived to have links with pro-Beijing figures. Police often used tear gas and water cannons, and roughly 10,000 people have been arrested.
Since the imposition of the national security law, there has been a broad crackdown. Leading pro-democracy activists have been arrested, some democratic lawmakers have been disqualified, activists have fled into exile, and protest slogans and songs have been declared illegal.
A Hong Kong government spokesman said last year's ""violent protests and anarchy on the streets"" may be one of the motivations for people choosing to emigrate, along with job, schooling and business opportunities or other personal reasons.
""The implementation of the National Security Law has reverted the chaotic situation and serious violence in the past year, and restored stability and increased the confidence in Hong Kong, thereby allowing the city to resume its normal operation,"" the government spokesman said, adding that arrests were ""impartial"" and ""based on evidence.""
China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which comes under the State Council, or cabinet, and the Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing's top representative body in the city, didn't respond to requests for comment.
There are no official statistics on how many are leaving this city of 7.5 million. But several proxy measures show a rising trend of people emigrating or looking to leave. The scale could be comparable to Hong Kong's previous mass exodus during the decade leading up to the 1997 handover.
The Hong Kong government estimates that about 503,800 people left between 1987 and 1996. The outflow peaked in the wake of Beijing's bloody crackdown on the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests of 1989, with more than 66,000 departing in 1992.
Initial indications show that the new wave may be rapidly building.
The United Kingdom has issued more than 200,000 British National Overseas (BNO) passports so far this year, according to a British government official. The passports are a legacy document of the colonial era that provides a path to citizenship.
Britain estimates that 5.4 million Hong Kongers are eligible for BNOs and that as many as 322,000 will move to the country between 2021 and 2025, according to a Home Office study. From January 2021, BNO holders will be eligible to stay in Britain for five years, at which point they can apply for settlement if requirements are met and, eventually, citizenship.
Hong Kongers' other preferred destinations are Canada and Australia, both of which eased visa restrictions in the wake of the security law, according to immigration agents and relocation firms. Canada's immigration authorities said visa applications from Hong Kongers jumped more than 10% last year to 8,640. They're on track to surpass that total by almost 25% this year, according to Reuters calculations based on January-September 2020 figures. More than 2,500 Hong Kong passport holders in 
Australia have had their visas extended after Canberra unveiled new rules providing a path to Australian citizenship for people from Hong Kong in July.
If tens or hundreds of thousands of middle-class people leave the city, said Leo Shin, associate professor and convenor of the Hong Kong Studies Initiative at the University of British Columbia, ""obviously a great deal of professional expertise and local knowledge will be lost.""
""On the micro level, despite the availability of social media and other technologies, family and social ties will inevitably suffer,"" Shin said.
When Asa and Willie Lai marched with their family in last June's massive rally, they were full of hope that their Chinese-ruled city was about to take a historic turn toward greater democracy.
But authorities dug in their heels, while demonstrations turned increasingly violent. To the Lais, the chaos on the streets and the government's reaction felt instead like a turn in the opposite direction.
""I couldn't accept it anymore. I thought, 'I don't want to live here anymore,'"" Asa said. ""Two million people, and the government didn't respond to us. And as time passed, news became more and more depressing.""
""For the youth of Hong Kong, as a mother myself, even though the children out there aren't my own, to not be able to see a path in their future...,"" she said, before choking with tears.
Willie, 46, took over: ""If the youth fear speaking out, then this isn't a suitable place. The best I can do, right now, is to help my children, to bring them up in a more suitable environment.""
By August last year, their minds were made up. They had to leave Hong Kong to give their three daughters – Eunis, now 12, Caris, 11, and Yanis, 1 – a chance at the freedoms they felt they had grown up with.
It was an ""enormous"" decision, Asa said. Both had stable jobs. She's been a nurse for 23 years, most recently for a cancer support organisation. Willie, who used to climb Hong Kong's hilltops as a boy just to watch planes land, had a lucrative job handling imports and exports of aircraft parts for an airplane engineering firm.
They would be leaving behind their parents, friends, their church community. Neither they nor their daughters are fluent in English. They've been watching ""English with Lucy,"" a YouTube channel that teaches English, from pronunciation to accents – a good thing for a family going to Glasgow, a city with one of the most impenetrable accents in Britain.
They contacted an immigration agent and made enquiries about the United States, then prepared the paperwork for a visa application. But the couple dragged their feet for months. Their daughters were worried about America's hurricanes and its gun violence.
Then Beijing's imposition of the security law prompted Britain to extend residency rights to BNO passport holders. The couple renewed theirs.
They had never even been to Britain before, but they booked a one-way flight to Glasgow, via London, for Dec. 17.
They know a few people who already live there and another family who just moved – at least that's a start. If it doesn't work out, they figure, they can look at different places in Britain.
PACKING UP
The Lais have already rented a four-bedroom, three-bath home in a suburb south of Glasgow, which they'll share for five months with the other Hong Kong family who emigrated to Scotland.
The large home feels a million miles, in more ways than one, from their 600-square-foot (55 sqm) flat in the Kowloon peninsula's Diamond Hill neighbourhood just beneath Lion Rock, a small mountain that is a symbol of grit and unity in the city's folk culture.
They've lived there for a dozen years, and at times it felt as if all life on earth took place in their tiny living room.
The two elder daughters often did their homework at the dinner table, while Asa cooked in the open-plan kitchen to their left and Willie sat on the couch behind them, watching the TV.
Toddler Yanis constantly looked for her sisters' attention, while Happy the cat, a 17-year-old Scottish fold, looked to evade their gaze, hiding on a shelf from the relentless moving and shouting next to a globe spun to show Britain.
The view of towering apartment blocks dotting the lush hills across the street was spectacular from the 37th floor, but it was usually obscured by piles of toys and hanging laundry.
""Our life has been very abundant, just like our hopes,"" Asa said of the chaotic apartment.
They sold the flat for a sum they expect to sustain them for a few years until they find their feet, a privilege they're aware that other people looking to move may not have.
""We may have the financial ability,"" Asa said, ""but what about the others, the future generation of Hong Kong? We are very lucky.""
On Nov. 7, they started packing it all up. Some things were to be taken with them, some were to be thrown out, some were going to end up with Asa's parents, with whom the Lais would stay until their flight out to Glasgow.
As Eunis and Caris stacked and sealed books into large cardboard boxes, Yanis used smaller ones to play peek-a-boo.
Asa and Willie went through a big pile of clutter to decide what stays and what goes: photo albums, piano music sheets, a Bible, Chinese recipe books, newborn-baby cards, brochures from their 10-day honeymoon in Mauritius.
They stumbled upon their wedding photos.
Willie was particularly struck by one of them. He pondered it for several seconds, then hung it on the wall to look at it again. Much more withdrawn than his wife, shy about his family and friends and not keen to get too personal, he usually reacts with a long pause when emotions get intense.
The photo shows the couple on a crosswalk on Canton Road in Hong Kong's tourist area of Tsim Sha Tsui, neon lights beaming behind them. Willie, in black suit and bowtie, stands on his toes to look taller, throwing a street-smart look down into the camera. Asa, in her A-line wedding dress, her hair done by her father and makeup by Willie's brother, holds a sunflower in her right hand.
It reminds Willie of the old Hong Kong, the one that had neon signs instead of LED lights everywhere, and where planes descended uncomfortably close to the city's rooftops before landing on a tiny strip on the Kowloon peninsula rather than over the wilderness of Lantau Island where the new, modern airport was built.
""When you look at it, you know that it was taken during that period, and it's significant. It's all changed,"" Willie said of the picture.
He preferred the old Hong Kong, he explained in a separate conversation. Its transformation into a glitzy finance hub makes it easier for him to leave. ""When you ask me what I miss most about Hong Kong, well, it no longer exists,"" he said.
He had wanted to leave for a while, but it was always going to be Asa's decision. And Asa always takes her time to think things through.
She met Willie in 2001 at Ocean Park, the city's oldest theme park, where his younger brother worked. Willie was chatting with the three girlfriends she was about to meet.
""I had just come out of a relationship, so I wasn't interested in Willie,"" Asa said. ""But he persisted.""
After five years of dating, Willie took her for a walk in a park by the harbour and asked her to marry him. It took her ""a few days"" to say yes.
To this day, their relationship is a constant tango between Asa's analytical instincts and Willie's romantic approach to life.
While Willie leads the way in searching for housing and schooling options, Asa will have the final word after looking into finances and logistics.
""I take charge of making sure that our life will be functional there,"" she said.
Three days after packing their things, the movers came to empty their flat. The girls were at school; Asa was at work. Willie watched on in pensive silence, interrupted only by a few long vowels uttered in awe at how deft the workers were.
After dinner, Willie brought Asa back to the apartment for another look around before handing over the keys. The view from their living room was finally unobstructed, but Asa seemed to stare into it blankly.
""There's no more guessing where we're headed,"" she said – away from Hong Kong.
Willie then guided her to the other room, where Asa spotted a turquoise handbag in the corner, a gift from her husband.
""He did the same thing when we first moved into the place,"" Asa said. ""He doesn't usually buy me gifts. It's touching.""
CHRISTMAS MOVED FORWARD
Every year around Christmas, the Lais and the families of Asa's childhood friends Adeline, Florence and Eve get together for a big dinner.
Adeline, this year's host, stuck to the festive theme despite having to move the event forward by three weeks because of the Lais' departure. A Christmas tree stood tall in a corner of the living room, while an LED monitor screen displayed a looped video of fireplace flames, carols playing in the background.
""It's snowing over in Glasgow. It looks so beautiful,"" Asa said, showing pictures sent by her friends who live there. In Hong Kong, it was the first weekend of the dry season when temperatures dropped below 20° Celsius (68°F) at night.
The seven children in the room, donning Santa hats, played with a mass of brightly coloured inflated balls while the adults had wine from Burgundy, a 2008 Carabello-Baum Château de Pommard vintage they initially wanted to keep for Eunis' graduation.
As Caris, her 11-year-old, walked past, Asa pointed to her pink leather watch and the white faux-fur scarf wrapped around her neck – farewell presents from her friends at school.
""I've been so busy with the move that I didn't realise my kids also need to do their own farewells,"" Asa said. ""They sent me pictures with their friends at school, and when I got them I started to cry.""
Just like during Christmas Eve, they shared gifts at midnight. Eunis got a pair of earrings; Caris got a bracelet. Adeline brought out a napoleon cake with the message, ""To Lais family, new change, better life"" written on it in chocolate and gave Asa a card with pictures of all of them together taken over the past seven years.
Asa teared up.
""We also actually have something for you,"" she said, pulling out three black boxes, each containing a translucent amulet engraved with Corinthians 13:7 in traditional Chinese characters:
""It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.""
THE DEPARTURE 
In the Lais' final hours in Hong Kong, the stress began to get to Willie and Asa. A quarrel seemed inevitable over what else could fit in the four large suitcases, the duffel bag, the three carry-on bags.
""I've spent all morning packing, and now you want to rearrange everything?"" Willie told Asa.
""I need to take these with me,"" said Asa, clutching some bottles of contact lens solution. ""These are from my cousin. They're gifts!""
Asa's mother, Ada, had been in denial about her daughter's departure. She stood watching everyone in her flat moving around aimlessly, saying words they didn't mean, worrying about things they didn't need.
""Today, I'm finally accepting reality,"" Ada said.
She cooked one last meal: spicy chicken pot, Caris' favourite, stir-fried vegetables and steamed fish.
Asa's friends arrived, split into three cars, to drive them all to the airport, where more than a dozen other friends, former colleagues and people from the church awaited to say their final goodbyes.
More gifts. They'll fit somewhere.

Right before heading through the security gates, Caris handed her grandmother a letter: ""You've taken care of me, cooked my favourite meals, took me to the doctors when I was sick. Now it's my turn to take care of you. When you're feeling stressed, I will always be there to chat.""

The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party opposes the move on safety grounds, staging noisy protests and flinging pig entrails in parliament on one occasion. It has called for two days of protests outside parliament on Wednesday and Thursday.
The government says nobody will be forced to eat the pork and that the move brings Taiwan into line with international norms.
In a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said all U.S. food exports to Taiwan and its other trade partners were safe.
""Unfortunately, U.S. pork has been needlessly politicised, creating unfounded concerns about its safety among Taiwan consumers,"" it said.  
""AIT's goal is to avoid the political debate around this issue, while ensuring that consumers have the information they need to feel confident when consuming U.S. products, just as they have for decades,"" it added, providing a link to a fact sheet on the U.S. food safety regime.
Last week the institute decried ""disinformation"" from politicians about food safety after the mayor of the central Taiwanese city of Taichung, the KMT's Lu Shiow-yen, expressed her concerns about the pork issue to the top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Brent Christensen.
The issue is extremely sensitive for Taiwan's government as the United States is the Chinese-claimed island's most important international backer and supplier of arms. 
Taiwan's government hopes the easing of the U.S. pork imports will pave the way for a long-hoped for free trade deal with Washington.

Most pork consumed in Taiwan is domestically-reared, with only a tiny percentage currently coming from the United States.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The political successor of a banned party in Thailand that had strong support from young Thais failed to make inroads in weekend provincial elections that were held after months of youth-led protests.
The ballot was the first since a general election last year and the first provincial vote since Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha first took power in a 2014 coup.
Unofficial results from the 76 provinces showed the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Movement failed to win in any of the 42 provinces where it had contested.
""We apologise for not being able to win any posts for provincial heads,"" said the movement's Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, who was banned along with his Future Forward party after emerging as Prayuth's most vocal challenger.
That ban helped to prompt youth-led protests this year that have demanded Prayuth's removal as well as reforms to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, Warong Dechgitvigrom of royalist group Thai Phakdee said the provincial election's rejection of the progressive Movement showed the lack of support for groups challenging the monarchy.
Thanathorn nevertheless said the party's overall share of the vote had been similar to at the 2019 election.
Candidates linked to the Pheu Thai Party linked to populist former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra held onto some strongholds in the northeast and the north, but the party said it was hard to tell whether it had gained or lost ground overall.
Several candidates who had made clear their loyalty to Prayuth were among those elected, but many of the winners were politicians with strong local power bases without any obvious loyalty to national movements.

Provincial administrations are responsible for the provision of local services and development plans and run their own budgets.

Leyla Guven of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), along with two other opposition lawmakers, lost her status in June after a conviction was finalised in a separate trial that ruled she was a member of a terrorist organisation. 
Ankara's Western allies and rights groups condemned that move, seen as part of a broader government crackdown in which thousands of HDP officials and members have been arrested and dozens of its mayors and lawmakers unseated in recent years.
In the latest sentencing on Monday, Guven was given 14 years and three months in jail on another charge of membership of a terrorist organisation, and an additional eight years for two separate charges of disseminating terrorist propaganda. 
The opposition has accused President Tayyip Erdogan and his AK Party of seeking to quash dissent by jailing opposition members and critics since a 2016 failed coup. The government has said its actions are justified by threats facing the country.
Ankara accuses the HDP of ties to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought against the state in the largely Kurdish southeast since 1984 and is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. 
Guven had spearheaded a hunger strike by thousands of inmates who called for an end to PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan's years of isolation and demanded he receive regular access to family and lawyers. It ended in May of last year at Ocalan's request after he met his lawyers for the first time since 2011. 
Ocalan has been held in an island prison since Turkish special forces captured him in Kenya in 1999. He is revered among many Kurdish supporters of the HDP, founded in 2012.

The state has appointed caretaker mayors to 59 out of a total of 65 municipalities that the HDP won in local elections in March 2019.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Indian farmers, protesting over agricultural laws that they say threaten their livelihoods, have vowed to carry on their around-the-clock sit-ins despite cold weather that has already led to some deaths among them.
Farmers from the northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and the desert state of Rajasthan have camped on key national highways for weeks demanding a repeal of the laws, withstanding temperatures dropping to 2-3 degree Celsius (35.6-37.4 Fahrenheit).
The farmers, including a large number of older people, said they would endure the bitter winter sweeping northern India, including the capital New Delhi, to force Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration to rescind the laws introduced in September.
""It's very difficult to camp out in this weather, but we aren't scared,"" said Balbir Singh, an octogenarian from the Patiala district of Punjab. ""We won't go back until our demands are met. Even if we have to die here, we will.""
Since late November, when thousands of farmers arrived in trucks and tractors to camp out on the borders of New Delhi, nearly 30 people have died, several of them as a result of freezing weather, farmers said.
About ten people have been killed in road accidents near the protest sites, they said.
""We don't want more people to die in this protest, and I hope Modi and his government take back the laws soon,"" Paagh Singh, 76, said, wrapped in a blue blanket. ""It's a democracy, and he (Modi) has to listen to us.""
As temperatures dropped, one of the main protest sites turned into a sea of small tents and tarpaulin-covered tractor trolleys. But some demonstrators have to spend the night sleeping in the open air.

""I don't care how cold it gets,"" said farmer Surminder Singh. ""I'm neither scared of the cold nor of Modi. Our struggle will continue until the laws are withdrawn.""

LINGUERE, Senegal (Reuters) - Fari Sow bent over to pick a green shoot from what is normally parched earth at this time of year, tearing its leaves to show their freshness.
""Thank God, this year we have grass,"" the herder said on a livestock reserve in northern Senegal as plump cows munched the pasture behind him.
Abundant rains soaked West Africa's Sahel region in recent months, causing catastrophic floods in some areas that raised concerns about the rising costs of extreme weather.
But this year's downpours also created the thickest vegetation in years, satellite data show - a vital respite for Senegal's farmers and its 3 million-strong herding community after six years of drought.
Since the early 1980s, the frequency of storms has tripled in the Sahel, according to a study https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22069 in the journal Nature, which said the trend was consistent with what scientists expect from human-driven climate change.
Herders are not used to unexpected benefits in the Sahel, whose semi-arid prairies stretch eastwards from Senegal across some of the world's poorest countries.
The successive droughts in Senegal and neighbouring Mauritania and a particularly long dry season before the latest rains have helped permanently weaken pastoral livelihoods across the whole region, according to aid agency Action Against Hunger.
Meanwhile rising temperatures mean some areas could become as hot as the Sahara Desert within 80 years, according to a study in the online journal Climatic Change published in October.
This year, though, things are looking up.
RECORD VEGETATION
Sow's long-horned white cows do not have to walk far to fill their bellies as they roam the sun-baked fields studded with acacia and baobab trees. 
Cattle and sheep on the reserve are at their fattest in recent memory. The heavy rain has encouraged zornia, a nutritious plant with slender leaves that herders feared was becoming scarce, said local vet Mawdo Ngom. 
""This time last year the grass was already dry,"" Sow said in late November.
The rains have also boosted other sectors. Grains output is expected to jump over 30% this year, prompting Senegal to reverse its economic outlook for 2020 from contraction to growth.
Vegetation levels have hit record highs this year in more central parts of the Sahel, including Niger and Chad, the satellite data from Action Against Hunger show.
This should have proved a blessing for the two-thirds of the region's population dependent on farming or herding. But conflict across Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has cut off access to farms and displaced communities.
Partly as result of this, the region is facing its worst food crisis in a decade with potentially over 23 million people needing aid to survive the upcoming dry season, according to the Cadre Harmonise, a regional food security framework under the auspices of the United Nations.
DRYING HEAT
Dramatic climate swings year to year are normal for the Sahel, making it hard to assess the impact of climate change on current conditions or predict what Senegal should prepare for in the long term, climate scientist Sylwia Trzaska of Columbia University's Earth Institute said.
""We are very uncertain about which way the rainfall is going to evolve, but temperatures are rising, especially during the dry season, that's a given,"" she said.
Senegal has escaped the violence devastating its neighbours, but some herders doubt the sustainability of their way of life given their struggle to get through recent dry seasons.
Sitting in his family's traditional home of woven branches, herder Dioubeyrou Ka, 67, said drought has made it hard to find the long-stalked plant needed to thatch his roof.
""Often we went in our carts from morning till night, searching for water so our children could have a drink,"" he said, tossing back thimble-sized glasses of tea.
If dry seasons keep getting hotter as projected under climate models, water resources will dry out quicker during these periods, putting additional pressure on herders and their livestock, Trzaska said.
On the reserve, where some herders have settled, Ngom says it's quiet. Earlier in the year nomadic herders desperate for pasture came in droves, piling children, possessions and baby goats onto carts pulled by three donkeys abreast. He does not expect such numbers this season.

""Herders - if nature smiles on them, they forget all their problems,"" said the vet, strolling past cows he deemed to be reassuringly stout.

(Reuters) - Farmers leaders sought to step up pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal three agricultural reform laws on Monday by starting a 24-hour relay hunger strike.
Modi's government is urging the farmers to engage in further talks to end a deadlock which has led to thousands camping on the outskirts of New Delhi for more than three weeks.
The protests have blocked roads connecting the national capital with neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, hitting public transport and the supply of fruit and vegetables.
""We are going on a 24-hour relay hunger strike, skipping meals, to press our demands of repealing three agricultural laws,"" Yogendra Yadav, a prominent protest leader, said.
Leaders called on their supporters to skip one meal on Dec. 23, in solidarity with the protests against new laws, approved by parliament in September without much debate, which farmers fear could pave the way for ending state procurement of crops, while helping big retail buyers.
Modi has defended the laws saying these would help increase farmers income as it would encourage more private investments in cold-stores, procurement and distribution. 
More than 30 protesters have died in recent weeks, mainly due to the cold as they were sleeping in the open with temperatures falling to 4 degree Celsius, farmer leaders said.
Farmers leaders also called upon their supporters to boycott Modi's monthly radio address. 

""People should bang their utensils at home on Sunday when Modi speaks up on radio,"" Jagjit Singh Dallewal, president of the Bharti Kisan Union, said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - When Jesus strode through the ancient Jewish temple in Jerusalem, his feet met hewn-stone, earth-tone tiles that were geometric in design and cool, dappled and scuffed to the touch.
Such is the understanding of Israeli archaeologists and masons who, drawing on relics and historical texts, have recreated the sacred flooring so it can be experienced today.
""We even made the scratches and all kind of marks that created the same appearance as it used to look like at the time,"" archaeologist Assaf Avraham told Reuters near the one- metre square, ankle-high replica on the Mount of Olives, overlooking Jerusalem's Old City and holy sites.
According to the New Testament, Jesus went to the temple as a boy for pilgrimage and study and, as an older preacher, cast out its money-changers in anger. The Gospel of John describes him ""walking in the temple in the portico of Solomon"".
The temple was designed by King Herod, as were other grand structures in Roman-era Judea. Surviving tiles from those ruins told the archaeologists what materials had been used - hand-tooled limestone and Dead Sea stone, as well as imported marble - and that the inlay had been the ornate ""Opus Sectile"" style. 
Josephus Flavius, a Jewish historian of the period, wrote that temple courts were ""laid with stones of all sorts"", another indication the tiles were of various colours and textures. 
Recreating the floor was ""very tough work"" that took seven months, said Avi Tavisal, manager of the team of artisans. 

""But it was very interesting, and we made it with all our hearts,"" he said. ""We hope that this will be something that the people can come and see and feel and touch and feel the feeling how it was 2,000 years before.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Inspiration for high fashion can come from strange places. For one Taiwanese designer, it's upcycling old wires and bolts from the power industry. 
Wang Li-ling, 36, scours dumps, picking up old bits of metal and wires from Taiwan's main electricity supplier to add extra flair to her clothes.
""For example, there's quite a lot of material from Taipower that they have phased out,"" Wang told Reuters in her studio. 
""These materials have been used for more than 20 or 30 years. At least more than 10 years. So their colour or the mottled feeling they give you is different from new material.""
The wires and other materials are stitched onto dresses and other items of clothing, giving them a futuristic feeling, and drawing a warm reception at a fashion show in Taipei on Friday.
""Actually, it is my first time seeing a Taiwan fashion designer turning recycled things into new ideas,"" said Taiwanese lifestyle influencer Andrew Chen, who was at the show. 
""Everyone knows the fashion industry is about fast fashion. And it is wasteful. It expanded my horizons today that I saw how to use old materials to create something new, and then present it with creativity."" 
A popular destination for trendy tourists in pre-coronavirus times, Taiwan has an up-and-coming fashion scene, whose designers are starting to make an impact on the world stage.

With many global events shuttered or moved online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan put on Taipei Fashion Week in October featuring live shows, a testament to the island's successful efforts to control the spread of the illness.

During the anti-government protests which have largely died down, many demonstrators wore masks to hide their identities from authorities and to protect themselves from tear gas. 
Surgical masks have also long been common in the financial hub for when people are sick and the ruling comes at a time when Hong Kong people are mandated to wear masks to curb the spread of COVID-19.
The Court of Final Appeal went further than a lower-court decision in April which upheld the government's right to impose emergency measures but ruled the mask ban was unconstitutional.
Opposition lawmakers and activists in the former British colony lodged a judicial review on the anti-mask law last year.

Joshua Wong, 24, one of Hong Kong’s most prominent democracy activists, was arrested for allegedly breaching the anti mask law and his participation in an unlawful anti-government rallies in 2019.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Relatives of some of the 12 Hong Kong people captured by China at sea as they tried to flee by boat asked authorities on Monday to give them 20-days' notice of their trial so they can attend.
The 11 men and one woman were intercepted by the Chinese coastguard on Aug. 23 on a boat, believed to be bound for Taiwan. All had faced charges in Hong Kong linked to anti-government protests in the former British colony, including rioting and violation of a national security law China imposed in June.
They face charges of illegally crossing the border and organising an illegal crossing, which could carry a sentence of up to seven years.
Their case has attracted a lot of interest in Hong Kong as a rare instance of Chinese authorities arresting people trying to leave at a time of growing fears about prospects for the city’s high degree of autonomy.
The 12 await trial in the mainland city of Shenzhen. Two underage suspects will undergo private hearings.
Trial dates have not been announced and the relatives said that given a 14-day quarantine period upon entering mainland China because of the coronavirus, those hoping to attend the trail would need longer notice than normal.
""We're worried that the Chinese authorities will use the pandemic as an excuse ... to prevent us from attending ... and the hearings will thus be equivalent to a secret trial,"" they said in a joint statement.
They asked to be given notice 20 days before the trial and that it be broadcast online, foreign diplomats be allowed to observe and all records be made public.
Chinese authorities have denied family and lawyers access to the 12, insisting they be represented by officially appointed lawyers.
The relatives reiterated on Monday their request to be allowed to speak to their loved ones.
""Our hearts are heavy,"" the wife of detainee Wong Wai-Yin told reporters outside the Hong Kong Immigration Department. 
Unlike in Hong Kong, where the justice system is independent and based on common law, mainland courts are loyal to the Communist Party and do not challenge the party's accusations. Conviction rates are close to 100%.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Opponents of Nepal's prime minister turned to the Supreme Court on Monday to challenge his dissolution of parliament and the calling of an election, denouncing it as a ""constitutional coup"".
Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli's dissolution of parliament on Sunday raises the prospect of months of political turmoil in the Himalayan country as it battles the novel coronavirus.
Seven government ministers stepped down after Oli's dissolution saying it was violation of the ""popular mandate"" given to them in a 2017 general election. Protesters burned effigies of him in the streets.
Supreme Court Spokesman Bhadrakali Pokharel said three petitions against the dissolution were ""in the process of being registered"".
""Under the constitution, the prime minister has no prerogative to dissolve parliament,"" lawyer Dinesh Tripathi, who is one of the petitioners, told Reuters.
""It's a constitutional coup. I'm seeking a stay order from the court.""
The president on Sunday set April 30 and May 10 as dates for the general election - more than a year ahead of schedule - on the advice of Oli's cabinet.
The prime minister has recently lost support within his own Nepal Communist Party (NCP), with some members accusing him of sidelining the party in government decisions and shunning members when making key appointments.
They have called on him to step down.
His supporters say that in a democracy, a new election is the best way out of a crisis like this.
The strife comes as Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, battles the coronavirus. 
Nepal has had 253,772 infections and 1,788 deaths and the pandemic has battered its tourism-and-remittance-dependent economy.
Tripathi said that under the constitution, the prime minister should allow the formation of an alternate government to ensure stability in a country that has seen 26 prime ministers in 30 years.
If the court registers the petitions it could take about two weeks for a decision, legal experts say. 

Neighbours China and India, which jostle for influence in Nepal, have not publicly commented on the upheaval.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - At least eight Katyusha rockets landed in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone in an attack targeting the U.S. Embassy, causing some minor damage on the compound on Sunday, the Iraqi military and the embassy said on Sunday.
The Iraqi military said an ""outlaw group"" fired eight rockets. Most of the missiles hit a residential complex and a security checkpoint inside the zone, damaging buildings and cars and wounding one Iraqi soldier, a military statement said.
Sirens blared from the embassy compound inside the zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions.
An anti-rocket system diverted one of the rockets, said one security official whose office is inside the Green Zone.
The U.S. Embassy condemned the attack and urged all Iraqi political and governmental leaders to take steps to prevent such attacks and to hold accountable those responsible.
""The U.S. Embassy confirms rockets targeting the International Zone resulted in the engagement of Embassy defensive systems. There was some minor damage on the Embassy compound but no injuries or casualties,"" it said in a statement.
In a subsequent statement, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there had been at least one Iraqi civilian casualty and wished those hurt a speedy recovery. 
U.S. officials blame Iran-backed militia for regular rocket attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq, including near the embassy in Baghdad. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility.
Pompeo called such militias the most serious impediment to peace and prosperity in Iraq, and added: 
""We call on all Iraqis to support their government’s efforts to reinforce Iraq’s sovereignty, to bring to justice those responsible for these reprehensible attacks and ensure that all the currently Iran-backed militias are under state control.""
A spokesman for the Iraqi president also condemned the attack.
An array of militia groups announced in October that they had suspended rocket attacks on U.S. forces on condition that Iraq's government present a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops.
But a rocket strike on the U.S. Embassy on Nov. 18 was a clear sign that Iranian-backed militias had decided to resume attacks on U.S. bases, according to Iraqi security officials.
Washington, which is slowly reducing its 5,000 troops in Iraq, threatened to shut its embassy unless the Iraqi government reins in Iran-aligned militias.

While it is not the first time China's carriers have passed close to Taiwan, it comes at a time of heightened tension between Taipei and Beijing, which claims the democratically ruled island as its territory.
The Shandong carrier group sailed through the Taiwan Strait a day after a U.S. warship transited the same waterway. China's military said it tailed the ship.
China's navy said the Shandong and its accompanying ships had ""smoothly"" transited the sensitive and narrow Taiwan Strait on Sunday, heading for exercises in the South China Sea, where China has extensive and disputed territorial gains.
The drills are part of ""normal arrangements made in accordance with annual plans"", it said. ""In the future, we will continue to organise similar operations based on training needs.""
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the Shandong was accompanied by four warships and had set out from the northern Chinese port of Dalian on Thursday. Taiwan said it sent six warships and eight air force aircraft to ""stand guard"" and monitor the Chinese ships' movements.
The Shandong is China's second carrier, and was formally commissioned almost exactly a year ago.
Since then, it has successfully completed tasks such as carrier-based aircraft take-off and landing and use of its weapons, the Chinese navy said. 
""The combat capability of the formation system has been continuously improved in experimental training,"" it added, referring to the group of warships which accompany the Shandong.
China has been working to hone its carrier operations, but has little experience compared to the United States, which has operated integrated carrier battle groups with multiple vessels for decades.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's government approved a ninth consecutive rise in military spending on Monday, funding the development of an advanced stealth fighter and longer-range anti-ship missile to counter China's growing military power.
The Ministry of Defense will get a record 5.34 trillion yen ($51.7 billion) for the year starting in April, up 1.1% from this year. With Suga's large majority in parliament, enactment of the budget is all but certain.
Suga is continuing the controversial military expansion pursued by his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, to give Japan's forces new planes, missiles and aircraft carriers with greater range and potency against potential foes including neighbouring China.
China plans to raise its military spending 6.6% this year, the smallest increase in three decades.
Japan is buying longer-range missiles and considering arming and training its military to strike distant land targets in China, North Korea and other parts of Asia.
A planned jet fighter, the first in three decades, is expected to cost around $40 billion and be ready in the 2030s. That project, which will be led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd with help from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), gets $706 million in the new budget.
Japan will spend $323 million to begin development of a long-range anti-ship missile to defend its southwestern Okinawan island chain.
Other big purchases include $628 million for six Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, including two short-takeoff and vertical-landing (STOVL) B variants that will operate off a converted helicopter carrier. 
The military will also get $912 million to build two compact warships that can operate with fewer sailors than conventional destroyers, easing pressure on a navy struggling to find recruits in an ageing population.
Japan also wants two new warships to carry powerful new Aegis air and ballistic missile defence radars that have much as three times the range of older models. The government has not yet estimated the cost of the plan, which replaces a project cancelled in June to construct two ground Aegis Ashore stations.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's non-profit group, the Archewell Foundation, is teaming up with celebrity chef Jose Andres to build a series of Community Relief Centers.
The centers will be permanent structures that can be opened quickly as service kitchens during emergencies such as natural disasters, and also serve as food distribution hubs, schools and medical clinics.
""The health of our communities depends on our ability to connect with our shared humanity,"" said Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in statement to the press. ""When we think about Chef Andres and his incredible team at World Central Kitchen, we're reminded that even during a year of unimaginable hardship, there are so many amazing people willing and working tirelessly to support each other.""
The first of four centers is slated to open in 2021 on the Caribbean Island of Dominica, which was hit by both Hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017. The second center will be built in Puerto Rico, which was also hard hit by the storms.
The charity will seek support from other groups to build more such centers around the world.
The Duke and Duchess stepped down from their roles as working members of the royal family at the end of March and moved to California and have largely eschewed the public spotlight.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Central African Republic's main opposition coalition on Sunday demanded the Dec. 27 election be postponed due to violence by armed groups outside the capital Bangui, but the government insisted the vote would go ahead.
On Saturday, the authorities accused former president Francois Bozize of plotting a coup after his candidacy was rejected. United Nations peacekeepers also dispersed armed rebel groups occupying roads and towns near Bangui.
Fighting was going on in several towns, including Mbaiki, about 100 km (62 miles) from Bangui on Sunday, according to one security source and two humanitarian sources. 
The opposition alliance, called Cod2020, which includes Bozize, said violence was preventing presidential and parliamentary candidates from campaigning and had led to the destruction of electoral material and threats in almost all provincial centres, without providing details.
In a statement, it ""noted the impossibility of pursuing an electoral campaign in current insecure conditions,"" and demanded the postponement of the vote until stability is restored.
In response, the government said it was doing everything possible to ensure the vote could take place as planned, deploying troops alongside U.N. peacekeepers to regain control of occupied towns.
""There is no plan B, the elections will take place on December 27,"" government spokesman Ange Maxime Kazagui said.
A number of planes from Russia, an ally of President Faustin-Archange, landed in Central African Republic this weekend, the security source and a source at the airport said.
The Russian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on whether Russia had sent planes. It has previously sent arms and security contractors to CAR, while Russian national Valery Zakharov is a security adviser to Touadera.
In a statement on Saturday, the Russian foreign ministry said a representative had talked with CAR's foreign minister by phone to reaffirm Russia's support for the country and its government's efforts to ensure security.
Touadera, who is seeking re-election, has struggled to maintain stability. 
Bozize was ousted in 2013 by mainly Muslim Seleka rebels, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militias and plunging the country into a civil war.
He could not be reached for comment on the government allegations he had plotted with members of his family and a number of armed groups to attack two towns near Bangui.

MOSTAR, Bosnia (Reuters) - Citizens in Bosnia's ethnically divided town of Mostar voted for their city councillors on Sunday for the first time in 12 years, after the rival Croat and Bosniak parties that rule the town agreed on long-disputed electoral rules.
The town, in the south of the country, is renowned for its Ottoman-era Old Bridge over the river Neretva, which was destroyed during Bosnia's war in the 1990s but has since been restored.
It is the most multi-ethnic town in Bosnia, but the Croat and Bosniak communities have been largely separated by the river since the end of the war in which they fought each other.
Mostar has not held an election since 2008 because its Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks were unable to agree on electoral rules. 
But the dispute has been settled thanks to a 2019 court ruling won by Irma Baralija, a philosophy teacher who filed a
suit against Bosnia at the European human rights court for failing to hold elections in Mostar. 
""This is a very emotional day, for us this has already been a victory,"" Baralija told Reuters TV, after casting her ballot. She is standing for the multi-ethnic Our Party in the election.
The voters will choose 35 city councillors from six ethnically-based electoral units and a central city zone. 
About 17% of about 100,000 registered voters had cast their ballots by 1000 GMT, obeying measures against the coronavirus pandemic, election authorities said. The polling stations will close at 1900 (1800 GMT) and the preliminary results are expected around midnight. 
The Croat and Bosniak nationalist HDZ and SDA parties have held a firm grip over Mostar for the past quarter century, each governing its own part of the divided town and its separate utilities, postal companies, universities and hospitals.
The city centre is still dominated by buildings damaged during the war and much of the town's infrastructure is in disrepair. Many state-owned firms in the town have shut down due to mismanagement and there has been exodus of young people.
""I expect the city to start functioning because so far nothing has been functioning,"" said Hedija Hadzic, a woman in her 50s, after casting the ballot.

""At least, we'll get the city council.""

Sikhs in India and abroad have rallied against recent measures to deregulate agriculture markets that they fear would erode farm incomes by giving a greater say to profit-chasing private companies, instead of assuring a minimum price like in government-regulated wholesale markets.
Protesting farmers, mainly from Sikh-dominated Punjab and neighbouring Haryana, have blocked highways into New Delhi for the past three weeks demanding a repeal of the laws, which the government says widen the agriculture market and are crucial to boost storage and other infrastructure.
The protesters have repeatedly rebuffed Modi and his ministers' attempts to reach a compromise, in what has become the biggest challenge from the country's farmers in his six-year rule.
On Wednesday, a 65-year-old Sikh priest committed suicide at one of the protest sites. The farmers have called for a 24-hour rotating hunger strike from Monday among protesters at home and abroad.
Modi, whose security detail often keeps him far away from the general public, prayed at the Gurudwara Rakab Ganj Sahib, interacted with Sikh religious leaders there and obliged visitors seeking to take pictures with him.
The temple near the Parliament House was where Sikh saint Guru Teg Bahadur was cremated.
""I felt extremely blessed,"" Modi said on Twitter.
While some social media users and his party colleagues welcomed Modi's visit to the shrine like a ""common man, without any restrictions"", others urged him to try and end the protests where tens of thousands of farmers, many in their sixties or above, are sleeping in the open in the cold.

""A request to @narendramodi please visit #FarmersProtests site as well where #Farmers are peacefully protesting,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Belarus, a country of 9.5 million, which Russia sees as a security buffer against NATO, has been rocked by mass protests since an Aug. 9 presidential election that veteran President Alexander Lukashenko said he won. His opponents say the vote was rigged and have been demanding his resignation.
Instead of coming together in one big march, as in the first months of the protests, demonstrators have increasingly adopted a different tactic, participating in multiple small-scale marches across the capital that start at staggered times throughout the day. 
More than 30,000 people have been detained in Belarus since the start of the protests in August, according to opposition leaders.
Two female journalists were among those detained on Sunday, the Belarusian Association of Journalists said. 

Lukashenko has been in power for 26 years. The European Union imposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 50 Belarusian officials in protest over the election, which the West says was rigged, and over Lukashenko's crackdown on opponents.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday appeared to add his own thumbs-down to widespread criticism of an unorthodox nativity scene in St. Peter's Square, telling visitors to instead visit a nearby exhibition of traditional crèches.
At his last Sunday blessing and address before Christmas, Francis also said the holy day that marks the birth of Jesus had been ""kidnapped"" by consumerism.
Speaking from his window overlooking the square, Francis twice urged people to visit an outdoor exhibit under the square's colonnade where 100 small traditional nativity scenes are on display. 
They demonstrated ""how people try to use art to show how Jesus was born (and)... are a great religious education of our faith,"" he said.
He made no mention of the main nativity in the centre of the square, a larger-than-life ceramic assembly of statues that includes an astronaut and a character reminiscent of Darth Vader from Star Wars.
It has received scathing reviews in the media and from visitors, many of whom have expressed emotions ranging from puzzlement to contempt.
The Vatican displays a different donated nativity scene each year, chosen by its municipal government.
This year's was made between 1965 and 1975 by students and teachers in Castelli, an Italian town famous for ceramics. The astronaut represents the lunar landings of the late 1960s and early 1970s, according to a description for visitors.
In his address, Francis also warned against ""frenetic"" consumerism during the Christmas season, urging people to remember those who have nothing.

""Consumerism has kidnapped Christmas, (taking it) away from us,"" he said. ""There is no consumerism in the manger in Bethlehem. What is there is reality, poverty and love.""

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal's president dissolved parliament on Sunday at the request of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli's cabinet and announced that general elections would be held in April and May, more than a year ahead of schedule.
The move plunges the Himalayan country, which has seen revolving-door governance since street protests restored multi-party democracy in 1990, into political turmoil as it battles the coronavirus pandemic.
Seven ministers stepped down, including the tourism head, citing Oli's decision to go against the ""popular mandate"" given to them in the 2017 general election. Protesters burned effigies of him in various parts of the capital Kathmandu.
President Bidhya Devi Bhandari's office said in a statement that the April 30 and May 10 voting dates were recommended by Oli's cabinet following an emergency meeting.
Oli, 68, pushed for a fresh mandate after his Nepal Communist Party (NCP) accused him of sidelining his party in government decisions and appointments. He had led an alliance with former Maoist rebels to a landslide win in the last vote.
""The prime minister has lost the majority in the parliamentary party, central committee and the secretariat of the party,"" said Bishnu Rijal, an NCP central committee member.
""Instead of seeking a compromise within the party, he chose to dissolve parliament.""
Oli's decision came after some lawmakers from his party registered a vote of no confidence against him in the 275-member lower house of parliament, NCP lawmaker Pampha Bhusal said.
Sandwiched between China and India, politics in Nepal is also influenced by the priorities of its giant neighbours. India has been pushing back against Beijing's growing clout in a country that New Delhi considers its own backyard.
Oli aide Rajan Bhattarai said the prime minister had acted in response to the backlash from his party, which had also asked him to consider quitting as its president.
Politicians and social media users said the ruling party should have tried out other political combinations to run the country instead of calling an untimely election when its tourism-dependent economy has been battered by the pandemic.
Nepal's 2015 charter does not give the prime minister the prerogative to dissolve parliament without exhausting alternatives, constitutional expert Bipin Adhikari said.
""It is unconstitutional at the first sight,"" he said, adding that the decision could be challenged in the Supreme Court, which may take a couple of weeks to decide its legality.
After his 2017 win, Oli had vowed to ensure political stability, fight corruption and poverty but has made little progress, especially since the pandemic.

Coronavirus infections have reached 253,772, with 1,788 deaths, in the country of 30 million people.

Speaking at an event commemorating 100 years since the founding of the SVR foreign intelligence service, Putin said the agency and other security services were a crucial guarantee of Russia's ""sovereign, democratic, independent development.""
Some international cyber researchers have suggested that Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service may have been behind an unprecedented attack on U.S. government computer systems first reported by Reuters last week.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that Russia was responsible for the attack. The Kremlin has always denied Moscow's involvement in cyber attacks against the West. It has said that Russia had nothing to do with this latest assault.
Putin told attendees of the event, which also marked the Day of the Security Services Worker, that it was important to continue developing the work of counterintelligence agencies.
""I know what I'm talking about here,"" Putin, a former KGB agent, said, in comments shared on the Kremlin website. ""And I rate very highly the difficult professional operations that have been conducted.""
""The most serious attention must be paid to information security, to the fight against extremism and against corruption,"" he added.
He also told members of the agency to pay particular attention to risks posed by conflicts ""simmering"" near the country's borders. 
Clashes have again been reported between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave despite a Russian-brokered ceasefire. Weekly anti-government protests continue in Belarus.

""I expect that the Foreign Intelligence Service will continue to respond flexibly to the highly changeable international context, actively participating in identifying and neutralising potential threats to Russia, and improving the quality of its analytical materials,"" Putin said.

The incident happened in the Lideta area near the centre of the capital, Ethiopia News Agency reported, adding the explosion killed three homeless people and injured five others. 
The explosion occurred amid a six-week conflict in northern Tigray region between federal forces and a rebellious force there, but there was no indication it was linked to that.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's navy and air force were deployed on Sunday as a Chinese aircraft carrier group led by the country's newest carrier, the Shandong, sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, the day after a U.S. warship transited the same waterway.
While it is not the first time China's carriers have passed close to Taiwan, it comes at a time of heightened tension between Taipei and Beijing, which claims the democratically-ruled island as its territory.
Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese military activity, including China's regular flying of air force aircraft near the island. China says such drills are aimed at protecting the country's sovereignty.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the Shandong, which was formally commissioned almost exactly one year ago, accompanied by four warships had set out from the northern Chinese port of Dalian on Thursday.
After passing through the narrow Taiwan Strait on Sunday, the carrier group was continuing in a southerly direction, it added.
China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
China has previously said that such trips by its carriers through the strait are routine missions, often on their way to exercises in the disputed South China Sea.
Taiwan's ministry said that six warships and eight air force aircraft were sent to ""stand guard"" and monitor the Chinese ships' movements.
""With the support of the people, the national armed forces have the confidence and ability to guard the homeland, and ensure national security and safeguard regional peace and stability,"" it added.
On Saturday, a U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait, the 12th such mission by the U.S. Navy this year.
China's military said it tailed the ship.
Beijing has been angered by increased U.S. support for Taiwan, including new arms sales and visits to Taipei by senior U.S. officials, further straining already poor Sino-U.S. ties.

Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is overseeing a revamp of the island's military, rolling out new equipment such as ""carrier killer"" stealth corvettes.

KANKARA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Annas Shuaibu says he awoke to the sound of gunshots fired by men who burst into his boarding school in northwest Nigeria in a nighttime raid. He and hundreds of other boys were rounded up and forcibly marched out of the school and into a nearby forest. 
After several hours trekking through woodland, the gunmen ordered them to stop walking and warned them not to try to flee, Shuaibu said. ""They said even if you tried to escape, or we allowed you to run, you will go nowhere. Rather, you will die in the forest,"" he said.
Shuaibu, 16, was among 344 students who were kidnapped from Government Science Secondary School, an all-boys boarding school, on Dec. 11 in the town of Kankara, in Katsina state.
The boys were held for six days before security services rescued them on Thursday from Rugu forest, a vast woodland area that spans four of Nigeria's 36 states.
The incident stoked anger about the insecurity that has gripped much of the country, Africa's most populous, and evoked memories of Boko Haram's 2014 kidnapping of more than 270 schoolgirls in the northeastern town of Chibok.
Dressed in a turquoise kaftan and smiling broadly while playing football with friends near his home in Kankara, Shuaibu seemed carefree a day after being reunited with his family.
But the smile left his face when he described the conditions in which he and the other boys were held. 
""I was really scared because I didn't know where we were going,"" he said, speaking softly and often looking at the ground as he described walking through the forest and the boys being beaten by their captors. 
Shuaibu, who said he did not know how many people held them, said the boys received little food, sometimes resorting to eating leaves and drinking from pools of water in the forest. 
Another freed student told Reuters, hours after the boys' release on Friday, that the kidnappers had initially taken them to a hiding place. 
""But when they saw a jet fighter, they changed the location and hid us in a different place. They gave us food, but it was very little,"" said the student, who did not give his name.
On Friday, with their ordeal over, the boys were taken to meet the governor and then President Muhammadu Buhari.
Many details surrounding the incident remain unclear, including who was responsible, whether ransom was paid and how the release was secured. The Islamist militant group Boko Haram said it was responsible for the abductions but there was no confirmation of this.
PARENTS WORRY
The joy of being free has not worn off for 14-year-old Muhammed Bello. 
""Now that I returned back home, I'll continue playing and do what I like,"" he said, with a broad grin. ""I'm very happy.""
But the raid made parents fearful. 
Shuaibu's father, who previously told Reuters his son was 13, said he would not send the boy back to the school unless there was ""proper security"". 
Attacks by armed gangs, widely known as bandits, are common throughout northwestern Nigeria. The groups attack civilians, stealing from them or kidnapping them for ransom.
A criminal gang attempted to abduct 80 schoolchildren and take them into a forest in the Dandume area of Katsina state on Saturday night, Katsina police said on Sunday.
All the children were rescued, along with four other people who were also abducted, after police and a local vigilante group exchanged gunfire with the gang, police spokesman Gambo Isah said in a statement. 
Following the rescue of the boys taken from Kankara, Katsina Governor Aminu Bello Masari said security will be strengthened at schools across the state. 
When the Kankara children were reunited with their parents on Friday weeping mothers and fathers hugged their boys, and some parents knelt to kiss the ground in gratitude.
Shuaibu recalled his fear of never seeing his family again.

""We feel extremely happy,"" he said. ""Some of us didn't expect that we would return.""

CHATEL, France/LES CROSETS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Like other French ski resorts, the Alpine town of Chatel has been forced to close its lifts over the Christmas period as part of tougher government curbs to contain the coronavirus.
But just 5 km (3 miles) away, holidaymakers are schussing down the same slopes on the other side of the border in Switzerland, where less strict restrictions mean it's business as usual in the Dents du Midi ski region.
Chatel mayor Nicolas Rubin was so annoyed by the sharp divergence in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic that he hung Swiss flags from the town hall windows for a week in protest.
    ""Of course we are worried, because beyond the closing of the ski resort the morale and the mental health of people is starting to be affected,"" he said.
Jean-Francois Vuarand, Chatel's tourism chief, said the year-end holidays normally generated a fifth of winter season turnover. 
""The problem is... it is difficult to make customers understand that at the border, in these two nearby areas, there are two different rules for the same activity,"" he said.
For Quentin Decoursier, owner of restaurant Le Comptoir on the French side, the discrepancy is manifestly unfair. 
""What is going to happen is that a lot of French people will go there (across the border) and we don't understand because we have as much right as they have to be open,"" he said.
While the two countries have similar COVID infection and fatality rates, Swiss authorities have let individual cantons decide whether lifts can operate safely, though Dents du Midi tourism director Sebastien Epiney said his community was also living on the edge.
""We are putting in place all our assets to offer a safe product to our customers, but the sword of Damocles is over our heads,"" he said.
Yoan Perroud, shrugged of the risk of skiing, saying outdoor activity was not as risky as the restaurants and bars that support them.

""For me the problem is not the ski slopes, it's what is next to them,"" he said from Les Crosets, a resort on the Swiss side.

Disrupted communications and poor weather were hampering the damage assessment effort but Red Cross volunteers were assisting those in need, Rokotunidau said.
There were concerns about the spread of diseases. 

Australia is sending air force aircraft to help with surveillance of storm-affected areas and has offered further assistance to Fiji if needed.

The 43.2 trillion rupiah ($3.07 billion) port in the town of Subang, 140 km (90 miles) east of the capital Jakarta, is one of the government’s priority infrastructure projects, designed to boost Southeast Asia's largest economy and relieve pressure on Jakarta’s congested Tanjung Priok port.
Speaking via link from the state palace, the president, widely known as Jokowi, said the first of three phases of the strategic project in Indonesia’s most populous province had been finished.
“Amid the pandemic, one of the national strategic projects, Patimban, has been completed,” he said. “With its strategic location, I am sure that Patimban will be key in connecting different sectors, from industrial manufacturing to agriculture, and increasing exports.”
Built with funding from the Japanese government, the port is expected to boost Indonesia’s economic recovery, after the Southeast Asian nation entered a recession for the first time in 22 years in the third quarter.
The government has targeted the port to boost the competitiveness of Indonesia’s exports, particularly in the automotive sector.
Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi said an operational trial of the port had been carried out this month, ahead of the first official day of operation on Sunday.
“In this inaugural operation, the first exports from Patimban will be carried out, including 140 cars made by Toyota and Daihatsu that will be sent to Brunei Darussalam,” he said.
Expected to be finished in entirety by 2027, the port is also expected to generate up to five million jobs in West Java.

The parade, followed by a toy run to donate toys to kids, is a global tradition around Christmas time. In Tokyo, the event is held by members of the ""Harley Santa Club"", founded in 2008.
At the parade, bikers said this year's event meant more, because more children were vulnerable to domestic violence during the coronavirus year. 
""Especially because of the coronavirus pandemic this year, I think there are many child abuse cases out of sight,"" said Takashi Mine, director of the event.
""It is very likely now that parents will take the stress out on their children after losing their jobs, so I think particularly during the pandemic we have to do the parade,"" he said.
The number of child abuse cases in Japan per month rose up to 20% between January and March versus the same period last year, as more families spent time at home because of the pandemic, the daily Asahi Shimbun reported. 
The number of reported child abuse cases was a record high last year, according to the health ministry.
Normally hundreds of motorcyclists take part in the parade, but because of coronavirus only about 100 rode this year.

Still, riders proudly roared their engines to bring Christmas joy to kids living in children's homes. Riders plan to visit four homes in Tokyo this year to donate toys and candy to about 400 children.

The neighbouring states of Victoria and Queensland have banned people arriving from Sydney as of Monday.
""If you are from greater Sydney now is not the time to travel to Queensland,"" Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told a news conference.
South Australia state imposed a 14-day quarantine for Sydney arrivals on Sunday and banned travellers from affected suburbs. The island state of Tasmania took a similar steps on Saturday.
Western Australia state imposed a hard border closure.
About a quarter of a million people in Sydney's northern beach suburbs where the outbreak has occurred have been put into a strict lockdown until Christmas Eve.
On Sunday, New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian said public gathering across the rest of Sydney will be limited, with household gatherings capped at 10 participants and hospitality venues at 300, among other restrictions.
""We must take this action now to ensure we keep on top of this outbreak,"" said New South Wales (NSW) state Premier Gladys Berejiklian.
She also urged people in the greater Sydney area to wear masks in public, although it was not mandatory.
""If you're going grocery shopping anywhere in NSW, please wear a mask, if you're going to a place of worship in NSW, please wear a mask ... and for goodness sake, do not get on public transport unless you're wearing a mask.""
Until this week, Australia had gone more than two weeks without any local transmission and had lifted most restrictions ahead of Christmas. The Sydney outbreak and border restrictions have thrown Christmas holiday travel plans into chaos.
The annual Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race starting Boxing Day Dec. 26 has been cancelled for the first time in its 76 year history as crews and their families would have to quarantine on arrival in Tasmania.
Hotels and holiday rentals in NSW have been swamped with mass Christmas cancellations and restaurants have seen the number of patrons drop significantly, local media reported. 
Australia has avoided the worst of the pandemic due to border closures, lockdowns, widespread testing and social distancing. It has recorded around 28,100 infections, the overwhelming majority in Victoria state, and 908 deaths.
Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews said the ban of travellers from Sydney was to protect the state's streak of 51 days of no new local coronavirus cases. 
The Victorian state capital Melbourne, the second most populous city, was locked down for four months earlier in the year as it battled a second wave of infections.

NSW health authorities said that there were more than 28,200 tests conducted in the past 24 hours and urged more people to get tested. The origin of the virus in Sydney remains unknown, which genome testing suggests is a U.S. strain.

NONTHABURI, Thailand (Reuters) - Thais voted nationwide on Sunday in provincial elections that mark the first test of democracy since a general election last year that drew accusations of manipulation and helped spawn months of youth protests.
The elections in Thailand's 76 provinces outside the capital Bangkok are the first since Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who kept power after last year's ballot, overthrew an elected government in a military coup.
""It's my duty to vote,"" said 27-year-old bank worker Korkiet Akaraparn, voting in his first provincial election in Nonthaburi, on the outskirts of Bangkok. ""I hope that there will be new people from this election who bring change."" 
Polling officials reported a steady turnout despite Thailand's biggest daily surge in coronavirus cases on Saturday in a province outside Bangkok. Polls close at 5 p.m. (1000 GMT), with results expected from the evening. 
Among the parties putting up candidates is the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Movement, which has its roots in the now banned Future Forward Party of Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.
Thanathorn had emerged as the most vocal challenger to Prayuth. When he and his party were banned from politics, it prompted protests demanding the removal of Prayuth, a new constitution and reforms to the powerful monarchy.
Prayuth rejects accusations that he engineered the general election to keep power.
Although the party backing him in parliament is not formally putting up candidates in the provincial elections, contestants in races across the country are making clear their loyalty to his camp.
The elections are also a test for the Pheu Thai Party linked to populist former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. In opposition it remains the largest party in Thailand's parliament.
Thaksin, who rarely comments in public from self-exile since being overthrown in 2006, has posted on Twitter to encourage people to support the party ahead of provincial elections, in which powerful families traditionally hold local sway.
""I voted for candidates who are relatives of the former chief,"" said Charoen Buaperm, 60.

Provincial administrations are responsible for the provision of local services and development plans and run their own budgets.  The Progressive  Movement seeks to devolve more power to provinces from Bangkok, which is not yet holding its own local election.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -U.S. President-elect Joe Biden and Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Saturday committed to work on a humane strategy to regional migration by addressing its root causes in Central America and southern Mexico.
The two leaders in a phone call ""discussed working together on a new approach to regional migration that offers alternatives to undertaking the dangerous journey to the United States,"" a summary of the call provided by Biden's team said. 
The two leaders said they shared a desire to address the reasons for migration in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and southern Mexico.
Biden pledged to build ""the regional and border infrastructure and capacity needed to facilitate a new orderly and humane approach to migration that will respect international norms regarding the treatment of asylum claims,"" the statement from Biden's team said. 
Earlier this week Lopez Obrador suggested the two neighbors under Biden's new Democratic administration work together on the thorny issue of immigration. 
Republican President Donald Trump's unprecedented demands that the Mexican government do more to reduce the flow of U.S.-bound migrants, including harboring migrants in Mexico while they wait for their U.S. court dates and paying for a border wall, caused friction in the relationship.
Biden emphasized the need to reinvigorate U.S.-Mexico cooperation on migration as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy and border security.
""We reaffirmed our commitment to working together for the well-being of our peoples and nations,"" Lopez Obrador said on Twitter.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted: ""There will be extensive bilateral cooperation and a very good relationship between the presidents of Mexico and the United States.""
A Mexican government source told Reuters that Biden and Lopez Obrador also spoke about investment for development and respect for the Mexican community in the United States.

The leaders of Latin America's two biggest economies, Brazil and Mexico, congratulated Biden on Tuesday, the day after the U.S. Electoral College confirmed Biden's Nov. 3 election win. The long delay ignited criticism they were running the risk of alienating Biden and his fellow Democrats.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - In China's Wuhan, the original epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, the city's residents are returning to normal life, even as they continue to grapple with memories of the early outbreak, which struck fear in the city. 
It's been almost seven months since the city recorded a locally transmitted case of the disease due to a strict city-wide lockdown and a mass testing event of almost all the city's 11 million residents. 
Today, restaurants, shopping streets and bars are crowded, but locals are still experiencing the lasting impact of the lockdown on mental health and work.
Reuters asked people throughout Wuhan to share images and videos they took during their outbreak, as well as their hopes for 2021, as the city approaches the one-year anniversary of the outbreak. City health officials released the first public notice of the then-unknown virus on Dec. 31, 2019.
Like the city itself, most people are enduringly optimistic, even as they reflect on the city's toughest year in recent memory.

""At that time, I could only eat one meal a day, because there was indeed a lot of work to do, but there were very few people doing this, so I was very anxious.
""I hope that the entire city will prosper in 2021.

""At that time, I couldn't do anything at home. It was very boring, so I thought I needed to write some music and sing some songs to find some fun in my life.
""It made me reflect on a lot of things, and it is the first time in my life that I have experienced such a disaster.

Duan's husband, Fang Yushun, caught COVID-19 in February while working as a surgeon.
""I had my birthday on the day he was hospitalised during the epidemic, and he spent a day editing and sent a video to me. So I felt very moved.

Shipments of the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccines began arriving in Israel last week.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines are on order. Israel expects to have enough doses by the year's end for the 20% of its population most prone to COVID-19 complications.
With polls finding that around two-third of Israelis intend to get vaccinated, officials have sought to stave off what they deem ""fake news"" about possibly perilous side-effects.

PUNTA MORALES, Costa Rica (Reuters) - Some 200 workers from 27 nations are building a hybrid sailboat on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica designed to carry 350 tons of goods, hoping to demonstrate that in the 21st century it is possible to transport cargo without polluting the environment.
Inspired by the historic Finnish trading schooner Ingrid of the Aland Islands, the firm Sailcargo Inc says it designed the vessel named Ceiba ""to be the first of its kind in the world."" It will rely mostly on wind power with two auxiliary electric engines for maneuvering in ports and low winds.
""One of the most important things is to prove that it's financially profitable"" as well as be environmentally and socially sustainable, Sailcargo's chief executive and founder Danielle Doggett told Reuters.
The vessel is being built in Punta Morales, a poor fishing community 125 kilometers (78 miles) west of Costa Rica's capital, San Jose.
Doggett, a professional ship captain, founded the company with her partner Lynx Guimond, an adventurer and cabinetmaker. The Canadian couple along with a Costa Rican partner intend to finish the prototype in 2021. The Ceiba is named after the sacred tree of the Central American native peoples.
Ceiba will be put into operation in 2022 on routes between Canada, Ecuador and Hawaii, and the firm plans to recover over six years the private investment of $4.2 million needed for the project.
""We want it to be a flagship ship that carries the Costa Rican flag with products that can be truly sold under the seal of 'zero emissions' like coffee, turmeric, salmon, barley and others,"" said John Porras, co-founder and legal representative of Sailcargo.
Amid the incessant sound of saws, sanders and mallets, the 45-meter-long (148-foot-long) Ceiba is being built using wood from secondary forests, cultivated or from fallen trees nearby.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Central African Republic says former president plotting a coup,"By Antoine Rolland
BANGUI (Reuters) - The government of Central African Republic on Saturday accused former president Francois Bozize of plotting a coup as political tension and violence rise ahead of the country's Dec. 27 general election. 
The government said in a statement that Bozize plotted with members of his family and a number of armed groups to attack two towns near the capital Bangui after the country's top court rejected his candidacy. 
It also said Bozize has amassed men in the outskirts of the town of Bossembele and planned to march to Bangui. ""It is manifestly an attempted coup,"" Ange Maxime Kazagui, spokesman for the government said in a broadcast on national television.
Bozize, who had previously accepted the court's decision, could not be reached for comment on Saturday.
The rising tension prompted the United Nations' peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic to deploy troops to disperse armed rebel groups that had occupied roads and towns near Bangui, and are threatening to disrupt the election.
The mission, known as MINUSCA, said in a statement late on Friday that it had placed troops in the capital and other regions on high alert to protect civilians and secure the legislative and presidential elections.
President Faustin-Archange Touadera, who has struggled to maintain stability, is seeking re-election. 
Bozize was ousted in 2013 by mainly Muslim Seleka rebels, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militias and plunging the Central African Republic in to a civil war.
U.N. peacekeepers have been deployed since 2014, including over 12,800 in uniform.
The U.N. mission said the rebel groups, some of whom had fought against one another in the civil war, had occupied two localities.
U.N. troops dispersed the armed militia blocking a major road northeast of the capital, while in Bossangoa in the north, the peacekeepers blocked armed elements on motorcycles who tried to leave the city, the statement said.
As the election campaign heats up, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said on Tuesday that rival disinformation campaigns from the country's former colonial master France, and Russia, seen as close to Touadera, have sought to influence the election and deceive voters.

U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres condemned the escalating violence, disinformation, hate speech and incitement to violence in a separate statement on Friday.

963,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Thousands protest in Sudan in call for faster reform,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Thousands of Sudanese protesters took to the streets of the capital Khartoum and its twin city Omdurman on Saturday, demanding an acceleration of reforms on the second anniversary of the start of an uprising that ousted Omar al-Bashir.
The veteran leader was deposed by the military in April 2019 after months of mass protests against poor economic conditions and Bashir's autocratic, three-decade rule.
Many Sudanese are unhappy with what they see as the slow or even negligible pace of change under the transitional government that has struggled to fix an economy in crisis.
The government was formed under a three-year power sharing agreement between the military and civilian groups which is meant to lead to fair presidential and parliamentary elections.
Sudan's state TV aired footage of thousands of protesters gathering outside the presidential residence in Khartoum which now hosts the sovereign council, a joint military-civilian ruling body.
The country also has a civilian cabinet of technocrats led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.
""We have come out today, not to celebrate the anniversary or to congratulate the transitional government. This government, unfortunately, over the past two years has not made any progress in the retribution file for our martyrs,"" protester Waleed El Tom told the state TV in Khartoum.
Hundreds of Sudanese civilians were killed in protests before and after the former president's ouster.
On Saturday, thousands more protesters gathered outside the abandoned parliament building in Omdurman, across the river Nile from the capital. Small protests took place in other cities across the country, state media said.
At the top of the protesters' demands is the formation of a long-awaited transitional parliament, part of the power sharing deal, to pass the necessary legislation for building a democratic state.
Others called for the dissolution of the sovereign council, the cabinet and the ruling coalition.
Sudan's economy has worsened since Bashir's removal, as the weak transitional government has failed to kick-start reforms and halt a fall in the Sudanese pound on the black market.
""The Sudanese people had hopes that their revolution would be great, that it would achieve things, but today the Sudanese people are standing in bread lines,"" a protester told state TV.
Security was tightened in Khartoum and Omdurman but no major incidents of violence or casualties were reported. 
Social media users shared pictures and videos of protesters burning tyres and security forces firing tear gas. Reuters was not immediately able to verify the images.
Sudan's government has signed peace deals with most of the rebel groups that caused unrest during Bashir's rule, and it hopes that the United States' recent decision to remove the country from its list of state sponsors of terrorism will help the ailing economy.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 19, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Explainer-Russia's potent cyber and information warfare capabilities,"By Andrew Osborn and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber
MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that Russia was responsible for a cyber attack that embedded malicious code inside U.S. government software systems and those of other governments and companies across the world.
The Kremlin has always denied Moscow's involvement in cyber attacks against the West. It has said that Russia had nothing to do with this latest assault.
Here is some information about Russia's possible motives for such an attack, and details about Russian cyber offensive and information warfare capabilities. 
POSSIBLE RUSSIAN MOTIVE 
The Kremlin has said many times it wants to improve ties with the United States, which are at a post-Cold War low and strained by issues from Ukraine to Syria. 
But it also openly views the United States as Russia's main geopolitical adversary and as a threat to its national security. 
President Vladimir Putin has accused Washington of starting a new arms race and NATO of moving military infrastructure closer to Russia's borders, and has complained about U.S. sanctions, part of what Putin casts as an attempt to hold Russia back economically and technologically. 
Russia regularly probes U.S. defences, flying nuclear-capable strategic bombers near Alaska and sending submarines into the Atlantic to lurk off the East Coast. 
Putin has complained that outgoing President Donald Trump was unable to improve U.S-Russia ties and has singled out what he has called President-elect Joe Biden's harsh anti-Russian rhetoric.
On Thursday, Putin blamed U.S. intelligence agencies for a series of recent media investigations into people close to him. Without providing evidence, he also linked U.S. intelligence agencies to what he presented as the stage-managed poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. 
Putin did not congratulate Biden on his victory in the Nov. 3 election until Dec. 15. Putin said last month he was not worried that his delay in congratulating Biden would worsen U.S.-Russia ties. 
""You can't spoil a spoiled relationship,"" said Putin. 
'COZY BEAR'
Some cyber researchers have suggested that Russia's SVR foreign intelligence service may have been behind the latest attack. 
In 2018, Dutch media cited unnamed intelligence officials as saying the AIVD, the Dutch intelligence agency, had linked a Russian hacking group known as ""Cozy Bear"" or APT29 (advanced persistent threat 29) to the SVR. The AIVD did not comment. 
The Washington Post cited sources on Dec. 13 as saying the United States had identified ""Cozy Bear"" as being responsible for the latest cyber attack referred to by Pompeo. 
Hackers from ""Cozy Bear"" were detected by cyber security firm CrowdStrike on the U.S. Democratic Party's servers in the run-up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election when email accounts of Hillary Clinton's staff were hacked. 
In July, Britain, the United States and Canada accused ""Cozy Bear"" of trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research from academic and pharmaceutical institutions around the world. 
'FANCY BEAR'
Russian military intelligence, commonly known as GRU, has potent cyber offence capabilities, according to U.S. intelligence agencies. 
In particular, GRU controls a hacking group known to cyber researchers as ""Fancy Bear"" or APT28 (advanced persistent threat 28) they have said. 
It was that group, according to a Department of Justice indictment filed in 2018, that hacked the email accounts of Hillary Clinton's staff before the 2016 election.
Reuters reported in September that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) believed ""Fancy Bear"" had also targeted a firm working with Biden.
In 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency accused Russian hackers of stealing confidential medical information about U.S. Olympic athletes and publishing it online. The FBI later seized the domain of the site - http://www.fancybear.net - where the information was released.
""Fancy Bear"" hackers have also been linked by cyber security investigators to cyber attacks on the U.S. and French elections.
THE FSB
Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, is the country's main domestic intelligence agency. 
The United States in 2017 charged two FSB agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts. 
The Justice Department indictment included charges of computer fraud, economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, access device fraud and aggravated identify theft. 
It painted a picture of the Russian security services working hand-in-hand with cyber criminals, who helped spies further their intelligence goals in exchange for money.
INTERNET RESEARCH AGENCY 
U.S. prosecutors say the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA) played a key role in Russian efforts to try to sway the 2016 election in favour of Trump. 
It did so, they say, by flooding social media with false reports and conspiracy theories in an attempt to exploit existing divisions.
The group is a Kremlin-backed outfit whose employees have posed as Americans, according to U.S. officials.

The U.S. Treasury Department in September imposed sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the financier of the IRA, who was charged in 2018, along with 12 other individuals and three entities, with conspiracy to defraud the United States for his alleged role in election meddling.

The conflict and the fatalities on the Armenian side have increased pressure on Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, whom the opposition accuses of mishandling the conflict by accepting a Russian-brokered ceasefire last month, to resign. 
Pashinyan led the march, held on the first of three days of mourning, driving up to the Yerablur military cemetery to light incense on the graves of fallen soldiers along with other senior officials.
Although his supporters filled the cemetery to its brink, footage published on Armenian television showed Pashinyan's critics shouting ""Nikol is a traitor!"" as his convoy passed by, escorted by heavy security. 
Armenia's opposition has called on its supporters to join a national strike on Dec. 22, at the end of the three-day mourning period, to pressure Pashinyan to resign over the losses incurred in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabkh. 
Pashinyan, who swept to power in a peaceful revolution in May 2018, has rejected calls to resign. 
Ethnic Armenian authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh accused Azeri forces on Wednesday of capturing several dozen of their troops, putting further strain on a ceasefire deal that brought an end to the fighting last month.
The two sides have nonetheless begun exchanging groups of prisoners of war as part of an ""all for all"" swap mediated by Russia.

Moscow has deployed peacekeepers to police the ceasefire, but skirmishes have nonetheless been reported.

""During the winter and spring seasons, carrying out novel coronavirus vaccination work among some key population groups is of great significance to epidemic prevention,"" he told a briefing.
China aims to actively build group immunity, and the vaccination of high-risk groups - which include workers in the cold chain industry, customs, healthcare, markets and public transport - is just the first part of a ""step-by-step programme"", he added.
China has included two candidate vaccines from Sinopharm and one from Sinovac Biotech Ltd in an emergency-use programme launched in July, targeting specific high-infection risk groups such as medical workers and border inspectors. 
It has also approved a vaccine from CanSino Biologics Inc for military use but has not approved any vaccine for use among the general public.
China is planning to vaccinate as many as 50 million people before the start of the Lunar New Year holiday in Feb. 2021, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. 
It said that Beijing would distribute 100 million doses of vaccines made by Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech.
Mao Junfeng, an official with China's industry ministry, told the briefing that the firms had already completed their ""capacity construction tasks"" and would be capable of meeting demand from key population groups. He did not say how many vaccines would be needed in total. 
Zheng Zhongwei, the NHC official heading China's COVID-19 vaccine development team, said China had administered more than 1 million emergency doses to members of high-risk groups since July and ""no serious adverse reactions"" had been detected so far.
""For the vaccines where we are moving quite fast, the number of cases required for the interim stage of Phase III clinical trials have already been obtained,"" Zheng said, without elaborating on specific products. 
Data has been submitted to the medical products regulator, which will approve the vaccines if they meet the necessary conditions, he added.

China, which claims democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory, has been angered by stepped-up U.S. support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait, further souring Beijing-Washington relations.
The U.S. Navy said the guided missile destroyer USS Mustin had conducted ""a routine Taiwan Strait transit (on) Dec. 19 in accordance with international law"". 
""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" it added.
This is the 12th sailing through the strait by the U.S. Navy this year.
China's military, in a statement released by its Eastern Theatre Command, said its air and naval forces ""tailed and monitored"" the vessel throughout.
Such missions ""deliberately raise the temperature of the Taiwan issue, as they fear calm in the Taiwan Strait, and send flirtatious glances to Taiwan independence forces, seriously jeopardising peace and stability in the strait"", it said.
The United States is engaging in a show of force and trying to use Taiwan as a pawn for its own selfish strategic purposes, the statement added.
In Taipei, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the U.S. ship had proceeded in a southerly direction, that it has also monitored its movements, and that ""the situation was as normal"".
Beijing believes Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen is bent on a formal declaration of independence for the island, a red line for Beijing. She says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

Tsai has made bolstering Taiwan's armed forces a priority in the face of repeated Chinese military activity near the island, including on occasion this year sending fighter jets across the Taiwan Strait's median line, an unofficial buffer.

Brunel, 74, was detained on Wednesday as part of a probe opened last year into allegations of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. Police arrested him at Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport before he boarded a plane to Senegal. 
The Paris prosecutor said Brunel was suspected of having raped, assaulted and harassed several minor and adult victims as well as having organised transport and hosting of young women for Epstein.
Under French law, an investigation may or may not lead to a trial.
A lawyer for Brunel did not reply to a request for comment.
Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail at age 66 in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Brunel co-founded the Karin Models agency in the 1990s, and founded MC2 Model Management in the United States with Epstein.

In August 2019, Paris' chief prosecutor opened a preliminary inquiry into whether Epstein committed sex crimes on French territory or against French girls.

Lisbon's regional health authority ARSLVT said in a statement cited by Lusa news agency that a working lunch between the two leaders on Wednesday was considered a ""high-risk exposure"" to the coronavirus. 
Costa tested negative on Thursday, but ARSLVT said he would have to stay in isolation until Dec. 29, which will be 14 days after he met with Macron in Paris to discuss Portugal's upcoming European Council presidency.
Macron tested positive on Thursday, prompting a track and trace effort across Europe, following meetings the French leader had with EU heads of government in recent days. Those included a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has tested negative.
News photos showed Macron warmly welcoming Costa to the palace, with both wearing face masks as they stood shoulder to shoulder outside the entrance to the Elysee Palace.
Costa's office said on Thursday he cancelled all in-person public activities, including an official trip to Sao Tome and Principe and Guinea Bissau this weekend, but would work remotely.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Shoppers washed their hands and sterilised their smartphones in the streets of Tokyo's posh Ginza district on Saturday using handwashing stations that a Japanese start-up hopes will revolutionise access to clean water and better hygiene.
WOTA Corp set up 20 of its WOSH machines near popular Ginza stores in an initiative with a district association aimed at encouraging shoppers to wash their hands to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
The machines don't require connection to running water and don't use fresh and waste water tanks. Instead they recycle the water through a three-stage process of membrane filtration, chlorine and deep ultraviolet irradiation.
They also have a device that cleans smartphones through 20-30 seconds of ultraviolet light exposure while users are washing their hands, since touching a dirty smartphone would otherwise negate their handwashing efforts.
The firm had already been developing the machine in part to alleviate long lines at rest rooms when the COVID-19 crisis hit early this year, Chief Executive Yosuke Maeda told Reuters.
""Amid the impact of COVID-19 we thought we had to implement this as soon as possible,"" Maeda said. ""So we sped up development and got things moving to have it in December in time for the third wave of the coronavirus.""
On average 20 litres of water provides around 500 washes, while the filters should be changed after about 2,000, he said.
The machine, however, needs connection to a power supply.
WOTA has now begun shipments within Japan of roughly 4,000 units. It aims to expand internationally next year, with many inquiries coming from the United States.
Maeda hopes the smartphone feature in particular will transform hygiene habits.
""We thought if it had the smartphone sterilisation function, maybe people who never wash their hands will start doing so,"" he said.

JAMBI (Reuters) - A pair of critically endangered orangutans, rescued from smugglers on the Thai-Malaysian border in 2017, have arrived in Indonesia to undergo rehabilitation so they can finally be released back into their native forest habitat.
Believed to be between the ages of four to six the orangutans, Ung Aing and Natalee, spent three years at Khao Pratab Chang Wildlife Breeding Center in central Ratchaburi province, Thailand.
On Friday they arrived in western Indonesia's Jambi province for medical checks, which will include COVID-19 swabs, before a rehabilitation process to prepare them for their jungle home.
""We will do a medical checkup and study their behaviour and habits before sending them to a forest rehabilitation centre at the Danau Alo sanctuary,"" head of local Natural Resources Coservation Agency (BKSDA), Rahmad Saleh told reporters, after the great apes were wheeled out in two metal cages at Jambi’s Sultan Thaha airport before media and officials.
Video footage showed the female orangutans eagerly climbed out of their carriers and into a temporary holding facility.
It is unclear how long the pair will stay in the orangutan sanctuary before being released into the wild. 
Orangutans are poached illegally for food, breeding to supply the domestic and international pet trade, and for traditional medicine.
Logging and deforestation, including forest clearance to make way for cash crops such as palm oil, has reduced the habitat of the critically endangered species.
There are an estimated 100,000 Bornean orangutans left in the wild, and only about 7,500 Sumatran orangutans, according to data from the World Wildlife Fund.

A total of 71 orangutans have been sent back from Thailand to Indonesia since 2006, according to a joint statement released by the two countries.

The all-powerful institution was officially designated to reform the constitution, but in practice ended up supplanting the opposition-controlled legislature and sacking public officials who challenged the government. 
Maduro has said the assembly, known as the ANC, is no longer necessary following Dec. 6 elections that will usher in a new parliament dominated by ruling Socialist Party legislators. The current parliament's term ends on Jan 5.
Maduro in 2017 called for the creation of the ANC following months of opposition protests that left more than a hundred people dead.
""The main objective of this National Constituent Assembly was to restore the peace of the republic, internal security, national union and the stability of the country,"" Maduro said in a ceremonial session. ""And today I can say, National Constituent Assembly, mission accomplished.""
The opposition boycotted the election that created the ANC, and the United States and Europe called it the consolidation of a dictatorship and a disavowal of the democratically elected legislature.
The 2017 protests ended quickly after that election. 
But despite being in existence for three years, the ANC did not reform the constitution.
Instead it legislated a raft of measures including an anti-hate law widely used to jail government critics, stripped a group of opposition legislators of parliamentary immunity and sacked former Chief Prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who had fallen out with Maduro. 

The 1999 constitution only describes the ANC as a body with no limits on its power. Critics insist its intended function was never to serve as a parallel legislature.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors on Friday said Ghislaine Maxwell, the former associate of Jeffrey Epstein charged with helping enable his sexual abuses, should remain in jail, and urged a federal judge to reject her proposed $28.5 million bail package.
In a filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, prosecutors said Maxwell has essentially rehashed previously rejected arguments for bail, and that she remains an ""extreme flight risk"" from ""incredibly serious"" charges.
""Nothing in the renewed bail application alters the analysis that led this court to conclude that the defendant 'poses a substantial actual risk of flight,' and that no combination of conditions could assure her appearance,"" prosecutors said.
Maxwell, 58, has been living in a Brooklyn jail since July, when she pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls for sex in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for having denied involvement under oath.
She has proposed living with electronic monitoring in a New York City residence, and under 24-hour guard to ensure she remains safe and does not flee.
Maxwell faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted at her scheduled July 2021 trial.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who rejected a $5 million bail package for Maxwell in July, will consider her latest application.
Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.
Maxwell's bail application said she ""vehemently maintains her innocence"" against allegations she assisted Epstein, based on uncorroborated testimony about events occurring more than 25 years ago.
But prosecutors said new details about Maxwell's finances - details she would have known when first seeking bail - did not bolster her case.
They said Maxwell's having moved most of her assets to her husband showed her ability to ""hide her true wealth,"" whose size demonstrated she could ""absolutely afford"" to flee.
Prosecutors also said Maxwell's pledge to waive extradition from the United Kingdom and France, where she has citizenships, was worthless because those countries' would not allow it.
Maxwell proposed posting a $22.5 million bond, representing all assets belonging to her and her husband, secured by $8.5 million of property and cash. The remaining bail would be posted by friends, family and a security specialist.
""Release to the equivalent of a 'privately funded jail' is not warranted here,"" prosecutors said.
Authorities arrested Maxwell on July 2 at her New Hampshire home, which prosecutors said she used as a hideout.

Her husband, whose name was redacted from court papers, has said Maxwell moved there to protect her safety and escape the media frenzy, not to elude capture.

ZURICH (Reuters) - World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Friday an international team led by the U.N. agency would be going to China in the first week of January to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.
Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergency expert, said international experts would go to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first cases of COVID-19 were detected last December.
""We still don't have a take-off date because we are working on the logistics around visas and flights. We do expect the team to be going there in the first week of January. There will be quarantine arrangements,"" Ryan told a news conference.
""The team will visit Wuhan, that's the purpose of the mission. The point of the mission is to go to the original point at which human cases were detected. They'll fully expect to do that,"" he added.

KATSINA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Scores of schoolboys who were rescued from kidnappers in northwest Nigeria arrived back home on Friday, many of them barefoot and wrapped in blankets after their week-long ordeal.
The boys, dressed in dusty clothes, looked dazed and weary but otherwise well as they got off buses in the city of Katsina.
Within hours - before many had met their waiting parents - they were whisked to a reception with President Muhammadu Buhari, who had come under mounting pressure to free them and deal with insecurity in the north.
One boy, who did not give his name, said the captors had told him to describe them as members of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, although he suspected they were armed bandits.
""They beat us morning, every night. We suffered a lot. They only gave us food once a day and water twice a day,"" he told Nigeria's Arise television.
Gunmen on motorbikes raided the boys' boarding school in the town of Kankara in Katsina state a week ago and marched hundreds of them into a vast forest that spans four states.
Authorities said security services rescued them on Thursday. The army said it had acted on ""credible intelligence"" and freed all 344 kidnapped boys.
Many details surrounding the incident remain unclear, including who was responsible, why they kidnapped the boys, whether ransom was paid and how the release was secured. 
The abduction gripped a country already incensed by widespread insecurity, and evoked memories of Boko Haram's 2014 kidnapping of more than 270 schoolgirls in the northeastern town of Chibok.
The boys' abduction was particularly embarrassing for Buhari, who comes from Katsina state and has repeatedly said that Boko Haram has been ""technically defeated"".
Any Boko Haram involvement in this kidnapping would mark a geographical expansion in the militant group's activities from its base in the northeast. 
TEARS OF JOY, PRAYERS OF THANKS
Hours before the rescue of the boys was announced on Thursday, a video started circulating online purportedly showing Boko Haram militants with some of the boys. Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the footage or who released it.
The rescued boy interviewed by Arise TV was one of those who had appeared in the online video. 
""They said I should say they are Boko Haram and gangs of Abu Shekau,"" he said, referring to a name used by a Boko Haram leader. ""Sincerely speaking, they are not Boko Haram ... They are just small and tiny, tiny boys with big guns.""
Another of the freed boys told Reuters that the kidnappers had initially taken them to a hiding place. 
""But when they saw a jet fighter, they changed the location and hid us in a different place. They gave us food, but it was very little,"" he said.
On Friday, the boys walked from the buses in single file, flanked by soldiers and armed police officers, and were taken to the government building to meet the governor. They were then brought back and driven off for medical checks, and then to the presidential meeting.
A group of parents waited to be reunited with them in a shaded parking lot in another part of town.
Hajiya Bilikisu, in a cream-coloured veil, said she had started to lose hope that she would ever see her son, Abdullahi Abdulrazak, again.
""I was just crying, crying with joy, when I saw them, my son"" in pictures after the release, she told Reuters. 
""They have to recovery psychologically,"" she said. ""They went through trauma. We have to try to counsel them, so they can now become normal persons.""

Hafsat Funtua, mother of 16-year-old Hamza Naziru, said she ran out of her house with joy ""not knowing where to go"" when she heard the news. She later returned home to pray.

The government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, based in the southern port of Aden, and the separatists are allies within the coalition, which has been at war against the Iran-aligned Houthis that have controlled the capital Sanaa since 2014.
However, the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) declared self rule in Aden earlier this year, and the two sides have been fighting in the south, complicating U.N. efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire in the overall conflict.
Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik was reappointed to head the new cabinet, which includes five ministers from Yemen's biggest political blocs, including the STC and Islah party, a statement from Hadi's office said. 
However, Hadi has kept his closest allies in the key ministries of defence, interior, foreign affairs and finances.
The new government followed two weeks of separation of forces and redeployment of troops in the south that would see their return to battlefronts with the Houthis in the north and to outside Aden, the heavily disputed port city. 
The clashes within the anti-Houthi camp were one factor holding up United Nations efforts to negotiate a nationwide ceasefire to pave the way for a resumption of political negotiations, last held in December 2018, to end the wider war.
Riyadh has struggled to prevent another front developing among its allies in Yemen’s multifaceted war, which has been locked in military stalemate for years.

The conflict, widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed more than 100,000 people and caused what the United Nations says is the world’s largest humanitarian crisis.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City is overhauling how it admits students to some of its most competitive public schools to make them less segregated by race and wealth, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Friday.
Some selective Manhattan high schools, particularly in wealthy neighborhoods, are allowed to give children who live nearby priority in admissions, which has tended to put children living in poorer neighborhoods at a disadvantage. These so-called geographic priorities will be ended over the coming two years, making it easier for children from anywhere to apply for a spot, the mayor said at a news conference.
The city will also end ""screening"" practices at hundreds of middle schools that admit students based on a mixture of grades, test results, attendance rates. 
These practices led to disproportionately high admissions of white and Asian students and fewer Black and Latino students in the best-performing schools in the nation's largest and most diverse education system, which serves some 1.1 million children. Admissions will instead be determined by a random lottery.
""We have been doing this work for seven years to more equitably redistribute resources throughout our school system,"" de Blasio told reporters. ""I think these changes will improve justice and fairness.""
Although calls to overhaul school admissions long predate the novel coronavirus pandemic, the disruption caused by school closures to stem the spread of COVID-19 was a factor in the overhaul: for example, some state exams were canceled and attendance rates became more difficult to track, Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza told reporters.
The New York Civil Liberties Union welcomed the changes but said they should have come sooner, and called for the permanent removal of screening at the high-school level.

""It should not have taken a pandemic to finally remove discriminatory admissions screens for children applying to middle school and to remove the egregious district priorities that concentrate wealth and resources into a few schools,"" NYCLU organizer Toni Smith-Thompson said in a statement.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The trial of a man charged with killing 10 people in a 2018 van attack in Toronto will end on Friday, as Canadian prosecutors push to have him found guilty of first-degree murder and attempted murder.
Alek Minassian, 28, rented a van and drove it onto the sidewalk along Yonge Street in North York, a suburb just north of Toronto, striking passersby. He later told police detectives he was motivated by a desire to punish society for his perceived status as an ""incel"" - short for involuntary celibate - because he believed women would not have sex with him.
Minassian has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 16 counts of attempted murder. He has not denied his role but entered a plea of ""not criminally responsible"" to the court via Zoom when the trial began in early November.
Defense lawyers argued that Minassian's diagnosed autism meant that he was not capable of making rational ethical choices.
Witnesses - including psychologists and Minassian's parents - were brought forward during the six weeks of trial to argue for or dispute that characterization of Minassian.
In their closing arguments, prosecutors said Minassian had ""the capacity to make a choice.""
""He never lost sight of the fact that society viewed his choice as wrong, and he made a choice to go ahead and commit the attack,"" prosecutor Joe Callaghan told the court on Friday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. prosecutors on Friday charged a China-based executive at  Zoom Video Communications  (NASDAQ:ZM) Inc with involvement in a scheme to disrupt video meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in China.
Xinjiang Jin, the company's main liaison with Chinese law enforcement and intelligence services, conspired since Jan. 2019 to use his company's systems to censor speech at the direction of China's government, the U.S. Department of Justice said.
Prosecutors said Jin helped terminate at least four meetings in May and June, including some involving dissidents who survived the protests in 1989, and fabricated violations of Zoom's terms of service to justify his actions to his superiors.
They also said Jin's accomplices created fake email accounts and Zoom accounts, including in dissidents' names, to make it seem the meetings' participants supported terrorism, violence or the distribution of child pornography.
Zoom was not named in court papers filed in Brooklyn federal court, but its identity was confirmed by a person close to the matter. The papers said Jin's employer is based in San Jose, California, which is where Zoom is headquartered.
A spokesman for Zoom said the company is reviewing the complaint. Jin is not in U.S. custody and a lawyer for him could not immediately be identified.

Abe, who stepped down due to poor health in September, is under fire on suspicion his office helped cover the costs of dinner parties for supporters, a possible violation of funding laws that Abe denied when questioned in parliament last year.
""It turned out to be not true that questioning against former prime minister Abe had been conducted. We apologise to former prime minister Abe, those concerned and our viewers,"" TV Asahi, a commercial broadcaster, said on its website.
Citing several unnamed lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, TV Asahi had reported on Friday that Abe had been questioned by Tokyo prosecutors on or before Thursday. 
Abe's office did not immediately respond to questions after the initial TV Asahi report. 
Domestic media said this month that prosecutors had asked Abe for voluntary questioning in a case they were building against his secretary over unreported, dinner party-related political funds involving as much as 40 million yen ($386,885).
On Friday, local media reported that Abe may be summoned to appear in parliament, perhaps before the end of the year, to answer questions, with Abe quoted before TV Asahi's initial report as saying he would respond in good faith.
""The prosecution is currently investigating this issue, but once the results are available I would like to answer in good faith,"" Abe said.
""Of course, I would also like to respond in good faith to parliament,"" the Nikkei Shimbun newspaper quoted him as saying.
The issue, which dogged Abe during the last year of his tenure, also risks damaging current premier Yoshihide Suga, who was Abe's right-hand man during his 2012-2020 term and is already under pressure for his response to the new coronavirus, including a U-turn on a travel subsidy programme.
Suga has also drawn fire for joining end-of-the-year social gatherings after imploring Japanese citizens to avoid such parties as the country sees a record number of coronavirus cases.
Politicians in Japan cannot provide anything to constituents that could be construed as a gift. The rule is so strict that two ministers in Abe's cabinet last year had to quit over giving things such as melons, crabs and even potatoes to voters in their constituencies.

Acting Security Secretary Ricardo Mejia said November registered 2,670 murders, the lowest monthly figure since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office.
The November figure is the lowest monthly total since February 2018, when 2,445 murders were recorded.
Mejia said the murders last month were concentrated in six states: Guanajuato, Baja California, Chihuahua, Jalisco, Michoacan, and the state of Mexico.
Despite the monthly drop, for the full year Mexico may yet narrowly surpass the 34,670 murders recorded in 2019.

Akufo-Addo's New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) each won 137 seats, which represents a loss of dozens of NPP seats. One constituency was won by an independent candidate. 
Akufo-Addo won a second four-year term in the Dec. 7 vote, narrowly defeating the NDC's presidential candidate, former president John Mahama. Mahama has said he will contest the results, which he called ""fraudulent"".
Akufo-Addo has promised to implement a $17 billion programme to boost growth in West Africa's second-largest economy. The pandemic has hit the price of oil and cocoa exports, resulting in the first quarterly contractions in nearly 40 years. 
Kwesi Jonah, a research fellow at the Institute for Democratic Governance, said he expected bipartisan cooperation on most of the president's agenda but that the hung parliament could slow down some controversial items.
""Parliament tries to build consensus on about 90% of issues. The remaining 10% is what is going to be difficult,"" he said. 
The NDC still hopes it can eke out a majority. Elvis Afriyie Ankrah, its director of elections, said on Friday that its own tallies showed it with at least 139 seats and that it was contesting several results. 
The election was tainted by violence that killed at least five people, a rarity in a country that has a reputation as one of West Africa's most stable democracies.

Ukraine's embassy in Sarajevo has raised concerns over the artefact after the Bosnian Serb news agency Srna published a photograph of the icon and its seal of authenticity, which suggest it may originate in the city of Lugansk, where pro-Russian separatists have been battling Kiev's forces. 
Dozens of Bosnian Serbs have fought alongside the rebels in the war in eastern Ukraine, which started in 2014. Serbia and Bosnia's Serbs have close ties with Russia, with which they share the Eastern Orthodox faith.
Milorad Dodik, the Bosnian Serb representative in Bosnia's three-member presidency, gave the gilded icon to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov during his visit to Sarajevo this week.
The Croatian and Bosniak presidency members refused to meet Lavrov over what they labelled his ""disrespect"" for Bosnia's state symbols and institutions.
Dodik has so far declined to comment on the matter. 
Ukraine's foreign ministry confirmed on Friday that its embassy in Sarajevo had asked Bosnian authorities to provide ""clarification and full information on the circumstances of this case"", and said it would hold talks on the issue in coming days.
In a letter published by Bosnian media, Ukraine's embassy said failure to provide information about the icon would be viewed as indicating support for ""the aggressive policies and military actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine"".

The embassy declined to provide a copy of the letter or further details to Reuters on Friday.

Turkish forces and their Syrian insurgent allies seized territory in the region in an offensive last year against the Kurdish YPG militia which holds swathes of north and east Syria. 
Ankara's Western allies widely condemned that incursion, which was halted when Turkey reached separate deals with Washington and Moscow, the second of which agreed to establish the joint Russian-Turkish patrols. 
The YPG, which Turkey deems a terrorist group, forms the military backbone of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance which defeated Islamic State in northeast Syria with the help of U.S. air power. 
Ain Issa, where the clashes erupted overnight, sits along the M4 highway that links major Syrian cities and where the Russian-Turkish patrols usually take place.
A rebel source with the Turkey-backed National Army said the faction seized some farmland after mounting an attack at the edge of the town.
An SDF commander told local Kurdish media that shelling hit parts of the town and highway but his forces were thwarting the attack.
Ain Issa, east of the Euphrates river, also has a sprawling camp for displaced people where the SDF has held families of Islamic State fighters, including foreigners.

995,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court throws out challenge to Trump census immigrant plan,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday threw out a lawsuit seeking to block President Donald Trump's plan to exclude immigrants living illegally in the United States from the population count used to allocate congressional districts to states.
The 6-3 ruling on ideological lines, with the court's six conservatives in the majority and three liberals dissenting, gives Trump a short-term victory as he pursues his hard-line policies toward immigration in the final weeks of his presidency. 
However, his administration is battling against the clock to follow through on the vaguely defined proposal before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan 20. The justices left open the possibility of fresh litigation if Trump's administration completes its plan.
The unsigned decision said that ""judicial resolution of this dispute is premature"" in part because it is not clear what the administration plans to do.
""At present, this case is riddled with contingencies and speculation that impede judicial review,"" the ruling said. The decision noted that the court was not weighing the merits of Trump's plan.
Challengers led by New York state and the American Civil Liberties Union said Trump's proposal would dilute the political clout of states with larger numbers of such immigrants, including heavily Democratic California, by undercounting state populations and depriving them of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives to the benefit of his fellow Republicans.
""If the administration actually tries to implement this policy, we'll sue. Again. And we'll win,"" said Dale Ho, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union who represents the challengers.
The administration has not disclosed what method it would use to calculate the number of people it proposed to exclude or which subsets of immigrants would be targeted. Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey Wall told the justices during the Nov. 30 oral argument in the case that the administration could miss a Dec. 31 statutory deadline to finalize a Census Bureau report to Trump containing the final population data, including the number of immigrants excluded.
During the oral argument, Wall told the justices that it is ""very unlikely"" the administration would amass data to exclude all immigrants in the country illegally. Instead, Wall said, it may propose excluding certain groups, such as the fewer than 100,000 in federal detention, and the total number may not be high enough to affect apportionment.
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a dissenting opinion that the government can currently try to exclude millions of individuals, including those who are in immigration detention or deportation proceedings, and the some 700,000 young people known as ""Dreamers"" who came to the U.S. illegally as children. 
""Where, as here, the government acknowledges it is working to achieve an allegedly illegal goal, this court should not decline to resolve the case simply because the government speculates that it might not fully succeed,"" Breyer added.
There are an estimated 11 million immigrants living in the United States illegally. The challengers have argued that Trump's policy violates both the Constitution and the Census Act, a federal law that outlines how the census is conducted. 
The Constitution requires apportionment of House seats to be based upon the ""whole number of persons in each state."" Until now, the U.S. government's practice was to count all people regardless of their citizenship or immigration status. 
By statute, the president is required to send Congress a report in early January with the population of each of the states and their entitled number of House districts. 
The challengers have argued that Trump's plan could leave several million people uncounted and cause California, Texas and New Jersey to lose House seats. 
A three-judge panel in New York ruled against the administration in September. 

The Supreme Court in June 2019 ruled against Trump's effort to add a citizenship question to the census. Critics said the question was intended to frighten immigrants from taking part in the population count and artificially reduce population numbers in heavily Democratic areas, also to benefit Republicans.

(Reuters) - The United States should choose dialogue and consultation with China instead of pursuing ""unacceptable"" unilateral sanctions against Chinese companies, China's State Councillor and foreign minister Wang Yi said on Friday.
Washington is adding dozens of Chinese companies, including the country's top chipmaker, SMIC, to a trade blacklist, a move seen as the latest in President Donald Trump's efforts to cement his tough-on-China legacy.
The U.S. Commerce Department said the action ""stems from China’s military-civil fusion doctrine and evidence of activities between SMIC and entities of concern in the Chinese military industrial complex"".
Wang, in a special address to the Asia Society that focused mainly on the state of Sino-U.S. relations, urged the United States to stop ""overstretching the notion of national security"" and ""arbitrary suppression of Chinese companies"".
""We need to replace sanctions with dialogue and consultation,"" he said, adding that unilateral sanctions had become the ""biggest destabilising factor to regional and global security"". 
""China is not a threat to the United States - was not, is not and will not be a threat,"" Wang said, yet relations were at their lowest ebb since the establishment of full diplomatic ties in 1979.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have grown over the past year as the world's top two economies sparred over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong and rising tensions in the South China Sea.
Wang also railed at attempts by some U.S. politicians to defame China's ruling Communist Party, describing these as ""irresponsible"" accusations without any evidence.
Likening Sino-U.S relations to a ""giant vessel,"" Wang said the interests of the whole world were at stake. ""I think we all agree the time has come to decide the future course of this vessel,"" he said, calling for U.S. policy toward China to ""return to objectivity and sensibility as early as possible"". 

Beijing has taken note of the four policy priorities of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who is set to take office on Jan. 20, Wang added, and believes at least three of them - COVID-19 response, economic recovery and climate change - provide room for cooperation between the two countries.

The findings were assumptions based on interviews with crew members, the company said.
A bulk carrier owned by Nagashiki and chartered by Mitsui OSK ran aground on a reef in Mauritius in July and began leaking oil, causing an ecological disaster in the pristine seas around the Indian Ocean island. Four people died when a tug sank during attempts to retrieve oil in the ocean.
The crew of the MV Wakashio, a nearly 300-metre Cape Size bulker used for carrying iron ore, changed direction to sail close enough to Mauritius to get cell phone coverage after also changing a set course two days earlier, Nagashiki said in a statement. 
""There was a lack of awareness of the dangers of navigating close to the coast ... and insufficient implementation of regulations that must be observed in order to safely execute voyages,"" the company said, based on its interviews with crew members.
The company will ban private use of cell phones during working hours on bridges and install high-speed communications systems on all its ships, as well beef up training, it said.
The company has also started installed monitoring cameras on the bridges of some of its ships for testing and will consider doing so on all of them.
The Wakashio ran aground on July 25 and began leaking oil on Aug. 6, eventually spilling 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil into the ocean.

The clean-up, which includes returning 30 km (18.6 miles) of mangrove coastline to its former state, will likely be mostly completed by January, Nagashiki said last month.

The money for helping capture heads of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) was announced on state-run broadcaster EBC and tweeted by a government taskforce.
TPLF leaders, possibly hiding in surrounding mountains since they lost Tigray's capital on Nov. 28, had said they were fighting back. Reuters has not been able to reach them for comment for more than a week.
Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and nearly a million fled their homes after two years of feuding between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and the TPLF erupted into war in early November.
Some power and phone links have been restored after a virtual blackout since the federal offensive began on Nov. 4. But access for media is still restricted and accounts from all sides are hard to verify.
Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis in Tigray, where about 600,000 people depended on food aid even before the war. 
The United Nations and other agencies are still pressing for safe access to most of the region.
The U.N. World Food Programme sent 11 trucks worth of food to two Eritrean refugee camps in the southern part of Tigray that arrived in the camps on Wednesday, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.
Despite the arrival of some aid, needs are increasing, OCHA spokesman Saviano Abreu said. ""People have now been living for more than six weeks with no running water, no access to health services, no cash and very limited access to food.""
He said the United Nations was still negotiating with the Ethiopian government for full and unhindered access and reiterated the global body's call for all parties to allow all aid groups into Tigray.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Police Department used excessive force during the wave of protests across the city this summer against police brutality and racism, according to a report published on Friday morning by New York City's Department of Investigation.
Mayor Bill de Blasio asked for the investigation in May as social media became deluged with cellphone videos showing police officers dousing protesters, elected officials and journalists with chemical irritants, shoving and hitting them while they struggled on the ground and, in one instance, driving police vehicles into them.
The report said the NYPD's response was excessive in part because most police officers involved had not received ""relevant training"" in policing protests.
""The NYPD's use of force and certain crowd control tactics to respond to the Floyd protests produced excessive enforcement that contributed to heightened tensions,"" the Department of Investigation said in the executive summary of its 111-page report.
The daily New York City protests were a prominent part of what quickly became a nationwide and international movement prompted in part by anger over George Floyd, a Black man killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, and Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in her Louisville home by white police officers during a botched raid.
De Blasio, who repeatedly defended his police department's conduct during the protests, said he agreed with the report's findings.
""It makes very clear we've got to do something different, and we've got to do something better,"" he said in a video statement released by City Hall.
The report concluded that the city's unusual system of three distinct, sometimes overlapping agencies conducting oversight of the police department had caused problems. It recommended that the city create a single independent police oversight agency.
Police Commissioner Dermot Shea in a statement called the summer a ""difficult period"" and thanked the Department of Investigation for ""20 logical and thoughtful recommendations that I intend to incorporate into our future policy and training.""

1000,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Sweden to allow underwater investigation of Estonia wreck site,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden said on Friday it would allow an underwater examination of the ferry Estonia, which sank in the Baltic 26 years ago with the loss of 852 lives, after a documentary film showed previously unknown holes in the wreck's hull.
The official investigation concluded in 1997 that the roll-on, roll-off ferry's bow shield had failed, damaging the bow ramp and flooding the car deck.
However, a Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Network documentary shown earlier in the autumn about the disaster included new underwater video images from the wreck site showing two previously unknown holes on the starboard side of the ship's hull.
""If there is new information, we need to look into it and clear up any questions,"" Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg told a news conference.
Damberg said the government hoped to amend the law designating the site of the disaster as a maritime memorial in the first half of next year.
On the night of Sept. 28, 1994, the Estonia was sailing from Tallinn to Stockholm in bad weather. Winds were around 20 meters per second and the waves around 4 meters high, according to the official investigation.
After the bow shield failed, the ferry rapidly filled with water and most of those who died were trapped inside.
The ship sank about 22 nautical miles from Uto island in less than 85 metres of water.
Over the years, a number of theories have emerged about the sinking that reject the official explanation, including a collision with a submarine and an explosion inside the ship.
The head of Sweden's Accident Investigation Authority, John Ahlberk, however, said a preliminary examination of footage from the documentary and previous material had not so far led to the conclusion that the 1997 official report had been wrong. 
""What the investigation we are doing now is about is to find out, as far as possible, what made these holes and how they occurred, he said.

1001,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Mysterious N.Korea site may be building nuclear components, report says","By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - A mysterious North Korean facility may be producing components for building nuclear bombs, a new report suggests, offering clues to understanding the site near the capital that has perplexed experts and policymakers.
The nondescript cluster of buildings called Kangson on the southwest outskirts of Pyongyang was first publicly identified in 2018 by a team of open-source analysts as the possible location of a facility for secretly enriching uranium, a fuel for nuclear bombs.
But the report by North Korea watchers at the 38 North project, reviewed by Reuters before its release on Friday, says satellite imagery points to the facility making components for centrifuges, the high-tech spinners used to enrich uranium, rather than enriching the fuel itself.
""The characteristics of the site are more consistent with a plant that could manufacture components for centrifuges,"" writes former International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) official Olli Heinonen in the report.
The imagery suggests the site lacks the infrastructure needed for enrichment, writes Heinonen, a distinguished fellow with the Stimson Center, the Washington think-tank that runs the project.
Pyongyang has denied having secret nuclear sites, an issue that contributed to the failure of a 2019 Hanoi summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Denuclearisation talks have remained stalled in part over U.S. assertions that the North is not fully declaring the extent of its programme.
""If the issue of undeclared facilities is going to be a factor in U.S.-North Korea negotiations, as it was in Hanoi, the more we can learn about these suspected facilities, the better we can assess their role and value to North Korea’s overall nuclear weapons development,"" said Jenny Town, deputy director of 38 North.
Friday's report could advance the debate on whether the Kangson site is building machines or using them to create bomb material.
Clandestine enrichment sites would complicate efforts to estimate the number of nuclear weapons produced by the North, which has pushed ahead with enlarging its nuclear deterrent in the absence of a denuclearisation agreement.
FILLING IN GAPS 
David Albright, one of the first analysts to reveal the site's existence, told Reuters it could be a covert enrichment facility but that the activity there is not convincing.
""We still see anomalies that do not allow us to reach a high confidence level"" that enrichment is taking place at Kangson, said Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security in Washington.
Similarly, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence reporting and analysis told Reuters they have reasons to believe Kangson is enriching uranium but that the evidence is not conclusive.
Kangson has many of features of an enrichment site, said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. It had been monitored by U.S. intelligence for more than a decade before he and a team of imagery analysts at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies identified the spot in 2018, he wrote in a report at the time.
The IAEA says Kangson shows some characteristics of an enrichment site but the organisation cannot be sure, as North Korea expelled its inspectors in 2009.
IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told Reuters the UN watchdog has ""indications,"" which he would not specify, that the site has a role in North Korea's nuclear programme.
Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King's College London, said that ""European intelligence officials are more cautious than their U.S. counterparts"" on whether Kangson is enriching uranium. The Europeans' position, he said, ""is that we simply don't know what's going on there for sure, so they can't jump to the conclusion that enrichment is taking place without more solid evidence.” 
Friday's 38 North report attempts to fill in some gaps.
Satellite imagery from 2003, when the main building was being constructed, shows a concrete floor that appears to be like those built for workshops, rather than the concrete pads used in enrichment facilities to protect sensitive equipment from vibrations, the report says.
Kangson appears to lacking air conditioning units that are essential for enrichment plants, and its security perimeter is not as extensive as at other nuclear sites, Heinonen writes.
He notes that the August U.N. report says an unnamed member state had spotted no cylinders used to transport uranium hexafluoride (UF6), a compound used in the enriching process.
While commercial satellites might miss such transfers, he argues, it is unlikely that the intelligence services of foreign countries would fail to spot them.

KHARTOUM/DUBAI (Reuters) - Clashes along Sudan's eastern border and the influx of tens of thousands of refugees from neighbouring Ethiopia have added to the challenges faced by a country already navigating a fraught political transition and protracted economic crisis.
Internal conflict in Ethiopia has driven more than 50,000 refugees into Sudan in just over a month, triggering a complex aid operation in an impoverished region of Sudan.
And fears of unrest in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region spilling into Sudan were fuelled when several Sudanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday, in what Khartoum called an ""ambush"" by Ethiopian forces and militias inside its borders.
Ethiopian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the incident.
Sudan has boosted its military presence near its eastern frontier since the conflict between Ethiopian federal forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) started on Nov. 4. 
But forces from Ethiopia's Amhara ethnic group, which back the government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, have also expanded their activity, leading to other incidents in long-disputed farmlands near the border where refugees have been crossing, Sudan's information minister Faisal Salih told Reuters.
""The tensions increased and some skirmishes took place recently,"" he said.
Amhara farmers claim rights to lands in the al-Fashqa plain also claimed by Sudan, and clashes sometimes flare during planting and harvest seasons.
Tigrayan refugees now hosted in eastern Sudan hold Amhara forces responsible for much of the violence they fled since early November.
Prompted by security concerns, Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok flew to Ethiopia on Sunday with what senior Sudanese officials said was a proposal to mediate.
Ethiopia, which declared victory over the TPLF on Nov. 29, said the offer was unnecessary. The TPLF has said it was continuing to fight.
Accounts are difficult to verify because most communications to the region have been down throughout the conflict.
Hamdok and Abiy agreed to revive a commission to settle their border dispute, which dates back to colonial times, and made progress over stalled three-way talks with Egypt on a giant hydropower dam Ethiopia has built on the Blue Nile, said Salih.
A diplomatic source in Sudan said Ethiopia's ambassador had been summoned over the troop deaths on Tuesday, but Abiy struck a conciliatory tone, tweeting: ""Such incidents will not break the bond (between) our two countries as we always use dialogue to resolve issues.""
VOLATILE REGION
Some people in Sudan are concerned that the fighting in Tigray, in which regional diplomats and humanitarian aid workers believe thousands of people have died, poses a threat to a volatile region.
The United Nations estimates that 950,000 people have been displaced by the crisis https://tmsnrt.rs/2KEWEmV.
""The conflict area in Ethiopia is a border area, and it's close to Sudan, Eritrea, and South Sudan. It can impact the whole region, and the Red Sea region,"" said Mervat Hamadelnil, head of a Sudanese civil society initiative that has pushed for Sudan to take an active stance on the Tigray war. 
Some also worry about the strain that refugee arrivals are placing on Sudan, which is trying to recover from decades of its own internal conflicts that displaced several million people.
An economic crisis has deepened since the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, causing fuel and bread shortages and pushing inflation to more than 250%. 
When the first refugees arrived last month, local communities in eastern Sudan welcomed them, residents and officials say.
But the influx has also pushed up the prices of basic goods, and aid agencies are struggling to source food, water and healthcare for refugees. 
Sudan's government has told many civil servants to work from home following a rise in coronavirus cases, complicating logistical operations. The head of Sudan's refugee commission died from COVID-19 earlier this month.
One pressure point is that Sudanese authorities, supported by the United Nations, are keen to move refugees quickly away from the border to camps, partly for fear that Tigrayan forces could use Sudan as a rear base, said a staff member of an aid organisation working in the area.
Some refugees are reluctant, hoping to return to Ethiopia to recover relatives, possessions and crops.
Three decades ago, Sudan backed Tigrayan forces that toppled Ethiopia's Marxist Derg rulers in a conflict that sent previous waves of refugees fleeing west over the border.
Sudan's transitional authorities, grateful for Ethiopia's mediation between the Sudanese military and civilian groups after Bashir's overthrow last year, now have no interest in playing a similar role against an Abiy government with international standing, said Suliman Baldo, a policy adviser for The Sentry, a Washington-based research group.

""Sudan needs to be very careful. They cannot afford now to be hosting opposition leaders and opposition armed groups,"" he said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The number of deaths recorded on migratory routes fell this year, although COVID-19 difficulties and so-called ""invisible shipwrecks"" mean the real number is probably much higher, officials at the U.N. migration agency said on Friday.
The IOM's Missing Migrants report showed 3,174 deaths compared to 5,327 in 2019.
""The decrease in recorded migrant deaths is not necessarily an indication that the number of lives lost truly dropped in 2020 as COVID-19 also challenges our ability both to collate data on deaths during migration and monitor specific routes,"" the IOM said.
Crucially, the data does not include losses from at least 15 so-called ""invisible shipwrecks"" in the Mediterranean - events that cannot officially be corroborated because the vessels cannot be located and information is insufficient.
If officials learn about them at all, it is often through bereaved family members.
Sometimes, the only indication is floating bodies.
In a poignant indication of the problem, the bodies of four children washed up on the shores of Libya this week from a boat believed to be carrying North and West African migrants. 
""Incidents like this happen way too often. These are the ones we know about and the number of lives lost on the crossing are much higher (than reported),"" said the IOM's Safa Msehli.
The report said 729 deaths had been confirmed in the central Mediterranean in 2020.
Msehli estimated that at least 600 more people have drowned in the Mediterranean this year in unrecorded incidents.
""There are gaps, serious life-threatening gaps in the monitoring of these routes,"" said the IOM's Paul Dillon, calling for rigorous, state-led search and rescue capacities. 
The IOM data also showed an increase in fatalities on some routes, such as the journey to Spain's Canary Islands, where 593 deaths were recorded compared with 210 last year.

More migrant losses were also recorded in South America, with many of the 104 recorded from Venezuela.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 08:56AM ET</span>","Analysis-U.S., Iran and inertia, an axis to dampen France's Lebanese dreams","By John Irish
PARIS (Reuters) -During a private dinner in Paris last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made clear that Washington was unhappy with France's strategy to include Iran-backed Hezbollah in efforts to resolve the economic and political crisis in Lebanon. 
French President Emmanuel Macron has been spearheading international efforts to rescue the former French protectorate from its deepest crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war. He has travelled twice to Lebanon since a huge explosion at the Beirut port in August devastated the city.
Macron is trying to use Paris' historical influence to persuade squabbling Lebanese politicians to adopt a road map and form a new government tasked with rooting out corruption, a prerequisite for international donors including the IMF to unlock billions of dollars in aid.
He had been due to return for a third visit on Dec. 22, but postponed the trip on Thursday after testing positive for coronavirus. Army chief Francois Lecointre will replace the president to visit French troops on the ground and an official involved in organising the visit said Macron may speak by phone to Lebanese President Michel Aoun but there were no other plans for now.
The 42-year-old French leader has from the outset faced the inertia of Lebanon's fractious political class, which has bickered and ignored international warnings of state bankruptcy, as well as resistance to his plans from Washington.
""The Lebanese political class is stuck in its own contradictions and is happy to play the clock,"" said Nadim Khoury at the Arab Reform Initiative. 
""(Prime Minister-designate) Saad al-Hariri is not able to form a government and internationally the U.S. will not facilitate French efforts to form a government.""
The U.S. objection to Macron's plan is centred on Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed armed movement that wields enormous power in Lebanon and which Washington brands a terrorist group.
Hariri, a former prime minister, was given the task of forming a government after Mustapha Adib resigned in September. He is so far struggling to cobble together a cabinet to share power with all Lebanese parties, including Hezbollah. 
Paris was not initially keen for Hariri to take up the role, having previously failed to implement reforms, three French officials said. But given the lack of progress in forming a credible government, Macron did not oppose the nomination.
France says Hezbollah's elected arm has a legitimate political role. 
The U.S. has already imposed sanctions on three leading politicians allied to Hezbollah. During a dinner in Paris last month with eight ambassadors, including from Europe, Pompeo made clear more measures would follow if Hezbollah were part of the government, according to two people with knowledge of his visit.
Responding to assertions that the U.S. was unhappy with French efforts, a French presidential official said President Donald Trump and Pompeo had clearly expressed support on several occasions for the French initiative to create a ""government capable of receiving international aid"".
The official added that the U.S. had participated in two donor conferences organised by France, underscoring its support.
In a statement after Pompeo had met Macron, the State Department said the two had discussed ""significant threats to global security, efforts to counter violent extremism, Iran’s destabilizing behavior, and Hezbollah’s malign influence in Lebanon"". 
The stalemate has important ramifications for all sides.
Without U.S. backing, international organisations and donors will not give Lebanon the money it needs to claw itself out of a financial crisis which the World Bank says will likely see more than half the population engulfed in poverty by 2021. 
Macron, having vowed amid the rubble in Beirut not to abandon the Lebanese people, is scrambling to show some foreign policy success in the region after walking empty-handed from high-profile initiatives on Libya and Iran in recent years.
For the outgoing U.S. administration, a tough stance on Hezbollah is key to demonstrating that its overall Middle East policy, including maximum pressure on Iran, has been effective.
Three diplomats said they did not expect President-elect Joe Biden to change policy quickly given the bi-partisan nature of the U.S. stance and other priorities for the new administration.
Biden has said he plans to scrap what he calls the ""dangerous failure"" of Trump’s maximum pressure policy on Iran, but people familiar with his thinking have said he will not shy away from using sanctions.
WARNING SIGNS
The differences with Washington exacerbate what was always going to be a difficult challenge for Macron.
When he had lunch with Lebanon's President Michel Aoun and parliament speaker Nabih Berri on Sept. 1, his objective was to ensure Berri, head of the Shi'ite Muslim Amal Movement, committed to a deadline to form a new government. 
Macron insisted on 10-15 days, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. Berri, a stalwart of Lebanese politics who has in the past had a hand in picking key ministers, twice responded with ""Insha'allah,"" (God Willing), a polite way sometimes used in the Middle East to react to something you don't want to do. Macron put out his palm to say no and again emphasize his demands.
Berri's office did not respond to a request for comment. 
Macron's office said: ""The president continues his calls with the various political players in Lebanon as he had previously committed to.""
A week later, although Macron said he had got all factions to back his plan, the United States blacklisted two former ministers, including one from Amal, for their ties to Hezbollah. 
""You're right to say the sanctions policy of the American administration, done without consultation or coordination with us, has strained the game,"" Macron said not long afterwards, when asked about the U.S. not being warm to his efforts. 
Since then Gebran Bassil, son-in-law of Aoun, who heads the Free Patriotic Movement, Lebanon's largest Christian party, has been sanctioned over his ties to Hezbollah. U.S., European and regional diplomats say new sanctions are imminent.
PUNITIVE MEASURES 
Hezbollah has become the overarching power in Lebanon, with elected members of parliament and positions in government. While its support from Iran has been hit by U.S. sanctions, the group remains a pillar of Tehran's regional influence.
French officials say Washington's punitive measures have done nothing to change the situation on the ground. A French presidential official told reporters on Dec. 2 ""they did not block anything ... but haven't unlocked anything either.""
Speaking at an online conference of the CSIS think-tank, U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Dorothy Shea said that while avoiding state failure in Lebanon was ""first and foremost"", Washington viewed Hezbollah as being ""wholly in service to their Iranian masters"" and said U.S. measures were having an effect.
Israel, the closest U.S. ally in the Middle East, regards Iran as its biggest threat and Hezbollah as the main danger on its borders.
Iranian officials said that Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was in contact with Tehran on how to handle Macron's initiative, but they would not allow Hezbollah to be weakened.
Macron has meanwhile been left admonishing Lebanon's politicians for betraying their commitments.

""As of today, these commitments have not been kept,"" he said on Dec. 2. ""So far, there is nothing to show that they were more than words. I regret that.""

ROME (Reuters) - After decades of neglect, one of ancient Rome's most important monuments, the mausoleum of the first emperor Augustus, has been restored and will reopen early next year, city officials announced on Friday.
The mausoleum is the largest circular tomb in the world and was constructed in 28 BC near the banks of the river Tiber to house the remains of Augustus and his heirs, including the emperors Tiberius, Caligula and Claudius.
""This is an historic moment,"" Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi told reporters, saying the site would open to tourists on March 1, with entrance free for all until April 21, the day the city marks its founding in 753 BC.
""To reopen a monument like this is a signal of hope as we look with good faith towards the future despite the uncertainties of the pandemic. We need to work for the future and maintain our traditions,"" she said.
Once one of the most magnificent buildings in the city, it underwent many changes after the fall of the Roman empire, at one point becoming a fortified castle, then a hanging garden and subsequently an amphitheatre for bullfighting and firework displays. 
At the start of the last century it was transformed into a huge theatre for concerts and operas before the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini ordered the dismantling of the auditorium as he sought to restore the landmarks of ancient Rome.
The site fell into disrepair over the years, trees grew from the walls and rubbish filled the pathways. 
All that has been cleared and the structure has been made safe thanks to a 10-million-euro ($12.25 million) restoration, partly financed by phone company TIM.
Augustus helped transform Rome into a world-class city with his infrastructure projects. On his deathbed, he reportedly said: ""Marmoream relinquo, quam latericiam accepi"" (I found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble).

The original marble cladding that adorned his tomb was plundered centuries ago and a statue that once towered over the building has long vanished, but tourists will get the chance to glimpse its past glories thanks to virtual reality tours.

Turkey's foreign ministry swiftly condemned the arrest, saying it violated the consular official's rights.
The official, a Greek national employed with the Turkish consulate on the island of Rhodes, was arrested on Friday after being questioned a week ago. A second Greek national was also arrested.
""One person was working at the Turkish consulate in Rhodes and the second man worked on a passenger ship which was operating the Rhodes-Kastelorizo line as a cook,"" a police official told Reuters.
Kastelorizo is a small Greek island just off the Turkish coast.
Turkey's foreign affairs ministry said the consulate worker was a secretary at its Rhodes representation. 
""In the process that led to the arrest of our employee, who holds Greek nationality, Greece violated his freedom, security and respect for private and family rights in the framework of the European Convention of Human Rights and Vienna Convention on Consular Relations,"" the ministry said.
One of the suspects was accused of photographing movements of Greek armed forces in the Aegean Sea. Greek media have reported that both individuals are members of Greece's Muslim minority based in the north of the country and that they had been under surveillance for several months.
Greece and Turkey have long running tensions, ranging from the divided island of Cyprus to exploration rights in the Aegean and Mediterranean Sea. Tensions flared in August when Turkey sent a seismic exploration vessel into waters claimed by Greece.

LONDON (Reuters) - Coronavirus vaccine approvals and rollouts have brought comfort and joy to many this Christmas but failed to halt new curbs on travel and family gatherings as COVID-19 cases rise worldwide.
More than 73.68 million people have been reported to be infected by the coronavirus globally and 1,655,424​ have died, according to a Reuters tally, with the United States leading the way in the number of deaths and infections.
A fast-spreading U.S. surge is pushing hospitals to the brink, weeks after millions took to the air and roads for the Thanksgiving holiday, with admissions rising to record heights for a 19th straight day.
Now many countries are preparing for the Christmas rush, with travel plans for thousands of Australians thrown into chaos when states and territories imposed border restrictions after 28 COVID-19 cases were detected in Sydney.
Large areas of England will be added to the ""very high alert"" COVID-19 tier category this weekend, placing residents under the most stringent curbs even as the government tries to defend a plan to relax curbs for five days over Christmas.
""It doesn't look like the tier system is holding the epidemic wave back, unfortunately"" John Edmunds, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told Sky News.
""I think we are going to have to look at these measures and perhaps tighten them up.""
South Korea, praised worldwide for its handling of the pandemic in its early stages, reported 1,062 new cases on Friday, its second-highest ever daily tally, as the government agonised over tighter restrictions.
Austrians abroad were heading home early for Christmas ahead of new quarantine rules coming in on Saturday. The country is going into a third lockdown after Christmas, the national news agency APA reported on Friday.
'NO SAFE PLACE'
Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset will ask cabinet colleagues on Friday to close restaurants for a month, two newspapers reported.
The Spanish capital of Madrid, one of Europe's worst COVID-19 hotspots at the start of the pandemic, has progressively reduced its spread without closing down clubs or shops.
But with an average notification rate of 244 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the last 14 days, the region is back to levels seen before the second wave started.
Police in Lithuania were planning to set up roadblocks to enforce a lockdown.
""There is no safe place in Lithuania,"" Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte told reporters last week.
As government leaders across the world address their nations on how to fight the pandemic, U.S. President Donald Trump has been largely silent, with his critics accusing him of abrogating his responsibilities as cases soar.
French President Emmanuel Macron tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday, prompting a track-and-trace effort across Europe following his numerous meetings with EU heads of government.
EU states will start vaccinations against COVID-19 on Dec. 27 as Europe tries to catch up with Britain and the United States after what some have criticised as a slow EU approval process for the shots.
The European Union has been waiting for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to approve a vaccine from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and German partner BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The EMA is expected to make an announcement on Dec. 21.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will ""rapidly"" work towards granting emergency approval of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine candidate, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said on Thursday.
A panel of outside advisers to the FDA overwhelmingly endorsed the emergency use the vaccine, virtually assuring a second option for protection.

It said Thailand should stop using the law, which bans insulting the monarchy, and other serious criminal charges against protesters, saying that criminalising such acts violates freedom of expression. 
Prosecutions, which had stopped in 2018, restarted after protesters broke longstanding taboos by calling for reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn during months of street demonstrations. Those found guilty under the royal insult law face three to 15 years in prison.
The spokesperson for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights noted that charges had also been filed against protesters for sedition and computer crimes offences. 
""We call on the Government of Thailand to stop the repeated use of such serious criminal charges against individuals for exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,"" spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told a news briefing in Geneva. 
The office of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged Thailand to change the lese majeste law to bring it in line with the right to freedom of opinion and expression.
The Thai government did not immediately comment when contacted by Reuters, saying it needed to review the rights office's statement first. 
Youth-led protests began in July to call for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and for the drafting of a new constitution.

They later called for reforms to the monarchy: seeking the king to be more clearly accountable under the constitution and the reversal of changes that gave him control of royal finances and some army units among other demands.

1012,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>","Gas, marbles and lead pellets: Peru protest deaths turn spotlight on police violence","By Marcelo Rochabrun
LIMA (Reuters) - Ruben Guevara was marching in teargas-filled streets in Lima in November when he was hit in the face by what felt like a gas canister, severely damaging his right retina. 
""We were protecting people who had already fallen to the ground and police kept moving forward and shooting straight at us,"" said Guevara, 32, a father of two.
Guevara was one of millions of Peruvians who marched against interim President Manuel Merino last month. After just five days in power, and faced by intense protests in Lima that led to the deaths of two demonstrators and some 200 injuries, Merino resigned.
The reaction by police to the protests in the capital has ignited a debate about police brutality, which human rights advocates say has historically been more common in the country's interior, where low-income Peruvians have a harder time demanding accountability. 
At least 20 demonstrators were shot with lead pellets or glass marbles during the Lima protests, according to medical records, interviews and information compiled by the local Human Rights Coordinator. On Thursday, Human Rights Watch said there was ""credible and solid"" evidence that such ammunition had been used by the police. 
At least half a dozen of those injured were hospitalized for over three weeks. A third person died in protests in northern Peru earlier this month. 
Peru's police declined to comment for this story. They have previously said they only used rubber bullets in counteracting protesters, and that any pellets or marbles must have been shot by the protesters instead. 
Jorge Vasquez, a pathologist in Lima who examined the body of one of those killed in the protests, as well as victims of a deadly nightclub stampede in August that was sparked by a police raid, said the number of deaths he was seeing as a result of police actions had increased this year.
Police in Lima had caused ""deaths that didn't need to happen,"" he said, adding that in his opinion police were ""getting out of control.""
In the wake of U.S. demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality this year, Latin America has also seen a wave of anger over perceived police impunity, with protests in Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Brazil.
In Peru, human rights advocates say police forces have been emboldened in part by a new 'Police Protection Law' passed in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic that backs officers who shoot on duty. 
Peru's new interim president Francisco Sagasti, a centrist who replaced Merino, has vowed there will be ""no impunity"" for violent officers, and removed 18 senior police chiefs from duty in the wake of the protests, citing the need to ""strengthen"" the police. 
No police officer has been charged or named as a potential suspect for actions relating to the protests.
'POLICE KILLED HIM'
Reuters TV footage filmed at the height of the protests in Lima showed how police fired tear gas without verbal warnings, aiming canisters either at body-height or at the sky, raising risk of injury. 
It showed police opening fire on demonstrators who had previously thrown rocks and other implements. None of the demonstrators appeared to be armed with firing weapons. 
Protester Jack Pintado died in Lima on Nov. 14, with 10 lead pellets lodged in his upper body, legal records show. Three weeks later, Jorge Munoz died on a sidewalk in Peru's north after being hit by a ""lead projectile.""
""Police killed him!,"" bystanders shouted as they desperately poured water on Munoz's injured skull, videos show. A row of riot police stood meters away. 
Others survived, their bodies heavily maimed. 
Lucio Suarez was hit in the head by three lead pellets which penetrated his skull and lodged into his brain, medical records show. 
Andres Rivero was also hit in the head, fracturing his skull. He was hospitalized for weeks and needs another surgery in January. 
""Police reform?,"" asked his father Mario Rivero, outside the hospital where Andres spent more than three weeks. ""Sure, but first I want to see the officer who did this to my son punished.""
In an interview with Reuters, Jose Luis Perez Guadalupe, who served as interior minister between 2015 and 2016, said he believed it was ""highly likely"" that the pellets that caused the injuries were shot by police. 
Others protesters, like Guevara, suffered injuries from teargassing. 
Reuters footage shows that at one point police shot a dozen canisters in the span of 10 seconds, forcing protesters to turn political cardboard signs into makeshift shields.
""A lot of unprotected people coupled with police who appear to not be particularly good at this: it's kind of a recipe for disaster,"" said Ed Maguire, a criminology professor at Arizona State University. 
Several protesters recounted how police threw gas canisters at panicked crowds. 
""When we tried to get through the gas, the police shot at us again,"" said Cesar Lecarnaque, a medical student who said he tended to three pellet victims on Nov. 14. ""I thought I was going to die."" 
Alonso Chero, a photographer for daily El Comercio, was covering the protests in Lima when officers began firing, he said. 
As he crouched and ran toward the protesters for safety he felt the impact of a shot in his back. 
A doctor later filmed how he extracted a glass marble from Chero's body that barely missed his spine. 

""To me the decision to use a glass marble is no different than the decision to fire a regular gun,"" said Maguire.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Prominent Turkish philanthropist Osman Kavala, already in jail for more than three years without being convicted, denied charges against him on Friday as an Istanbul court opened a new trial in which he is accused of involvement in an attempted coup in 2016.
Ankara's Western allies have raised concerns about Kavala's detention and the European Court of Human Rights has said it only serves to silence him. After President Tayyip Erdogan last month promised judicial reforms, rights activists and opposition politicians redoubled calls for his release.
Immediately after he was acquitted in February of charges related to nationwide Gezi Park protests in 2013, Kavala was newly arrested on charges related to the failed coup in 2016. 
""None of the charges in this indictment are based on any facts, evidence or objective evaluation of a concrete criminal act,"" Kavala told the court by video link from prison. 
The allegations ""are in stark contrast to my world view, ethical values and the goals of the projects carried out by the civil society organizations under my supervision,"" he said. 
Critics say the detention points to political pressure on Turkey's judiciary, which they say has been bent to punish thousands of the government's perceived opponents in the wake of the 2016 failed coup.
While Erdogan's reform pledges prompted speculation that Kavala and others may be released, the president said last month he could never defend the philanthropist and called him the sponsor of the 2013 protests - despite courts clearing him of that accusation.
In the new indictment, Kavala is accused of collaborating with Henri Barkey, a prominent Turkey scholar in the United States. The indictment accuses Barkey of links to the network of U.S.-based Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Ankara accuses of orchestrating the coup.
Gulen denies involvement in the coup attempt.
Kavala and Barkey are charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, for which a conviction carries a life sentence without parole, and with espionage, which could lead to up to 20 years in jail.
Barkey has rejected the charges as a ""complete fabrication"".
The indictment says Kavala and Barkey spoke by phone on Oct. 8, 2016, nearly three months after the failed July 15 coup. It says that many times between 2013 and 2016, signals on Barkey and Kavala's phones came from the same area and that they met at an Istanbul restaurant on July 18, 2016.
Barkey told Reuters in October in an emailed response that the two had run into each other at the restaurant and chatted briefly. He added that their phones could easily have been in the same district of a crowded city at other times without them meeting.
The ECHR ruled last year that Kavala should be released since the evidence did not back up the charges. This month, the Council of Europe's Committee of Ministers also called for his release.
In October, the Turkish court lifted Kavala's arrest warrant related to the constitutional order charge but kept him jailed due to the espionage charge.
Ahead of Friday's hearing, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and other groups called for Kavala's release.

""Implement the binding European Court of Human Rights decision. Drop the baseless charges against him,"" Milena Buyum, Amnesty's Turkey campaigner, said on Twitter.

Buyoya died just two months after being convicted in absentia by a court in Burundi of the 1993 murder of a successor, a killing that triggered more than a decade of ethnic bloodletting.
""The death of former president Pierre Buyoya is confirmed. There is no more doubt,"" the head of the information and communications division at the office of Burundi's President Willy Nyamitwe said in a tweet.
At the time of his death, Buyoya had been living in Mali, where he had held a post as an envoy of the African Union. An official at the Clinique Pasteur in the Malian capital Bamako told Reuters Buyoya had been treated there before being evacuated to Paris overnight. He gave no further details.
A relative of Buyoya, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters Buyoya had died on Thursday en route to Paris for medical treatment.
French radio RFI said Buyoya had contracted COVID-19 in Mali and had been hospitalised there for a week.
Malian government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. The French foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Buyoya, a member of the Tutsi minority that held power in Burundi for decades after the country's 1962 independence from Belgium, was president for 13 years in total during two stints, from 1987-1993 and from 1996-2003.
From 2012, Buyoya served as the African Union's envoy for Mali and the Sahel region. He resigned last month after his conviction in absentia at home.
Buyoya first took power in 1987, ousting president Jean-Baptiste Bagaza in a military coup. In June, 1993, Buyoya left office after losing Burundi's first free election, to Melchior Ndadaye, a member of the Hutu majority. 
Just three months after Ndadaye took office, soldiers from the still Tutsi-dominated military captured and killed the new president. His death unleashed a conflict in which both the Tutsi-led army and mainly Hutu rebels were accused of atrocities against civilians.
In October, Burundi's Supreme Court convicted Buyoya in absentia of Ndadaye's murder, sentencing him to life in jail.
Buyoya called the conviction politically motivated. RFI said that at the time of his death he planned to return to Burundi to clear his name.

Three years after the killing of Ndadaye, Buyoya returned to power in a second military coup. He stepped down in 2003, replaced by his vice president, Domitien Ndayizeye, a Hutu, as part of an agreement that helped end the conflict.

Tens of thousands of farmers have blocked roads leading into New Delhi for the past three weeks demanding a repeal of laws that give them the option to sell directly to private companies.
The government says the change is necessary to boost farm returns and improve storage and other infrastructure. 
But the farmers, mainly from the northern agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana, fear private companies would eventually dictate terms and the government would stop buying grains like wheat and rice from them at a minimum guaranteed price.
In online remarks to farmers of the country's biggest wheat-producing state, Madhya Pradesh, Modi said there should be no cause for concern and repeated the government's position that farmers would be assured of a price like earlier.
""The modern facilities available to the farmers of major nations should also be available for those from India, it cannot be delayed any longer,"" he said.
""Still, if anyone has any apprehension, and in the interest of the farmers of the country and to address their concerns, we are very humbly ready to talk on every issue.""
His comments came as farmers, many in their sixties or above, brave north India's harsh winter to camp out in the open on Delhi's borders with their tractors and trailers parked bumper to bumper.
After a series of previous meetings with Modi's ministers, the protesters have said that nothing short of an official annulment of the three laws will be enough to change their position.

Rakesh Tikait, a farmers' leader, said after Modi's speech that the premier was trying to privatise agriculture to benefit companies and not them.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Songphon ""Yajai"" Sonthirak had been a boxer for most of his young life and knew how to face down a stronger opponent: Keep your guard up, stand tall, stay focused. So he was shocked to discover, on the day of his arrest, how little his training mattered and how fear seized him.
Yajai, meaning ""balm for the heart,"" is a 21-year-old law student with a mop of dyed blue-green hair. He'd volunteered to help with security at a small anti-government protest in the heart of old Bangkok.
It was Oct. 13, a Tuesday, the start of 11 days that would change Yajai's life and shake Thailand.
For three months, thousands of young Thais had been pouring onto streets in protests of growing size and boldness, largely unimpeded by police. They were demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a retired army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup. Far more remarkably, they were publicly criticising King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is protected from insult by a strict lese majeste law. The young demonstrators were thus risking criminal prosecution and tearing up the rules of a society centred on devotion to its monarch, who is still revered by many as semi-divine.
Yajai and his friends were gathered around a pick-up truck that doubled as a sound stage. Reuters reporters witnessed the scene. It was the end of the rainy season, overcast and drizzling. Dancing on the truck was Yajai's friend Jatupat ""Pai"" Boonpattararaksa. Pai had previously served two years in prison for sharing a critical article about King Vajiralongkorn on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), so falling foul of Thailand's lese majeste law. Today, Pai was gyrating his hips and singing a satirical song about the king.
""Don't love him, don't love him, don't love him, don't love him
Then be careful you'll go to jail, to jail, to jail...""
Other protesters sang along or held up three-fingered salutes, a gesture of defiance borrowed from the Hunger Games movies.
Yajai watched the police. Since late morning, there'd been a few cops. Then, around 3 p.m., hundreds of officers swarmed the intersection where the protesters were gathered. King Vajiralongkorn, on a rare visit to Thailand from Germany, where he has spent much of each year, would soon pass in his motorcade on the way to a nearby temple.
Normally when a royal motorcade approaches, Thais sit on the ground or even prostrate themselves, in silence. Now, for the first time, openly disrespectful protesters would be within shouting distance of the king. And for the first time since these protests began, police were moving in to break up the demo.
""Form a line! Form a line!"" Yajai shouted, linking arms with others to hold back the police.
The police lines moved closer, slowly throttling the protest. Yajai later recounted how, in the confusion, he saw a policeman grab one of his friends and he ran to help. After the briefest of scuffles, he was pinned down and carried off by four or five officers, then bundled into a police van.
""I'd always thought my boxing experience meant I could protect myself, but it turns out I couldn't do a thing,"" Yajai said. ""I'd never been more frightened in my life.""
In the van, Yajai said he was guarded by six policemen. ""Who do you all think you are?"" he recalled one of them sneering. ""Did you think you could win?'""
Modern Thai history is littered with failed street protests, many of them crushed by the military. Most recently, in 2010, more than 90 people died in clashes when the army ended pro-democracy protests by the populist ""Red Shirts.""
This time is different, say the young protesters, who continue to pour into the streets. They portray their movement as more inclusive, incorporating diverse political and social grievances. Three demands unite them: They want Prayuth's resignation; a new, more democratic constitution; and curbs on the monarch's powers, though not his overthrow.
They have learned from the tactics of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement and built alliances with anti-China activists in Taiwan. This new generation threatens to upend Thailand's conservative, predominantly Buddist establishment. And they are complicating U.S. hopes of drawing Thailand, America's oldest ally in the region, away from China's growing sphere of influence. Some Thai officials suspect Washington is aiding the protests, despite U.S. denials.
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told Reuters the authorities need to do a better job of explaining to young people ""why the monarchy is important and why it has been with Thailand for centuries."" Prayuth's government, he went on, was democratically elected and any challenge should come from parliament, not the street.
The palace didn't respond to a request for comment.
Yajai and Pai were among 21 protesters arrested that day. Deputy police spokesman Colonel Kissana Phathanacharoen said the force was following standard operating procedure faced with an illegal gathering that was blocking the road.
In the days that followed, there would be bigger demos, more arrests, and harsher responses as the government tried to contain the unrest.
The damage to the monarchy's lustre was already done. After Yajai, Pai and several others were arrested, dozens of protesters remained on the street, their hands raised in three-fingered salutes. When the king's limousine went past they shouted a new battle cry.
""Free our friends! Free our friends!""
""WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS""
While Yajai spent his first night in a police cell, Patsaravalee ""Mind"" Tanakitvibulpon was worrying about portable toilets. And also about her parents. Again.
Mind, a 25-year-old engineering student from Bangkok, was helping to organise a bigger protest for the next day, Oct. 14. Thousands would march to Government House, home to the prime minister's office, and occupy the surrounding streets for five days. They would need trucks, tents, all sorts of supplies – including portable toilets, which Mind was struggling to rent.
She was also trying to convince her parents that everything was going to be okay. ""I give my mother such a headache,"" she told Reuters.
Mind has a tiny frame, a disarming smile and a habit of greeting people with a cheerful, double-handed wave. She had worked mostly behind the scenes as a protest organiser. The youth movement is often described as ""leaderless"" when it is actually hydra-headed, with new leaders emerging with every arrest. It would soon be Mind's turn.
There were already hints at the firebrand she would become. At a big protest outside parliament in September, she had climbed onto a truck.
""We will not stop until we have a constitution that comes from the people,"" she thundered. ""We will not stop until the dark forces disappear!"" When she got down from the truck, she was still so nervous her legs were shaking.
Many student protesters use the Thai phrase taa sawang – literally, ""eyes brightened"" – to describe their political awakening. Mind's eyes brightened in 2015, on the first anniversary of Prayuth's coup. A dozen or more young people protested against military rule in central Bangkok. In a video, Mind saw police officers and men in civilian clothes drag away protesters.
""I was shocked and thought, 'Why can't we talk about the coup? What kind of democracy is this?'"" said Mind. ""That was it. That was the beginning.""
Like most Thais, Mind was taught from an early age that the king is the centre of Thai identity. Gold-framed portraits of the monarch hang in all classrooms and look down on city streets. Cinema audiences stand for the royal anthem.
Mind began to question the things she'd learned. She went online to study the history she hadn't known at school. She listened to lectures by outspoken Thai scholars and watched radical documentaries. She thought about the duelling protests that dominated her childhood, pitting Thais clothed in the colours of their movements: the populist Red Shirts against the royalist Yellow Shirts. And she reflected how any challenge to the military establishment was branded anti-monarchy.
She began to see a straight line through her country's turbulent past. It drew through dozens of coups and attempted coups and popular uprisings and military massacres, right back to the 1932 Siamese Revolution that ended the centuries-long reign of Thailand's absolute monarchs.
But despite the shift to a constitutional monarchy that revolution was unfinished, and today the military and monarchy exist in an unhealthy alliance, Mind thought. She believed that the only way to avoid future violence was to talk more about the monarchy, not less.
""We don't want to topple the monarchy, but we want to talk about these problems,"" she said. ""For too long, no one has dared.""
A HEARING
The next morning, Oct. 14 – the day of the big protest – Yajai appeared at a hearing in a Bangkok court. According to Yajai and his lawyers, he faced 10 charges, including illegal assembly, damaging property and blocking traffic. The offenses were fairly minor and Yajai had no criminal record. He was confident the court would grant him bail and he would still make it to the protest.
Yajai not only studied law; he believed in it.
Growing up in northeast Thailand, where his parents ran a market stall in a small town in Roi-et province, he thought little of politics; he barely remembered the 2014 coup. His activism began at university, where he joined an environmental group. In 2019, he met his friend, Pai, newly released from prison, in the university's law department.
There was a general election in March 2019, the first since the coup, and Yajai hoped for a return to democracy. Like many young Thais, Yajai supported Future Forward, a new progressive party. It came third, and General Prayuth remained prime minister. The opposition complained the election was designed to favour military-backed parties. Prayuth said the vote was fair.
Less than a year later, in February 2020, Future Forward was dissolved by a Thai court on the grounds the party received an illegal loan from its founder, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit. Future Forward's supporters were outraged. The student protests began.
Today's protest in Bangkok would be the biggest Yajai had attended – if only the court would grant him bail. 
But Yajai was denied bail. ""I was in deep shock. I couldn't even form a thought,"" he recalled. He was driven to Bangkok Remand Prison and locked in a squalid cell packed with two dozen people. He was relieved to see that Pai was among them.
A spokesperson for the Court of Justice said of the case: ""The court is impartial and independent and all the decisions it makes are based on the law.""
""THEY CAN TRY TO SHUT OUR MOUTHS BUT WE WILL REFUSE""
Mind arrived for the big protest after noon with an oversized white bow in her hair and wearing one of her favourite T-shirts. It read, ""Love Cat, Hate Coup.""
The protest was layered with symbolism. Democracy Monument, where the protesters gathered, commemorates the 1932 end of absolute monarchy. Oct. 14 was the anniversary of a 1973 student-led uprising that propelled the military dictators of the day into exile and ushered in a brief period of democracy.
The march was aimed at occupying the streets surrounding Government House, around a mile away. Mind was riding on one of three main sound trucks. She looked at the crowd and felt her adrenalin pumping. There were tens of thousands of people.
Attached to Mind's truck was a German flag, a reference to the king's frequent extended visits in Bavaria. A protester on another truck was wearing a crop top with a bare midriff, a more daring reference to the king. Photos of King Vajiralongkorn dressed this way had appeared in several European tabloids and had circulated online in Thailand.
The march set off. The trucks played songs or led the crowd in chants of ""1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Asshole Tu!"" Prime Minister Prayuth's nickname is Uncle Tu.
The march soon ground to a halt. The road to Government House was blocked by buses and riot police. Hours went by at a standstill. Then, at dusk, the protesters swept through the barricades and occupied the surrounding streets.
It was now Mind's job to help organise for the planned occupation. Groups of people set up stages, sound systems and tents. The portable toilets were en route. Food vendors wheeled in carts and sold grilled chicken and pancakes. Within an hour, a tent city had sprung up with a festive atmosphere.
Mind was confident. ""If we can maintain a large enough crowd, I don't think the police will take drastic action,"" she recalled thinking.
She was wrong. At 4 a.m. Prayuth declared a state of emergency, citing ""turmoil"" and ""acts affecting the Royal Motorcade"" after a few dozen protesters jeered Queen Suthida's car on Oct. 14. All political gatherings of more than five people were now illegal, and the police had wide powers of arrest and detention.
Just before dawn, riot police surged back into the area, ripping down protesters' barricades and tents. Thousands fled. Police arrested dozens of people, including 18 protest leaders, but not Mind. She slipped away into the night, only to reappear hours later to address a protest in central Bangkok, near the national police headquarters.
With so many leaders now behind bars, Mind was stepping up. ""Hello, all democracy-loving brothers and sisters!"" she told the crowd. ""More than 30 of our friends have been arrested. Is this appropriate? Is this right? Our friends are fighters. They fought bravely to challenge the dictatorial power of the government.""
Her legs weren't shaking this time. ""They can try to shut our mouths,"" she cried, ""but we will refuse!""
A FAMILY DISPUTE
As the Oct. 14 drama unfolded, 18-year-old student Raroengchon ""Kaen"" Rattanavijai was watching the protests on television at her grandmother's house in Bangkok's eastern suburbs.
She had always been close to her grandmother, and had chosen to spend the day with her rather than alone in the dormitory. The protests were about to tear her family apart.
Three televisions in her grandmother's house were tuned to Nation TV, whose commentators have described the protesters as ""nation haters."" Kaen's grandmother and aunt watched in outrage.
""They're a disgrace to our country,"" Kaen recalled her grandmother saying. ""I wouldn't be against the idea of shooting them dead.'""
Kaen fumed but said nothing. She had already attended some protests but knew it was pointless to argue with her grandmother. She also knew that, a few years ago, she too might have condemned the protests.
Kaen, a budding artist, speaks in near-flawless English picked up during a year in Alaska on a high school exchange program. Reverence of the monarchy runs deep in her family. She had marched with her mother in pro-royalist demonstrations in her earlier teens. Her grandmother had been fostered by an aristocratic family and grew up inside the grounds of a royal palace in Bangkok. Kaen and her mother went to an elite girls' school.
""We had to write essays about why we love the king,"" said Kaen. ""I was taught you cannot question this one person.""
The turning point for Kaen came in 2016 with the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the current king's father. King Bhumibol had ruled for so long – 70 years – that most Thais had no memory of a time before. For many Thais, he is the archetypal monarch: kind, wise, frugal, dutiful, despite the crown's vast wealth.
King Vajiralongkorn's style was different. He took control of the Crown Property Bureau, which manages the monarchy's holdings, from the country's finance ministry. The government transferred two bodyguard units in Bangkok to the king's personal command. King Vajiralongkorn ordered the creation of a new volunteer corps, millions strong, whose members salute his portrait.
In May 2019, shortly before his coronation, the thrice-divorced king married one of his longtime bodyguards and named her Queen Suthida. Three months later, he elevated another bodyguard to be his ""Royal Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) Consort,"" a title that hadn't been used since 1921. Soon after, the consort was stripped of the title for what the palace called her ""very evil behavior,"" only to be later restored and publicly declared ""untainted.""
By then, the student protests were gaining momentum, and criticism of King Vajiralongkorn was blossoming online. Kaen read some of this and taa sawang – her political awakening began. Or, as she put it in American English: ""I was like, 'All my life, was it all a freaking lie?'""
Kaen started attending protests. Her family knew this, which made their comments in front of the television so hurtful. ""My aunt said if I was to hold up three fingers, I might lose them,"" she recalled.
Kaen silently resolved to defy the emergency decree and join the next protest.
""I thought the justice system would help protect us""
The morning after his arrival at Bangkok Remand Prison, Yajai's green-blue hair was shaved off by a guard.
Anti-coronavirus measures meant prisoners weren't allowed to leave their cells. Yajai's overcrowded cell had no beds. Prisoners slept on mats on the hard floor. The lights were left on 24/7. In one corner, open to the room, was a toilet and water barrel. Yajai shut his eyes while washing in case he saw anyone watching him.
A spokesman for the Department of Corrections told Reuters that prisons were quarantining new arrivals for 14 days because of the coronavirus, and this was leading to more overcrowding. It is government policy to treat all prisoners in accordance with international standards, he said.
The cell had a television but it mainly aired prison information broadcasts or the Royal Bulletin – a reverential daily round-up of royal activities shown on most Thai channels. There was nothing on the protests.
Yajai battled despair. ""I thought the justice system would help protect us,"" he said.
Seventeen of the 20 protesters arrested along with Yajai now shared his cell. Reuters interviewed several of them, including Pai, who was the oldest at 29. He'd been in jail before. He helped his friends prepare their beds, cracked jokes and urged them to eat and exercise.
Yajai encountered another political activist – a well-known Red Shirt called Nattawut Saikua, imprisoned for his role in the 2007-2010 pro-democracy protests. Yajai and several others recounted how Nattawut lifted their spirits, telling them they were fighters, not criminals.
""Just changing this mindset made things better,"" Yajai recalled.
Nattawut had access to information about what was happening on the streets. He told them tens of thousands of people were still protesting. Soon, said Yajai, a new thought punctured his gloom about being jailed: It was worth it.
LEARNT FROM HONG KONG
Just after 5 p.m. on Oct. 16, Kaen arrived at that day's protest site – Ratchaprasong, a busy intersection in central Bangkok – to find that police had sealed it off. It was the third straight day of mass protests and police were growing more forceful.
Kaen pulled out her phone and checked Telegram, the latest messaging app used to organise the protests and confound police. The protesters had seen in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement the value of last-minute changes of plan and tactics. 
Sure enough, there was a message announcing a different venue: another busy intersection nearby, flanked by giant shopping malls and crisscrossed with elevated train tracks and pedestrian walkways.
Thousands of protesters had occupied the intersection, bringing rush-hour traffic to a halt. Among them were high school students in their uniforms. A loudspeaker on a truck pumped out chants of ""Prayuth, get out!"" Food vendors moved in to sell to protesters. Reuters reporters were at the scene.
Kaen was sitting in front of a makeshift stage when she heard someone say, ""The police are coming!"" She stood and saw a line of riot police edging towards the protest, a big truck behind them. Only when Kaen saw drenched protesters run past did she realize the truck had a water cannon.
A cry went up: ""We need umbrellas!"" Kaen watched as people on the walkways threw down umbrellas. Hands reached out to pass them to people on the front line facing the water cannon. This human conveyor belt was a scene straight from the Hong Kong protests.
As the water cannon broke through, the crowd turned and fled. Kaen ran with them, fending off calls from her mother, who was watching live TV coverage of the protests. ""Mom, I don't have time for you right now!' Kaen thought. A few hours later, her mom would pick her up, along with another student who'd been kicked out of her royalist home.
The Royal Bulletin that evening showed the king on a visit to a university. He told a group of subjects sitting at his feet, ""Right now, the country needs people who love the nation and the royal institution. We must teach the new generation to understand this.""
But it wasn't just the new generation that was asking questions. The use of water cannons on non-violent protesters, many of them school kids, shocked many people. One was Kaen's mother, Patcharee. When the family's messaging group erupted in an argument, Patcharee took her daughter's side and called for the monarchy's reform.
Kaen's grandmother left the chat in disgust. So did Kaen's aunt, who later shared a Facebook post, seen by Reuters, that read: ""I cut ties with anyone who supports the protests insulting the monarchy, whatever our relationship.""
Kaen stopped going to her grandmother's house. When her grandfather had a birthday party, she and her parents weren't invited, Kaen said.
""WE WILL STILL BE OUT HERE FIGHTING""
Yajai was released from prison the following Monday, Oct. 19, after seven days behind bars. Mind was arrested on Wednesday night and charged with breaching the emergency decree, but was released the next morning. The next day, she led a rally outside Bangkok Remand Prison to call for the release of Pai and the remaining jailed protesters.
Pai walked free on Friday and immediately resumed his activism. ""Send our voices to those locked up inside,"" he told a cheering crowd at the prison gates. ""No matter how many leaders they arrest, we will still be out here fighting.""
The fight, all three agreed, had barely begun. The protests continue. And no one can predict what will happen next.
The king has extended his stay in Thailand indefinitely. He attended gatherings with loyalists in yellow shirts – the monarchy's colour – and posed for selfies or signed autographs. Millions of mostly older Thais still passionately believe that devotion to the king is the core of Thai culture and identity.
The government has barely budged either. Prayuth promised to consider changes to the constitution, the process for selecting the prime minister, for example, but not to the sections that deal with the monarchy's powers. He also said in late November that all laws would be used against the protesters, including Article 112 – the lese majeste law – which remained on the statute book but hadn't been applied for the past two years. At least 30 protesters have since been questioned by police on suspicion of breaching the lese majeste law. Charges have not so far been laid.
There have also been signs of violence as protests ground through November and into December. On Nov. 17, protesters marching on parliament clashed with police firing water cannons and tear gas. That evening, six protesters sustained gunshot wounds after they fought with royalist counter-protesters.
But Pai, Yajai, Mind and Kaen continue to hope. Speaking in early December, they said their movement continued to grow. They believe the change they helped set in motion is seismic. And now that the taboo about criticising the king is gone, they say, everything about the future is up for discussion.

""I can create change,"" Mind said. ""It's a powerful feeling.""

1018,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>",Algerians impatient for change with president still out sick,"By Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune's first appearance since being hospitalised in Germany with COVID-19 in October was intended to reassure a country where big political decisions are long overdue. 
But on the streets of Algiers people voiced growing impatience after the five-minute video message he gave on Sunday saying he would still be away for up to three weeks. 
""Most of our demands are still awaiting a response,"" said Ahmed Abbachi, a member of the leaderless protest movement known as Hirak.
The major energy producer has been in turmoil since early last year when mass protests pushed the old president Abdelaziz Bouteflika from power along with many of his clique, but left much of the ruling elite at the helm. 
The period of unrest, and this year's pandemic, have delayed Algeria's efforts to address systemic frailties looming over the economy as declining oil and gas revenue threaten lavish social spending. 
The 75-year-old, a heavy smoker, appeared gaunt in his video message, the first sight that Algerians had had of their president since he went to Germany. 
The absence of any photographs or videos spurred rumours that his condition was worse than the official news bulletins proclaiming his good health were letting on. 
It reminded many Algerians of the long years when Bouteflika was incapacitated by illness, leaving government largely rudderless while rival power blocs in the ruling elite jostled for influence. 
""Bouteflika was completely unable to speak, to walk, and we were told over and over again that he was capable of leading the country,"" said plumber Antar Aissaoui, before Tebboune's video appearance. 
The president will have a full in-tray when he finally returns to Algiers. The government is pushing a programme of economic reforms seen as necessary to avert a looming fiscal crunch after burning through more than half its foreign currency reserves in five years. 
The Hirak street protest movement remains unconvinced by Tebboune's efforts to turn a page on last year's unrest. 
While demonstrations have not taken place since a COVID-19 lockdown began in March, the referendum he pushed in November on constitutional changes had turnout of only a quarter of registered voters. 
""Algeria faces one of the most difficult periods of its history. Threats are surrounding us from all directions,"" said schoolteacher Rachid Chalabi, referring to the internal political crisis, looming economic threats and conflicts in neighbouring countries. 
""Tebboune will face his biggest challenges after recovering. Everything indicates that the path to stability is still long,"" said 37-year-old engineer Djamel Taibi.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Supporters of firebrand Indonesian cleric Rizieq Shihab clashed with police during a demonstration in Jakarta on Friday, after demanding their spiritual figurehead be released from police detention.
Several hundred protesters, some dressed in white Islamic garb, had gathered in the capital of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, with scuffles breaking out after police told the group large gatherings were prohibited amid the pandemic.
""For the safety of our souls...the police and the military will disperse (protesters) and act decisively,"" a police officer told protesters, blasting the message through a sound system. 
Indonesia is grappling with the worst coronavirus outbreak in Southeast Asia, averaging more than 6,000 new cases per day this week.
Police deployed thousands on the streets of Jakarta on Friday to guard the protest, with a new requirement for people to present a negative rapid COVID-19 test to enter the capital likely thwarting some supporters from joining the rally. 
Rizieq, the controversial leader of the Islamic Defenders' Front (FPI) was arrested last weekend for allegedly violating coronavirus protocols after his recent return to Indonesia following three years in self-exile was marked with events attended by thousands.
The calls for his release also come after six of the cleric's bodyguards were shot dead following a clash with police on a highway.

The FPI, once notorious for raiding bars and brothels, has become more politically influential in recent years, particularly after helping orchestrate mass rallies against Jakarta's former Christian governor in 2016 that were the largest in decades.

Turkey had set up a dozen military posts in the region in 2018 as part of an ill-fated deal it reached with Russia and Iran to calm fighting between Syrian government troops and rebels. Ankara backs the forces fighting Bashar al-Assad, while Moscow and Tehran back the Syrian president.
Several Turkish military posts were surrounded last year by the Russian-backed Syrian government forces. Turkey vowed at the time to maintain its presence at all of them but it started withdrawing in October.
The source, who requested anonymity, said the last of the evacuations was completed on Thursday night, and the forces were being redeployed within territory controlled by the Ankara-backed forces under an understanding reached with Russia.
""It is not in the form of troop withdrawal or reducing their numbers. The situation is just about changing location,"" the source said.
Syrian rebels say Turkey retains between 10,000 and 15,000 troops in northwest Syria, alongside rebel fighters backed by Turkey and jihadist forces it has committed to disarm and contain.
Already home to nearly 4 million Syrian refugees, Turkey is determined to prevent further influx of people fleeing fighting. The United Nations says there are about 4 million people in northwest Syria outside Syrian government control, of which 2.7 million have been displaced during the nine-year conflict.

Jee Jong Hoon, 54, who uses sign language to communicate, was charged in a court in western Penang state with using criminal force to outrage the modesty of the men, his lawyer Shanmugam Ganesan told Reuters. The alleged victims were described by the police as having speech and hearing impairments.
Jee is the latest foreign religious figure accused of abusing Christian church congregants in Malaysia. Briton Richard Huckle died in prison last year after being convicted of targeting children in vulnerable communities while volunteering at a church in Kuala Lumpur.
Jee was accused of hugging, kissing and groping the men, who were in their 20s, in two separate incidents in 2013 and 2017.
He did not enter a plea since he could not understand Malaysian sign language, Shanmugam said, adding that his client intended to plead not guilty.
The court set Jan. 18 for the charges to be re-read to Jee after his lawyer requested that the court appoint an international sign language interpreter.
""He is denying the charges against him,"" Shanmugam said, without elaborating.
If convicted, Jee could face up to 10 years in prison, a fine or both.
Shanmugam said he expected further charges to be filed against his client. 
In a statement on Thursday, Malaysian police said six reports had been filed against a South Korean pastor for allegedly molesting five men aged between 27 and 40 who had hearing and speech impairments in incidents dating back to 2011.
Malaysia's national criminal investigations director Huzir Mohamed confirmed on Friday that the statement was referring to Jee.

The pastor, who is married with two children, arrived in Malaysia in 1998 after being invited to conduct Bible teachings by the founder of an association for the deaf, Huzir said.

A 67-year-old woman who sells shrimp in the Samut Sakhon province was confirmed to have the infection, senior health official Sopon Iamsirithaworn told a news conference, adding that three of her family members later also tested positive.
She did not have a history of travelling outside the country, the official said, adding they were waiting for the results of the tests of 165 other people who had been in close contact with the woman.
""We are collecting information to find the origins of this infection,"" said Disease Control Department director-general, Opas Karnkawinpong at the same news conference.
Local cases have been in the single-digits in recent months, with most of them found in people observing quarantine after having been in close contact with an infected person. Most of Thailand's recent cases have been imported.
Thailand has managed to keeping infections relatively low, reporting a total of 4,297 cases and 60 COVID-19 deaths, but the success has come at a cost to its tourism-dependent economy. 
The new infections come as authorities on Thursday began easing travel restrictions to allow foreign tourists to return to the country in a bid to revive its battered tourism industry. 
Thailand eased restrictions for citizens from over 50 countries, but visitors will need to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival and will need a certificate to show they were free of COVID-19 72 hours before travel.

Last month, authorities tested over 300 people after Thai nationals entered the country illegally from Myanmar, but most new infections were found in quarantine.

On the other end of the question were some of the most senior leaders in the U.S. military: Then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Milley's senior enlisted advisor, Ramon Colon-Lopez.
Virtual town halls like this have been a way for the Pentagon's top brass to address concerns in 2020 about racial discrimination in a military - America's largest employer - which is diverse in lower ranks but largely white and male at the top. 
Apparently unbeknownst to Colon-Lopez, who responded only indirectly to Champ, the Defense Department not only carries out granular surveys about discrimination but has been legally-required to do so since the 1990s https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/senate-bill/2182/text?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22cite%3APL103-337%22%5D%7D&r=1&s=1. The last survey of the active duty force, conducted every four years, was for fiscal year 2017.
However, the Defense Department denied repeated requests from Reuters to release the 2017 survey data, including through a Freedom of Information Act request. It has also not released a separate report about the 2017 survey data or clearly explained why the data has been withheld for so long.
Maryland Rep. Anthony Brown, a retired Army Reserve colonel and the only member of the Congressional Black Caucus on the House Armed Services Committee, said the failure to release the data was troubling.
""It concerns me tremendously,"" Brown said, adding Congress had established a clear reporting requirement and the public had a right to know. 
Champ declined to be interviewed for this article, the Army said. Colon-Lopez did not respond for a request for comment.
In its final response to Reuters this month, rejecting the Freedom of Information Act request, the Department of Defense said the survey data constituted ""information of a pre-decisional, deliberative nature."" 
If released, the Pentagon asserted it could ""reasonably be expected to interfere with the government’s deliberative process.""
Still, the data is already so old that the Pentagon is now in the awkward position of having to start planning for another survey in the ongoing 2021 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.
MAKES THEM LOOK BAD
A Pentagon spokeswoman said the Defense Department was nearing completion of its report on the fiscal year 2017 survey data and would provide it to Congress in the coming weeks. The spokeswoman did not explain the years-long delay. 
Don Christensen, a retired chief prosecutor for the Air Force who leads the advocacy group Protect Our Defenders, was skeptical of the Pentagon's motives when denying requests for the data's release over a period of months.
""What it really means is that whatever you're asking makes them look bad. And if it made them look good, they'd release it,"" said Christensen, whose research has drawn attention to racial discrimination in the military.
A Reuters investigation this year https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-military-civilrights found servicemembers are far less likely than civilian Defense Department employees to bring forward their concerns about discrimination through formal channels. Equal Opportunity complaints, current and former servicemembers say, is often a dead end, resulting in little action, or worse, backfiring on the complainant. ()
The Pentagon survey, known as the Workplace and Equal Opportunity Survey of Active Duty Members, examines such issues directly.
In the most recent publicly available survey, back in 2013, the data showed that some 16% of minorities in the active duty force experienced harassment, discrimination or both because of their race or ethnicity.
President-elect Joe Biden underscored the importance of diversity at the Pentagon when he announced his pick earlier this month to lead it: retired Army general Lloyd Austin, who would be the first Black U.S. defense secretary, if approved by Congress.
""More than 40% of our active duty forces are people of color. It's long past time that the department’s leadership reflects that diversity,"" Biden said.
Rep. Brown, who strongly supports Biden's pick of Austin, said he believed that the retired U.S. general would prioritize diversity in the Pentagon - including when addressing the issue to Congress and the public.

""I think with Lloyd Austin, we're going to get greater transparency than we've had in the past,"" Brown said.

1026,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",YouTube faces complaints of lax approach on overseas election misinformation,"By Fanny Potkin
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - After facing heavy criticism for not doing enough to stem misinformation ahead of the U.S. presidential election, YouTube announced last week it would remove videos that alleged fraud had changed the outcome of the contest.
But half a world away in Myanmar, which held a general election just five days after the U.S. vote and faced a tidal wave of online misinformation including unfounded claims of voter fraud, the new rules do not apply. 
Social media researchers and civil society groups in Myanmar say the uneven standard is emblematic of YouTube's comparatively hands-off approach to election misinformation globally at a time when rival Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is taking a more aggressive country-by-country measures. 
""It looks like 2020 might be YouTube's equivalent of Facebook's 2016, holding on to hope that a universal approach might work, even when it's clear that it's not going to be the case,"" said Evelyn Douek, a Harvard Law School lecturer who researches online speech. 
Experts, including Douek, warn that this issue will only escalate for Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s YouTube in other elections worldwide, until it creates policies that account for its role for potentially volatile situations.
""With other platforms, there's at least starting to be a recognition that universal rules just aren't going to cut it. For the U.S and Myanmar elections, Facebook tried to learn from the criticisms it received and roll out distinctive policies,"" she told Reuters.
YouTube did not respond to those criticisms but said it consistently enforced its guidelines and had deleted more than 1.8 million channels for policy violations in the third quarter of 2020, including more than 54,000 for hate speech.
Facebook, which faced accusations that it helped incite genocide in Myanmar in 2017, launched an unusual Myanmar-only civic misinformation policy ahead of the recent election, allowing it to remove false claims that could lead to voter suppression or otherwise damage the electoral process.
The temporary policy, a first for Facebook on election misinformation, followed previous Sri Lanka-specific measures on curbing misinformation that could lead to violence that was eventually expanded worldwide.
The company also built partnerships with civil society organisations in Myanmar, who say that the platform's performance during the election, while imperfect, improved. 
Alphabet's YouTube, by contrast, chose a light-touch approach and only appeared to block false election claims that people complained about, or if the material otherwise violated its broader guidelines on hate speech and harassment, researchers said.
""When it comes to hate speech and disinformation in Myanmar, YouTube is the new frontier,"" said Victoire Rio, an adviser at the Myanmar Tech Accountability Network (MTAN), a consortium of civil society organisations that study risks on social media. 
Rio told Reuters the video-sharing site was unprepared and didn't make the investments needed to mitigate risk in Myanmar, calling for it to do a human rights impact assessment. 
Rio and fact-checking organisations say purveyors of misinformation joined YouTube in large numbers in 2020, as video streaming usage skyrocketed thanks to cheaper data plans, with more than half of Myanmar's population now online. 
A review by Reuters found more than a dozen recently created YouTube channels that promoted Myanmar election-related misinformation while posing either as news outlets or political programmes. Myanmar fact-checking organisations say hundreds of such channels appeared in 2020.
The reach of those channels varied, with the popular ones accumulating millions of views, far more than most accredited media. A November video falsely stating the ruling party had already picked a new president had more than 350,000 views.
Half of the channels had their corresponding Facebook pages deleted by Facebook for content rules violations in the last two months. But YouTube links from the same banned creators were still widely shared on Facebook. 
PROBLEMATIC CONTENT
YouTube states in its guidelines that it removes political misinformation only when it pertains specifically to false claims about a voting process, or if it violates other rules.
""Our Community Guidelines prohibit spam, scams, or other manipulated media, coordinated influence operations, and any content that seeks to incite violence,"" a YouTube spokeswoman told Reuters.
She said YouTube had ""terminated"" a number of channels for violating its hate speech and harassment policies, but did not comment on whether the platform had a Burmese-language team or a local “Trusted Flaggers” programme that allows recognised groups to flag problematic content.
YouTube has argued in blog posts that it also reduces the spread of misinformation by pushing people to authoritative sources.
But democracy advocates say that is not enough. 
A recent YouTube search for the word ""fraud"" in the Burmese language revealed as the third result a channel full of videos that allege, without evidence, that the ruling party committed fraud in the Myanmar election.
Other searches for election related terms showed other channels containing political misinformation in top results. 
Yatanar Htun, a director of the Myanmar ICT for Development Organization (MIDO), which monitors online hate speech, told Reuters that YouTube videos had been used in fake emails to voters that spoofed emails from Myanmar authorities to allege fraud and foreign interference. 
Facebook deleted the original page sharing the videos, but YouTube was slow to act, Yatanar Htun said. 
YouTube took down one of the videos linked in the emails after it was asked for comment by Reuters and removed a channel for harassment. But another channel used to allege fraud remains on the site.

1027,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",Sikh diaspora drums up global support for farmers' protest in India,"By Mayank Bhardwaj and Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of Indian farmers protesting against deregulation of agriculture markets are drawing strength from Sikhs around the world who are urging foreign governments to intercede with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Farmers, mostly from the Sikh-dominated state of Punjab, have been camped on the borders of New Delhi since last month, demanding Modi roll back the reforms intended to bring investment in the antiquated farm sector but which the farmers say will leave them at the mercy of big corporations. 
Sikhs living overseas, most of whom have families at home tied to the farms, have picked up the thread in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, demonstrating outside Indian embassies to draw attention. 
On Thursday, 250 to 300 Sikhs and other overseas Indians took part in a rally in a Melbourne district to express their support for India's farmers, said Rajbir Singh, who runs a small transport business in Melbourne. 
On Saturday, people of Indian origin plan to carry out similar protests near the state parliament of Victoria in Melbourne, said Siftnoor Singh, a data scientist. 
""The new laws will bring economic devastation to our motherland, and we can't simply close our eyes and pretend that everything is alright back home,"" he told Reuters by phone.
The farmers' fear is that by allowing companies such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and India's Reliance Industries Ltd's retail arm to buy directly from farmers, the government intends to weaken the traditional markets where their rice and wheat are guaranteed a minimum price.
Sikhs and other Indian Punjabis overseas are estimated at 12 million. They form a tightly knit group and are vociferous in articulating the concerns of the community back home.
Since the farmers' protest started more than two weeks ago in India, members of the diaspora have participated in protest marches - mostly consisting of 400 to 600 people - in nearly 50 different cities of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, protesters and their families said. 
The government has declined comment on the protests overseas. But underlining India's sensitivity about what it sees as foreign interference in its internal affairs, New Delhi summoned Canada's ambassador this month to convey displeasure after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the farmers had a right to protest.
'HAND THAT FEEDS YOU'
""I've been approached by many concerned people of Indian origin who are based in Victoria to speak about the issue,"" Samantha Ratnam, parliamentary leader of Australia's Victorian Greens party, recently told the state legislative council.
Relatives and supporters of the farmers gathered this month even in the small town of Canton, Michigan, in the United States, carrying placards saying ""Don't bite the hand that feeds you"" and ""I stand with farmers"". Other protesters staged a demonstration outside the Indian embassy in Washington.
In Canada, home to a Sikh community that is politically influential, residents of Indian origin have vowed to step up their support for India's protesting farmers.
    ""We are taking part in regular protests to bring it to the notice of local authorities who can help us amplify our voices,"" said Amanpreet Singh Grewal, a resident of Brampton, Ontario, Canada. ""We are committed to support our farmers in India.""
Many Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) own farmlands in Punjab and fear the sweeping changes that the government plans will hurt them economically. 
""Punjabi NRIs are worried that if these laws are implemented, and result in fall in crop procurement prices, it would lead to substantial fall in the value of their farm lands and yearly income from land contracts,"" said Avtar Singh Gill, 64, who is now settled in Punjab after four decades in the UK.
Mewa Singh, the chief of the NRI council in the Ropar district of Punjab, said organisations such as his that represent overseas Indians were helping farmers mobilise people in villages, arranging transport for them, and collecting milk and rations for supplying to the protesters sleeping out in the open near Delhi.
Singh said his son, the manager of a basketball team in Houston, Texas, was leading protests there.
""We can't allow Prime Minister Modi to take away what we have gained over the years through hard work and political struggle,"" Mewa Singh said.
In Britain, Sikh groups wield influence and have been making the case for British leaders to raise the issue with their Indian counterparts even if the Modi government baulks at such involvement. 
Jas Singh, an adviser at the Sikh Foundation, said the community had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer to lobby their case.
""Worried by the use of disproportionate force against many elderly protesters, we've also reached out to the United Nations to ask India to protect farmers' right to peaceful protests,"" Jas Singh said.

Northern Ireland and Wales have both outlined plans to head back into lockdown after Christmas to control infection rates, raising suggestions that England might follow suit.
""Nothing is ruled out of course as we tackle this pandemic but the test system is a very effective way... to focus the restrictions,"" Gibb told Sky News when questioned about a possible third English lockdown.
Asked to confirm that the government was not ruling out a post-Christmas lockdown, Gibb said: ""That's not what I said. We have a very effective tier system.""
Swathes of England's population, including London, have either entered or will enter the highest tier of restrictions this week, Tier 3, which requires all hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants to close except for takeaways. 
The Times newspaper quoted a government official as saying the case for going further than Tier 3 was getting stronger, though measures could still happen on a local basis.
The talk of tighter restrictions comes as the Britain prepares to relax all measures over Christmas. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson resisted pressure to change the law, keeping a promise to allow three households to meet up over five days next week, but urging people to exercise extreme caution.
John Edmunds, epidemiologist at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said the Christmas relaxation was a risk as prevalence was still high.

""It doesn't look like the tier system is holding the epidemic wave back, unfortunately"" he told Sky News. ""I think we are going to have to look at these measures and perhaps tighten them up.""

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 18, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>","Irritated by loss, Trump hunkers down at the White House and avoids talk of future","By Steve Holland and Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hunkered down in what one former White House official called the ""presidential man cave"" of the Oval Office, President Donald Trump does not want to talk about what lies ahead once he leaves office next month.
Several people familiar with the situation say he knows his time is up even as he presses the fight against the election outcome, despite having failed in a series of court challenges to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election that made Democrat Joe Biden president-elect. 
With Monday's Electoral College vote certifying Biden's win, White House staff members are looking for jobs and planning their post-administration futures. First lady Melania Trump has looked for a school in Florida, where the couple is expected to reside, for their son Barron, People magazine reported.
A source close to Trump says he does not want to talk about the future beyond his remaining days in office. Any suggestion that he begin laying the groundwork for another run for president in 2024 is shunted aside, at least for now.
""He wants no conversation about what he's going to do when he leaves the building,"" the source said, asking for anonymity to speak candidly. ""He's convinced he's leaving, but he compartmentalizes things. As long as he's the president, he wants to be the president.""
Although an extrovert through his four years in office, Trump has largely closed himself off from the public in recent weeks, communicating mostly through tweets. He has done little to show he is focused on governing other than speaking at an event to highlight the speed of coronavirus vaccine development.
He has not played a significant role in responding to the computer hack that targeted the U.S. government, one administration official said. ""This is not his wheelhouse, and it also involves the Russians, which complicates things.""
Trump confers with a coterie of advisers including Vice President Mike Pence and chief of staff Mark Meadows, who update him on vaccine distribution and stimulus talks under way in Congress.
NO CONCESSION
The president has brought in members of his campaign team for updates and to urge them to keep fighting. 
His refusal to concede the election is egged on by endless phone conversations with his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and what the former White House official called ""a rag-tag collection of lawyers that has kept the torch lit.""
Trump has declined to concede the election. He spends long days in and out of the Oval Office, sometimes not retiring to the residence until after 8 p.m., calling allies and aides to discuss strategy. He has spent weekends at his nearby golf property and done one trip to Georgia to campaign for Republican U.S. Senate candidates. 
He frequently emphasizes to advisers that he got 74 million votes, 9 million more than Democrat Barack Obama did in his successful re-election bid in 2012. Biden's 80 million, he tells them, points to fraud.
Trump is irked at his fellow Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, for announcing on the U.S. Senate floor this week that he considered Biden the president-elect, two of the sources said.
The sources said Trump has been brushing off aides urging him not to carry out a threat to veto a massive defense bill, because he does not feel like he should reward McConnell for what he regards as bad behavior.
Trump opposes the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act because it does not repeal a law that gives big tech companies liability from lawsuits. Another source said Trump had been advised his veto would be overridden, though some in his circle still advised him to go through with it.
The White House declined to comment.
PARDON RUSH
Trump and his legal team have been preparing a number of potential pardons for him to carry out before leaving office, including for some close allies who may face legal jeopardy, one of the sources said.
Along Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White House, a cacophony of noise erupts daily from the construction of platforms for Biden's Inauguration Day events on Jan. 20.
One source said it was hard to imagine Trump showing up for the inaugural ceremonies and sitting behind Biden, having derided his Democratic rival on the campaign trail as incompetent. Trump has declined to say whether he would take part in the long-standing custom of showing the world a peaceful transfer of power.
What comes next for Trump is a matter of speculation. 
A source close to Trump said he has in the past toyed with the idea of announcing a 2024 run on Inauguration Day to divert attention from Biden. That person and another source said Trump is being advised to put off an announcement about running again, and instead simply tease the possibility, because being an official candidate would invite a level of scrutiny he might not want.
The former White House official noted that Trump's musings about running again would only give Democrats fodder to investigate him in years to come.
Trump faces a range of civil and criminal legal actions related to his family’s businesses and his activities before he took office, which could accelerate once he loses the legal protections granted the occupant of the Oval Office.

    “If you want to lessen the chances of there being congressional investigations into 2021 and 2022, the best thing he can do for himself would be to stop these trial balloons,"" the former official said.

In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Rafael Grossi, who heads the IAEA that polices Iran's compliance to the 2015 nuclear deal, said there had been too many breaches by Iran for the agreement to simply snap back into place when U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office next month.
Biden has said the United States will rejoin the deal ""if Iran resumes strict compliance.""
After President Donald Trump quit the deal in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions, Iran responded by breaching many of the deal's restrictions. 
""Presenting any assessment on how the commitments are implemented is absolutely beyond the mandate of the agency and should be avoided,"" Kazem Gharibabadi, Iran’s ambassador to IAEA in Vienna, tweeted. “@iaeaorg played its part during negotiations on the JCPoA.”

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, architect of the 2015 nuclear deal with six powers, has repeatedly said Tehran's nuclear steps were reversible if the United States lifted sanctions and fully respected the pact.

Beijing is planning to distribute 100 million doses of the vaccines made by Chinese firms Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech Ltd, the report said.
China has granted emergency-use status to two candidate vaccines from Sinopharm and one from Sinovac Biotech. It has approved a fourth, from CanSino Biologics Inc, for military use.
The SCMP report said Chinese officials have been asked to complete the first 50 million doses by Jan. 15 and the second by Feb. 5.
The mass inoculation for high-priority groups aims to reduce the risks of the spread of the disease during the annual week-long holiday, the report added.
The high-priority group includes health workers, police officers, firefighters, customs officers, cargo handlers, transport and logistics workers.
China's Sichuan province could start vaccinating the elderly and people with underlying conditions at the beginning of next month, after it completes inoculations for priority groups, officials have said.

(Reuters) -A powerful cyclone pounded Fiji, killing two people, including a three-month old baby, and leaving a trail of destruction across the Pacific Island nation, authorities said on Friday.
Cyclone Yasa, a top category five storm, made landfall over Bua province on the northern island of Vanua Levu on Thursday evening, bringing torrential rain, widespread flooding and winds of up to 285 km per hour (177 miles) across the archipelago.
Scores of houses were destroyed, while power was cut to some areas and roads blocked by fallen trees and flash flooding, authorities said.
Images shared on social media showed roads blocked by landslides, floodwaters and power lines. All roads in Rakiraki, a district on the main island with about 30,000 residents, were flooded, Fiji's Road Authority said.
Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama confirmed the two deaths in a video posted in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""Two fatalities have been confirmed. A 45-year old man in Labasa and a three-month old baby,"" he said.
""The dust has yet to settle... but we are likely looking at hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.""
Fiji on Thursday had declared a state of natural disaster, implemented a nightly curfew and ordered its entire population of nearly 1 million people to seek shelter.
""Villages in Vanua Levu have lost a lot of houses. The wind has flattened many community buildings and crops have been flattened,"" Fiji Red Cross Society Director-General Ilisapeci Rokotunidau told Reuters by phone from Suva, the country's capital.
Bainimarama said authorities were scrambling to help affected communities. Adverse weather has hampered efforts by aid groups to dispatch assistance, with waves of more than 3 metres (10 ft) preventing ships leaving Suva.

Concerns remain about heavy rains, although the storm has weakened in strength and is now a category two as it moves south across the island chain.

1033,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 08:08PM ET</span>",Nigerian security forces rescue more than 300 schoolboys kidnapped by gunmen,"By Afolabi Sotunde and Ismail Abba
KATSINA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Security forces on Thursday rescued nearly 350 schoolboys who had been kidnapped in northwestern Nigeria and taken into a vast forest, the governor of Katsina state said, bringing relief to many families.
It was not immediately clear whether all the missing boys had been recovered.
""I think we have recovered most of the boys,"" Governor Aminu Bello Masari said in a televised interview with state channel NTA.
Hours earlier a video started circulating online purportedly showing Islamist militants from Boko Haram with some of the boys. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the footage, the boys, or who released it. 
The abduction gripped a country already incensed by widespread insecurity, and evoked memories of Boko Haram's 2014 kidnapping of more than 270 schoolgirls in the northeastern town of Chibok.
Last Friday night, gunmen raided the Government Science Secondary School in Katsina on motorbikes and marched the boys into Rugu forest, in the biggest such incident in the lawless region in recent years. 
Masari said a total of 344 boys held in the forest had been freed in neighboring Zamfara state. He did not say how many had been missing or how they were freed. 
He said security forces had cordoned off the area where the boys were being held and were given instructions not to shoot.
""We thank God that they took our advice and not a single shot was fired,"" he said.
The boys were on their way back to Katsina and would be medically examined and reunited with their families on Friday, Masari said. 
Retired health worker Shuaibu Kankara, whose 13-year-old son Annas Shuaibu was among the kidnapped boys, could not contain his joy at their release.
""I am so happy,"" he said. ""We are so grateful to the governor of Katsina and all those who worked hard to secure their release.""
His only concern now was reuniting with his son, he said.
President Muhammadu Buhari welcomed the students' release and asked for patience while his administration dealt with security issues. 
""We have a lot of work to do,"" he said in a statement but added, ""We will deal with all that.""
The abduction was awkward for Buhari, who comes from Katsina and has repeatedly said that Boko Haram has been ""technically defeated"". 
HARROWING VIDEO
Boko Haram had claimed responsibility for the kidnapping in an unverified audio recording.
The video, which featured Boko Haram's emblem, showed a group of boys in a wood pleading, ""Help us, help us."" 
The father of one of the missing boys, who gave only his first name Umar, said his son, Shamsu Ibrahim, was one of the boys who is heard speaking in the video.
""All the armies that have come here to help us, please send them back. They can do nothing to help,"" the boy says.
Boko Haram has a history of turning captives into jihadist fighters. If its claims are true, its involvement in northwestern Nigeria marks a geographical expansion in its activities. But it could have purchased the boys from local criminal gangs with which it has been building ties. 
Earlier on Thursday, protesters marched in the state capital, also called Katsina, under a banner reading #BringBackOurBoys as pressure mounted on the government to improve security.
""Northern Nigeria has been abandoned at the mercy of vicious insurgents, bandits, kidnappers, armed robbers, rapists and an assortment of hardened criminals,"" said Balarabe Ruffin of the Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG), which focuses on the welfare of northern Nigerians.
Armed gangs that rob and kidnap for ransom, widely referred to as ""bandits"", carry out attacks on communities across the northwest, making it hard for locals to farm, travel or tap rich mineral assets in some states such as gold. 
Such gangs killed more than 1,100 people in the first half of 2020 alone, according to rights group Amnesty International.
In the northeast, Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, have waged a decade-long insurgency estimated to have displaced about 2 million people and killed more than 30,000. They want to create states based on their extreme interpretation of Islamic sharia law.

    Buhari, a former military ruler, was elected in 2015 in large part due to his pledge to crush the insurgency. Under his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, Boko Haram grew in strength and controlled territory around the size of Belgium.

PORT OF SPAIN (Reuters) - Trinidad and Tobago said on Thursday it would impose stiffer penalties on those trafficking migrants from neighboring Venezuela, days after a Venezuelan boat headed to the Caribbean twin-island nation sank, killing at least 28 people.
A humanitarian crisis in Venezuela has spurred the mass migration of millions, including to Trinidad and Tobago, where at least 40,000 Venezuelans now live, while dozens have gone missing since vessels they boarded to get there sunk.
Prime Minister Keith Rowley said it had more fleeing Venezuelans than any other nation ""per square kilometer and per capita"" and there would be ""new and firmer laws for persons who encourage illegal trade and stiffer penalties for human trafficking"".
His announcement came the same day Venezuela's Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab said two people had been arrested in relation to the shipwreck last weekend off the eastern Venezuelan coast: the owners of the boat and the property from which it embarked.
Arrest warrants have also been issued for seven national guard officers who had extorted the equivalent of $4,500 from the owner of the boat in exchange for overlooking his trafficking business, Saab said in televised comments.
Authorities updated the death toll from the boat wreck to at least 28 from an initial 14, he said.
Rowley said there would be no mass deportation of Venezuelans early next year. His government planned to extend the legal registration of over 16,500 for another six months when it expires at the end of the year, he said.
Yet Venezuelans who have been responsible for bringing illegal migrants into the Caribbean country ""will be at the head of the line to go back home"", he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a religious school in Kentucky that is challenging the state's decision to limit in-school instruction as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The action by the justices is a loss for Danville Christian Academy. The school said the order violated its religious rights under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees the free exercise of religion.
The justices, in a brief order, said that the school closing order ""effectively expires this week or shortly thereafter, and there is no indication that it will be renewed,"" but indicated that the school could renew its legal challenge if another closure is announced in the new year. 
Two conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, dissented from the court's decision. ""I would not leave in place yet another potentially unconstitutional decree, even for the next few weeks,"" Gorsuch wrote. 
The case pits Kentucky's Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, against the Republican attorney general, Daniel Cameron, who joined the legal fight against the order.
Beshear's November order required all schools, public and private, to close for in-school instruction. Some elementary schools would be able to reopen if COVID-19 rates decrease. 
The order was discriminatory, the school said, because other types of activities and indoor gatherings have been allowed to continue. Children's day care centers and universities are open, as are gyms and bowling allies, with some restrictions. Houses of worship are also open.
Beshear's lawyers counter that the order, aimed to combat a spike in coronavirus infections, treats all schools the same and does not target religion. 

A federal judge in Kentucky ruled in favor of the school on Nov. 25 but the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals prevented the ruling from going into effect.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada wants deeper environmental ties with the United States and one result could be a North American ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks, a senior cabinet member said on Thursday.
Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said Ottawa and the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden both agreed zero emissions vehicles needed to be deployed faster.
Canada will discuss with the United States how to achieve this and also improve the overall performance of the transport sector, which accounts for 26% of Canadian emissions, he said in a phone interview.
Talks with Washington could cover ""what the European countries and Quebec and British Columbia have done, which is to put a date at which they will no longer allow the sale of internal combustion engines,"" he said.
Wilkinson stressed he would not prejudge the results of future conversations, adding: ""I think we can collectively come up with mechanisms that will help both countries make progress on climate change.""
Canada, which has missed all its greenhouse gas targets, is vowing to hit zero net emissions by 2050. The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who says the environment is a big priority, last week said it would increase the price on carbon from C$30 a tonne now to C$170 by 2030.
In 2017, Canada said all vehicles sold starting in 2040 should produce no emissions. California and Quebec say they will ban the sale of new gasoline-powered passenger cars and trucks starting in 2035.
Earlier this year Biden announced a climate plan that would provide incentives for manufacturers to produce zero-emission electric vehicles.

California, British Columbia and Quebec already require a certain proportion of vehicles for sale have to be emissions-free, Wilkinson said, and Ottawa wants to talk to Washington ""about whether there is a North American pathway to doing something like that.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Once an early adopter of the coronavirus-proof 'namaste' greeting, French President Emmanuel Macron was showing signs of letting his guard down almost a year into the pandemic.
On Monday, three days before his office said he had tested positive for COVID-19, Macron greeted OECD chief Angel Gurria with a warm hand clasp in the Elysee palace courtyard, pulling the 70-year-old into a loose embrace, a Reuters picture shows. 
They were wearing masks, but Macron broke his government's no.1 pandemic rule: stick to what the French call ""barrier gestures"" and avoid handshakes, hugs and kisses.
""You know them, they save lives: barrier gestures are not an option!"" Macron said in a tweet on July 12. 
His office recognised Macron had made an ""unfortunate"" mistake in shaking Gurria's hand. ""It's a mistake, he had this gesture, there is no denying it,"" an official told Reuters, adding that the president was nonetheless constantly washing his hands and asking guests to do the same.
Macron was always very tactile before the pandemic, sharing hugs with leaders like U.S. President Donald Trump and kissing and patting members of the public on the back. 
In the past couple of weeks, the French leader fist-bumped EU counterparts at a summit in Brussels and greeted EU chief Charles Michel and Spanish leader Pedro Sanchez at the Elysee with pats on the back and elbows, TV footage shows.
Now Sanchez, Michel and Gurria are self-isolating.
Macron also hosted a lunch at the Elysee on Tuesday with about 20 parliamentary leaders and dined with a dozen lawmakers on Wednesday, parliamentary sources said, despite his government recommending no more than six guests at the table during end-of-year holidays.
That contrasted with his careful following of social-distancing guidelines earlier in the pandemic. 
In March, days before he put the nation on lockdown, he replaced the traditional handshake with the Indian-style namaste when he greeted Spain's king and queen in Paris, pressing his palms together and bowing slightly.
He repeated the namaste greeting with Britain's Prince Charles on June 18 and maintained social distance outside 10 Downing Street with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
But on Oct. 28, when he announced a second lockdown, he included himself among those who had let social distancing slip.

""We should all have respected barrier gestures more, especially with family and friends,"" he said on TV. ""Is now the time for regrets?""

(Reuters) - Six men facing charges of plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer were indicted by a grand jury this week, the U.S. attorney's office for western Michigan said on Thursday.
The men — Adam Fox, Barry Croft, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta — were arrested and charged in October with conspiring to grab Whitmer, a Democrat, from her vacation home earlier this year.
Some of the men belong to an anti-government militia group called Wolverine Watchmen. At least one of the defendants, Fox, considered Whitmer to be a sort of tyrant because she had ordered gyms closed in the state to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, according to prosecutors.
Obtaining the grand jury indictments, which came down on Wednesday, was a necessary step to proceed with the federal prosecutions, the U.S. attorney's office said in a statement.
Parker Douglas, a lawyer representing Harris, said Harris had pleaded not guilty because ""there was no actual conspiracy to kidnap Governor Whitmer.""
""As you can see from the indictment, the government is extremely vague regarding the alleged conspiracy's nature, the alleged conspiracy's object and any steps my client allegedly took to agree with the conspiracy,"" Douglas wrote in an email.
Lawyers for the other defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
If convicted at trial, the defendants, who are in jail after being denied bail, would face a maximum sentence of life in prison.
The indictment accuses the men of discussing kidnapping Whitner, meeting in July in Wisconsin to practice using assault rifles, and surveilling Whitmer's vacation home in August and September, mapping out how far it was from the nearest police station. 
Some of the men also bought supplies for kidnapping, the indictment said. In September, Fox bought a Taser-style stun gun and placed a $4,000 order for explosives with someone he did not realize was, in fact, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Moroccan national Ayoub el Khazzani was heavily armed when he launched his attack moments after the Thalys train crossed into France from Belgium on Aug. 21, 2015.
A Paris court found the defendant guilty of attempted murder with intent to commit terrorism.
The attack was thwarted by passengers. Among them were three Americans, two of whom were in the military at the time, who rushed Khazzani and disarmed him.

France was at the time of the Thalys incident still recovering from the trauma of Islamist militant attacks in Paris seven months earlier against the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. 
The three attackers were killed by police but 14 accomplices were convicted in a separate trial on Wednesday of crimes ranging from financing terrorism to membership of a criminal gang.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Friday declined calls to ban a weeks-long farmers' protest and asked the government and unions to help form a committee of experts to mediate between them. 
""We make it clear that we recognize the fundamental right to protest against a law. There is no question of balancing or curtailing it. But it should not damage anyone's life or property,"" Chief Justice S. A. Bobde said.
Thousands of farmers angered by three agricultural laws that they say threaten their livelihoods have intensified their protests by blocking highways and camping out on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi.
Petitioners had approached the Supreme Court to complain that the protests had hampered drivers and making it difficult for people to access emergency medical services.
""We are of the view at this stage that the farmers' protest should be allowed to continue without impediment and without any breach of peace either by the protesters or the police,"" Bobde said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration in September introduced the farm bills that the government says will unshackle farmers from having to sell their produce only at regulated wholesale markets and make contract farming easier.
Farmers insist that the new laws will leave them at the mercy of big corporations. 
Six rounds of talks between government ministers and farmers' union leaders have failed to resolve the situation. 
The government has said while the laws can be amended, it is against repealing the bills. Farmers last week rejected a government's proposal to amend the legislation.

India's vast agriculture sector, which makes up nearly 15% of the country's $2.9 trillion economy, employs about half of its 1.3 billion people.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A special envoy from Pope Francis met on Thursday with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, the Vatican said, following tensions between the government and the Church over the exiling of the archbishop of Minsk.
The Vatican said in a statement Archbishop Claudio Gugerotti, the Vatican's ambassador to Britain and former envoy to Belarus, had met Lukashenko to express the pope's ""worry about the current situation in the country"".
Archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, who had angered
Lukashenko by defending the rights of anti-government
protesters, was blocked from returning to Belarus at the border in August as he tried to come home from a ceremony in neighbouring Poland.
The official Belarus news agency Belta reported Thursday's meeting between Lukashenko and Gugerotti and released a photo of the two men, but did not mention Kondrusiewicz's exile or tensions in the country.
Lukashenko has been trying to strengthen his grip on power
after mass protests and strikes following a disputed election on Aug. 9.
Vatican diplomats have been working for nearly five months to persuade Lukashenko to allow Kondrusiewicz to return but have so far been unsuccessful. The Vatican's foreign minister, Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, made a mission to the country in September.
A senior Vatican source said the Holy See was trying to get Kondrusiewicz back in time for Christmas.
Other churchmen have faced reprisals from the authorities since the contested polls. At least two Catholic priests have been detained for participating in protests.

Belarusians overwhelmingly observe Orthodox Christianity, but the country has small Catholic minorities, observing the Roman rite common in Poland or the Eastern rite found in neighbouring Ukraine.

(Reuters) - Student medics, retired doctors, pharmacists and soldiers are being drafted into a European COVID-19 vaccination campaign of unprecedented scale, beginning just after Christmas.
As coronavirus cases continue to rise in a pandemic that has killed nearly half a million Europeans, the EU announced on Thursday that a bloc-wide inoculation campaign would begin on Dec. 27, four days after European authorities are expected to give approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
Beyond hospitals and care homes, sports halls and convention centres emptied by lockdown measures will become venues for mass inoculations.
In Italy, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions will spring up in town squares around the country, designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers, a symbol of spring. 
Faced with a shortage of health professionals able to give the shot, many countries are on a recruitment drive. German states are calling on retired medics and company doctors to join the push, in some cases offering up to 140 euros ($170) an hour.
""This will probably be the biggest mass vaccination campaign in history, certainly of our century and our generation,"" Domenico Arcuri, Italy's special commissioner for the COVID emergency, told reporters at a launch of national plans.
A phased-in approach means frontline healthcare workers and elderly residents of care homes are being prioritised, with most national schemes not reaching the general public until the end of the first quarter of 2021 at the earliest.
The goal of the 27-member European Union is nonetheless to reach coverage of 70% of its 450 million people. The European Commission, which struggled in the early months of the crisis to persuade national capitals to work together, is calling for the inoculation drive to be coordinated across borders.
""This is a huge task. So let's start rapidly with the vaccination together, as 27, on the same day,"" Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this week.
On Thursday she confirmed the start date for the whole bloc would be Dec. 27. In a sign of the impatience of some member states, Germany had already announced that date on Wednesday.
BOTTLENECK CONCERNS
Britain, which quit the EU this year, was the first country to deploy the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outside of clinical trials, giving it emergency approval two weeks ago. It said nearly 140,000 people received their first shots in the first week of roll-out. 
It is introducing a new national protocol allowing midwives, physiotherapists, pharmacists and others to give the shot.
""This will help ensure we have the workforce needed to deliver a mass COVID-19 vaccination programme, in addition to delivery of an upscaled influenza programme, in the autumn,"" a government consultation document said.
National rules vary by country. In France the injection must take place in the presence of a doctor. In Germany it can be administered by someone else as long as the patient can consult a doctor first.
There is a concern social distancing rules and paperwork could create bottlenecks at inoculation venues such as Berlin's Velodrom sports hall or the Hamburg trade hall.
Some countries face extra hurdles. Portugal is establishing separate cold storage units for its Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira; non-EU member Norway is buying doses from neighbouring Sweden.
Armies in countries including Switzerland and Italy are set to help secure vaccine supplies, while in Germany the Bundeswehr - already involved in contact-tracing - is on standby to help with injections if local regions need it.
With surveys showing many Europeans remain wary of taking a vaccine developed in record time, authorities are accompanying the push with information campaigns.
Stefano Boeri, the architect behind Italy's primrose-themed pavilions, said the spring flower was picked to ""convey a sign of serenity and regeneration"".

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish pilot accused of aiding Carlos Ghosn in his dramatic escape from Japan said on Thursday he did not know the former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) executive was on the plane, as the case against him and several other employees of a Turkish jet company resumed.
Ghosn, once a leading light of the global car industry, was arrested in Japan in late 2018 and charged with underreporting his salary and using company funds for personal purposes, charges he denies.
The ousted chairman of the alliance of  Renault  (PA:RENA), Nissan Motor Co and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp had been awaiting his trial under house arrest in Japan when he escaped in December last year via Istanbul to Beirut, his childhood home.
An executive from Turkish private jet operator MNG Jet and four pilots were detained by Turkish authorities in early January soon after Ghosn's escape and charged with migrant smuggling, a charge carrying a maximum sentence of eight years in jail. They were released in July, when the first hearing was held.
Noyan Pasin, one of the pilots on the flight from Osaka to Istanbul, said before the hearing on Thursday that he learned that Ghosn was on the plane from news reports after the flight.
He said he executed the flight as requested by the company, and had no chance to intervene at any point in the process of Ghosn's escape.
""Even if we wanted to, there is no possibility for us to intervene because the local authority has full control. We had nothing to do with the escape, we only carried out the flight,"" he told Reuters.
At Thursday's hearing, the court rejected a request by the pilots to lift a travel ban against them. They had told the court the measure prevented them from carrying out their job. 
It set the next hearing for Jan. 20, 2021.
All defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The Ghosn saga has shaken the global auto industry, at one point jeopardising the Renault-Nissan alliance which he masterminded, and increased scrutiny of Japan's judicial system.

Renault and Nissan have struggled to recover profitability following his tenure, during which both automakers say Ghosn focused too much on expanding sales and market share.

The New York-based rights group urged interim President Francisco Sagasti, Congress and police commanders to adopt reforms to ensure officers respect the right of peaceful assembly. The interior ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Two protesters were killed and over 200 injured, some seriously, in demonstrations between Nov. 9 and 15, HRW said in a statement. 
""Witness statements and other evidence Human Rights Watch collected indicate that police repeatedly used excessive force against protesters,"" the rights group said.
The evidence includes videos showing police ""recklessly"" shooting teargas canisters directly into crowds, HRW said.
Vizcarra, who drove a tough anti-corruption campaign, was removed by the opposition Congress on Nov. 9 in an impeachment trial over allegations of bribery. He joins a long list of Peruvian politicians ensnared in allegations of corruption, and his ouster threw the world’s no. 2 copper producer into political turmoil ahead of planned elections next year.
In Sagasti's inauguration speech on Nov. 17, he promised justice to the victims of abuse at the hands of police. The commission he created on Nov. 24 has 60 days to recommend measures aimed at modernizing and improving the police force.
""President Sagasti has taken an important step by convening a commission to improve police performance,"" HRW Americas Director Jose Miguel Vivanco said in the statement.
HRW said it interviewed 76 people, including victims and their lawyers, during a visit to Lima as part of its probe. HRW also met with the justice minister and the police commander.
Sagasti told Reuters last month there would be ""no impunity"" for those responsible for the deaths and injuries, but he stopped short of committing to police reform.
""On November 9, Congress ousted Vizcarra from office through a questionable legal process, claiming that he lacked 'moral capacity' because there is an ongoing corruption investigation against him. He has not been charged with any crime,"" HRW said.

MOSTAR, Bosnia (Reuters) - The historic Bosnian town of Mostar, a gem of 15th century Ottoman architecture, has not held an election since 2008. On Sunday it has a chance to shake off years of political paralysis.
    Despite drawing millions of tourists, the town is suffocating under uncollected garbage and it still bears the scars of war from the 1990s: local echoes of a similar dysfunction at the national level in Bosnia.
    The town of around 100,000 has not held an election for 12 years because its Catholic Croats and Muslim Bosniaks were unable to agree on electoral rules, a row that illustrates the ethnic tensions that brought war to Bosnia three decades ago.
    But the dispute has been settled, thanks to a 2019 court ruling won by Irma Baralija, a philosophy teacher who filed a suit against the Bosnian government at the European human rights court for failing to hold elections in Mostar. 
    ""They just stole all those years of democracy from us,"" said Baralija, a Bosniak who is standing for the multi-ethnic Our Party in Sunday's city government election. 
""We simply must take a step forward to the future, we cannot live in the past anymore."" 
    Twenty-five years since war ended, Bosnia faces a choice, analysts say: either it reforms and moves on from ethnic politicking towards European Union integration, or it falls deeper into decay and stagnation.
    In Mostar, voters face the same question, with potential new leaders such as Baralija campaigning on bread-and-butter issues rather than on the ethnic agenda that has bogged down Bosnia for 25 years. 
Political experts expect multi-ethnic parties to win some councillors, although perhaps not enough to seriously damage the two-party nationalist majority. But new members will at least be able to challenge council decisions.
Croats outnumber Bosniaks in Mostar by less than 5%, but people from both groups are leaving the town because its economy has been ruined by mismanagement. 
ARGUMENTS
The Croatian HDZ party and the Bosniak SDA argued for years over electoral boundaries, until the court decision forced them to accept a proposal almost unchanged from a decade ago.
During that time, the HDZ and SDA, which share power nationally in Bosnia's autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation, have drafted the Mostar budget together and it had been approved each year by the region's parliament. Citizens say money was spent without rigorous controls or transparency.
    ""What we have seen in Mostar in the past 12 years was lawlessness and anarchy ... with only two men running the town,"" said Slaven Raguz, head of the opposition Croatian Republican Party (HRS).
    ""Mostar has become a paradigm of Bosnia, in which ruling elites have tailored society according to their needs, living off taxpayers' money and not showing any responsibility towards the people they are supposed to represent,"" Raguz said.  
    The acting mayor declined to comment and the finance minister did not immediately answer telephone calls and emails from Reuters.    Mostar's young people, facing Europe's highest rate of youth unemployment of 40.2% and a society marred by ethnic rivalries and corruption, will be voting for the first time in their town. 
    ""It means a change, we'll finally have a city council so something should be happening,"" said Zvonimir Bioksic, 22, a Croat student of mechanical engineering, while taking a stroll in the town centre with his Bosniak friend Djani Fejzic.
    The two young men defy prejudices about Mostar's divisions.
    ""Why would the town, which has so many bridges, be a synonym for divisions,"" Fejzic asked. ""I am all for connecting.""
    Marin Bago, an activist who will run on a list of independent candidates called ""The Right to the Town"", says Mostar has been divided only in peoples' minds.
    ""The deepest emotion in Bosnia is fear, remaining from the war,"" Bago said, pointing to ruins that date from the fighting that began in 1992.
    ""We are looking at them for 28 years, it is frustrating because there is no reason nor excuse to watch the ruins for 28 years.""

VIENNA (Reuters) - Reviving Iran's nuclear deal under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden would require striking a new agreement setting out how Iran's breaches should be reversed, U.N. atomic watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said.
Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said the United States will rejoin the deal ""if Iran resumes strict compliance"" with the agreement that imposed strict curbs on its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions.
After President Donald Trump quit the deal and reimposed U.S. sanctions, Iran responded by breaching many of the deal's restrictions. Tehran says it could quickly reverse those steps if Washington first lifts its sanctions.
In an interview with Reuters, Grossi, who heads the International Atomic Energy Agency that polices Iran's compliance, said there had been too many breaches for the agreement to simply snap back into place.
""I cannot imagine that they are going simply to say, 'We are back to square one' because square one is no longer there,"" Grossi said at IAEA headquarters.
""It is clear that there will have to be a protocol or an agreement or an understanding or some ancillary document which will stipulate clearly what we do,"" he said.
""There is more (nuclear) material, ... there is more activity, there are more centrifuges, and more are being announced. So what happens with all this? This is the question for them at the political level to decide.""
FULL CIRCLE
Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium is more than 2.4 tonnes, 12 times the cap set by the deal, though still far below the more than eight tonnes Iran had before signing it. Iran has been enriching uranium up to 4.5% purity, above the deal's 3.67% limit though below the 20% it achieved before the deal.
Iran is enriching uranium in places where it is not allowed under the deal, such as at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain. More recently it has started enriching with advanced centrifuges at its underground plant at Natanz, where the deal says it can use only first-generation IR-1 machines. [L1N2IK1A7]
""What I see is that we're moving full circle back to December 2015,"" Grossi said, referring to the month before the deal's restrictions were put in place, after which large amounts of material and equipment were swiftly removed.

""If they want to do it (comply), they could do it pretty fast. But for all of those things we had a charted course,"" he said.

Forces still loyal to Tigray's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), surrounded the Sero base near the northern border with Eritrea on Nov. 4, according to the two men. Within days, food and water were running low, forcing those inside to ration supplies, they said.
They said the siege reached a climax on day 10 when TPLF reinforcements arrived with tanks, anti-aircraft guns and mortars to try to seize the base. They described a six-hour barrage in which some soldiers tried to escape from the back of the compound but were captured.
""Even after we surrendered, they stabbed one of our members for no reason,"" one of the soldiers, Takele Ambaye, said. He said he saw the bodies of 15 comrades, some with slash wounds, others who had been shot.
The description provided to Reuters by Takele and Molla Kassa, another soldier, supports government accounts of how the conflict started. It is also consistent with details given by a senior military officer at a news conference broadcast by state TV on Nov. 10.
However, the TPLF denies starting the conflict.
""We didn't initiate any attack,"" the group's leader, Debretsion Gebremichael, told Reuters in a text message last month, although he said some soldiers ""joined us by rejecting (the) federal treatment to Tigray.""
Reuters has been unable to reach TPLF officials for further comment.
Reuters also could not independently verify the two soldiers' accounts as communications to that part of Tigray are down, and the government restricts access to the region. Government and military officials did not respond to requests for comment.
The government says its forces are now back in control of major cities and towns, and a new transitional administration is working to restore order in Tigray. 
But the experiences recounted by Molla and Takele help explain why bitter divisions remain.
""The cruelest thing is I stayed there (in Tigray) for 21 years. I stayed there longer than with my own mother who raised me,"" said Molla. ""What kind of animals are they?""
Reuters spoke to Molla and Takele by phone this month, before an army spokesman announced a ban on soldiers speaking to the media. The men said that after their surrender, the TPLF held them captive in several locations before they were released with around 200 other soldiers from Sero, eventually reaching the town of Sekota in the neighbouring Amhara region.
Government officials have told Reuters that the TPLF trucked thousands of captive soldiers to the border with Amhara and released them. The officials have not specified whether soldiers from Sero were among them. Other soldiers were freed by federal forces as they advanced on the regional capital Mekelle, the government has said.
CONFLICT BEGINS
The government says fighters loyal to the TPLF attacked federal military bases at multiple locations in Tigray early on Nov. 4 after jamming communications. It says TPLF fighters took control of the headquarters of the military's Northern Command in Mekelle and raided federal armories.
A United Nations security report dated Nov. 6, seen by Reuters, said Tigrayan forces had seized heavy weapons from several depots.
The fighters included members of the national defense force, who killed fellow soldiers in their beds and seized their weapons, Redwan Hussein, spokesman for the government's emergency task force on Tigray, told Reuters previously.
At the Nov. 10 news conference, Lt. Gen. Bacha Debele said radio communications were cut at military bases across Tigray at 10:00 p.m. on Nov. 3. The next day, he said, a group of senior officers was kidnapped from a regular dinner with Tigrayan officials, while in other places, soldiers were surrounded.
""Many died on both sides,"" he said, without providing evidence. ""They buried their militia while they stripped our soldiers' bodies of their uniforms and left them under the scorching sun...the dead were left to be devoured by vultures."" 
BITTER DIVISIONS
Molla and Takele said shots were fired at the Sero base, where 250-300 government troops were stationed, at around 5 a.m. on the morning of Nov. 4. Initially, the attackers retreated when government soldiers returned fire, they said.
They said they asked local residents who was behind the attack and were told by a TPLF official that army commanders had agreed to surrender their arms to the TPLF and that soldiers inside the base should comply.
""We said we never received such commands from above and told them that we were not going to give up the arms. The arms belong to the nation,"" Molla said. 
In the ensuing siege, as TPLF forces surrounded the base, those inside rationed food to one meal of flour at midday to preserve supplies, but after eight days, the base ran out of food, they said.
""They ate us like a cat eats its child after giving birth,"" Molla said.
The two soldiers said the betrayal by former comrades had cemented their desire to avenge their comrades and capture the fugitive TPLF leadership. 

""We couldn't even bury our friends and brothers. They stopped us from burying them,"" Takele said. ""I want to join my friends and fight.""

The new law passed by parliament widened the circumstances that could constitute rape - under the old legislation, prosecutors had to show the rapist had used violence or attacked someone who was unable to resist.
""Now it will be clear, that if both parties do no consent to sex, then it's rape,"" justice minister Nick Haekkerup said in a statement.
A similar law introduced in neighbouring Sweden in 2018 resulted in a 75% rise in rape convictions.
Around 11,400 women a year are raped or subjected to attempted rape in Denmark, according to the ministry's figures.
Amnesty International said Denmark had become the 12th country in Europe to recognise non-consensual sex as rape.
""This is a great day for women in Denmark as it consigns outdated and dangerous rape laws to the dustbin of history and helps to end pervasive stigma and endemic impunity for this crime,"" the campaign group's Women's Rights Researcher, Anna Blus, said.
The law will take effect on Jan. 1.

The sailors, who include Italian and Tunisian nationals, were accused by local authorities of operating in Libya's territorial waters. Italy disputed this.
""Our sailors are free,"" Di Maio said in a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) shortly after he and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte flew to Benghazi for talks with military commander Khalifa Haftar, who holds sway in eastern Libya.
The prolonged imprisonment of the group had become a political embarrassment for Italy's government, with critics accusing ministers of failing to stand up to Haftar.
It was not immediately clear what concessions, if any, Italy had made to win their release.
Italian officials said in October that Haftar had demanded the release of four Libyans who were arrested in Sicily in 2015 and subsequently sentenced to up to 30 years in jail for allegedly organising a migrant crossing that resulted in multiple deaths.
The southern Mediterranean fishing grounds have been disputed since 2005, when Libya's then ruler, Muammar Gaddafi, unilaterally extended Libyan territorial waters to 74 nautical miles offshore from 12. Haftar is trying to enforce this.
Rome has never recognised the revised boundary.
Libya has been without strong central rule since Gaddafi was toppled in 2011 and rival camps set up parallel administrations in the east and west since 2014. 

Italy has publicly backed the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and has had difficult relations with Haftar. But it has sought to work with both administrations to try to slow the flow of illegal migrants to Italy.

Putin presided over sweeping constitutional reforms this year that, among other things, allow him to run for two more six-year terms as president, potentially extending his rule until 2036. 
The 68-year-old leader, in power as president or prime minister since the turn of the century, had been due to step down when his second consecutive presidential term, his fourth in total, ends in 2024. 

""I haven't decided for myself whether I'll run or not in the election in 2024,"" he told reporters at his televised annual news conference.

Drought in 2019 and this year has left millions facing hunger. That includes about one-third of the rural population, who are expected to face ""crisis"" or ""emergency"" levels of hunger, and 2.3 million hungry urban dwellers, WFP said.
An economic recession during the past two years has compounded the problem for the country of 15 million people.
""We are deeply concerned that if WFP does not receive enough funding to reach the 4 million people it intends to, families will be further pushed to the limit,"" Francesca Erdelmann, WFP Zimbabwe's representative said.
The additional funding would allow WFP to provide the minimum amount of emergency food assistance to the most vulnerable 3.5 million rural and 550,000 urban citizens.
While COVID-19 had aggravated food insecurity in both rural and urban areas of the country, WFP said many of its traditional donors were also struggling in the wake of the impact of the pandemic on their own economies.
Zimbabwe spent $458 million importing food, mostly grain during the first nine months of this year compared with $140.5 million during the same period in 2019, according to treasury data.
At least 7.6 million people have fallen into poverty this year, a million more than in 2019, according to a latest report compiled by the government and donors.

1059,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","From Navajo Nation to New Orleans, challenges arise in vaccine roll out","By Lisa Baertlein
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - From the wide-open spaces of a U.S. tribal nation to urban hospital emergency rooms, doctors, nurses and delivery people are wrestling with challenges in the roll-out of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine - including delays, anxiety and keeping the drug at just the right level of cold.
U.S. Public Health Service Lieutenant Commander Erica Harker on Monday delivered a red, portable cooler with 165 doses of the vaccine to a hospital in tiny Ganado, Arizona, one of three drop-offs on a roughly 200-mile (322 km) round trip through the Navajo Nation, accompanied by tribal police.
    The long-awaited vaccine - which must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F) - comes in pizza-sized plastic boxes containing 975 doses, too much for many rural areas. When pharmacists like Harker crack open those boxes to extract vials, they start a 120-hour countdown to get the vaccine into arms. 
    ""It wasn't anything where we could just lollygag and take our time,"" said Harker, who used a sensor to be sure that her deliveries stayed in a temperature range similar to that of a home refrigerator. 
Big delivery companies experienced problems when a handful of trays bound for California and Alabama in Pfizer's dry-ice cooled containers hit minus 92 Celsius (minus 197.6°F) in transit, which was too cold, U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said on a conference call on Wednesday. 
""We locked those trays down ... they never left the truck,"" Perna said of those shipments.
WAITING ON PINS AND NEEDLES 
Reserving initial doses for healthcare professionals made the roll-out somewhat easier. 
""They are anxious to get the vaccine. Out of hundreds of clinical caregivers in round 1, only a handful have declined,"" for reasonable issues such as pregnancy, said Marcy Brown, chief operating officer of Southern California's Hoag Health Network, which experienced a vaccine delivery delay. 
Oschner Health in Louisiana on Monday got about a tenth of the doses it prepared for at its New Orleans hospital - forcing staffers there to reschedule appointments. 
""The biggest disappointment was expecting 9,500 doses ... and getting much less,"" said Dr. Sandra Kemmerly, the system medical director of hospital quality.
Despite the headaches that come with the nation's largest and most complex vaccination campaign in history - healthcare workers said the release of the vaccine was a ray of hope after months of witnessing the deaths of patients and co-workers.
It is particularly poignant for workers in heavily hit areas, like the Navajo Nation. 

The impact of the pandemic ""is a memory that will be ingrained in our hearts, our mind and our souls, for a lifetime,"" Harker, of the Public Health Service, said.

Truong Chau Huu Danh, 38, a former journalist, will be detained for three months for posts that the police said were abuses of freedom of speech and infringements on state interests, the Ho Chi Minh City police newspaper reported.
""Danh owns a Facebook page with nearly 168,000 followers and has got several anti-state posts, causing division of national unity,"" the report added. 
Danh's arrest comes as the Vietnam government steps p a crackdown on activists ahead of a key party congress in January next year. Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party tolerates little criticism. 
Facebook, which serves about 60 million users in Vietnam as the main platform for both e-commerce and expressions of political dissent, is under constant government scrutiny.
In November, Reuters exclusively reported Vietnam had threatened to shut down Facebook in the country if it did not bow to government pressure to censor more local political content on its platform. 
Vietnam has been widely rebuked for its tough moves to curb online dissent as public appetite for the Internet soars and Web users turn to blogs to read about issues that state-controlled media avoids.

1061,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Erdogan ally calls for Turkey's pro-Kurdish party to be banned,"By Daren Butler
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan's nationalist ally said Turkey's pro-Kurdish HDP party, the country's third biggest, should be banned for separatism - a move the HDP's co-leader condemned on Thursday as a bid to silence six million voters.
Nationalist Movement Party leader Devlet Bahceli has long been a fierce critic of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and, like Erdogan, accuses it of ties to militants who have fought a 36-year-old insurgency in southeast Turkey.
""The HDP must be closed and not reopened. No tolerance should be shown to any party organisation that takes as its reference ethnic separatism and terrorism,"" Bahceli said in a tweet on Wednesday, attacking the HDP for not signing a cross-party parliament statement condemning U.S sanctions on Turkey.
Turkish courts have banned pro-Kurdish parties in the past on charges of militant ties, drawing criticism from Turkey's Western allies. But moves supported by Erdogan's AKP have since made closing parties down more difficult.
Bahceli, whose party is the fourth biggest in parliament and whose comments in the past have appeared to influence government policy, suggested a change in the constitution, political parties law or the penal code if necessary.
""The fight with poisonous vermin is a wonderful service to national dignity. The fight with separatism is honourable support for our independence,"" he said.
HDP co-leader Mithat Sancar responded on Thursday in an interview with Turkish broadcaster Fox TV, saying the HDP had the support of millions of people.
""Shutting the HDP means shutting down democracy in this country, it means silencing 6 million people,"" Sancar said.
""In the past, six of our parties were closed down and what happened? If our party is closed we will come back stronger.""
Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants have fought against the state in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984 in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people. 
Ankara, the European Union and the United States designate the PKK as a terrorist organisation. The HDP, parliament's third largest party, denies links to terrorism.

The HDP, founded in 2012, won 11.7% of the vote in the 2018 parliamentary election. It has been targeted by authorities in a crackdown in recent years under which thousands of party officials and members have been arrested and dozens of its mayors and lawmakers unseated.

1062,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 05:46AM ET</span>",Turkey says will not turn back on Russian S-400S purchase despite sanctions,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will not turn back on its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defence systems and will take reciprocal steps after evaluating U.S. sanctions imposed over the acquisition, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday.
The United States on Monday imposed sanctions targeting NATO member Turkey's Defence Industry Directorate (SSB), its chief, Ismail Demir, and three other employees over its purchase of the S-400s. Turkey condemned the sanctions as a ""grave mistake"".
President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday the sanctions were a ""hostile attack"" against Turkey's defence industry, and they were bound to fail.
In an interview with broadcaster Kanal 24, Cavusoglu said Turkey could not be subjected to so-called CAATSA sanctions as its acquisition predated the law, adding that the decision was an attack on Turkey's sovereign rights and would have no impact.
The 2017 Countering America's Adversaries through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) legislation is meant to dissuade countries from buying military equipment from NATO foe Russia.
""This is not in line with international law, diplomacy, and it is a politically and legally wrong decision,"" Cavusoglu said, adding that the United States could have solved the dispute with common sense if it cooperated with Turkey and NATO.
""If there was to be a step back, it would have happened by now,"" he said, referring to the decision to acquire the S-400s.
""It's not important whether the sanctions are soft or harsh, sanctions in themselves are wrong.""
Turkey says its purchase of the S-400s was not a choice, but rather a necessity as it was unable to procure defence systems from any NATO ally on satisfactory terms.
The United States says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and to NATO's broader defence systems. Turkey rejects this and says S-400s will not be integrated into NATO. 
The sanctions come at a delicate moment in fraught relations between Ankara and Washington as Democratic President-elect Joe Biden gears up to take office on Jan. 20, replacing Republican incumbent Donald Trump.
Asked whether ties could normalise under Biden, Cavusoglu said that depended on whether Washington would meet Turkish expectations on Syria policy and the extradition of a U.S.-based cleric Turkey accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt.

""If the United States thinks strategically, they need Turkey very much. They say this, but they must do what is necessitated by this,"" he said.

The ruling, which legally requires Hungary to change its policy or potentially face fines, is the latest rejection by EU institutions of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-immigration strategy since a migration crisis in 2015.
""The court holds that Hungary has failed to fulfil its obligation to ensure effective access to the procedure for granting international protection,"" the EU's highest court said in a statement.
The court rejected the Hungarian government's position that the migration crisis, when millions of people fled the Middle East and North Africa for Europe, was a justification for breaching EU rules in the name of public order.
During the peak of the crisis, Orban ordered Hungary's southern border to be sealed, blocking a route for hundreds of thousands of migrants and trapping people in so-called migrant transit zones on its borders until May this year.
In an earlier ruling in May, the court said the migrant zones were essentially illegal detention centres, forcing Hungary to close them. 
""The Court finds that this system of detention was established outside the cases set out in EU law and without observance of the guarantees which must normally govern it,"" the court said in reference to its earlier judgement.
The court also found that Hungary was wrong to forcibly expel non-EU nationals using police into Serbia, which is not a member of the EU, without following any EU rules and guarantees that seek to make such deportations more humane.
The court noted that Serbia's land border was ""devoid of any infrastructure"" and that Hungary did not respect migrants' right to apply for asylum or to remain in the country for a limited period even after their asylum request had been rejected.
While the court's assessment of the case, brought by the European Commission, focuses on the situation in 2017 and early 2018, Hungary has since hardened rules that will effectively bar future asylum applicants. Hungary has argued that it borders so-called safe countries, and so can deport migrants.

KABUL (Reuters) - Killings by small, magnetic bombs slapped under vehicles are unnerving Afghan officials, activists and journalists, who blame the Taliban for the attacks that are increasing despite peace talks aimed at ending two decades of war.
At least 10 government officials and their aides have been killed by ""sticky bombs"" in recent weeks, mostly in the capital Kabul. The tactic, senior security officials and Western diplomats say, is meant to instill fear while avoiding large-scale civilian casualties.
""Internal intelligence memos reveal that the Taliban are systematically eliminating mid-career, ambitious government officials and other prominent individuals who are clearly against their hardline stance,"" said a senior Western diplomat responsible for Afghanistan.
The rebels ""are not killing the government's top brass as they can't afford to generate large-scale furore, for it would impinge upon the peace process,"" the diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity, as he is not authorised to speak to the press.
A Taliban spokesman said the group was behind some of the attacks but targeted only officials of the government that the group is both warring and negotiating with.
""We will continue to target the enemy and continue to eliminate important government figures, but not journalists or social activists,"" said Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the militant group.
""We are directly attacking those people who are fighting against us either on the battlefield or those plotting against us from their government offices.""
Afghanistan's Interior Ministry blames the Taliban for all the sticky bomb attacks.
Eight senior Afghan government officials, three local journalists and two female professors in Kabul told Reuters they have recently changed their modes of transport and now regularly alter their routes to work.
Taliban leaders are in neighbouring Pakistan during a break in the peace talks in the Qatari capital Doha, which have taken three months to agree on procedural ground rules. The rise in violence mars the best hope for ending the war that has ravaged Afghanistan since the 2001 attacks on the United States.
""Despite the talks, the militants were achieving desired the results of inculcating tremendous fear,"" the diplomat said. 
The militants have also stepped up widespread attacks against government forces in the provinces in an effort to establish new strongholds. 
QUICK AND DIRTY
Sticky bombs, assembled in Afghanistan, can be detonated remotely or with a time-delay fuse and are powerful enough to blow up a car. They have been used since the early years of the war to sow terror among Afghans and expatriates working to safeguard the economy and fragile democracy.
The devices can be crude or sophisticated - but planting them is cheap, simple and hard to defend against.
Recent arrests reveal that target vehicles were stuck in traffic, where attackers on motorbikes or on foot could attach a bomb.
""In most cases young men were also involved in sticking magnetic bombs for a small amount of cash,"" said Rahmatullah Andar, a spokesman for the National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan's anti-terror agency. 
Rising unemployment due to COVID-19 has made it easier for the Taliban to recruit young boys who wash cars on the side of the roads, vendors and beggars to collect information on intended targets, said another official at the directorate.
Although the sticky bomb attacks remain sporadic, they are having a psychological effect.
""After breakfast, I take a few minutes to think which route I should take to work to stay alive,"" said Rahmatullah Rahim, a bureaucrat in the ministry of law and justice. ""The fear is intense.""

FARASDUES, Spain (Reuters) - Archaeologists in northeastern Spain have uncovered the mass grave of 10 women killed by a fascist firing squad in the early days of the Spanish Civil War, drawing attention to the often overlooked plight of women in the conflict.
Well preserved white buttons trace a path up some of their spines, the last remnants of the clothes they wore on the day they were executed on Aug. 31, 1936 after being snatched from their homes in the village of Uncastillo the previous night.
Their bodies were dumped in a narrow pit in the local cemetery in neighbouring Farasdues, in the region of Aragon.
Mari Carmen Rios' grandmother Inocencia Aznares was among them.
""Why did they kill her?"" Because they couldn't find my uncle? Because she could read and write? Because she voted for the republic? ... I don't know ... Nothing they did makes sense,"" Rios said.
More than 500,000 people were killed during the 1936-1939 war. Historical foundations estimate over 100,000 bodies remain missing, many in unmarked mass graves.
The leftist coalition government approved a bill in September to finance exhumations from mass graves as part of efforts to ""restore democratic memory"". 
Academic research on the conflict, though extensive, has been overwhelmingly focused on the experience of men, said Cristina Sanchez, who investigates civil-war violence against women at Zaragoza University. 
""Where are all the women? ... Now we are finding that they were present as victims of violence and as perpetrators.""
Some were persecuted for their political leanings or activism but many more were killed as substitute victims for their male relatives, she said. Methods of execution were equally savage for both sexes. 
""We have deaths by drowning, deaths by hanging, and the majority were killed by firing squad.""
Excavations in Farasdues began in November but the massacre had remained lodged in the area's collective memory for decades, said archaeologist Javier Ruiz.
""Carrying off 10 women in one go didn't happen in many places, at least not in Aragon ... In Uncastillo these 10 women have never been forgotten.""
Next to their grave, archaeologists uncovered another site with the bodies of at least seven men, who are yet to be identified. 

For Rios, the excavation triggered powerful feelings of outrage, which later gave way to a sense of closure: ""When you say 'We've found her, she's there, we're going to bury her with grandpa,' honestly it makes me very happy.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand on Thursday eased travel restrictions for citizens from 56 countries in a bid to boost the country's pandemic-hit tourism industry, though visitors will be required to undergo a mandatory two-week hotel quarantine.
Tourists from countries including Australia, France and the United States can travel without visas, but would need a certificate to show they were free of COVID-19 72 hours before travel and a place at a quarantine hotel, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for Thailand's COVID-19 taskforce said.
Visitors would then be subject to a two-week quarantine period after arriving, he said, adding that the normal 30-day visa would be extended to 45 days. 
While in quarantine, arrivals would undergo three COVID-19 tests, up from two required previously, Taweesin said, adding that more testing could potentially lead to shorter quarantine times in the future. 
The revisions come as the tourism-reliant economy struggles to encourage more domestic activity, but an ongoing travel ban continues to keep most foreign tourists away.
""The entry of tourists will stimulate the economy,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tanee Sangrat, told Reuters.
Travellers from other countries not included in Thursday's announcement could still be eligible for a 90-day special tourist visa and a certificate of entry.
Thailand's entry restrictions have helped keep its COVID-19 cases at a low 4,281, but caused widespread economic damage and many job losses.

""We are confident in the Thai public health system, before this we were not sure, but now we are confident in the system,"" Tanee said.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - With investigators from the World Health Organization (WHO) set to visit China next year, residents of Wuhan are saying they want the team to come to the central city, hoping they could prove the virus did not originate there.
An international team of investigators is expected to travel to China in January, the WHO said on Thursday, more than a year after the first identified cluster of COVID-19 infections was linked to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
""I welcome them to come. We also want to know how it developed, specifically where it came from, if the source of the virus is here,"" said a Wuhan resident surnamed Wan, as he walked to work on Thursday morning. 
""My feeling is that it is not from there,"" he added, referring to the seafood market. 
The WHO did not confirm whether its team will go to Wuhan, saying that discussions on the itinerary were ongoing. A two-member WHO team visited China in July, but did not visit Wuhan.
Reuters reported earlier, citing a member and diplomats, that a team of 12-15 international experts will visit Wuhan to examine evidence, including human and animal samples collected by Chinese researchers, and to build on their initial studies.
Beijing has strongly opposed calls for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, but said it has been open to a WHO-led investigation.
China's foreign ministry did not directly comment on the WHO visit during a daily media briefing on Thursday.
""China stands ready to enhance its cooperation with WHO to advance the global tracing efforts and contribute our share in our early victory against the pandemic,"" spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
Many questions remain about the origins of COVID-19 and the role Wuhan's exotic wildlife trade may have played in it. 
Although authorities closed the Huanan market in January, there is a growing scientific consensus that the virus did not originate there. Some studies suggest it was already in circulation by the time it reached the market, with more than one transmission route.
China still tightly restricts access to locations such as the Huanan market, which stands empty and locked even though normal life has largely resumed in Wuhan and throughout China.
Beijing has also been pushing a narrative that the virus existed abroad before it was found in Wuhan, and unlike other countries cites frozen food packaging as a risk of spreading COVID-19.
""There is a strong possibility it was brought in via wholesale seafood from elsewhere. Wuhan has no seafood,"" said 20-year-old Wuhan student Jiang Yongcheng. 
Others said a WHO visit is an opportunity to show how well the city had done battling the virus. Wuhan has not reported a locally transmitted case since May 10, after a 76-day lockdown that was one of the strictest worldwide. 

""We are not afraid of their investigation,"" said Liu Qin, who works in real estate. ""Because you can see from the epidemic this year, in Wuhan things were done well, if not the epidemic would not have been controlled quickly.""

YANGON (Reuters) - In a shady corner of a cemetery in Myanmar’s commercial capital of Yangon, pastel-colored headstones mark the final resting places of dozens of beloved pets: ""Treasure"", ""Blacky"", ""Princess"", ""Bark A Lotzzi"". 
    Local doctor Tin Htun Naing said he created the burial ground, the country’s largest and best known, in 2015 when his dog, Little Daughter, died after 15 years of loyal companionship and he couldn’t find a place to inter her. 
    While pet ownership is on the rise, few people in densely populated Yangon have gardens. When pets die, many have little choice but to dump their bodies in landfills or rivers, or find a plot of unused farmland.
    ""I couldn’t dump her in the wild when she died because I took care of her as my own child,"" Tin Htun Naing said. 
    He went to a local cemetery and asked a gravedigger to bury her there, later helping other grieving owners to do the same. 
Now, some 300 pets are buried there, mostly dogs - including a celebrity police sniffer dog named Sergeant Michael - but some cats and one rabbit. 
Each burial, handled by a local family who takes care of the graveyard, costs about $70. 
    Pet cemeteries have long existed in the West and have proliferated around the world in recent years, including in other parts of Southeast Asia. 
    But Tin Htun Naing says Yangon residents could soon have to find an alternative. Municipal authorities have ordered burials to stop after complaints about the interment of animals close to human graves.
    ""I have no intention to disrespect the people who died and were buried here,"" he said. ""I just created some space to bury pet animals as I think they should have their proper graves too.""
Aung Myint Maw, director of environmental conservation at the Yangon City Development Committee, said there were no legal guidelines covering the disposal of animals in Myanmar but pet cemeteries could be established if there was public demand. 
Sein Wa Ti, a pug fanatic who has a large posse of the dogs at her home, said she hoped the site could remain open.

    ""On behalf of pet lovers, I want to ask the government to recognize this pet cemetery,"" she said.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 03:26AM ET</span>","Peril at sea, danger on shore for migrants trapped in Libya","TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - When Abdullah boarded an inflatable boat crammed with fellow migrants in February he thought he would finally reach Europe after braving the dangers of a Sahara crossing and Libya's civil war.
The 27-year-old from Niger knew the voyage ahead was risky. The Mediterranean waters between Libya and Italy have claimed thousands of lives in recent years as people sought a better life in richer, safer countries.
After only two hours at sea, naval vessels turned back the small flotilla of smuggling boats, returning Abdullah to the Libyan mainland where he had faced violence and abuse.
""I cried and cried ... It was terrible to fail after all that hard work,"" he said.
Afraid of being detained by police or an armed group, Abdullah asked to be identified by his first name only.
As the coronavirus pandemic slowed people's movement in the spring, the numbers trying to cross from Libya to Italy dropped. But as the months have worn on, smugglers' rickety vessels have taken to the waves again.
So far, more than 1,000 people have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2020. That is fewer than last year's 1,800, but fatalities have picked up since October.
Mediterranean migrant deaths rose from 117 in September to 141 in October and 184 in November, according to the U.N. migration agency.
The risks migrants take to reach mainland Europe are not only at sea. In Libya, there has been little central authority since the 2011 uprising and armed groups often control the streets in major cities.
In May, gunmen in the desert city of Mizda abducted 30 migrants in the hope of extracting a ransom, tortured them and slaughtered them when a few tried to fight back.
SMUGGLERS
Abdullah was confined to a crowded detention centre in northwest Libya after his abortive attempt to flee, and there was little to eat and barely room to sleep. After two months, a friend bribed a guard and he escaped, he said.
When Abdullah tried to make the voyage a second time, he was stopped by fighters on his way to the rendezvous and robbed of the money had earned in previous months to pay for his passage.
He now works as a cleaner in Tripoli, and has given up on another sea crossing. 
Even reaching Libya was a triumph of sorts. After paying a smuggler, Abdullah joined a dozen other migrants in a pick-up truck trundling for days across the desert to the border. They had little water and two passengers died, he said.
Once inside Libya, he faced the reality of a country at war.
""There are militias everywhere here. Sometimes I lose hope and I just want to return to Niger. I work very hard then armed people storm my home and take my money,"" he said. 
In the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, Somali national Abdul Razzaq Yassin is still determined to get to Europe.
Sick of the insecurity in his hometown of Mogadishu, Yassin left after his father was killed.
Smugglers helped him cross into Ethiopia and then Sudan before reaching the remote Libyan desert area of Kufra, where he was detained with hundreds of others in an airport hangar.
Eventually he escaped.
Several friends have already reached Europe and he is determined to join them, whatever dangers the Mediterranean poses.

""There's no future at all. I want to go to Europe.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Two critically endangered orangutans smuggled into Thailand three years ago were returned to Indonesia on Thursday, where they will undergo rehabilitation before being released into the wild. 
Ung Aing and Natalee, both four-year-old Sumatran orangutans, were taken from a wildlife rescue centre in Ratchaburi province to Bangkok's airport, before being put on a flight to Indonesia where they will initially stay at a rehabilitation centre in Jambi Province on Sumatra island. 
Before being put on the flight, the pair were fed with bananas and green apples, and cleared of having COVID-19 after taking a test, said Suraphong Chaweepak, a director at the Thai division to protect wild fauna and flora. 
""This is the fifth repatriation of orangutans back to Indonesia since 2006,"" Prakit Vongsrivattanakul, an official at Thailand's Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation said at the airport. A total of 71 orangutans have now been repatriated to Indonesia from Thailand. 
The two great apes were seized on the Thai-Malaysian border in 2017 and after the smugglers were prosecuted, Thailand agreed to send them back to Indonesia, according to a joint statement from Thailand's wildlife and conservation ministry and Indonesia's embassy in Bangkok. 
Orangutans are poached illegally from forests for food, to obtain infants for the domestic and international pet trade, or for traditional medicine.
There are only estimated to be around 100,000 Bornean orangutans left in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Fund, while only about 7,500 Sumatran orangutans are thought to remain.

In addition to illegal poaching, populations have crashed because of habitat destruction due to large-scale logging and replacement of forests with cash crops such as palm oil.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 17, 2020 02:21AM ET</span>",Need a ventilator? Polish arms dealer has plenty,"By Anna Koper
WARSAW (Reuters) - When the coronavirus pandemic surged across Europe in April and hospitals were desperate for ventilators, Poland’s government turned to an unlikely supplier: an arms dealer.
Andrzej Izdebski, 69, has helped smuggle rifles and ammunition across borders, worked for Poland’s Communist secret services, and claims to have sold dietary supplements to North Korea.
Months later, as a second coronavirus wave strains Poland’s hospitals and raises its COVID-19 death toll, Izdebski has provided less than a fifth of the 1,241 ventilators the government agreed to buy for about $53 million, the government and Izdebski say.
Izdebski’s struggle to deliver ventilators to Poland opens a window into the extraordinary lengths countries have gone to obtain the devices in the pandemic. While wealthier countries raced to secure the breathing machines from big manufacturers in China, Europe and the United States, poorer countries like Poland had a choice when the pandemic swept the globe: go on a waiting list that could delay shipments by months or turn to little-known third-party brokers. 
Izdebski went with the brokers.
Under the deal, the Polish government expected Izdebski’s company to deliver the first 321 ventilators in April and May. But with buyers around the globe also scrambling for the devices, Izdebski struggled to secure them on time, he said in an interview. When they didn’t arrive, Warsaw cancelled those orders.
Warsaw expected the remaining 920 ventilators ordered through Izdebski to come in June.
But by early July, he had delivered just 200, according to the government official in charge of the deal.
The official didn’t blame Izdebski for failing to deliver the machines, which help patients breathe and can be the difference between life and death for those facing the most dire respiratory effects of the coronavirus. He said Izdebski produced documents showing that one of the manufacturers wasn’t able to deliver the ventilators on time. Izdebski corroborated the official's account. Reuters was unable to view the documents.
But by then, Warsaw had turned to other suppliers and cancelled orders for 1,041 undelivered ventilators. Izdebski said he paid for more than half the original order with the money he received up-front from the government. 
Today, he owes Warsaw millions of dollars and is seeking buyers for almost 500 ventilators. 
His unwanted inventory is a predicament that caps a year of chaos worldwide, as authorities cast aside regular procedures to obtain medical equipment. This year, European countries and the United States agreed contracts for ventilators worth at least $5.3 billion, according to a Reuters tally of 106 deals. In at least 10 cases, as many as 43,000 ventilators failed to arrive. 
In Poland, opposition politicians have criticized the government for relying on an arms dealer for urgent life-saving equipment and for agreeing to pay upfront. Michal Szczerba, a member of Civic Platform, the biggest opposition party in the parliament, called the ventilator deal ""a gigantic scandal.""
Janusz Cieszynski, a former deputy health minister who agreed to pay Izdebski’s company a 35 million euro ($42 million) advance for the equipment, told Reuters Izdebski had received a “positive recommendation” from Poland’s Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, which did not respond to questions on the matter. 
The health ministry said all of its deals underwent reviews by multiple government agencies but otherwise declined comment, saying “everything about this case has already been communicated.” Other government agencies involved in the deal either declined to comment or did not respond. 
Izdebski says he is being unjustly scapegoated as having failed to provide the devices. The court granted a health ministry request to order him to repay 12 million euros of the advance as well as around 3.6 million euros in fines. He acknowledges the debt but is appealing the rulings. 
The 200 ventilators that he delivered -- worth 9 million euros -- are in storage, according to the health ministry. Not one has reached a hospital. Asked why not, the ministry referred Reuters to Poland’s National Reserves Agency, which runs stores of strategic goods. The agency did not respond. 
“This is a disaster for the pandemic fighting system,” Pawel Grzesiowski, a specialist in the fight against COVID-19 with Poland’s physicians’ association, the General Medical Council, told Reuters.
“The money was spent, and there is no equipment.” 
Cieszynski, the deputy minister who signed the contract, resigned in August, followed by the minister, Lukasz Szumowski. 
Both had faced calls to quit over alleged problems in buying masks and other medical equipment, including ventilators. They denied wrongdoing and said their resignations were unrelated to the ventilator deal. Szumowski did not respond to a request for comment for this story. He and Cieszynski have said they were already planning to leave but stayed on temporarily to help the pandemic effort.
Izdebski, who has already returned 14 million euros of the advance, said he had to commit millions of dollars of taxpayers’ cash upfront as demanded by the brokers. He has asked for more time to sell his stock so he can repay the rest. 
THE SUPPLIER
Izdebski conducted the deal through his 27-year-old company, E&K Sp. z o.o. According to the most recent public disclosures, E&K had assets of 4.36 million zlotys ($1 million) at the end of 2018, lower than its liabilities of 5.77 million zlotys. 
E&K initially in the 1990s specialized as a broker of air transport, chartering flights and providing other aviation services. Izdebski said he had separately been involved in trading medical equipment and designing a rescue helicopter for the Ministry of Health. 
Unimesko, another Polish company he owns, listed weapons trading in the official registry among other business activities until this year. On Nov. 30, its description in the registry changed to “non-specialized wholesale trade,” but it lists arms and ammunition production as a secondary activity.
He said he once worked with Poland's now-defunct Communist-era secret services and admitted to smuggling rifles and ammunition into Croatia despite an arms embargo in the 1990s using forged documents. In his interview with Reuters, he acknowledged that breaking the embargo ""wasn't totally legal"" but said others were doing it and he was never charged. 
In 1993, he was kidnapped in a dispute over money, court records show. Today, he describes himself as a trader in “special equipment” -- such as spare parts for the military -- as well as vitamins and nutrients to North Korea. He said he didn't violate any embargoes with those trades.
Generally speaking, Izdebski said, weapons make up a very small proportion of his dealings, most of which have been legal. 
Reuters couldn’t independently confirm certain aspects of his activities, including his involvement in the secret services. 
THE DEAL 
In early April, when Poland reported around 5,000 COVID-19 cases, Izdebski said he was sourcing protective masks for Polish companies when an official at one the companies asked if he could also supply ventilators. He said he had no experience in ventilators but spoke to the ministry and agreed to deliver some.
Normally, the authorities hold public tenders for such large deals. In March, Poland’s parliament passed a law saying that tenders are not necessary in COVID times. 
On April 14, the ministry signed a deal worth 44.4 million euros for 1,241 ventilators and transferred around 35 million euros -- nearly 80% of the total -- to Izdebski’s company within hours, according to invoices and receipts seen by Reuters. 
Izdebski said the ventilator manufacturers were out of stock, so he sourced the equipment through third parties. In a highly competitive market, he was forced to commit to purchasing equipment unseen.
He procured some of the machines through a Pakistan broker, ZM Corp, that he worked with in the past. ZM did not respond to repeated requests for comment. 
Izdebski said his assets have been frozen and he needs to sell the equipment to repay the government. He has 465 ventilators on his hands, sitting at a Polish airport.
One, he said, sits in the garage of his home

“If you have a hospital, I will be very happy to donate this ventilator.”

Mayor Lori Lightfoot also criticized the police for trying to stop the CBS Chicago network from broadcasting the video of the raid on the home of the woman, Anjanette Young.
""I was completely and totally appalled as a human being, as a Black woman and as a parent,"" Lightfoot told a news conference.
""Ms Young's dignity, that she and all of us deserve, was taken from us and this is simply inexcusable.""
The video shows police officers forcing their way into Young's home after smashing the door open.
""You've got the wrong house,"" a terrified Young is seen screaming at police, while clasping a blanket to cover herself. 
""I don't even know what you're doing.""
The Chicago police department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Young's treatment has drawn parallels with the shooting of Breonna Taylor by police in March, after police forcibly entered her house in a drugs investigation focused on Taylor's ex-boyfriend.
Taylor's case became a rallying cry in Black Lives Matter protests that swept the United States and beyond this year.
Reuters did not have contact details for Young but she told CBS in an interview https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/12/16/anjanette-young-handcuffed-naked-in-her-home-by-police-to-lori-lightfoot-i-believed-in-you-as-a-black-woman that she had felt violated by the raid.
""If I made one wrong move I felt like they would have shot me,"" said a teary-eyed Young, who wore a T-shirt with a picture Taylor and the words ""I am her"".
CBS reported https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicago-woman-raid-handcuffed-naked-lightfoot that the Chicago Police Department had denied a Freedom of Information Act request lodged by Young to gain access to the video. Police also filed an emergency motion in federal court to stop CBS Chicago from airing it.
""Filing a motion against a media outlet to prevent something from being published is something that should rarely, if ever, happen. This is not how we operate,"" Lightfoot said.

Reuters was unable to determine why police conducted the raid or if Young had faced any charges in connection with it, but media https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/chicago-mayor-criticized-after-city-lawyers-try-suppress-video-botched-n1251466 described it as ""botched"" and Lightfoot issued an apology to the woman.

Australia's second-most populous state, Victoria, locked down nine public housing towers for several days in July due to a surge in coronavirus cases.
Victoria's acting chief health officer had only 15 minutes to consider and approve the lockdown, including the potential human rights impacts, Ombudsman Deborah Glass said in her report released on Thursday.
""The rushed lockdown was not compatible with the residents' human rights, including their right to humane treatment when deprived of liberty..., the action appeared to be contrary to the law,"" she said.
Residents in eight towers were confined in their apartments for five days but the ninth tower, which had the highest number of infections, went through a total lockdown for two weeks. 
Some were left without food and medicines while many others waited more than a week to be allowed outside, the report said.
The state government conceded mistakes were made, but said decisions were made to ensure the safety of the residents. 
""We make no apology for saving people's lives, absolutely no apology for saving people's lives,"" Victoria state Housing Minister Richard Wynne told reporters.
It was not immediately clear on Thursday whether the findings would open up any legal remedies for residents to pursue against the government.
Victoria was placed into a statewide lockdown days after authorities shut the towers to contain fresh outbreaks but it has since effectively eliminated the virus due to the lockdown. 
No new cases have been reported in the state for 48 straight days as of Thursday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council is planning to discuss Western Sahara on Monday, diplomats said, after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Morocco's sovereignty over the disputed region in return for the kingdom normalizing ties with Israel.
Trump's announcement last week was a departure from longstanding U.S. policy on Western Sahara. A closed-door U.N. Security Council meeting on the situation was requested by Germany, diplomats said.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft sent a copy of Trump's proclamation recognizing ""that the entire Western Sahara territory is part of the Kingdom of Morocco"" to U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and the Security Council on Tuesday.
The United States had supported a 1991 ceasefire between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, a breakaway movement that seeks to establish Western Sahara as an independent state. The ceasefire is monitored by U.N. peacekeepers.
The region has effectively been split by an earthen wall separating an area controlled by Morocco that it claims as its southern provinces, and territory controlled by the Polisario with a U.N.-mandated buffer zone between them.
U.N. talks have long failed to broker an agreement on how to decide on self-determination. Morocco wants an autonomy plan under Moroccan sovereignty. The Polisario wants a U.N.-backed referendum including on the question of independence.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, due to succeed Trump on Jan. 20, will face a decision whether to accept the U.S. deal with Morocco on the Western Sahara, which no other Western country has done. A Biden spokesman declined to comment.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres ""position remains unchanged,"" said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric last week.
""He remains convinced that a solution to the question of Western Sahara is possible, in accordance"" U.N. Security Council resolutions, Dujarric said.

In October, the 15-member Security Council extended the U.N. peacekeeping mission, known as MINURSO, for a one year, adopting a resolution that ""emphasizes the need to achieve a realistic, practicable and enduring political solution to the question of Western Sahara based on compromise.""

Cyclone Yasa, a top category five storm, is expected to bring winds of up to 250 kmh (155 mph) and torrential rain across the South Pacific archipelago nation when it makes landfall by early Friday.
The country ordered a 14-hour nationwide curfew from 4 p.m. (0400 GMT) with people living in low-lying areas urged to move to higher ground before nightfall, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said in a video posted to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
""The impact for this super storm is more or less the entire country,"" Bainimarama said in the video.
Yasa would ""easily surpass"" the strength of 2016's Cyclone Winston, he added, referring to the southern hemisphere's most intense tropical storm on record, which killed more than 40 Fijians and left tens of thousands of people homeless.
Over 850,000 Fijians, or 95% of the population, live in the direct path of Yasa, said Bainimarama, adding that weather forecasts anticipated flash flooding and ""severe coastal inundation"" that included waves up to 10 metres (33 ft) high.
Police would enforce a ban on public transport, said the country's National Disaster Management Office, which added that the country had declared a ""state of natural disaster"" which gives law enforcement authorities increased powers.
By 8 p.m. on Thursday, the centre of Yasa was forecast to be 100 km (62 miles) east of the village of Yasawa-i-Rara and potentially over Fiji's fifth-most populous province of Bua, home to 15,000 people, the office said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's tradition of communal dining at hawker centres, open air food courts popularised by celebrity chefs and hit films such as 'Crazy Rich Asians', has been recognised by UNESCO for its cultural significance. 
The United Nations' cultural agency announced late Wednesday it had added the city-state's ""hawker culture"" to its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, nearly two years after Singapore submitted a bid to be included in the list.
Singapore's hawker centres were set up to house former street vendors, or ""hawkers"" in an effort to clean up the island in the 1970s and serve a variety of cheap, no-frills dishes to locals as well as providing a social setting. 
""These centres serve as 'community dining rooms' where people from diverse backgrounds gather and share the experience of dining over breakfast, lunch and dinner,"" UNESCO said.
Celebrity chefs including Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay have effused over favourite hawker centre dishes such as chicken rice. The 2018 film Crazy Rich Asians showed its stars tucking into heaped plates at a famous night market, and some stalls even gained  Michelin  (PA:MICP) stars for meals costing only a few dollars.
However, Singapore's hawker culture does face its challenges. 
The median age of hawkers in the city-state is 60, and younger Singaporeans are increasingly shunning cramped, sweaty kitchens for office jobs. The COVID-19 pandemic also dealt a blow, halting the usual train of tourists to the centres, while even locals were prevented from dining out for a few months during a lockdown earlier this year.

Singapore must submit a report every six years to UNESCO, showing the efforts made to safeguarding and promoting its hawker culture.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is expected to soon unseal criminal charges against another suspect in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 270 people mostly Americans, according to a person familiar with the case. 
The suspect, identified by the Wall Street Journal as Abu Agila Mohammad Masud, is a Libyan intelligence official whom the Journal reported is in custody in Libya and will be extradited to the United States to stand trial.
The case, to be unveiled in the coming days, would mark the second time Attorney General William Barr has overseen charges in connection with the bombing.
During Barr's first stint as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush, the Justice Department indicted two Libyan Intelligence Agency operatives - Abdel Basset Ali Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah - for building a plastic bomb with a timer, hiding it inside a suitcase and planting it on an Air Malta flight.
The suitcase was eventually transferred to Pan Am Flight 103.
""We will not rest until all those responsible are
brought to justice. We have no higher priority,"" Barr said in 1991, at the time the indictment was unveiled. Parallel charges were also filed against the men in Scotland.
Since then, only one person has been brought to justice. 
Megrahi was found guilty in Scotland of the Lockerbie bombing in 2001. He was freed in 2009 on compassionate release grounds and returned to Libya because he had terminal cancer. He died in 2012.
His release back to Libya at the time infuriated the Justice Department, which had the indictment against him pending and was still investigating the bombing.
The 32-year anniversary of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 - in which 190 Americans died - will be on Monday.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian Senate unexpectedly approved a bill late on Tuesday to facilitate the purchase and leasing of rural properties in Brazil by foreign nationals or foreign companies.
The legislation must be approved by the lower house of Congress before the president can sign it into law.
If passed, the legislation could attract investments in agriculture and other sectors such as wind and solar energy farms, along with mining.
According to the bill, foreign ownership can account for no more than 25% of the territory in an municipality, and foreign owners must use the land to ""fulfill a social function.""
The senator who proposed it has publicly said he hopes the law would attract some 50 billion reais ($9.8 billion) in new investments per year to Brazil. Its approval in the upper house comes as the government of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro pushes to further open the economy to private investment. 
In the case of intended land purchases in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) region, the new law would require final clearance from the National Defense Council.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors said on Wednesday they had charged a Kenya-born militant with terrorism-related offenses, including conspiring to hijack aircraft for a 9/11-style attack on an American target on behalf of the Somali-based al-Shabaab militant group.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan and the U.S. Justice Department said that Cholo Abdi Abdullah, aged 30, was arrested in the Philippines in July 2019 and transferred to the United States on Tuesday to face six federal charges related to alleged terrorism.
At a hearing held via electronic link on Wednesday morning, Abdullah told a U.S. magistrate judge he was pleading not guilty to all of the charges. His defense lawyer agreed with the judge that Abdullah should remain in custody pending a hearing in January.
The Justice Department said Abdullah, acting at the direction of an unnamed senior al-Shabaab commander, traveled in 2016 to the Philippines to enroll in a flight school to train for a possible 9/11-style attack. 
The al-Shabaab commander in question was previously responsible for planning a January 2019 attack on a hotel in Nairobi, Kenya, in which more than 20 people were killed, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors said that between 2017 and 2019, Abdullah attended the flight school on ""various occasions"" and ultimately completed tests to obtain a pilot's license.
While training to be a pilot, Abdullah also researched how to hijack a commercial airlines flight, including how to breach a locked cockpit door from the cabin, they said. He also researched information about the tallest building in an unidentified U.S. city and how to obtain a U.S. visa. 
Abdullah faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison, but a possible maximum sentence of life.

KANKARA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Families of more than 300 kidnapped Nigerian schoolboys worried they may be brainwashed or held for years as security forces combed a vast forest on Wednesday for armed captors possibly from the jihadist Boko Haram movement.
According to an unverified audio clip, the Islamist group - whose name means ""Western education is forbidden"" - was responsible for last week's raid on an all-boys school in the town of Kankara in northwestern Katsina state.
Parents fear time may be running out: Boko Haram has a history of turning captives into jihadist fighters.
""They will radicalise our children if the government does not act fast to help us rescue them,"" said trader Shuaibu Kankara, crying as he spoke from home. 
His 13-year-old son Annas was among those abducted from the Government Science school on Friday night. 
Two other sons managed to escape, he added, when men on motorbikes with AK-47 assault rifles stormed the school and marched the boys into a forest.
Though the military said it had them roughly located, some experts feared the boys could be taken over the porous border with Niger, about an hour's drive north, or at least split into small groups to make finding them harder. 
Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, have waged a decade-long insurgency estimated to have displaced about 2 million people and killed more than 30,000. They want to create states based on their extreme interpretation of sharia (Islamic law).
If Boko Haram carried out the kidnapping in an area where it had not previously claimed attacks, that would mark an alarming expansion beyond its northeastern base, security experts say. But it may alternatively have purchased the boys from criminal gangs in the northwest with whom it has been building ties. 
CHIBOK GIRLS REMEMBERED 
Nigerian soldiers and intelligence officers were combing the Rugu forest on Friday in search of the roughly 320 missing schoolboys, Abdu Labaran, an aide to Katsina's state governor, told Reuters. Planes have also been deployed. 
One of the largest forests in Nigeria, Rugu straddles three states and includes woodland near the school. Labaran said earlier in the week that a ""bandit"" had called a parent demanding a ransom and an end to helicopter flyovers.
The mass abduction echoes Boko Haram's 2014 kidnapping of more than 270 girls from a school in the northeastern town of Chibok. The attack stunned Nigerians and gave rise to a global #BringBackOurGirls campaign. 
Six years on, only about half the schoolgirls have been found or freed. Others were married off to fighters, while some are assumed to be dead.
""We pray it's not going to be another situation of the Chibok girls' abduction,"" said Ahmed Bakori, a farmer whose 14-year-old son Abubakar was among those taken.
About two dozen parents came to the Government Science compound on Wednesday and prayed in the school mosque. The compound, comprised of white single-storey buildings built on dusty red soil, was quiet. 
Abubakar Lawal, who has two children among the captives, said he did not believe Boko Haram's claim and would wait with patience and prayers. ""The government has to do diplomacy in a way to rescue these people,"" he said outside the school building.
The attack is awkward for President Muhammadu Buhari, who comes from Katsina and arrived on a private visit hours before the kidnapping occurred. Buhari has repeatedly said that Boko Haram has been ""technically defeated."" 
A retired general and former military ruler, Buhari was elected to office in 2015 in large part due to his pledge to crush the insurgency. Under his predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, Boko Haram grew in strength and controlled a large tract of territory in northeast Nigeria around the size of Belgium.
Around the nation, anger and anxiety were building over the abductions, with #BringBackOurBoys trending on Twitter.
Armed forces spokesman John Enenche said on Wednesday that troops were determined to rescue the boys alive and had no evidence any were dead. 
He gave new details of the school attack and subsequent firefight with guards. Soldiers arrived but could only shoot in the air as the assailants used the boys as shields. 

""It is the characteristics of terrorists,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - A French court on Wednesday convicted 14 people of crimes ranging from financing terrorism to membership of a criminal gang in relation to Islamist attacks in 2015 against the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine and a Jewish supermarket.
The trial has reopened one of modern France's darkest episodes, just as another wave of Islamist attacks on home soil this autumn, including the beheading of a schoolteacher, prompted the government to crack down on what it calls Islamist separatism.
Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi stormed Charlie Hebdo's offices in Paris, spraying gunfire and killing 12, on Jan. 7, 2015, nearly a decade after the weekly published cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammed. 
A third attacker, Amedy Coulibaly, killed a police woman and then four Jewish hostages in a kosher supermarket in a Paris suburb. Like the Kouachis, Coulibaly was killed in a shootout with police.
Among the 14 accomplices sentenced on Wednesday was Hayat Boumeddiene, the former partner of Coulibaly and one of three defendants tried in absentia. Believed to be still alive and on the run from an international arrest warrant, prosecutors referred to her as an ""Islamic State princess"". 
The judges convicted Boumeddiene, 32, of financing terrorism and belonging to a criminal terrorist network, and sentenced her to 30 years in jail. 
""DESIRE TO SOW TERROR""
The attacks, claimed by al Qaeda and Islamic State, laid bare France's struggle to counter the threat of militants brought up in the country and of foreign jihadists.
""The fact of choosing victims precisely because they were journalists, or a member of the security forces, or of Jewish faith, clearly demonstrates in itself their desire to sow terror in Western countries,"" the presiding judge told the court. 
Terrorism-related charges were dropped for six of the defendants who were found guilty of lesser crimes.
Journalists from Charlie Hebo testified during the trial.
After Wednesday's ruling, the magazine’s lawyer, Richard Malka, described the defendants as part of a nebulous support network that enabled the attackers to spill blood.
""Without these nebulous networks, attacks cannot occur,"" he told reporters, in the first reaction from the magazine or its representatives to the verdicts. 
On the eve of the trial's opening, Charlie Hebdo, which has long tested the limits of what society will accept in the name of free speech, re-printed the cartoons that had stirred outrage in the Muslim world when they were first published by a Danish paper in 2005.

A month later, history teacher Samuel Paty was decapitated by a teenage Islamist who said in a recorded message that he was avenging Paty's use of the cartoons in a class on civil liberties.

China arrested businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig in December 2018, shortly after Canadian police picked up Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant. The two men face spying charges.
Asked by Global News whether he thought there would be good news for the men's families before the New Year, Trudeau replied: ""I certainly hope so.""

Pashinyan, who swept to power in a peaceful revolution in May 2018, accepted a Russian-brokered ceasefire deal last month to end a bloody conflict between Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces over the Nagorno-Karabkh enclave and surrounding areas.
The deal locked in territorial gains for Azerbaijan, sparking protests in Yerevan. He has accepted responsibility for the conflict's outcome, but declined to resign, ignoring a deadline set by his critics to step down earlier this month. 
Hundreds of opposition demonstrators rallied in Yerevan and chanted for his exit as the deadline passed last week. They have called for snap elections to be held and also put forward a possible interim leader to replace Pashinyan. 
""....We will continue accumulating power so that Tuesday (Dec. 22) becomes decisive,"" Ishkhan Saghatelyan, one of the opposition leaders, told supporters at a rally in Yerevan where he announced the strike plans. 
On Wednesday, Pashinyan said in an interview with RFE/RL that it was not up to him to call a snap election and that such a move would have to be agreed with other parliamentary parties. 
He said the opposition forces criticising him over the ceasefire deal were the same factions who had demanded his exit in December last year. 

""Essentially, nothing has changed all this time,"" he said.

Nigeria closed its land borders last year to curb smuggling of rice and arms, which it says threatens efforts to boost local production and security, and to generate state revenues through import duties.
The government at a cabinet meeting approved the reopening of Seme border to the South West, Illela and Maigatari border in the North West and Mfun in the South. The others will be reopened on December 31.
It kept restrictions on rice import and some other products.
Last month, the government ratified its membership of the African free-trade zone due to be launched in January, after initial reluctance to join the bloc for fear of exposing local industries to dumping by countries outside Africa.
Discussions to reopen Nigeria's borders closed to the movement of goods have been going on for months. Nigeria has insisted on levying duties on goods transiting its country through neighbouring nations to curb smuggling.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia's opposition says it has written to Turkey urging it not to send a planned shipment of weapons to a special police unit that they fear incumbent President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed could use to ""hijack"" forthcoming elections.
Political tensions have been high in the Horn of Africa country, stoked by opposition anger over a delay in holding the elections for both chambers of parliament. 
The polls were initially planned for this month but that plan was scrapped following disagreements over the composition of the electoral board. 
On Tuesday opposition supporters marched in the capital Mogadishu denouncing the president for the delay.
In the letter addressed to Turkey's ambassador in Somalia and seen by Reuters, opposition candidates said they had learned Turkey was planning to deliver 1,000 G3 assault rifle and 150,000 bullets to Harma'ad, a special unit in Somalia's police, between Dec. 16 and Dec. 18. 
Abdirahman Abdishakur Warsame, chairman of the Wadajir (unity) party and one of the candidates who jointly wrote the letter, confirmed its authenticity to Reuters.
The candidates, the letter said, are ""worried about this amount of weapons ... flooding the country at this sensitive election time."" 
The president ""has already used the Harma'ad forces for coercion and rigging of regional elections, and so there is no doubt the same Harma'ad forces and the weapons from Turkey will be used to hijack the upcoming elections,"" it said. 
There was no immediate comment from Turkish officials.
Turkey provides training to the police unit. The letter urged Ankara to delay the delivery of weapons and ammunition until after the delayed elections have been conducted. 
Somalia's information minister Osman Abukar Dube did not immediately respond to Reuters calls and a text message seeking comment. 
In recent years Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has become a close ally of the Somali government. Ankara has built schools, hospitals and infrastructure and provided scholarships for Somalis to study in Turkey. In 2017, Turkey opened its biggest overseas military base in Mogadishu.
However that alliance has inserted Somalia into the centre of a regional struggle between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on one side and Qatar backed by Turkey on the other.

DUBAI (Reuters) - An annual Gulf Arab summit has been put off to January while parties locked in a rancorous row that led to a boycott of Qatar work towards announcing a tangible deal, though a final resolution is likely to take longer, informed sources said.
The dispute, in which Saudi Arabia and its allies severed diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar in mid-2017, has seen movement with Riyadh earlier this month saying a final solution was within reach. 
The other nations involved were more circumspect when welcoming progress in mediation efforts by Kuwait and the United States, which wants Gulf Arabs to be united against Iran.
Four sources familiar with the matter said they expected an announcement to coincide with the summit, which is normally held in December and has not grouped Qatar's emir together with leaders of the boycotting states since 2017. 
A Gulf source said a deal, to be finalised by ministers ahead of the government leaders' summit, could result in a set of principles for negotiations or a more concrete move involving reopening airspace to Qatar as a show of good faith.
""Things are moving fast but are still up in the air. Negotiations for a final resolution will take months and months,"" the source said.
Another source close to the matter said that when Kuwait announced progress there had been promises that all leaders would attend the summit, but talks on reopening airspace, which Washington has been pushing for, had still run aground. 
SAUDI TAKES LEAD ON QATAR
A foreign diplomat in the region, who also expected full participation at the gathering, said that a preliminary deal however may be followed by a renewed impasse.
The Saudis appeared more keen than their allies, the diplomat said, and Doha was willing to hold out for a comprehensive deal, especially given that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to take a firmer stance with Saudi Arabia. 
""The Saudis are keen to demonstrate to Biden that they are peacemakers and open to dialogue,"" the diplomat said, adding that the Gulf powerhouse is likely to convince reluctant allies to fall into line.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-Gulf Egypt accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism, an allusion to Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty.
The UAE is at cross purposes with Qatar in Libya and over the Muslim Brotherhood, also key issues for Cairo.
""If there are countries that still support terrorism and extremism in the region, then this will be a problem,"" UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan told a news conference this week when addressing the dispute.
Qatar says any resolution should be based on mutual respect, including of foreign policy.
Doha had been set 13 demands, ranging from closing Al Jazeera television and shuttering a Turkish base to cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran.
A senior Omani diplomat said some issues like Turkey required more time but that ""there are shifting sands"" after a rare telephone call between Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last month.

""I see light at the end of the tunnel,"" the diplomat said.

According to state media, Turkey fined YouTube, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter some 40 million lira each in the last two months for not complying with the law, which critics says muzzles dissent from people who have turned to online platforms as Ankara has tightened its grip on mainstream media.
YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google, said it respects the laws and regulations in countries where it operates, while maintaining its ""commitments to freedom of expression, access to information, and transparency"". 
""We have been able to find a way forward and will commence the process of appointing a local representative legal entity in compliance with the law, without compromising our values,"" it said in a statement. 
The law allows Turkish authorities to remove content from platforms, rather than blocking access as they have done in the past, and requires social media platforms to appoint a local representative to address authorities' concerns.

Companies that still do not follow the law after fines will have their bandwidth slashed by 90%, essentially blocking access. If companies comply, the restrictions will be lifted and a quarter of the imposed fine will be collected, according to the regulation.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court in Siberia jailed a Jehovah's Witness adherent for six years on Wednesday after finding him guilty of extremist activity, his lawyer said, part of a crackdown on the religious group. 
Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Masked law enforcement officers carried out mass raids on the religion's adherents in Russia last month.
Yuriy Savelyev, 66, was sentenced by a court in Novosibirsk, around 1,740 miles (2,800 km) east of Moscow, his lawyer, Vitaliy Svintsov, told Reuters. Svintsov said Savelyev would appeal the decision. 
The court confirmed the ruling on its website.
""Convicting Yuriy, a peaceful 66-year-old Christian, to six years in prison is patently absurd,"" said Jarrod Lopes, a U.S.-based spokesman for the group. 
""It also defies international human rights norms, which is why the European Union, Britain, the United States and the United Nations have repeatedly called on Russia to stop the systematic persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses.""
Prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Savelyev to eight years in prison, Lopes added. 
Russia's Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that the group was an ""extremist"" organisation and ordered it to disband, a decision that was followed by a crackdown which has seen dozens of adherents jailed and hundreds hit with criminal charges.
Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination known for door-to-door preaching, close Bible study, and rejection of military service and blood transfusions.

(Reuters) - By the time anyone at the Milwaukee County Jail noticed Shade Swayzer had given birth alone in a filthy cell, her baby was dead.
Swayzer had arrived a week earlier, on July 6, 2016, picked up after a dispute with a hotel clerk and charged with disorderly conduct and a parole violation from an old burglary conviction. She was clearly pregnant, just a few weeks from her due date, and police had her evaluated at a hospital before bringing her to jail. The fetus was deemed active and healthy, and Swayzer cleared for detention.
Swayzer, who had documented diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, told a jail nurse she’d stopped taking her medication, fearing it might harm her baby, court filings show. She refused examination by a jail physician and was assigned to the closely monitored “Special Needs Unit” with instructions for daily medical checks.
But within 48 hours, she was moved. That unit had only three cells for women, versus at least 13 for men, and the jail needed her cell for another female inmate who was suicidal. Swayzer landed in an isolation cell with no video coverage.
Five days later, an officer making rounds noticed Swayzer wearing no pants and acting “bizarre,” sitting on a mattress folded against the wall, bedding bunched beside her. The guard didn’t know Swayzer was pregnant – it wasn’t in her custody notes – and moved on. Later, the guard passed again and smelled a “funk,” according to investigation reports. Returning after her rounds for a closer look, she saw blood on Swayzer’s mattress and called for help.
Just after 6 a.m., nurses found Swayzer on her side, umbilical cord attached to the newborn. Swayzer cradled the child in a blanket. There was blood everywhere, feces on the mattress, empty meal containers scattered about, court testimony showed. “Don’t hurt my baby,” she said.
Laliah Swayzer, just under six pounds and already named by her mother, was dead. Her tragedy is part of a little-noticed confluence of trends behind bars.
The number of women held in America’s jails has risen more than 20% over the past decade, to an average of more than 115,000 inmates a day. And more and more are arriving in need of medical attention or with debilitating health conditions that strain the capacity of lockups typically designed for men. Thousands arrive pregnant each year. Most suffer from mental illness – at far higher rates than their male counterparts – and they’re more likely to experience drug and alcohol addiction.
As more women land in America’s local jails, more are dying there, too.
Reuters, analyzing data it obtained from more than 500 U.S. jails, documented 914 deaths of female inmates in those facilities from 2008 to 2019. In a three-year stretch from 2008 to 2010, 171 women died in the jails surveyed. From 2017 to 2019, the number rose to 287 dead, amid a spike in drug and alcohol deaths across U.S. society.
The casualties disproportionately affect Black women. Blacks comprise less than 14% of the U.S. population, but at least 24% of the 914 female victims identified by Reuters were Black. Information on race was unavailable for about 5% of female victims.
Seventy percent of the women who died over the 12-year period – at least 639 inmates – were awaiting trial, unconvicted and presumed innocent of the charges they faced. The death toll doesn’t include a category of collateral fatalities: their infant children.
The female inmate population has risen even as the male population declined, Reuters found, and many women struggle to afford bail, which can lead to longer jail stays.
“These women are showing up with needs, imminent needs, usually during a period of crisis and with trauma,” said Jessica Stroop, a correctional consultant with The Moss Group and former researcher specializing in female inmates at the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. “It puts a massive strain on the jails.”
Jails “need to have gender-responsive programs and staff and training and facilities,” Stroop said. Instead, “women often get treated as a bolt-on” in jails “designed for men.”
Jailers have been slow to adapt their medical programs, staffing models and housing strategies to accommodate the demographic shift, say experts. The Milwaukee jail, which had few cells set aside for women in need, has been under court supervision since 2001 due to repeated findings of inadequate healthcare; the sheriff’s office did not reply to five interview requests and a lawyer representing the county declined comment.
The influx of women in jails “poses significant challenges, because there are limited resources,” said David Mahoney, the sheriff in Dane County, Wisconsin, who is also president of the National Sheriffs’ Association. The prevalence of addictions, mental illness and pregnancy “is a strain” requiring more personnel, housing and medications, he said.
DRUG, MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES
In the 500-plus jails surveyed by Reuters, deaths of women from the acute effects of drugs and alcohol, including overdoses and withdrawal, have climbed substantially.
From 2008 to 2016, at least 12% of female inmate deaths were attributed to drugs or alcohol, double the rate for men. From 2017 to 2019, at least 24% of female deaths were linked to drugs or alcohol, again double the rate for men. Cause of death findings were unknown in 6% to 12% of cases in those periods.
Nearly 70% of female jail inmates suffer mental health disorders, versus just over 40% of male inmates, a 2017 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics study found.
The first time Jennifer Casey Norred tried to hang herself in her cell, jailers at Florida’s Leon County Detention Facility responded by strapping her in a restraint chair.
Over the next 24 hours, she cried, screamed and struggled until exhaustion silenced her. Norred, 36, appeared to suffer a seizure and urinated on herself, jail records show. 
Norred had battled schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. When using her medications, she was full of energy, cooking meals for her mother’s book club, or visiting her grandmother in an assisted living facility.
“She was happy, healthy, and productive,” said Elizabeth Frederick, her mother.
When in the throes of mental illness, the popular waitress was tormented by sleep-deprived paranoia.
Her obsessive behavior led to aggravated stalking charges and landed her in jail on April 2, 2017. During her three months behind bars, she grew agitated, argued with inmates and told staff she didn’t need her medication. A psychologist deemed her incompetent for trial and recommended a mental health facility. A judge eventually agreed.
Before she could be transferred, Norred hanged herself.
“What she needed was intensive psychiatric treatment, not a restraint chair,” said James Cook, an attorney representing the family in an ongoing wrongful death lawsuit against the sheriff’s office and Corizon Health Inc, the jail’s healthcare provider.
In court filings, the Leon County sheriff and Corizon denied wrongdoing. Corizon told Reuters that while Norred’s suicide was “tragic,” the company provided care “consistent with best practices and national standards.” The sheriff’s office declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.
DANGEROUS DETOX
The opioid crisis has deepened the risk for women behind bars. Drug and alcohol overdoses, frequently involving opioids, have emerged as the single biggest factor behind the rise in female inmate deaths. As the epidemic ravaged Ohio, 35-year-old Brittany Rae Schlarb was among the casualties.
Schlarb’s life took a hard turn at age 21. Diagnosed with anxiety disorder three years earlier, the hair stylist turned to cocaine, methamphetamines and other drugs and, in time, lost custody of her three kids. At the age of 28, she cleaned up, fell in love, got her kids back and earned an associate’s degree in marketing.
“Brittany had dreams of one day opening and running her own salon,” Deborah Schlarb, her mother, said in a previously unreported affidavit.
Then in 2011, a truck sped through a red light and slammed into Schlarb’s car, severely injuring her. Surgeons screwed a rod into her arm “that caused her pain all the time,” said her mother. Prescribed an opioid medication, her addiction returned. She moved on to fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, and to heroin. On June 21, 2018, police found her with meth and heroin in a restaurant parking lot.
The Summit County Jail in the city of Akron booked her into a medical infirmary for observation as she began to detox in her cell, a painful process that can include diarrhea, insomnia, hallucinations and dehydration. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care, an industry body that provides voluntary health standards for jails, recommends jails medically assist inmates going through detox. Some prescribe the drugs methadone and suboxone to reduce cravings and prevent withdrawal symptoms. Some inmates receive intravenous fluids.
Over four days of vomiting and dizziness, Schlarb’s only treatment amounted to suggestions she drink more water, according to a medical examiner investigation and her family attorneys.
Rail-thin, she rapidly deteriorated. By 9 p.m. on June 25, 2018, she was found face down in her cell, unconscious and covered in vomit, the medical examiner reported. “Her body was the color of a pickled egg, a reddish purple,” reported Tina Hamrick, who was an inmate in the next cell. An autopsy found Schlarb died of “dehydration due to complication of methamphetamine detoxification in custody.”
Her family threatened to sue the jail and its private medical contractor, Advanced Correctional Healthcare Inc, for knowingly providing inadequate care. The case settled for $625,000 before it went to court, county documents show.
Three addiction specialists expressed surprise Schlarb was offered just water. Withdrawal treatments should be “highly individualized” for underlying health conditions, said Joseph Lee, a medical director at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation. “Detox can be very straightforward but it can also be incredibly nuanced and complicated.”
Advanced Correctional Healthcare denied wrongdoing but declined to comment on the specifics of the case. The jail also declined to comment on Schlarb’s case but said all inmates were screened for medical issues and those going through withdrawal had their vitals regularly checked. Five months after Schlarb’s death, it switched medical contractors, but did not respond to questions about the change.
“It was senseless what happened to her. All they had to do was take her to the hospital,” Schlarb’s mother, Deborah, said in an interview. “If she’d only been put on an IV, she’d be alive today.”
PREGNANCY WORRIES
At America’s 3,000-plus jails, thousands of women arrive pregnant every year, a situation that can imperil mother and child.
Data on pregnant women in jails is scant or dated. Studies reviewed by Reuters have estimated that from 3% to 5% of female inmates are pregnant when they arrive.
Without data, “you can only make assumptions,” said Carolyn Sufrin, an assistant professor in gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Reuters has filled some of that data void by examining public records, media reports and academic research. Reporters identified at least 65 cases from 2010 to 2019 in which female inmates suffered serious pregnancy-related complications, including miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, placental abruptions, stillbirths, and newborn or maternal deaths.
There are no national standards that all jails must meet for handling pregnant inmates.
Sufrin, who started a women’s health clinic at the San Francisco County Jail, led a study examining pregnancy outcomes for incarcerated women and found that the quality of care varies widely. Some jails provide comprehensive care with routine checkups and nutritional services. Others, understaffed, provide dangerously inadequate care.
In a jail, where women aren’t free to call a doctor or go to the hospital on their own, requests for medical attention can be ignored or overlooked.
Meagan Deadrich was 26 weeks pregnant when she was booked into the Salt Lake County Metro Jail on Valentine’s Day 2018 for violating her probation by not checking in with probation officials on a prior shoplifting case and misdemeanor drug charge. Within days, she had contractions and began bleeding two days later. Deadrich, then 34, said a nurse assured her the bleeding was normal. The mother of four said she knew otherwise.
A week later, when the bleeding wouldn’t stop, Deadrich begged for help. A nurse evaluated her on March 1 but she never saw a doctor, jail records produced in litigation show. Four days later, “I couldn’t feel my baby move,” Deadrich told Reuters. “If they would’ve sent me to the hospital sooner, my baby would’ve been fine.”
That afternoon, a physician assistant in the jail’s women’s clinic failed to detect a fetal heartbeat, her lawsuit alleged. Deadrich pleaded to go to the emergency room, but instead was returned to her cell.
That night, at about 10 p.m., she was handcuffed and driven to the hospital, where a doctor told her the baby was dead. “I was heartbroken,” she said.
She was diagnosed with placenta previa, a life-threatening condition in which the placenta covers the cervix and can lead to bleeding and complications during pregnancy and delivery. She underwent a c-section and a hysterectomy to remove her uterus. Deadrich can no longer have children.
When she awoke from the procedure, shackled to her bed, she asked to hold her baby and say goodbye. A deputy standing guard would only unshackle one hand, she said. “She was beautiful,” said Deadrich, sobbing. “She had a full head of black hair.”
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists condemns the use of restraints on incarcerated women during pregnancy and postpartum recovery, except for those who pose a risk of escape or harm. The group also recommends pregnant inmates have 24-hour access to obstetric visits. Deadrich says she didn’t have that.
She sued the county, sheriff and jail, alleging they violated her constitutional rights by failing to provide proper medical care. The sheriff’s office denied that her rights were violated or that its staff contributed to her injuries or the baby’s death. The case is ongoing.
Reuters identified 52 inmate deaths in the Salt Lake County Sheriff’s two jails from 2009 to 2019, or 2.2 deaths per 1,000 inmates – above average among the 500-plus big jails it surveyed. Nineteen of those deaths were women. The jail said it strives to provide quality care to all inmates.
When Shade Swayzer arrived at the Milwaukee County Jail, the medical and mental health directors saw her pregnancy and mental illness as a risky mix, lawsuit testimony shows. But their plan to address those risks collapsed in less than 24 hours.
“We wanted to make sure that we kept an eye on her,” Dr. Karen Ronquillo-Horton, the medical director, testified in the Swayzer family’s wrongful death suit. “I had concerns about her baby.”
Ronquillo-Horton directed that Swayzer be housed in the jail’s Special Needs Unit, where two officers provide continuous supervision and cells allow clear views of inmates. The doctor ordered regular prenatal exams and daily checks of the mother’s and baby’s vital signs.
But when a corrections supervisor needed one of the unit’s three female cells for someone else, Swayzer was moved out. The supervisor later testified that he checked with the inmate classification desk and found that Swayzer’s housing specifications card listed no restrictions. But a classification officer insisted in a deposition that the card noted the order to house her in Special Needs.
Exactly who erred was never determined; an investigator later acknowledged in court testimony that one of the officers probably was lying. In any event, Swayzer was removed from the Special Needs Unit. Isolated in a general population cell, she was surly and uncooperative. After three days, the jail’s nurse midwife, Katherine Meine, asked if she could do an exam. Swayzer told her to “fuck off,” Meine later testified, and said she was “fine” and could feel the baby moving.
While Swayzer’s mental illness was well documented, she had not been deemed incompetent, so she had a right to refuse treatment. In response to her lawsuit, the sheriff’s office said it met its obligation to provide medical care, saying she was monitored and showed no outward signs of distress. Another defendant, Armor Health, the contractor that provided the jail’s medical care and staffing, told Reuters in a statement that “no member of our team played a role in the tragic loss of the infant.”
Meine was concerned by Swayzer’s refusal of treatment, she later testified. It had been nearly a week since Swayzer’s last exam, including any check of the baby’s heartbeat.
The nurse midwife filed an urgent request to have Swayzer sent back to the hospital where she’d gotten prenatal care before her arrest, hoping Swayzer might agree to the plan. The request was approved, and an appointment sought at the hospital.
Two nights later, with the appointment still unscheduled, the duty officer noticed Swayzer acting “weird,” but she later testified that the inmate never mentioned any concerns. Swayzer, in her own sworn statement, said she told the officer, “I’m hemorrhaging and I’m having contractions” and called for help when she delivered the baby.
The medical examiner was unable to determine an official time or cause of death for the child. In her ongoing lawsuit against the sheriff and jail staff, Swayzer testified the baby was born alive and cried weakly as she tried to breastfeed her, before going silent. Expert defense witnesses contend the baby was stillborn, likely killed by a lung infection 24-36 hours before birth.
“Nobody is competent to have a baby by themselves in a cell, whether or not you’re medically trained, not medically trained, having mental health issues, not having mental health issues,” midwife Meine testified. “Nobody wants to have a baby in the jail.”

""We're already used to the fact that the United States and other Western countries make new accusations against Russia in the media, be it about hackers or revelations about the double or even triple poisoning of Navalny,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. 
""It's amusing to read these news items,"" Lavrov added during a news conference in Zagreb alongside his Croatian counterpart Gordan Grlic Radman. 
Navalny on Monday declared his poisoning case solved after a joint media inquiry said it had identified a team of assassins from Russia's FSB security service as his would-be killers who had stalked him for years.
It said FSB operatives ""that have specialised training in chemical weapons, chemistry and medicine"" secretly followed Navalny around Russia for the last four years more than 37 times.
The investigation was carried out by Bellingcat and Russian media outlet The Insider in cooperation with CNN and the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel.
The Kremlin has repeatedly rejected any suggestion that Russian authorities tried to kill Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics.

Navalny, 44, suddenly fell ill on a flight from Siberia to Moscow in August. He was airlifted for medical treatment to Germany, where he continues to undergo rehabilitation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hundreds of Indian women, including many widows of farmers who were believed to have killed themselves over debt, joined a protest on Wednesday against government reforms that farmers say threaten their livelihoods.
Farmers have been protesting for nearly a month over the reforms, enacted in September, to deregulate the agriculture sector, allowing farmers to sell to buyers beyond government-regulated wholesale markets.
Small farmers fear the changes will mean the end of guaranteed minimum prices for their crops and leave them at the mercy of big retailers.
""If these black laws come, more farmers will go deeper into debt,"" said 40-year-old Harshdeep Kaur, a widow from Punjab state, at one protest site on the outskirts of the capital, New Delhi.
""More mothers and sisters will become widows like me.""
Suicide by struggling farmers has been a problem in India for years. 
Nearly 10,350 farmers and agricultural labourers committed suicide in 2018 - making up almost 8% of all suicides in India, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.
Kaur said her husband committed suicide three years ago after running up debts of 500,000 rupees (nearly $7,000). As she spoke, she held a passport sized photo of him.
The reforms, contained in three laws, loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has tried to assure farmers the changes will bring them new opportunities but few have been convinced. Several rounds of talks between farm union leaders and the government have failed.
""We'll keep protesting,"" said Gurbax Singh, a farmer union leader at a north Delhi protest site.
The farmers have gathered at various sites around the capital since late last month, blocking traffic and clashing with police, at least in the early days of their action. 
Singh said dozens of buses, tractors and cars were being arranged to bring more women from Punjab – the epicentre of the agitation.
The protesters occupied several kilometres of a busy main road in western Delhi with their tractors on Wednesday.
At a nearby protest site, old farmers lounged in ramshackle shelters beside medical stalls and makeshift kitchens.
Kaur said she and other women were prepared to protest until the laws were repealed. 
""More women will come,"" she said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Two former Lebanese ministers charged with negligence over a huge explosion at Beirut port in August that killed 200 people indicated on Wednesday they would not appear for questioning before the judge handling the case.
Judge Fadi Sawan charged three former ministers and the caretaker prime minister last week, sparking a fierce debate about whether the judge had the authority to charge the politicians in a nation still seeking answers about the blast.
The explosion added further strains to a country struggling with its worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
Some leading parties rebuked the judge for his action, including Shi'ite Muslim movement Hezbollah and the Sunni group led by former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri.
Ali Hassan Khalil, a former finance minister, and Ghazi Zeaiter, a former public works minister, who were both charged, said they had not been officially informed of Wednesday's session, which protocol demanded.
Both are lawmakers from Amal, the Shi'ite party led by powerful Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri who is allied to Hezbollah.
Sawan could not immediately be reached for comment.
Hassan Diab, the caretaker prime minister whose cabinet resigned after the explosion, declined to be questioned on Monday. An official source said the judge set a new appointment for Friday but had yet to receive a response. Diab says his conscience is clear over the matter. 
Families of blast victims are increasingly frustrated that details have not emerged from an investigation since the Aug. 4 explosion caused by a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate, which was stored in unsafe conditions.
The blast, one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in history, injured thousands of people and devastated several districts in the centre of the capital.
Many Lebanese say they have given up hope of finding out the truth about the explosion in a country where a political elite have held power for decades amid corruption and mismanagement, while few in authority have ever been held to account.
Politicians say Sawan has been selective and overstepped his powers, while the head of the Beirut Bar Association and others say the judge has shown courage.
Khalil said he played no role in the blast case. The Finance Ministry, which he led from 2014 to early 2020, oversees customs.
Zeaiter, who called the charges ""a blatant violation"", ran the Public Works Ministry in 2014, soon after ship carrying the ammonium nitrate arrived at the port.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities on Wednesday transferred 23 Islamic militants to the capital Jakarta for questioning, including one of the suspected bomb makers behind the 2002 attacks on the resort island of Bali.
Zulkarnaen, thought to be one of the seniormost members of Al Qaeda-linked militant group Jemaah Islamiah, was arrested on Sumatra island last week along with 22 others in a series of raids. 
After the group's charter plane had landed at Jakarta airport, Zulkarnaen, who was wearing an orange shirt with a sarong, was escorted by anti-terrorism police from the plane. 
At a news conference at the airport, national police spokesman Aswin Siregar desribed Zulkarnaen as ""a very, very dangerous person"" for Indonesia and the world 
Zulkarnean is believed to have been involved in making the bombs that were used in the Bali bombings that killed 202 people and the 2003 bombing of the J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta that killed 12 people. 
Indonesia has been dealing with militant attacks for the past two decades from groups such as Jemaah Islamiah, some of whose members trained in Afghanistan, Pakistan and the southern Philippines.
In the wake of the Bali attacks and with backing from Australia and the United States, Indonesia set up an elite anti-terrorist unit that helped weaken Jemaah Islamiah and resulted in scores of suspected militants being arrested or killed. 
But the ability of Zulkarnean to stay hidden for so long raises questions about whether the group has managed to remain a force and potentially regenerate.

Police spokesman Aswin told reporters authorities aimed to track all the networks that helped him evade capture.

The Minnesota Pardons Board commuted Myon Burrell's sentence to 20 years from life plus 12 months, and said he will serve the remainder of his sentence on a supervised release, according to an internal memo from Commissioner Paul Schnell of the Minnesota Department of Corrections to various officials. 
""Based on the Board's action, I authorize you to immediately process Mr Burrell for release from secure custody to serve out the remainder of his time on supervised release status,"" Schnell said in the memo, a copy of which was emailed to Reuters.
Burrell was sentenced as a teenager for the murder of Tyesha Edwards, who was killed when she was hit by a stray bullet that struck her in the chest.
The Associated Press (AP) in February reported https://apnews.com/article/115076e2bd194cfa7560cb4642ab8038 that his sentencing and his age at the time of the killing raised questions about the integrity of the criminal justice system and uncovered flaws in the police investigation of the case.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which had been seeking recourse for Burrell since the AP report was published, said the case was a reflection of how much work needs to be done to repair the criminal justice system.

""We will continue to hold the justice system accountable for its transgressions in criminalizing Black youth and rushing to put them behind bars for a long time,"" the NAACP said in a statement.

Between 2016 and 2018, dozens of U.S. embassy staff, largely in Cuba, reported symptoms that included hearing loss, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with mild traumatic brain injury that came to be known as the ""Havana syndrome.""
Canada has said more than a dozen of its embassy staff and relatives stationed in Havana experienced similar symptoms. 
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump said the diplomats were attacked by some sort of secret weapon. Cuba has repeatedly said there is no evidence for that and denied any involvement. 
The Cuban Academy of Sciences said on Tuesday the report by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, commissioned by the U.S. State Department and published on Dec. 6, gives no scientific evidence of the existence of radio frequency waves.
""Cuba's Academy of Sciences disagrees with the final conclusion regarding the causes of the ailments,"" the academy said in a statement read to journalists by its President Luis Velazquez.
Velazquez, who did not take any questions at the news briefing in Havana, said the ""investigation about these health ailments has suffered from a lack of fluid communication between U.S. and Cuban scientists.""
U.S. officials say off the record they cannot cooperate with Cuba on such a sensitive investigation where its Communist government has a strong interest in the outcome.
Cuba said the Trump administration has used the health incidents to further its political agenda of dismantling U.S.-Cuban relations, after Trump's predecessor Barack Obama had worked to improve diplomatic ties with Havana.
The administration reduced the U.S. embassy in Havana to skeletal staffing and hiked its warning on travel to Cuba following the mysterious incidents.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Canadian fashion mogul Peter Nygard was charged on Tuesday with sex trafficking, racketeering and other crimes targeting dozens of women and underage girls over a quarter century in three countries, U.S. authorities said.
Canadian police arrested Nygard in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on Monday at the U.S. government's request under the countries' extradition treaty.
Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said Nygard, 79, had since 1995 used his influence and businesses to ""recruit and maintain"" victims in the United States, Canada and the Bahamas to sexually gratify himself and his associates.
“Mr. Nygard vehemently denies all the allegations and expects to be vindicated in court,"" his lawyer Jay Prober said.
Nygard wore a white face mask, a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, with his long white hair pulled back in a bun, at an initial appearance in a Winnipeg courtroom.
He was led away while wearing handcuffs and leg chains. Nygard plans to seek bail, and his next scheduled hearing is on Jan. 13, 2021.
Nygard also faces class-action civil litigation in Manhattan by 57 unnamed women accusing him of sexual misconduct. He has denied wrongdoing.
Born in Finland, Nygard grew up in Manitoba, eventually running his own namesake clothing companies and becoming one of Canada's wealthiest people.
Authorities said that victims were assaulted by Nygard or his associates, with some drugged to ensure they met his sexual demands, and that Nygard often targeted victims who came from disadvantaged backgrounds or had suffered abuse.
The nine-count indictment said Nygard used multiple means to recruit victims.
These allegedly included company-funded ""Pamper Parties"" named for their free food, drink and spa services, and held at his properties in Marina del Rey in California and the Bahamas.
The indictment said Nygard took some victims - he called them ""girlfriends"" - to swingers clubs where they would be intimidated into having sex with other men, ""to facilitate Nygard having sex with other women and for his own sexual gratification.""
Nygard also used threats of arrest, reputational harm and lawsuits to silence potential accusers, the indictment said.
In February, Nygard stepped down as chairman of Nygard International after its New York headquarters near Times Square was raided by the FBI.
The company filed for bankruptcy in March.

Nygard has also been embroiled in a decade-long feud, including defamation claims and other litigation, with billionaire hedge fund manager Louis Bacon, who owns an adjacent property in a gated Bahamas community.

OTTAWA (Reuters) -Iran is not conducting its investigation into the downing of a civilian airliner in January properly and many questions remain unanswered, an independent Canadian report into the tragedy said on Tuesday.
The 79-page document is the latest expression of frustration from Western nations into how the Islamic Republic is handling the aftermath of a disaster that claimed 176 lives.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards say they accidentally shot down the Ukraine International Airlines plane shortly after take-off, mistaking it for a missile when tensions with the United States were high. Many of the victims were Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
Former Canadian cabinet minister Ralph Goodale, charged with helping the victims' families and examining how to deal with similar disasters in future, said ""many of the key details of this horrific event"" remain unknown.
""Iran...has not conducted its investigations (safety, criminal or otherwise) in a truly independent, objective and transparent manner, and answers to critical questions"" are absent, he wrote in the report.
Last month the United Nations aviation agency and Ukraine complained separately about how Iran was conducting the probe.
""There's not much of a track record to base any optimism on so far,"" Goodale said by phone when asked about the chances of Tehran carrying out a fully transparent investigation.
Just before the disaster, Iran had fired missiles at U.S. bases in Iraq. Five days earlier, the United States had killed a Revolutionary Guards commander in Iraq.
Goodale said Iran needed to explain how it had assessed the risks to civilian aircraft, why it had left the airspace open and also why the Guards had decided to down the plane.
Canada and other nations who lost citizens are pressing Iran for reparations and a formal apology.

""Canada just has to be absolutely relentless...to make sure the international community does not forget what happened,"" said Goodale.

Biden's victory and Bolsonaro's reluctance to recognize it have cast a dark cloud over U.S.-Brazilian relations, which had warmed to the point of discussing a free trade deal last year.
Biden is likely to take a tougher line on Brasilia in areas such as the environment, human rights and trade, leaving the far-right Bolsonaro even more isolated on the global stage. 
""Greetings to the President Joe Biden, with my best wishes and the hope that the USA will remain 'the land of the free and the home of the brave,'"" Bolsonaro said in a statement published by Brazil's Foreign Ministry.
""I will be ready to work with you and continue to build a Brazil-USA alliance, in defense of sovereignty, democracy and freedom around the world, as well as in trade integration.""
Bolsonaro, a former army captain, was one of the last global leaders to acknowledge Biden's victory, doing so only after it was confirmed by the U.S. Electoral College on Monday.
Echoing Trump, Bolsonaro previously voiced concerns about alleged widespread U.S. fraud in the November vote, without citing evidence. Trump has continued to make unfounded claims about fraud and refused to concede. 
Biden's victory leaves Bolsonaro without a key diplomatic ally and further undermines his approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, whose gravity, like Trump, he has often sought to play down.
Fresh U.S. pressure to curb deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and spur global action against climate change has already caused friction with Bolsonaro, who bristled at Biden's comments along those lines during a pre-election presidential debate.

Frostier relations with Washington could ironically push Bolsonaro closer to China, some experts say. A longtime China skeptic, Bolsonaro may come to rely more on the world's No. 2 economy – Brazil's biggest trade partner – if environmental and human rights issues crimp the U.S.-Brazil trade agenda.

LONDON (Reuters) - London's theatres will shut again on Wednesday as the British capital moves into the toughest level of coronavirus restrictions, with some forced to close Christmas shows just days after they opened, in a hammer blow for the industry.
The government on Monday announced that the rate of coronavirus infections was rising exponentially in London and all hospitality and indoor entertainment would close, giving the industry two days notice.
""It's a huge blow for the casts, for the crews, for the creative teams. You know, a huge amount of money has been invested in getting these Christmas shows up and running, and now they have to close,"" said Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre. 
About 30 theatres are open in London, he said, ranging in size from small pub theatres to massive auditoriums.
After an extremely difficult year many theatres had adapted their premises and shows to be COVID safe with reduced capacity, socially distanced seating, and temperature checks at the door. Audiences felt safe, he said.
Louis Hartshorn, chief executive officer of Hartshorn-Hook Productions said: ""It's a hammer blow to an industry that's already on its knees ... we have managed to put together a production expecting that there might be some twists in the road. But actually, we're getting to the point where the reserves are exhausted.""
His company's production of The Great Gatsby reopened in October, but now faces its second shut down in two months.
Theatres all over Britain felt the same, he said.
London's theatre scene is slightly bigger than Broadway in New York, with just over 15 million attendances in 2019, according to the Society of London Theatre's box office data.
    The city's theatres saw revenue of nearly 800 million pounds last year, with the average ticket costing around 50 pounds.
    Out in London's West End theatre district on Tuesday for their likely last chance of seeing a show this year, Lisa and Carly Sandom from Essex said they were dismayed. 
""This is completely depressing. (I am) gutted for all the people that work for the theatres and the production. It's awful,"" said Carly Sandom.
Jennifer Webb, also in London to see a show, said she couldn't understand why theatres must close but shops, packed with Christmas shoppers, could remain open.

   ""Really the shops ... should be the places that are closed and the theatres, that are managing everything beautifully to get audiences in ... should be the places that are open.""

Protesters paraded near the shuttered Bastille Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) house in central Paris with dancing giant puppets, drums and trumpets to spread the word that culture is essential, including during a pandemic.
French President Emmanuel Macron had said theatres could reopen from Dec. 15, but this was scrapped because COVID-19 transmission rates were not falling fast enough. The new target date for reopening is in January.
Culture is ""part of humanity,"" said one protester, who gave his name as Maurizio, and had a 12-foot (3.6 metre) tall puppet mounted on his shoulders. ""It's a part of what defines someone.""

The move, which comes amid a slew of sanctions announced by Washington as President Donald Trump's term nears a close, designates Saraya al-Mukhtar, a marginal group operating underground, as a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist"". Most of the group's members are in jail or in Iran.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saraya al-Mukhtar, or Mukhtar Brigades, was designated for ""posing a significant risk of committing acts of terrorism that threaten the national security and foreign policy of the United States"".
""The group has plotted attacks against U.S. personnel in Bahrain and has offered cash rewards for the assassination of Bahraini officials,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
Tuesday's action freezes any of the group's U.S. assets and generally bars Americans from dealing with it.
Pompeo also accused the group of having received financial and logistical support from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which controls a business empire as well as elite armed and intelligence forces in Iran. 
The IRGC is blacklisted by Washington. 
The foreign ministry in Bahrain, which hosts the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet as a regional security bulwark against Iran, issued a statement welcoming the move as an important step ""in combating malign acts and intentions of this terrorist group"".
In 2011, members of Bahrain's Shi'ite Muslim majority staged major protests against its Sunni Muslim royal family inspired by the so-called Arab Spring of that year. The unrest was crushed with the help of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Since then, militants have carried out sporadic bombing and shooting attacks against security forces that Bahrain blames on Tehran's Shi'ite theocracy. Iran denies any involvement in Bahrain's unrest. 
A September report by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service included the Mukhtar Brigades among small underground Bahraini Shi'ite groups that the Sunni-dominated government says have been armed and advised by the IRGC as part of an effort to destabilize the country.
But, the report noted that attacks by the groups, which have mainly been aimed at security forces, ""have been sporadic and appear to have waned since 2018"".
It said the U.S. State Department international terrorism report for 2019 – the latest available – stated that there were no militant attacks in Bahrain that year.

The bill was due to be approved by Dec. 15, but it has been delayed to next year, with the Supreme Court setting a new deadline of April 30 for the law to be passed, according to local media.
Lopez Obrador said legislators requested a delay as time had run out before the current session in Congress ended this month, meaning there was not enough time to review the bill.
""The period was practically over but they are matters of form and not substance,"" Lopez Obrador said in his morning daily press conference, adding that the issues will be ""resolved"" in the next session due to start in February.
The bill, which would mark a major shift in a country bedeviled for years by violence between feuding drug cartels, easily passed the Senate in a vote last month, and would create a huge new legal market for marijuana.
Lopez Obrador's left-of-center Morena party, which backed the initiative, holds a majority in both chambers of Congress with its allies.
""It is nothing more than a matter of mistakes that were made, lack of precision on quantities and there can be no contradictions in the law itself,"" Lopez Obrador said, referring to how much cannabis citizens can possess legally.

The legislation responds to a Supreme Court order mandating that use of the drug be regulated, although the process has been subject to repeated delays, frustrating legalization advocates. Nevertheless, the legislation is ultimately expected to pass.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government has announced a tight national lockdown starting in January to fight the spread of COVID-19, in the wake of a recent spike in cases.
At a rally of entrepreneurs and representatives of small businesses on Kyiv's Independence Square, clashes between helmeted riot police and demonstrators erupted after the protesters tried to set up tents. 
""One policeman was hit on the head - and he lost consciousness. Another 40 received chemical eye burns,"" the interior ministry said in a statement. 
Three police officers were hospitalised after being attacked by a group of drunk men, police said in a separate statement. 
More than 900,000 people have contracted the novel coronavirus in Ukraine. 
The new lockdown measures, which include the closure of schools, cafes, restaurants, gyms and entertainment centres and a ban on mass gatherings, will be in force from Jan. 8 to 24.

The government last month introduced a lockdown at weekends, closing or restricting most businesses except those involved in essential services such as grocery shops, pharmacies, hospitals and transportation. It lifted the restrictions on Dec. 2.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -White House senior adviser Jared Kushner will lead a U.S. delegation to Israel and Morocco next week for discussions on the normalization deal the two Middle East countries reached last week, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.
The U.S. delegation and an Israeli team will join together and take a direct flight from Tel Aviv to Rabat as a sign of progress after the Israel-Morocco deal that Kushner helped broker, the official told Reuters.
Kushner, Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz and Adam Boehler, chief executive officer of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, will arrive in Israel on Monday.
While in Jerusalem, Kushner, who is U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, is to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the official said.
El Al is expected to be the airliner for the flight from Tel Aviv to Rabat next Tuesday for the Kushner team and a delegation led by Israeli national security adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat, the official said.
In a live interview on Israel's Army Radio, Transportation Minister Miri Regev was asked about news of the Kushner trip.
""I am so proud that our grandfathers and grandmothers can visit Morocco while still alive. This is peace,"" said Regev, who is descended from Moroccan Jewish immigrants to Israel.
Morocco is the Muslim country that produced the greatest number of Jewish immigrants to Israel - 250,000.
The Israel-Morocco deal was the fourth the United States helped broker, following similar agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan.
As part of the agreement, Trump agreed to recognize Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara, where a decades-old territorial dispute has pitted Morocco against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, a breakaway movement that seeks to establish an independent state in the territory.

Kushner and his team are still holding talks with other countries from the Arab and Muslim world and hope to seal at least one more agreement before Trump leaves office on Jan. 20 when President-elect Joe Biden is due to enter the White House.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea President Alpha Conde promised on Tuesday to tackle corruption among senior officials during his third term, with policies aimed at helping the poor in the minerals-rich nation whom he described as victims of bureaucratic neglect.
At a swearing-in ceremony in Conakry after his victory in the bitterly-contested Oct. 18 presidential election, the 82-year-old Conde said he planned to govern the West African nation of nearly 13 million people in a different way.
""During the last two mandates, I noticed that the poor anonymous people in villages were abandoned by ministers and senior civil servants,"" Conde said in a speech to the dozen assembled regional heads of state and governments.
Guinea witnessed sustained economic growth during Conde's decade in power thanks to its bauxite, iron ore, gold and diamond wealth, but few saw the benefits.
Unemployment remained high while power cuts and protests were frequent.
""We need to change our practices,"" Conde said. ""We are committed to fighting corruption. We want to govern differently. This means that ministers must put themselves at the service of the people and not their families.""
Conde added that ministers, their wives and children will have to declare their wealth while companies linked to ministers and senior civil servants will be excluded from government tenders.
Obliging relatives to file wealth declarations is a new tactic, but it is not clear if Conde has the political will to root out endemic graft which has led Guinea to rank 130th out of 180 countries on a global corruption index by watchdog Transparency International.
Conde decided to seek a third term after a constitutional reform in March allowed him to reset the clock on a presidential term limit.

His decision to run for a third term led to violent protests in which dozens of people were killed before and after the election.

In the letter, dated Dec. 14, Lopez Obrador said he hoped U.S. foreign policy in Mexico will adhere to ""non-intervention and self-determination"" principles outlined in Mexico's constitution.
The leftist leader, speaking at his daily morning press conference, also called for the two countries to work together while respecting each other's sovereignty.

On Monday, Washington imposed the sanctions targeting NATO member Turkey's Presidency of Defence Industry (SSB), its chairman and three other employees in a move Ankara called a ""grave mistake"".
In a joint declaration, four of parliament's five major political parties said U.S. relations should be based on mutual respect and said the sanctions over the S-400 Russian defences are ""not in line with the spirit of alliance"". 
""We call on the United States to turn back from this grave mistake immediately,"" the declaration said. Turkey will not ""turn back in the face of threats or sanctions"". 
The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Iyi Party, both usually bitter rivals of President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party, signed the declaration, as did the AK Party and its nationalist MHP allies. 
The pro-Kurdish HDP, the second largest opposition party, did not sign. 
The sanctions come at a delicate moment in the fraught ties between Turkey and the United States as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office.
Washington says the S-400s, which Ankara acquired from Moscow in mid-2019, pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and to NATO's broader defence systems. Turkey says they will not be integrated into NATO and therefore pose no danger.

EU migration commissioner Yiva Johansson visited Rabat this month to seek a readmission agreement allowing the 27-nation bloc to return migrants to Morocco in the face of a surge in arrivals to Spain's Canary Islands. 
The request was rejected, the Moroccan ministry said. ""Morocco is not into the logic of subcontracting and insists that each country accepts its responsibility towards its nationals,"" Moroccan migration and border control chief at the Interior Ministry Khalid Zerouali said by email. 
Morocco readmits an average of 15,000 of its own citizens who are sent home by the EU every year. It also agreed in 1992 to accept third-party nationals from the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, providing it is within 24 hours. 
Morocco has stopped 32,000 people from crossing into Europe - located as close as 14 km (9 miles) away across the Strait of Gibraltar - this year, Zerouali said. That compares to 74,000 attempts last year. 
Tighter Moroccan patrols along the northern coast and the effect of COVID-19 border closures have pushed trafficking networks to shift their routes towards the Canary Islands, 1,400 km (870 miles) off the African coast, Zerouali said. 
The number of migrants illegally reaching the Canary Islands this year - 20,000 - was 10 times larger than last year, according to Spanish authorities. Johansson said half those arrivals were thought to have come from Morocco.
Hundreds of people have died this year while making the perilous crossing to the Spanish islands in the Atlantic Ocean, often in rickety, overcrowded boats with unreliable engines, according to the International Organization for Migration.
The EU has given Morocco 343 million euros ($416.75 million) since 2018 to help it counter illegal migration.
Financial and technical support for Morocco is warranted by a ""shared responsibility between partners facing common challenges and threats"", said Zerouali.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden failed to protect elderly people during the pandemic with the high level of community spread likely the biggest factor as the coronavirus ravaged ill-prepared nursing homes, an initial report by an official commission said on Tuesday.
Sweden's pandemic strategy, shunning lockdowns and masks, has stood out internationally. It left schools, restaurants and businesses largely open while appealing to people to socially distance and maintain good hygiene.
When announced during the spring, the strategy was coupled with a goal to ""ring-fence"" the elderly from COVID-19. But as deaths mounted, above all at nursing homes, the commission was appointed to asses the response. 
In the commission's first findings, it said the overall spread and previously known structural problems within the elderly care system, for which the current and previous governments were ultimately responsible, were to blame for the many deaths.
""These shortcomings meant that elderly care was unprepared and ill-equipped to deal with a pandemic,"" the commission said in a statement. ""The employees in elderly care were largely left alone to handle the crisis situation.""
The strategy has been called reckless and cruel but also won praise from people seeing it as more sustainable and business-friendly. Just under half of Sweden's almost 7,700 deaths have been nursing home residents.
The commission also said measures by the government and governmental agencies to protect the elderly during the spring had come too late. ""We also asses that the measures were insufficient in several respects,"" it added.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has defended the overall strategy but admitted Sweden failed to shield the elderly, though stressing health and elderly care are the responsibility of regional authorities and not the central government. 

In November, Sweden's Health and Social Care Inspectorate said it had found ""serious shortcomings"" in elderly care - in only 6% of cases reviewed were nursing home COVID-19 patients given a physical examination by a doctor. 
Sweden has suffered many times more deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours, although fewer than some European countries that opted for lockdowns.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary amended the definition of family in its constitution Tuesday to allow an effective ban on adoption by same-sex couples, another win for the ruling conservatives but decried by one pro-LGBTQ group as ""a dark day for human rights"".
The nationalist Fidesz party of Prime Minister Viktor Orban has worked to recast Hungary in a more conservative mold since winning a third successive landslide in 2018, and anti-gay verbal attacks and legislation have become common.
In recent years Orban, facing a unified opposition for the first time, has doubled down on propagating his increasingly conservative ideology, deploying strong language against immigrants and Muslims who he says could upend European culture.
The new Hungarian constitution defines family as ""based on marriage and the parent-child relation. The mother is a woman, the father a man."" It also mandates that parents raise children in a conservative spirit.
""Hungary defends the right of children to identify with their birth gender and ensures their upbringing based on our nation's constitutional identity and values based on our Christian culture,"" it says.
Hungary has never allowed gay marriage but still recognises civil unions. Adoption by gay and lesbian couples was possible until now if one partner applied as a single person.
Although there are exceptions when single people or family members can adopt children, ""the main rule is that only married couples can adopt a child, that is, a man and a woman who are married,"" Justice Minister Judit Varga wrote.
The legislation passed on Tuesday follow the passing of a new law earlier this year banning gender change in personal documents and ideological battles over children's books showing diversity positively. 
Nearby Poland’s ruling nationalist PiS party also made homophobia a key plank of its campaign in an election this year, endorsing ""LGBT-free zones"" despite European Union criticism.
As per the new law, single people in Hungary must get their adoption requests approved by the family affairs minister, a post held by ultra-conservative Katalin Novak, who promotes the traditional family model.
""Do not believe that us women should continuously compete with men,"" Novak said in a video published on Monday. ""Do not believe that in every waking moment we must measure up and have at least as high positions or as large salaries as (men).""
""DARK DAY FOR HUMAN RIGHTS""
Rights groups denounced the changes and called on European leaders to raise their voices.
""This is a dark day for Hungary’s LGBTQ community and a dark day for human rights,"" said David Vig, Director of Amnesty Hungary. 
Masen Davis, Executive Director at Transgender Europe, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen should pay attention to the issue as the EU reviews Hungary's rule of law record and a connected punitive legal procedure. 
Hungary and Poland last week escaped the immediate prospect of losing EU funding because of rights transgressions seen as contrary to the European mainstream, leaving potential counter-measures weakened and delayed in time.
""We are deeply concerned for the health and safety of trans children and adults in Hungary in such a hostile climate,"" Davis said.

Katrin Hugendubel, advocacy director at international gay rights group ILGA, said the changes meant ""LGBTI children will be forced to grow up in an environment which restricts them from being able to express their identities.""

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somalia severed diplomatic relations with neighbouring Kenya on Tuesday, accusing it of meddling in politics as protests and gunfire erupted in the capital Mogadishu over delayed elections.
The dispute could undermine cooperation in the fight against the Islamist group al Shabaab in Somalia, where Kenya provides 3,600 troops to an African Union peacekeeping force.
""Somalia calls back all its diplomats from Kenya and orders Kenyan diplomats to leave Somalia within seven days,"" Somalia's Information Minister Osman Dube told the state news agency. 
Dube added in a statement read on Radio Mogadishu that Nairobi was interfering, but did not give more details. 
""This is an answer to the constant political violation and Kenya's open interference in Somalia's independence,"" he said. 
Kenya's government did not immediately respond.
Last month, Somalia expelled Nairobi's ambassador and recalled its own envoy after alleging interference in the electoral process in Jubbaland, which borders Kenya and is one of Somalia's five semi-autonomous states.
Also last year, Kenya recalled its ambassador after Mogadishu decided to auction disputed oil and gas exploration blocks at sea. Ties were restored a few months later. 
GUNFIRE 
The new diplomatic flare-up came as anti-government protests broke out in Mogadishu. Demonstrators denounced President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed - usually known by his nickname ""Farmaajo"" (cheese) - over delayed votes for both houses of parliament.
The polls were due early this month but became snagged on disagreements over the composition of the electoral board. 
The opposition accuses the government of packing it with sympathisers, which officials deny. 
""We do not want a dictator, we do not want Farmaajo,"" hundreds of protesters chanted, calling for him to quit. Some carried placards with ""Farmaajo is a curse"" written on them. 
Armed men in plain clothes guarded the protesters but soon started exchanging gunfire with police, prompting the protesters to scamper for safety. One witness Halima Farah told Reuters she saw two people injured. 

The president was chosen by parliamentarians in 2017, promising to crush al Shabaab, which is fighting to topple the government and rule according to Islamic sharia law. There was no immediate response from the government to the protests.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian investigators are pursuing the first criminal probe of current executives at commodities trading firm Trafigura on allegations they approved the bribery of employees at state-controlled oil producer Petrobras, according to three people familiar with the matter.
The investigation has focused on two of the three top Trafigura https://www.trafigura.com/about-us/leadership directors, Co-head of Oil Trading Jose Larocca and Chief Operating Officer Mike Wainwright. The criminal probe is advancing alongside a civil lawsuit against the same executives and others disclosed this month, the people said. 
Brazilian investigators have also shared findings with U.S. prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the case is classified. 
The decision to pursue both civil and criminal cases shows Brazilian prosecutors are emboldened by the $164 million settlement with oil trader Vitol in a separate bribery case. Vitol Inc will pay the U.S. and Brazil to settle claims it paid more than $8 million in bribes to win contracts at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state firm is formally called.
Neither Larocca nor Wainwright have been charged. 
The two did not reply to requests for comment. Trafigura said ""any suggestion that Trafigura's current management authorized or had knowledge of improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct.""
The two probes have been advanced by information provided by Trafigura's former board member and Brazil chief, Mariano Ferraz, who admitted paying bribes for more than a decade and in May signed a cooperation agreement. U.S. investigators interviewed Ferraz earlier this year, sources said. 
Ferraz told prosecutors that Larocca and Wainwright approved bribes to win hundreds of fuel oil contracts, according to court documents unsealed this month. Ferraz agreed to cooperate in exchange for reduced penalties. 
The evidence includes hundreds of pages of bank records and e-mails seized from people who are collaborating with authorities. In some of them, Ferraz and others used code names to hide identities. 
A former Petrobras trader who went by the code name ""Phil Collins"" in 2011 sent a message to a middleman called ""Tiger"" with an attachment for tallying the bribes. In the message, Ferraz - who was arrested in 2016 and sentenced to 10 years in jail in 2018 https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-corruption-ferraz/brazil-judge-sentences-decal-do-brasil-executive-to-over-10-years-idUSKBN1GH32U - is referred to as ""the Prince"". 
The middleman and former trader are cooperating with authorities in Brazil and in the United States, according to court documents. 
CIVIL SUIT 
In Brazil, prosecutors can investigate corporate crime but can only bring criminal charges against individuals. Companies are subject to administrative sanctions in civil lawsuits, which can include fines and bans from doing business with state firms. 
Authorities have accelerated their work in recent months after a slowdown during the first months of the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has opened investigations against transactions involving commodities traders Vitol, Cockett and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY). 
In the lawsuit filed earlier this month against Trafigura, prosecutors accused the trading firm of bribing Petrobras employees in 31 fuel oil transactions between May 2012 to October 2013. The suit seeks more than 400 million reais ($77 million) from the company, pending a judge's decision.
Former Petrobras fuel oil trader Rodrigo Berkowitz, who provided evidence to prosecutors probing Trafigura, was also at the center of the U.S. case against Vitol. Berkowitz was unavailable for comment, according to his attorney. 
Earlier this month, prosecutors used the confession by Ferraz to back a request seeking to freeze 1 billion reais in assets from individuals in the Trafigura case. Those individuals include the heirs of Claude Dauphin, the late founder of Trafigura who Ferraz said knew about and approved the bribe payments. 
On Dec. 9, Trafigura said it had acquired the Dauphin family's stake in the company after reporting record earnings in 2020, boosted by pandemic-related volatility and consolidation in the sector.

But one wish unites all Santas, from Lebanon to Nigeria, in this year decimated by the coronavirus pandemic.
(Click https://reut.rs/3ni6SZ6 to see a picture package of Santas around the world.)
""My Christmas message to the world is to be kinder to everyone in a time when we are so isolated,"" said Oliver Levi-Malouf, 22, who performs as a drag queen Santa at The Imperial Hotel in Sydney, with strikingly red lips and dramatic winged eye makeup.
Levi-Malouf puts on a Santa event for youth around Christmas time at the hotel, giving out colourful presents such as a feathered fascinator in the shape of a bird. 
""Breathe, simply breathe,"" is the advice of Dana Friedman, who has been a Santa since wanting to hearten first responders and their families after the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York. 
Friedman, 61, who is an attorney, urges people take time this year to appreciate the beauty and good in the world. ""While you're at it, do something nice for a total stranger,"" he said. ""But don't let them know you did it ... Let them pay it forward in their own way.""
Japanese mambo musician Paradise Yamamoto has been a Santa for 23 years, and takes an annual certification test he says is no walk in the park. ""I was tested on how quickly I ate ginger biscuits, climbed chimneys, and laughed merrily with a good 'Ho, ho, ho',"" he said. 
Yamamoto wants to reassure children that Santa is still coming to their houses this Christmas. ""I've never heard of a Christmas where Santa Claus didn't appear,"" said the 58-year-old, who also owns a gyoza restaurant, where he works as a chef. 
""I might try to get in your houses through a different route from usual, but I will most certainly visit everyone's homes – after, of course, washing my hands, gargling, disinfecting the soles of my shoes, and taking the proper measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus."" 
Children excited to see Santa had better take note of the warning from Mexican actor and director of children's theatre Alejandro Zelayaran, though.
""I will not visit children who do not respect their mother and father, who have not taken care of themselves during COVID and who have pulled practical jokes on their teachers during virtual classes,"" he said. 
Zelayaran, who will don a face shield when he distributes dolls and other gifts at an orphanage in Mexico City, also emphasises the importance of family. ""Faith and hope must move the hearts of humanity,"" said the 43-year-old. 
""I want to see families taking care of each other and knowing that even from afar, love and hope always survive.""
Limachem Cherem, 64, who runs a school for Santas in Rio de Janeiro, will be spending more time in a studio this month, raising children' spirits with recorded messages and live video chats. 
He, too, encourages people reach out to each other. 

""Get on the phone, send messages, it doesn't cost much with the internet,"" said the jovial man with a big beard. ""Since we can't hug in person, send a message of peace to a friend. He needs it, while he is at home.""

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Siyar Guldiken, still short of breath from his own battle with the coronavirus, was not able to grieve after his grandmother and uncle died of the related disease, as one of the world's worst second waves of the pandemic slammed Turkey.
After 10 days in isolation in Diyarbakir last month, Guldiken said only a full lockdown could stop the pandemic from worsening in Turkey, which has registered the seventh most cases globally.
Ankara has resisted such calls so far.
But pressure for more stringent action is growing from medical bodies, opposition parties and Istanbul's mayor, after daily cases jumped to more than 30,000 and deaths to 200, even as the country prepares for a vaccine to arrive shortly.
President Tayyip Erdogan's government has issued weekend stay-at-home orders to tackle the pandemic, and it plans a five-day lockdown over New Year.
""The measures are really inadequate,"" said Guldiken, 42, local head of a health and social services union in southeast Turkey's largest city. ""I can comfortably say for Diyarbakir, numbers will rise,"" he added, as he looked at photos of his late grandmother and uncle.
He said full lockdowns would have prevented deaths such as that of his uncle, who died five days before his test results came back positive. His mother recovered from the disease after two weeks in hospital, but his youngest uncle lost both his parents to it.
""We couldn't live and share our grief as much as we wanted to,"" he told Reuters. ""This stemmed from the insufficiency of the measures.""
The government has defended the measures it has taken, saying they have started to slow the spread of infection, with daily cases falling several thousand from their peak to below 30,000. But it has also said economic activity must be sustained.

At the other end of Turkey, in Istanbul, the head of the city's cemeteries department, Ayhan Koc, said its planning had to be adjusted as the death rate leaped to more than 400 a day in November - around double the level in previous years.
It is a statistic cited by Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in demanding drastic measures to protect the city of 16 million people, alongside steps to support workers concerned about the economic impact of a lockdown.
""Let's shut down for 2-3 weeks,"" he urged the central government at a memorial ceremony last week for a doctor who died of COVID-19. ""I beg them, please take measures. Let's fight with all we have.""
Hospitals are struggling to meet demand for treatment and thousands of municipal employees are infected, Imamoglu said.
Turkey only began reporting all cases, including asymptomatic ones, in late November. It waited until last week to give the pandemic's full tally of nearly 1.9 million, on a par with Britain and Italy. 
Erdogan said late on Monday that distribution of China's Sinovac vaccine would begin soon, while there were hopes to roll out a domestic vaccine in the spring.
But spotty public disclosure could impede the vaccine rollout, said Turkish Medical Association head Sebnem Korur Fincanci.
""Many people do not trust the government and they are against the vaccination because of this loss of trust,"" she said, adding lockdown measures must complement inoculations.
""Vaccination is not enough. Also we have to lock down and decrease the speed of the transmission. Then vaccination would be helpful and effective.""
Current weekend curfews are not enough while workplaces remain open all week, she said.
Playing with his young children in a park in Diyarbakir, Guldiken said stricter measures were needed despite the psychological impact of isolation and grieving.

""Sharing this process (grieving) is very important, but unfortunately we can't if we are to prevent the spread of the virus.""

1132,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>",Sanctioned Turkish defence industry chief expects U.S. ties to survive,"By Daren Butler and Dominic Evans
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's defence industries chief said U.S. sanctions on him and his agency for buying Russian missile systems would not have a big impact on ties and may boost domestic development, though the defence minister said the move had ""shaken"" their alliance.
The sanctions, announced at a delicate moment in the fraught relations between the two NATO partners as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office, could affect contracts worth $1.5 billion to $2.3 billion, around 5% of U.S.-Turkish trade. 
Ankara has condemned the measures as a grave mistake, but the lira firmed after their announcement, having been pressured for more than a year by the prospect of U.S. punishment for Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 air defences.
The sanctions avoided targeting Turkey's economy generally, focusing on its arms procurement and development body Defence Industries Directorate (SSB), its chairman Ismail Demir, his deputy and two officials responsible for air defence systems.
They do not cancel existing contracts or prevent either side procuring vital defence needs - including parts for the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter still being produced in Turkey, or spare parts for Turkey's F-16 jets. 
""We expect this will not influence our relations much,"" SSB head Demir said on Tuesday. ""We are NATO allies. As they themselves said, there is cooperation with Turkey in many areas. We and they expect this to continue,"" he said in comments broadcast by state-owned Anadolu news agency.
The so-called U.S. CAATSA sanctions, designed to deter any country from agreeing military deals with Russia, also restrict U.S. loans and credits to SSB, although that is not seen having a significant impact.
""We will find remedies for this in our own circles. From our point of view, the issue of developing domestic industry will continue, maybe more quickly,"" Demir said.
SANCTIONS ""UNJUST""
While Demir played down the sanctions, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said they had damaged relations and called for renewed cooperation between the two allies.
""This sanctions decision has shaken all values in our countries' alliance,"" Akar said.
President Tayyip Erdogan had earlier said it was upsetting that Washington had taken the step and Turkey's foreign ministry described the decision as inexplicable and unjust.
The sanctions ""will inevitably negatively impact our relations, and (Turkey) will retaliate in a manner and time it sees appropriate,"" the ministry said.
Monday's move was the first time the United States deployed CAATSA legislation against a NATO partner, and comes as Washington seeks to discourage other countries including its Middle East ally Egypt from buying Russian military equipment.
Russian media have reported that Cairo signed a $2 billion deal with Moscow to buy more than 20 Sukhoi SU-35 fighter jets.
Ankara acquired the Russian S-400 ground-to-air defences in July last year and says they pose no threat to NATO allies.

On Monday, Washington imposed the sanctions targeting Turkey's Presidency of Defence Industry (SSB), its chairman and three other employees.
""This sanctions decision has shaken all values in our countries' alliance,"" Akar said. ""Returning to cooperation and solidarity with the United States ... will provide an important contribution to regional and global peace and security.""

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 07:01AM ET</span>","Ten years on, anger grows in Tunisian town where 'Arab Spring' began","By Angus McDowall and Tarek Amara
SIDI BOUZID, Tunisia (Reuters) - Ten years ago, a fruit seller set himself ablaze in the central Tunisian town of Sidi Bouzid after an altercation with a policewoman about where he had put his cart.
Word of Mohammed Bouazizi's fatal act of defiance quickly spread, sparking nationwide protests that eventually toppled Tunisia's long-serving leader and helped inspire similar uprisings across the region - the so-called ""Arab Spring"".
Huge demonstrations broke out in Egypt and Bahrain, governments fell and civil war engulfed Libya, Syria and Yemen.
Tunisians are now free to choose their leaders and can publicly criticise the state. Yet for all the chaos they have been through, many people look back on the events of 2010 and regret that their dreams remain unfulfilled.
""Something went wrong in the revolution,"" said Attia Athmouni, a retired philosophy teacher who helped lead the uprising after Bouazizi's death by standing on the fruit seller's abandoned cart to address the crowd the night he died.
Protests have flared again in recent weeks across Tunisia's poorer southern towns against joblessness, poor state services, inequality and shortages.
The scramble to get enough cooking gas to provide for families underlines the hardships ordinary people face in a country where the economy has stagnated, leaving the public as angry as it was a decade ago.
Near Sidi Bouzid last week, a crowd placed large stones across the tarmac to block a main road. They wanted trucks taking cooking gas cylinders to the town to offload them in their village instead.
Supplies have been in short supply in Tunisia since people living near the main state-run factory producing the gas closed the plant several weeks ago to demand more local jobs. 
Outside the main outlet for cooking gas in Sidi Bouzid, three riot police vans guarded the gate as hundreds of people waited to get their hands on full cylinders.
A woman at the front of the crowd said she had had no gas for three days and her family had been eating only cold food. She had queued for six and a half hours.
REVOLUTION 
Bigger demonstrations may take place in Tunisia on Thursday, the anniversary of Bouazizi's self-immolation after his fruit cart was confiscated when he refused to move off an unlicensed pitch.
Slimane Rouissi, another Sidi Bouzid activist and former teacher who knew Bouazizi's family, said the young man had endured a string of disappointments before the final confrontation.
He drenched himself in petrol and killed himself in front of the local governorate office. 
When Athmouni, the retired teacher, heard about the incident, he dismissed his class and told his students to start protesting.
That night, as hundreds of people gathered outside the governorate and chanted slogans, he heard the words ""the people want the fall of the regime"" - soon to be the catch phrase of Tunisia's revolution - for the first time.
Over the coming weeks the protests grew. By January, 2011, thousands were marching in Tunis and President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, in power for 23 years, realised the game was up. He fled to Saudi Arabia where he died in exile last year.
Tunisia's revolution spread. In Egypt the crowds forced Hosni Mubarak from power after 30 years as president. Uprisings shook Libya, Syria, Bahrain and Yemen.
Hope for a new democratic future soon turned to bloodshed, particularly in Syria, Yemen and Libya, where civil wars pulled in major powers fearful their regional foes would gain an advantage.
Though Tunisia's path to democracy has been far smoother, its economy has deteriorated and political leaders appear paralysed.
Last year's election delivered a bitterly fragmented parliament unable to produce a stable government, with parties bickering over cabinet seats and putting off big decisions. 
More Tunisians are trying illegally to leave the country than ever, while visions of jihad lure alienated, jobless youth. Both dynamics were evident in the recent attack in Nice by a young Tunisian migrant who killed three people in a church.
""There is a rupture between the politicians and the people now because the system cannot understand the demands of the street,"" Athmouni said bitterly in a Sidi Bouzid cafe full of unemployed young men. 
NO INVESTMENT
In the streets near Bouazizi's old home - a shabby single-storey building behind a dented metal gate - a group of young men stood chatting on a street corner.
Sabri Amri, 26, laughed when asked if he had voted in any of Tunisia's post-revolution elections. All he and his group of friends want is to emigrate, he said. There is no work and young people spend their time drinking or taking drugs, he added.
""We have geniuses here - doctors, engineers. I know a guy who is a mechanical engineer. What does he do now? He sells weed just to live,"" said Abdullah Gammoudi, a qualified sports teacher who does not have a job.
In Sidi Bouzid, the only tangible signs of investment since 2011 are a new building outside town to replace the governorate headquarters where Bouazizi died, and his memorial - a stone fruit cart scrawled with graffiti saying: ""The people want...""
Mohammed Bouali, 37, stood behind the government offices off Sidi Bouzid's main road, his cart full of oranges, apples and bananas. He and Bouazizi used to work on the same street.
Though his work - weighing out fruit for customers with a small hand-held scale - does not make enough to support his two children, he has few other options.
""The government won't provide anything,"" he said. 
The policewoman who confiscated Bouazizi's cart 10 years ago still patrols the same streets, moving unlicensed vendors from their pitches.
Athmouni believes the answer is more protests. Mass uprisings in Algeria and Sudan ousted entrenched leaders there only last year.

""I'm convinced the revolution is continuous,"" he said. ""This year the anger is bigger than in the past.""

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - The Croat and Muslim Bosniak members of Bosnia's inter-ethnic three-man presidency declined on Tuesday to meet Russia's visiting Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, saying he had shown disrespect towards their state.
Lavrov, whose nation is a champion of Serbian interests in Bosnia and the wider Balkans, met the Serb member of the presidency Milorad Dodik on Monday and again on Tuesday.
Croat presidency member Zeljko Komsic said the first meeting, in the Serb Republic's government office just outside the capital Sarajevo, was insulting as no national flag was on display despite the Russian being on an official visit. 
""Mr. Lavrov, as one of the worlds' three top diplomats ... is sending us a message ... which we interpret as disrespectful and a denial of the state he is visiting,"" Komsic told reporters.
He and Bosniak Muslim presidency member Sefik Dzaferovic did not attend a planned meeting with Lavrov at the presidency building in Sarajevo, where the Russian met Dodik again. 
Komsic said that Lavrov, who on Monday backed the Serb Republic parliament's resolution on military neutrality, knew a regional legislature cannot decide such strategic policy. 
""We are aware that we are small and weak, but we are not ready to be a hostage in any kind of games by Russia when it comes to their relations with the European Union and NATO members,"" Komsic said.
Lavrov made no comments on the failed meeting at a press conference later with Bosnia's Foreign Minister Bisera Turkovic. The two signed agreements on future cooperation.
But Lavrov did stress: ""Russia confirms its principled and strong support for Bosnia's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and equality of all of its constituent peoples"".
The Russian echoed a long-time request by Bosnian Serbs to shut an international peace overseer's office, set up as part of the U.S.-brokered Dayton pact to end Bosnia's war 25 years ago.

Under the deal, Bosnia was split into two autonomous regions, the Serb-dominated Serb Republic and the Federation shared by Bosniaks and Croats, which are linked via a weak central government.

1136,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 06:41AM ET</span>",Philippine journalist Maria Ressa says new libel case 'ludicrous',"MANILA (Reuters) - Maria Ressa, who heads a Philippine news website known for its tough scrutiny of President Rodrigo Duterte, refused to enter a plea on Tuesday in a second cyber libel case she faces, saying the charges against her were ludicrous.
Ressa, a Time Magazine Person of the Year in 2018, has faced a series of lawsuits that she says amount to intimidation against her and other journalists in a country previously known for upholding press freedom.
""I will take this all the way to the end, and we will win it, because it's ludicrous,"" Ressa, CEO of news site Rappler (www.rappler.com), told reporters outside the court in Manila.
Ressa's counsel, Theodore Te, said they had agreed to a conditional arraignment while waiting for a decision on a motion to quash the charges.
Businessman Wilfredo Keng had filed a new cyber libel case against Ressa, accusing her of sharing screenshots of a 2002 article linking him to a criminal report. Keng's lawyers did not talk to reporters after the hearing.
In June, Ressa was convicted of libel over a 2012 article that linked Keng to illegal activities. She faces up to six year in jail but is appealing the ruling.
Ressa is also facing several other cases, including tax offences and violation of foreign-ownership rules in media.
She has said the cases are a form of harassment due to her news site's critical reports on Duterte's bloody war on drugs, during which more than 5,900 suspected drug dealers and users have been killed in anti-narcotics operations.
Duterte has lambasted media agencies for critical reporting on alleged rights abuses in the campaign.
In July, lawmakers allied with the president blocked the application of media conglomerate ABS-CBN Corp, which has also angered Duterte, for a congressional franchise renewal.

As a result, the country's biggest broadcaster closed radio stations, shut down provincial offices and laid off thousands of workers.

1138,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 06:17AM ET</span>","After 60 years, East Jerusalem Palestinians face eviction under Israeli settler rulings","By Suheir Sheikh and Rami Ayyub
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - For Nabil al-Kurd, being forced out of the East Jerusalem home he has lived in since the 1950s would be a fate worse than death.
But the 76-year-old and his wife and children are among dozens of Palestinians under threat of eviction from two districts of the disputed city, after an Israeli court ruled their properties are built on land belonging to Jewish settlers.
""This is my motherland. All my memories are in this house,"" Kurd told Reuters. ""I won't leave unless it is to the cemetery."" 
The ownership claims against him and others in Sheikh Jarrah and a second neighbourhood, Batan al-Hawa, are a focal point of settler development plans in East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in a war in 1967. 
Kurd was ordered evicted in October, within 30 days. 
He has appealed to the Jerusalem District court, though Hagit Ofran, project coordinator for Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now, says he has little chance of overturning the ruling. 
That same court has this year upheld several settler claims, based on 19th- and early 20th-century documents, drawing censure from the European Union, whose representative in Jerusalem says 77 Palestinians are at risk of forced transfer. 
CITY AT THE HEART OF CONFLICT
The status of Jerusalem, a city holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians, is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Palestinians want the capital of their would-be state to be East Jerusalem, and most countries regard settlements that Israel has built there as illegal. 
Israel disputes this, citing biblical and historical links to the territory, as well as security needs and legal arguments.
Many of the Palestinians facing eviction were refugees like Kurd or their descendants, who came to the area more than half a century ago, Peace Now said. 
The settlers in Kurd's case bought the land from two Jewish associations that claimed to have purchased it at the end of the 19th century, the group said. 
A lawyer who represented the settlers claiming Kurd's property declined to speak with Reuters.
Peace Now says some 14 families have been evicted from Batan al-Hawa since 2015 and 16 from Sheikh Jarrah since the late 1990s in such cases.
Evictions are typically stayed while appeals are heard, and some of the residents have appealed their cases to Israel's Supreme Court, but Kurd's family is taking no chances.
""My family has prepared luggage of the important things we need so that if they come in any second, we will be ready,"" said daughter Muna al-Kurd.

""...We have a camera at the house, four cameras that show the street, and dad stays up until two to three in the morning just watching if they are coming to evacuate us.""

LOS ANGELES/MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - After spending eight months of 2019 in a makeshift tent camp in the dangerous Mexican border city of Matamoros, Israel Martinez abandoned his hopes of seeking asylum in the United States.
Beaten down by the cold and unsanitary conditions in the encampment, Martinez accepted a free flight back to his homeland of Honduras in January 2020. 
Last month, his house was severely damaged by flooding during back-to-back hurricanes. And in January, U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who has promised to relax some immigration restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border, takes power. Those factors have prompted Martinez and others to start making plans to return.
Thousands of newly hopeful migrants in Central America have recently joined WhatsApp and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) groups dedicated to organizing northbound caravans, slated to begin leaving the region in the coming weeks. Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration is a frequent topic. ""Remember, Trump leaves on the 20th,"" one person wrote in a group planning to leave Honduras on Jan. 15. ""If people arrive before then, they'll have problems."" 
U.S. border officials and shelter directors along the border are concerned about the effects of a major surge in migration in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, as is the Biden transition team, people familiar with the team's discussions said.
A new wave of migrants could create an early crisis for the incoming administration as it seeks to fulfill campaign promises to roll back the harsh policies of U.S. President Donald Trump, while still deterring unregulated travel across the southern border.
Reuters spoke with seven shelter organizations, including three of the country's largest, in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. Many said they wanted Trump's policies to be reversed as quickly and safely as possible, but feared pandemic-related factors - including reduced shelter capacity, fewer volunteers and medical workers, a lack of government testing of migrants, and fewer donations - would make it difficult for them to cope with a surge without additional resources.
The Biden campaign website says the new administration will ""dramatically increase U.S. government resources to support migrants awaiting assessment of their asylum claims and to the organizations providing for their needs.""
The Biden transition team has been meeting with advocates to listen to suggestions for how to cope with a surge, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. Migrant advocates interviewed by Reuters said they have yet to receive concrete commitments from incoming officials.
Biden has promised ""on day one"" of his administration to end the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, the controversial Trump program implemented in 2019 that forced Martinez and tens of thousands of other asylum seekers to wait in Mexico pending U.S. immigration court hearings.
The Biden transition has not yet said if it plans to repeal a separate COVID-19-related order put in place by the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March that allows U.S. authorities to quickly expel almost all border crossers.
On a call with reporters on Monday, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Acting Commissioner Mark Morgan said immediately reversing Trump's policies on the border would lead to a ""full-blown crisis in a couple of weeks.""
Three people familiar with discussions among Biden transition officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the team recognizes the importance of implementing an orderly process to dismantle MPP to avoid any rush to the border and said unraveling the program will take time. 
Another person familiar with the issue said public health concerns regarding the coronavirus will be a key factor in planning how fast to proceed. 
VOLUNTEERS 'DRAMATICALLY REDUCED'
El Paso, Texas-based Annunciation House, one of the country's largest shelter organizations, took in around 150,000 people from U.S. immigration authorities in fiscal year 2019, director Ruben Garcia said. As many as 1,000 people arrived at its facilities each day during peak times that spring, he said, requiring a ""Herculean effort"" to respond.
Annunciation House mobilized thousands of volunteers and enlisted churches as makeshift shelters and rented hotel rooms in blocks. Now, Garcia said, ""We're running into the reality that people are saying, 'Ruben, in this pandemic, there's just a lot of people who aren't going to want to help.'"" He is facing reluctance from overflow spaces while his own shelters have reduced capacity due to the virus.
Many of Annunciation House's short-term volunteers are older retirees who are more vulnerable to the coronavirus. At the same time, as the pandemic has hurt jobs and incomes, donations have dropped off. The organization does not receive government support for its work.
Teresa Cavendish, director of the Casa Alitas program that runs a large shelter in Tucson, Arizona, said COVID-19 had ""dramatically reduced"" the organization's active roster of 400 volunteers and 150 medical providers because many are vulnerable to the coronavirus, or now have other commitments.
For example, the shelter's main doctor is now running a COVID-19 ward in a Tucson hospital, she said. The organization has also seen financial donations drop by 75-80%.
Michael Smith, director of The Holding Institute in Laredo, Texas, which helps migrants as well as the local community, said his shelter had lost many volunteers and been forced to introduce new pandemic-related restrictions that have halved its bed capacity.
Donations have also fallen because ""in Zoom church, you can't pass the plate,"" he said. He has cut weekly community food distributions from 30 pounds to 25 per household in an effort to stretch resources, and is now shopping online for ""backup plan"" camping tents in case arriving migrants need to sleep outside.
'NOWHERE TO LIVE'
Garcia, the Annunciation House director, said he wished migrants would ""stay put"" for a few months as the coronavirus vaccine is rolled out. ""It's going to add an element of manageability that is going to be desperately needed,"" he said.
But back in Central America, migrants like Israel Martinez say they cannot wait.
""Look at how sad this is,"" Martinez said in a video shot on his cellphone for Reuters as he waded through the streets of his San Pedro Sula neighborhood, still filled with ankle-deep water more than two weeks after the second hurricane made landfall.
The first time he left Honduras, Martinez said, he was fleeing threats from a ruling party politician, who had threatened to jail him for working for the opposition. 
Now, with his neighborhood in ruins and shelters for storm victims at capacity, his reasons are simpler.

""I have nowhere to live,"" he said in a phone call from an elementary school where he is sleeping with his wife and their six children, aged six to 21. The family is planning to leave for the United States in the first week of January, just before Biden takes office.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 05:22AM ET</span>",South Korea bans anti-North leaflets; defector says he won't stop,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Monday banned the launching of propaganda leaflets into North Korea, drawing the criticism of rights activists and defiance from a prominent North Korean defector who said he would not stop sending messages to his homeland.
Defectors and other campaigners in South Korea have for decades sent anti-North Korean leaflets over the tightly guarded border, usually by balloon or in bottles on border rivers. They also send food, medicine, money, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean news and dramas.
Isolated North Korea has long denounced the practice and recently stepped up its condemnation of it, to the alarm of a South Korean government intent on improving ties on the divided peninsula.
The South Korean parliament voted on Monday to amend the Development of Inter-Korean Relations Act to bar any scattering of printed materials, goods, money and other items of value across the heavily fortified frontier. 
It also restricts loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts, which the South's military once championed as part of psychological warfare against the North until it withdrew the equipment following a 2018 summit between the two Koreas.
The ban will take effect in three months and violators face up to three years in prison or 30 million won ($27,400) in fines. 
The change was approved despite efforts by opposition lawmakers to block the super-majority of the ruling party of President Moon Jae-in, who is keen to improve cross-border ties. 
CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE
The bill was introduced in June after Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said South Korea should ban the leaflets or face the ""worst phase"" of relations. 
""They're trying to put Kim Yo Jong's order into law at her single word,"" Tae Yong-ho, an opposition lawmaker and former North Korean diplomat, said in a 10-hour filibuster speech, adding the bill would only help Kim's government continue ""enslaving"" its people. 
Park Sang-hak, a defector who has already been stripped of a license for his leaflet-launching group and faces a prosecution investigation, said he would not give up his 15-year campaign. 
""I'll keep sending leaflets to tell the truth because North Koreans have the right to know,"" he told Reuters. ""I'm not afraid of being jailed"". 
Park and some other 20 rights groups in South Korea vowed to challenge the law's constitutionality, while Human Rights Watch called the ban a ""misguided strategy"" by South Korea to win Kim's favour.
""It criminalises sending remittances to families in North Korea and denies their rights to outside information,"" said Shin Hee-seok of the Transitional Justice Working Group.
""Such appeasement efforts only risk inviting further North Korean provocations and demands."" 
Chris Smith, a U.S. Republican congressman co-chairing a bipartisan human rights commission, issued a statement criticising the amendment as ""ill-conceived, frightening"" for facilitating the imprisonment of people for simply sharing information. 
When asked about Smith's statement, South Korean's Unification Ministry, which handles ties with North Korea, said the bill was a ""minimal effort to protect the lives and safety of residents in border regions"".

1142,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>","Amid pandemic, Jakarta burials 61% higher in first 10 months of 2020","JAKARTA (Reuters) - Burials in the Indonesian capital were 61% higher in the first 10 months of 2020 than in the past five years, according to a new study that could suggest Indonesia's real coronavirus death toll is far higher than official data shows.
The study by the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, analysed government records that showed there were more than 16,000 burials between January and October in Jakarta than the average for 2015-19 – about a half of which were suspected or diagnosed as due to COVID-19.
The Eijkman-Oxford study, led by biostatistician Dr. Iqbal Elyazar noted that ""burial records indicated substantially increased mortality associated with the onset of and ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Jakarta"". 
""After almost 10 months, the scale of pandemic is getting worse and more serious as seen from the burials data,"" noted Dr Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist from Australia's Griffith University, referring to the new study.
Public health experts in the world's fourth-most populous country have long questioned the accuracy of the official statistics, particularly given that Indonesia has one of the world's lowest rates of coronavirus testing for population size.
The paper also noted the ""shortfall in testing capacity likely comes with very significant underreporting of infection and its consequences"" with some patients dying before being tested, or testing returning false negative results. 
Jakarta, a sprawling metropolis that is home to more than 10 million people, has officially recorded more than 154,000 cases of the coronavirus as of Dec. 14, with 2,963 deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. 
A further 5,109 people were classified as 'probable' COVID-19 deaths – those presenting with severe coronavirus symptoms but who died before tests confirmed it – a figure 58% higher than official deaths. 
In April, Reuters reported that a 40% spike in burial data this March indicated that deaths from COVID-19 in the Indonesian capital were likely far higher than officially reported.
Indonesia's COVID-19 national taskforce and Jakarta taskforce were not immediately available for comment on the study's findings. 
Indonesia recorded its first case of SARS-CoV-2 in early March, but the Eijkman paper showed that deaths began to surge in January, two months earlier, with the virus likely circulating in Jakarta in December 2019.
A year on, Indonesia has recorded more than 623,000 cases and almost 19,000 deaths, by far the most severe outbreak in Southeast Asia and one that has shown little sign of abating, with the country continuing to regularly report daily record high deaths and cases.

Based on data compiled by KawalCovid-19, an independent data initiative, as of Dec. 13 there were 8,541 probable COVID-19 deaths nationally, an indication the true death toll could be 38% higher based on the group's findings.

Malka Leifer has fought her return to Australia, including with a submission of mental illness, dragging the case on through Israeli courts since 2014. 
Leifer, who was the principal of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish school in Melbourne, has denied the allegations against her.
Wanted by Australian police on 74 sexual assault charges, including rape, involving girls at her former school, Leifer, who also holds Israeli citizenship, fled Australia in 2008 after the accusations surfaced.
Australia has pressed Israel to expedite Leifer’s case, and her alleged victims have criticised the lengthy Israeli judicial proceedings.
In September, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that Leifer could be extradited on the basis of a series of psychiatric examinations that found she had faked mental illness.
Leifer then lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court, which upheld the lower court's decision, according to a ruling distributed by the Justice Ministry.
Israel's justice minister said after she lost the appeal that he would sign an extradition order without delay.
Leifer can lodge another appeal with the Supreme Court against the justice minister's extradition approval once it is given, but in its decision on Tuesday, it signalled it might not be receptive to another legal challenge.
""With this ruling...the declaration of the appellant as eligible for extradition receives final validation,"" the Supreme Court said, according to the ruling distributed by the Justice Ministry.
""Extradition agreements signed by Israel for international cooperation in eradicating crime should be honoured,"" the court added. ""Those who think they can escape justice should know they won't find sanctuary in Israel.""

The constitutional court had ruled in October against some anti-corruption laws, citing as excessive the punishment for false information on officials' asset declarations. It also struck down some powers of the NAZK agency which is responsible for checking the asset declarations. 
The decision hobbled a $5 billion IMF deal that was already mired in concerns about Ukraine's reform momentum and the independence of the central bank.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had warned the country could slide into ""bloody chaos"" and be stripped of its prized visa-free access to European Union countries if anti-corruption reforms were not restored. 
Ukraine's economy is expected to contract by 5% this year, dragged into recession by the coronavirus pandemic. Cases have spiked since September and the government announced it would introduce a stricter national lockdown in early January.

Parliament on Dec. 4 approved a draft law to restore accountability for false asset declarations by officials, though some lawmakers criticised the legislation as ineffective.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin on Tuesday passed an important test of his parliamentary support after a narrow majority of lawmakers approved his 2021 budget at the final stage amid a challenge by the opposition.
The result could signal firmer footing for Muhyiddin, whose eight months in office have been beset by infighting in his ruling coalition and a leadership challenge from opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, just as the country grapples with the economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Parliament voted 111-108 to approve next year's budget, a record 322.5 billion ringgit ($79.61 billion) of spending aimed at spurring economic activity.
The benchmark KLSE closed 0.68% higher after the budget vote, while the ringgit was little moved.
Muhyiddin had also avoided a potential political crisis last month, after the opposition backed down from a plan to vote down the budget at the end of the policy stage debate.
A defeat would have been signalled a loss of confidence in Muhyiddin's leadership, possibly triggering snap polls.
Tuesday's vote also dents Anwar's bid for the premiership, after he declared in September he had secured a strong majority in parliament to form a government and replace Muhyiddin.
Two opposition sources on Monday said Anwar believed he had secured 113 lawmakers to defeat the budget at the final stage, including up to 10 members from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) former ruling party led by party president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and former premier Najib Razak.
Anwar and Najib's offices declined to comment, while Ahmad Zahid's representative did not have any immediate comment.
Anwar has for months been rumoured to be holding talks with UMNO leaders, but Tuesday's failure to defeat the budget means he will need to rethink his strategy, some analysts said.
""It's clear now Muhyiddin won't be removed through parliament. Anwar working with UMNO to be made prime minister is not an option,"" said Adib Zalkapli, Malaysia director with political risk consultancy BowerGroupAsia.

Takahiro Shiraishi, 30, was found guilty of murdering, dismembering and storing the bodies of the nine in his apartment in Zama city in Kanagawa, on the outskirts of Tokyo, the report said.
In court the prosecution argued Shiraishi made contact with victims via Twitter after they expressed suicidal thoughts, the Jiji news agency reported. Using a handle which loosely translates as ""hangman"", Shiraishi invited them to his apartment in Zama, promising to help them die, Jiji said, citing the indictment.
Shiraishi's defence lawyers argued Shiraishi killed the victims with their approval, Kyodo said.
Presiding Judge Naokuni Yano ruled the victims did not consent to being killed, and that Shiraishi was mentally fit to be held responsible for their murders. 
Twitter Japan was not immediately available for comment.
According to the indictment, Shiraishi strangled and dismembered eight women and one man aged 15 to 26 from August to October 2017, Kyodo said. He was also alleged to have sexually assaulted all his female victims, the report added.
Shiraishi said before the trial that even if given the death penalty he would not appeal, according to Japanese media.
In Japan the death penalty is executed by hanging, with execution dates not made public until after the penalty is carried out.

Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is forbidden"" in the local Hausa language, has waged an insurgency in the northeast of Nigeria since 2009 but has not previously claimed any attacks over to the northwest. 
The man purporting to be the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau, offered no proof for the claim. Reuters was unable to verify the audio and Nigerian authorities did not immediately comment.
In a region where criminal gangs often rob and kidnap civilians for ransom, gunmen took the boys from the Government Science school in Kankara town on Friday. Katsina state authorities say some managed to escape but around 320 were still missing.
""We are behind what happened in Katsina,"" said the man in the audio, which reached Reuters via a Whatsapp message.
""What happened in Katsina was done to promote Islam and discourage un-Islamic practices as Western education is not the type of education permitted by Allah and his holy prophet.""
No video footage was released of the missing boys.
Spokesmen for the presidency, police and army did not immediately respond to messages and calls seeking comment.
Analysts have warned that West Africa's porous borders mean other Islamist groups operating in the wider Sahel region could form alliances with jihadists in northeast Nigeria. 
Boko Haram carried out the 2014 kidnap of more than 200 girls from a school in the northeastern town of Chibok. Since then, about half of those girls have been found or freed, dozens have been paraded in propaganda videos, and an unknown number are believed to have died.

More than 30,000 people have been killed since Boko Haram began its insurgency, which aims to create an Islamic state.

The six-week conflict between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces over the region and its surrounding areas was brought to a halt by a Russian-brokered ceasefire deal last month. 
The fighting locked in territorial gains for Azerbaijan and has stoked anger in Yerevan, prompting street protests against Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. 
Russian peacekeeping forces have deployed in the region. 
Late on Monday, Armenian Deputy Prime Minister Tigran Avinyan said a group of 44 Armenian prisoners had returned to Armenia after Russian mediation, the Interfax news agency reported. 
A Russian military aircraft also flew a group of 12 Azeri prisoners to Baku as part of the same swap, Rustam Muradov, the commander of Russia's peacekeeping forces, said in a defence ministry video published on Tuesday. 

Azeri authorities confirmed their arrival.

Since taking office in 2016, Duterte launched a bloody anti-narcotics crackdown in which thousands have been killed, sparking global outrage and criticism from rights groups.
Duterte has at times lashed out at what he said were international efforts to paint him as a ""ruthless and heartless violator of human rights"" and unilaterally withdrew the Philippines from the ICC's founding treaty in 2018.
The presidential office on Tuesday dismissed the report as speculative and legally erroneous.
""They can do what they want to. We do not recognise the jurisdiction of the ICC,"" Harry Roque, Duterte's spokesman, told a news conference.
The report issued on Monday said ""the office is satisfied that information available provides a reasonable basis to believe that the crimes against humanity of murder, torture and the infliction of serious physical injury and mental harm as other inhumane acts were committed"" between 2016 and 2019.
Many people targeted had been on a drug watch lists compiled by authorities or had previously surrendered to police, while a significant number of minors were victims, the report said.
Government data show that 5,942 suspected drug dealers have been killed as of the end of October, though rights groups suspect the death toll is much higher and say thousands more have died in shadowy circumstances.
Rights groups accuse police of systematically executing suspected drug dealers and users. Police deny this and say those killed violently resisted arrest during sting operations.
Philippine police spokesman Ysmael Yu declined to comment, saying his office has yet to receive a copy of the ICC report.
The Hague-based ICC started its preliminary examination of the Philippines drug campaign in 2018 and is due to reach a decision on whether to seek authorisation to open a formal investigation in the first half of next year.

Fractious politicians have been unable to agree on a new government since the last one quit in the aftermath of the Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion, leaving Lebanon rudderless as it sinks deeper into economic and financial crisis.
""We have entered a tunnel and I don't know how we will get out of it,"" Berri told al-Joumhuria newspaper. ""We are in a pitiful situation. The government situation is completely blocked.""
Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri and President Michel Aoun aired their differences over the government in statements on Monday, each blaming the other for the delay.
""Why this blockage? The answer certainly lies with the president and prime minister-designate,"" said Berri, an ally of the armed Iran-backed Hezbollah group. 
""God willing, the French President Emmanuel Macron will be able to do something in his coming visit. We can only wait.""
Macron is due to visit Lebanon later this month, his third visit since the devastating port explosion which worsened an economic crisis. Caused by decades of corruption and bad governance, the financial meltdown is the worst crisis to hit Lebanon since its 1975-90 civil war.
Following the blast, Macron led efforts to get Lebanese politicians to agree on a new government which could enact reforms and in turn unlock international support. 
But Lebanese leaders have delivered no reforms.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Lebanon's political and economic collapse was like the sinking of the Titanic, only without the music which it is believed the orchestra played as the ship went down.

Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah took the reins in September following the death of his brother at a time the wealthy OPEC member state is facing a severe liquidity crunch due to low oil prices and the coronavirus crisis.
""Our country's path faces serious problems and big challenges which call for putting in place a comprehensive reform programme,"" Sheikh Nawaf said in Tuesday's address at the new assembly's first session.
""There is no room for wasting more efforts, time and capabilities on fabricated conflicts, disputes and settling accounts which have become a source of frustration and discontent for citizens and an obstacle to any achievement.""
This month's parliamentary polls saw two thirds of lawmakers lose their seats as opposition candidates made gains in results that analysts say could hamper government efforts to enact fiscal reform in the cradle-to-grave welfare state and end legislative gridlock over a debt law that would help boost state coffers.
Frequent rows and deadlocks between cabinet and parliament have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament, hampering investment and economic and fiscal reform.
Kuwait's economy, which is worth nearly $140 billion, is facing a deficit of $46 billion this year. A government priority is to pass a bill that would allow Kuwait to tap international debt markets.
Kuwait, a U.S. ally, has the most open political system in the Gulf region, with a parliament wielding power to pass legislation and question ministers, although senior posts are occupied by ruling family members.

1154,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 15, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>",U-turn on travel subsidy adds to pressure on Japanese PM,"By Sakura Murakami and Yoshifumi Takemoto
TOKYO (Reuters) - Even as coronavirus infections in Japan hit record highs and government support ratings slipped, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga defended a government tourism campaign, defying experts and denying links to the spread of the virus.
    Until Monday.
    In a stunning about-face on a policy aimed at helping small businesses that he took credit for when assuming the premiership in September, Suga said he would halt the subsidy programme over the year-end, the latest wrangle to mar his first months in power.
The decision was likely prompted by another steep drop in opinion polls over the weekend, showing respondents highly critical of Suga's handling of the pandemic and, for the first time, those against the government outnumbering those in favour.
The events mark a dramatic reversal in the fortunes of a man who came to power with the aura of an uncompromising political operator capable of pushing through reforms and taking on the stodgy bureaucracy.
They also revealed a leader who, critics from within the ruling camp say, lacks big-picture vision and smart advisers, and acts like the micromanager he was known to be when serving as the right-hand man to his predecessor, Shinzo Abe.
Suga is also under fire for defending Abe over allegations - being investigated by prosecutors - that his office helped fund parties for supporters, violating political funding laws.
He also stirred an outcry by removing scholars critical of the government from an advisory panel and was forced by the junior coalition partner, Komeito, to compromise on a policy on healthcare costs for the elderly.
The stumbles have raised questions about the longevity of Suga's tenure, government officials say, and could complicate his ability to implement difficult reforms.
QUESTIONS
Izuru Makihara, a professor of politics at the University of Tokyo, compared Suga's previous role of chief cabinet secretary liaising with ministries to a piano tuner who ""tinkers with the issues so that everything goes smoothly"".
""As prime minister, you need to be the record player and play the music. At the moment, that record player doesn't have a record in it and can't play any music,"" Makihara said.
The criticism was echoed by ruling-camp members of parliament and a senior government official, who said Suga still called up bureaucrats, fussing over details and giving instructions.
""We can't function as an organisation if he's going over the heads of ministers and vice ministers,"" said the official, who declined to be identified.
The son of a farmer without a strong base in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) dominated by political bluebloods, Suga has been a political underdog and an unlikely pick for prime minister from the outset. 
His mishaps have prompted some rank-and-file lawmakers to question his ability to lead the party in a lower house election that has to be held by late October.
""It's possible that the prime minister's office will lose a lot of its momentum if the number of people who think that the LDP can't win with Suga rises,"" said a different government official speaking on condition of anonymity.
An LDP executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, questioned whether lawmakers would want to put up Suga's posters in their districts during elections.

""Suga's administration started out as a 'down-to-earth cabinet' but it's now turning into a 'dark cabinet',"" he said.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's new foreign minister said on Tuesday the country would be willing to help negotiate a truce between neighbouring Australia and regional heavyweight China, who are caught in an escalating trade and diplomatic spat. 
Nanaia Mahuta, 50, said hosting the high profile Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit next year presented an opportunity for New Zealand to bring both parties to the table. 
""Do I believe that there might an opportunity for New Zealand to create a different environment and have a conversation? Yes, I do,"" Mahuta said in an interview with Reuters at the distinctive Beehive parliament building in Wellington. 
""And I think hosting APEC might well be the opportunity... but both parties will have to be willing to come together and concede in some areas where they are currently not seeing eye to eye,"" Mahuta said. 
Relations have deteriorated over new foreign interference and investment laws in Australia, calls for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus and Chinese blocks on Australian exports.
Tensions worsened last month as after a China foreign ministry spokesman posted a digitally manipulated image of an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child.
New Zealand raised concerns with China about using the image.
""I don’t think Twitter diplomacy can be achieved when disinformation is promoted through social media. I think we need to go back to tried and tested diplomacy which is dialogue and ensuring doors are open so people can work through some challenging issues,"" Mahuta said.
Mahuta also recently joined counterparts from Five Eyes intelligence partners - Australia, the U.K. Canada, and the United States - in condemning China for disqualifying legislators in Hong Kong.
This angered China which reacted by warning the Western alliance that it could get ""poked in the eye"".
Like Australia, New Zealand has major trade ties to China and has long been touted by Beijing as an exemplar of its “firsts” with Western countries. 
But under Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government, which won a second term in office in October, it has criticized China’s lending to small Pacific islands, raised concerns about Muslim Uighurs in China's Xinjiang province and backed Taiwan’s participation at the World Health Organization (WHO) despite a warning from Beijing.
SURPRISE PICK
Alexander Gillespie, Professor of Law at University of Waikato said New Zealand was still well placed to try to broker some kind of calming measures.
""There is no guarantee that getting the two sides to sit down and talk calmly will work. It would be a very, very, long road ahead – but it would be heading in a different direction to where we are currently going,"" he said. 
The first indigenous Maori woman to hold the post, Mahuta highlighted New Zealand's ""whakapapa"" or kinship connections that go back to the Asia region. 
""That enables us to navigate our relations with China perhaps a little differently than other countries,"" she said.
Little known outside New Zealand, Mahuta was a surprise pick as Ardern's foreign minister in the country's most diverse ever cabinet.
Her moko kauae, or facial tattoo inscribed on her chin as a symbol of her Maori heritage, has attracted much attention. 
""Curiosity is the operative word,"" she said when asked how people have reacted to her.
Mahuta said she sees her position as an opportunity to create a different type of dialogue in the foreign affairs space, and she has had conversations with other women in foreign offices in other countries about common issues such as the role of women in society, gender equality and the environment. 
""I have a perspective that is intergenerational, that's born out of culture, that's firmly drawing on the context of New Zealand which hasn't been altogether smooth if you think about the way in which indigenous issues have been addressed here and our history of colonisation,"" she said.

SUAO, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan may become a supplier of weapons to Western democracies, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday, praising the island's ramped up weapons-design ability as she launched an advanced, missile-laden warship and commissioned a new minelayer.
Tsai has made boosting the defence of the Chinese-claimed island a priority in the face of a growing military challenge from Beijing, which has never renounced the use of force to bring democratic Taiwan under its control.
While Taiwan's air force has benefited from big-ticket items like new and upgraded F-16s, the navy is Tsai's next focus, with submarines in production and the Tuesday launch of the first of a fleet of highly manoeuvrable stealth corvettes.
The new Tuo Chiang-class corvettes, a prototype of which is already in operation, has been dubbed by Taiwan's navy the ""aircraft carrier killer"" due to its complement of anti-ship missiles. It can also carry Sky Sword anti-aircraft missiles.
Speaking in the eastern port city of Suao for the launch of the Ta Chiang, the first mass production ship of the Tuo Chiang-class, Tsai said the vessel and the new minelayer would deter attacks and showcased Taiwan's research and development ability.
""We have the determination and capability to complete the task of building our own ships, letting the world see our defence research and development energy,"" Tsai said.
""In the future, we may also become a supply source of related equipment and components in Western democracies, driving the upgrading of the defence industry,"" she said.
The United States is Taiwan's main foreign source of weapons. Most countries shy away from arming the island, wary of angering Beijing and loosing valuable commercial contracts with the world's second-largest economy.
Tsai, re-elected in a landslide in January on a vow to stand up to China, has championed the concept of ""asymmetric warfare"", focusing on high-tech, mobile weapons designed to make any Chinese attack as difficult as possible.

She has bolstered the domestic arms industry to try to make Taiwan as self-sufficient as possible.

As water levels continued to rise due to the heavy overnight rains shutting low-lying roads, New South Wales (NSW) state emergency services directed hundreds of residents of several regional towns to move to safer places. 
The cyclonic conditions, generated by an intense low-pressure system off the Queensland coast, have swallowed beaches and submerged large swathes of the heavily populated regions between NSW and Queensland state borders.
Quiet seaside suburbs were battered by the storm with high seas destroying some of the most famous beaches along the coast, including the main beach at popular tourist spot Byron Bay in northern NSW.
The storm also whipped up thick sea foams, a rare event, along the beaches in Gold Coast that lured families and children to play in the bubbles, footage on social media showed. 
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said the heavy rains are expected to weaken by late Tuesday or early Wednesday but warned isolated thunderstorms may still generate localised heavy falls triggering flash floods.
Australia is passing through a summer expected to be dominated by the La Nina phenomenon, typically associated with greater rainfall and more tropical cyclones - a sharp contrast to the massive bushfires that razed the country last summer.
""We've been warned by the weather experts that La Nina will have an impact over summer in the eastern coast of Australia so we need to expect the unexpected,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told Australian Broadcasting Corp television.

At least 274 journalists were in jail as of Dec. 1, the most since the New York-based group began collecting data in the early 1990s, the report said, up from at least 250 last year.
Protests and political tensions were the cause of many arrests, with the most made in China, Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, it said.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, authoritarian leaders tried to control reporting by arresting journalists. At least two journalists died after contracting the disease in custody, the report said.

""It's shocking and appalling that we are seeing a record number of journalists imprisoned in the midst of a global pandemic,"" CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon said in a statement.
The report blamed a lack of global leadership on democratic values, and in particular attacks on the media by U.S. President Donald Trump, which it said gave cover to authoritarians to crack down on journalists in their own countries.
Globally, 34 journalists were jailed for ""false news"" in 2020, compared with 31 last year, it said.
""The record number of journalists imprisoned around the world is President Trump's press freedom legacy,"" Simon said.

While no journalists were in prison in the United States as of Dec. 1, 110 were arrested or charged in 2020, many while covering demonstrations against police violence, the CPJ said.
Countries where the number of jailed journalists rose significantly include Belarus, where the re-election of its long time president sparked mass protests, and Ethiopia, where political unrest has led to armed conflict.
The report found that two-thirds of journalists in jail were charged with anti-state crimes such as terrorism or membership of banned groups, while no charges were disclosed in nearly 20% of cases.

The filing also said Maxwell ""vehemently maintains her innocence"" and is not a flight risk, despite media that have ""ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt"" in far more articles than the comedian Bill Cosby and movie producer Harvey Weinstein got after their arrests.
""Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be, far from it,"" the filing said. ""Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and have her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.""
A spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment.
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls as young as 14 to engage in illegal sexual acts in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for having denied involvement under oath.
Her trial is scheduled to begin in July 2021, and she faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.
U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan could rule on Maxwell's bail application this month.
The judge denied bail on July 14, agreeing with prosecutors that Maxwell posed a substantial flight risk, citing her opaque finances and ""sophistication"" in hiding her wealth and herself.
Authorities arrested Maxwell on July 2 at her New Hampshire home, which prosecutors said she used as a hideout and concealed her identity to buy.
TWITTER COMMENTS 'PARTICULARLY GALLING'
Maxwell has since July been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where she was quarantined last month after a staff member tested positive for COVID-19.
Her lawyers said Maxwell has suffered weight and hair loss, been subjected to repeated and invasive searches, and lacks adequate protection from COVID-19, which now affects 80 inmates and staff.
Jail officials have said Maxwell's health is good and that she is treated like other inmates.
In Monday's filing, Maxwell proposed living under home confinement with an acquaintance in New York City, with 24-hour security and electronic monitoring.
The filing said Maxwell waived her extradition rights and therefore ""could not seek refuge"" in the United Kingdom and France, where she holds citizenships.
It also said the lack of ""meaningful"" new documentary evidence turned over by the government since her arrest ""reinforces"" Maxwell's belief she was falsely accused.
Maxwell's bail application was filed on Dec. 8, and parts of the version made public were blacked out.
Her lawyers have said this was done to preserve the safety of her husband, friends, family, and co-signers for her bonds, and that Maxwell herself has received online death threats.
In a letter to the judge, Maxwell's husband said Maxwell had dropped from public view prior to her arrest for safety reasons amid ""increasingly frightening"" media interest.
""Twitter comments have been particularly galling,"" he added.
Prosecutors have until Dec. 16 to respond to Maxwell's bail application.

Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Thunberg took to Twitter on Dec. 13 to say that New Zealand's ""so-called climate emergency declaration"" earlier in the month, committing the country to become carbon neutral by 2025, was ""of course nothing unique to any nation"". 
Ardern on Monday told reporters she welcomed Thunberg's contribution to the debate on climate, but said the emergency declaration covered only a portion of New Zealand's climate change goals.
""If it was the sum total of what we were doing, it would be worthy of criticism, it's clearly not,"" Ardern said, adding it's ""only a good thing that there are people out there continuing to urge ambition and action.""
New Zealand declared a climate emergency on Dec. 2, promising its public sector would achieve carbon neutrality by 2025. Its programme will be backed by a NZ$200 million ($142 million) fund to finance replacing coal boilers and help purchase electric or hybrid vehicles.

United Nations investigators in September determined that Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government has committed systematic human rights violations, including killings and torture, amounting to crimes against humanity.
The Hague-based tribunal has been examining Venezuela's case since 2018 and expects to determine in 2021 whether to open a full investigation, according to a report on the office's 2020 activities released on Monday.
""The Office has concluded that the information available at this stage provides a reasonable basis to believe that since at least April 2017, civilian authorities, members of the armed forces and pro-government individuals have committed the crimes against humanity,"" the report reads. 
Protesters in 2017 led months of demonstrations against the government for undermining the opposition-led legislature, a period marked by accusations of torture, arbitrary arrest, and abuse by security forces. The protests left 125 people dead.
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Ruling Socialist Party leaders have in the past said such demonstrations were violent efforts to overthrow Maduro and insist all human rights violations are prosecuted.
Though Maduro's adversaries have celebrated the ICC's probe of Venezuela, few believe the process is likely to lead to a short-term change in the struggling nation.

ICC criminal proceedings stretch for years, and it has in the past struggled to carry out arrest warrants when it obtains them.

WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States imposed long-anticipated sanctions on Turkey on Monday over Ankara's acquisition of Russian S-400 air defense systems, further complicating already strained ties between the two NATO allies.
Turkey condemned the sanctions as a ""grave mistake"" and urged Washington to revise its ""unjust decision."" It said sanctions would inevitably harm mutual relations and threatened unspecified retaliatory steps. 
Senior U.S. officials said in a call with reporters that Ankara's purchase of the S-400s and its refusal to reverse its decision, despite repeated pleas from Washington, left the United States with no other choice.
The sanctions, first reported by Reuters last week, target Turkey's top defence procurement and development body Presidency of Defence Industries (SSB), its chairman Ismail Demir and three other employees.
The measures, which received a bipartisan welcome from the U.S. Congress, were announced under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) - the first time the act has been used against a fellow member of the NATO alliance.
Turkey's lira rallied about 1% as Washington opted not to adopt broader sanctions but analysts said the move was still likely to weigh on the Turkish economy, already in a coronavirus-induced slowdown and with double-digit inflation.
Ankara acquired the Russian S-400 ground-to-air defenses in mid-2019 and says they pose no threat to NATO allies. But Washington has long threatened sanctions and last year removed Turkey from an F-35 jet program. 
Ignoring the advice of aides, President Donald Trump had resisted imposing penalties on Turkey until giving the green light several days ago, sources familiar with the matter said.
""The United States made clear to Turkey at the highest levels and on numerous occasions that its purchase of the S-400 system would endanger the security of U.S. military technology and personnel and provide substantial funds to Russia’s defense sector,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.
Briefing reporters, Christopher Ford, Assistant Secretary of State for International Security and Nonproliferation, said Washington had sought a solution but Ankara rejected all offers.
""This is not a step we've taken lightly or certainly quickly,"" he said.
Turkey says it has repeatedly proposed forming a joint working group with the United States and NATO to resolve the issue but its offers have not been fully utilised
The sanctions, near the end of Trump's presidency, are likely to weigh on Ankara's ties with Democrat Joe Biden's administration when he takes over as president next month. 
CHILLING EFFECT
The sanctions will block joint projects or technology transfers between U.S. companies and Turkish firms linked to SSB, said former Turkish diplomat Sinan Ulgen, who heads the Istanbul-based Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies think tank.
They also impose restrictions on loans and credits by U.S. financial institutions to SSB totalling more than $10 million, while imposing asset freezes and visa restrictions on the SSB president and three other employees.
It is not immediately clear what impact the sanctions will have on third countries such as European states that supply arms or defence components and work with Turkish defence firms.
""Turkey's defence industry will be under stress for a while,"" said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, from the German Marshall Fund in Ankara. ""Whether there is a secondary sanctions aspect or not, it will have a chilling effect on third countries as well.""
But he said the impact on the wider economy would be less severe and it was ""very good that the uncertainty is being removed"" after sanctions had loomed for so long.
U.S. senators, both Republican and Democratic, hailed the move. Animosity against President Tayyip Erdogan in the U.S. Congress has deepened over the past year, a phenomenon Biden will have to consider when dealing with Ankara.
""After watching President Trump repeatedly refuse to hold Turkey and President Erdogan accountable, I’m glad to see this Administration finally impose these required sanctions,"" Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said.
""These measures send a clear message to Erdogan: we will not allow him to undermine our national security and that of our faithful NATO allies without consequence.""

Macron has been under fire from left-wing factions of his centrist party for failing to do enough to combat global warming despite pledges to spend billions of euros to speed up moves to a greener economy.
He told the Citizens' Climate Council that he was willing to include mention of biodiversity, the environment and tackling climate change in Article 1 of the Constitution. 
""It will be put to a referendum"", he added.
Parliament's upper and lower houses must also agree to the referendum.
France's Green Party has gained momentum over the past two years, drubbing Macron's ruling party in regional elections early this summer. Macron loyalists worry the Greens could erode his base of support on the political left in the 2022 presidential vote.
Last month, France’s highest administrative court gave the government three months to show it is enacting climate policies that will ensure it meets its commitments on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Macron established the Citizens’ Climate Council in response to anti-government ""yellow vest"" protests that sprang up in late 2018. Some within the council have denounced it as a talking shop.

First test-launched in 2014, it is being developed to replace the Proton M as Russia's heavy lift rocket, capable of carrying payloads bigger than 20 tonnes into orbit. A launch pad for the new rocket is due to open in 2021.
The Angara has however been dogged by manufacturing delays and technical issues, including the discovery last year of a defect in its engines that scientists said could destroy it in flight.
The defence ministry and space agency Roscosmos said Monday's launch, from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in the country's northwest, had been successful however.

Roscosmos has suffered a series of setbacks and corruption scandals in recent years, including during the construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome in the country's far east where contractors were accused of stealing state funds.

At a summit on Friday, EU leaders agreed to prepare limited sanctions on Turkish individuals over a row with Greece and Cyprus about offshore energy exploration, but postponed discussions on any harsher steps until March.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after the summit that EU leaders planned to discuss weapons exports to Turkey with allies in the NATO military alliance following a Greek push for an arms embargo on Ankara.
Answering questions in parliament as part of annual budget talks, Cavusoglu said: ""It is out of the question for us to abandon our rights and interests in the eastern Mediterranean because we will face sanctions or the EU will criticise us.""

Earlier on Monday, President Tayyip Erdogan said he was upset by the United States and EU moving forward with sanctions processes against Turkey, saying Turkey expected the EU ""not to sanction it but rather to realise its promise of full (EU) membership.""

The results confirm the party's position as a dominant force after it won nearly 75% of contested seats for Egypt's newly recreated Senate in August.
Parliament was already controlled by Sisi supporters, but Nation's Future sharply increased its share of seats to 315 from 57 in the 596-seat chamber.
A small opposition block of leftist and independent deputies lost seats, official results showed. 
Voters and politicians had expected Nation's Future to benefit from new electoral rules to lock in control of the parliament.
Lists headed by the party won all 284 seats allocated for pre-selected lists under a winner-takes-all system. Nation's Future got 145 of these seats, according to election commission statements.
The party also won 170 of the 284 seats contested by individual candidates. Another pro-Sisi party, the Republican People's party, won 50 seats and non-affiliated candidates won 93 seats. Sisi can appoint 28 legislators directly.
Some voters and rival candidates accused Mostaqbal Watan of giving food or cash handouts to voters, accusations the party repeatedly dismissed.
Rival candidates and parties also filed complaints to the election commission alleging electoral fraud, but all were rejected. Some have also taken complaints to the courts.
Turnout in the two main rounds of voting was 29%.
Sisi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on political dissent since leading the ouster of former President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013. 

Sisi and his supporters say the measures were needed to stabilise the country.

Lavrov was speaking on a visit to Bosnia on the anniversary of the day when the peace accords, agreed previously in the U.S. air base in Ohio, were signed in Paris by the then presidents of Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia, all parties to the Balkan wars of the 1990s.
""We are witnessing the efforts to bring down the Dayton, to erode it ... this may cause risks and grave consequences,"" Lavrov told a news conference in East Sarajevo. 
He said the deal must not be changed in any way, referring to comments by some Western diplomats and Bosnian politicians that the agreement, which was made to stop the war, needs to be upgraded to enable Bosnia to make progress forward with reforms. 
The peace deal ended the war among Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) in which about 100,000 people were killed and two million were moved from their homes.
But a quarter of century later Bosnia, which was split into two autonomous regions, remains dysfunctional, with reforms blocked by the rival ethnic leaders. The two regions are the Serb-dominated Serb Republic, and the Federation shared by Bosniaks and Croats, all linked via a weak central government. 
Upon his arrival, Lavrov first visited Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of the country's three-man presidency, in the Serb Republic's government office just outside the capital Sarajevo.
He urged the closure of the office of an international peace overseer in Bosnia which was set up as part of the Dayton deal, saying that international protectors should have left the country ""long ago"".
Dodik has repeatedly said that any changes to the Dayton structure would be the reason for the Serb Republic to secede from Bosnia.
Lavrov is scheduled to separately meet the leader of the largest Croat HDZ party on Monday evening.
He will meet the members of Bosnia's inter-ethnic presidency on Tuesday.

Jeenah Moon, based in New York, was assigned to document a holiday music concert on the steps of a historic Episcopal cathedral on Amsterdam Avenue and West 113th Street, held in the fresh air because of coronavirus restrictions. The performance ended and audience members were milling about, hoping for a chance to see inside the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, the world's second-largest Anglican cathedral.
About quarter of an hour after the music ended, the performers and most of the audience had either gone inside the church or left, when Moon heard a bang.
""I thought it might be a gunshot but I thought maybe a flat tire... I heard the faint sound, very quickly, three seconds, boom, boom, boom. I didn't know how close. I thought it (might) be a few blocks away.""
""It was happening maybe two to three times, and someone shouted out, 'Gun!""
Moon was a few meters away from the church steps when she saw people running. 
She saw a man standing by the church front door, holding two guns and wearing a hat and a mask.
Moon hid behind a vehicle, following her training on how to stay safe for this kind of situation. Working with a 70-200mm telephoto lens, she snapped photos of the man.
The New York Police Department (NYPD) responded quickly, Moon said, arriving in less than five minutes.
""It got a little chaotic,"" she said. ""I was on the corner, so he didn't see me, but I was very close to the NYPD when he confronted the suspect.""
The police yelled at the suspect, who was wearing a face covering, to drop the gun, Moon recalled.
""(The gunman) said, 'Kill me!'. When he tried to shoot, he's always pointing at the air, not at (people)."" 
NYPD officers yelled at Moon to get back and led two women to run to safety across Amsterdam Avenue. 
One photo, showing the man brandishing the guns, was used by the New York Post on its front page on Monday with the headline, ""Gunman Terrorizes St. John the Divine.""
Another of Moon's photos shows the two women running away from the scene while an officer moves toward the suspect. 
Several minutes after the incident began, the gunman was shot dead by police, who said they recovered a bag apparently belonging to the suspect that contained a can of gasoline, rope, wire, several knives, a Bible and tape. No-one else was injured in the incident.
""My heart was beating so fast. This is my first experience with this kind of situation but I was lucky, on the side, so I (was) out of sight,"" Moon said. ""He was talking straight at the NYPD so I was able to move around, hiding.""
Recalling the events the next day, Moon compared it to an action movie. 

""I feel a little numb,"" she said. ""That was my first time to see a dead body.""

A heavy police presence backed by water cannons and anti-riot forces deployed in the main avenue leading to Parliament square, where a group of pro-Palestinian rights organisations had planned the sit-in.
Police prevented demonstrators from reaching the square.
Two prominent activists, Sion Assidon, Morocco coordinator for the international Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, and lawyer Abderrahman Ben Amrou, were escorted away by authorities and asked to leave the area.
""Unfortunately, political normalization ... comes after a long process of economic, agricultural, tourism and academic ties,"" Assidon, a Moroccan Jew, told Reuters. BDS is a group that calls for economic pressure on Israel to end the occupation of Palestinian land.
There are nearly 1 million Jews hailing from Morocco in Israel and last year 70,000 visited the kingdom, which recognizes the Jewish community as a constituent of its national identity.
A local authority source said the protest was not authorized, citing a COVID-19 emergency decree.
Hassan Bennajeh, a leading member of the outlawed Adl Wal Ihssane, one of several organisations which called for the protest, said the ban reflected a ""weak political position"", saying that authorities had allowed a gathering in support of the deal in the same place on Sunday.
A core element of the deal was U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty over the Western Sahara. A decades-old dispute over the territory has pitted Morocco against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, which seeks to establish an independent state.
A rally was held on Saturday in Western Sahara’s largest city Laayoune by the opposition Istiqlal party bringing together some 30,000 people in support of the deal.

The main political parties in Morocco have welcomed the deal with Israel and the U.S. recognition of Moroccan sovereignty. Islamist groups have rejected normalization.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has proposed new envoys to mediate conflicts in Libya and the Middle East, who could be given the greenlight by the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday after months of delay, diplomats said. 
Guterres put forward his current Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov to become his Libya special envoy - replacing Ghassan Salame who stepped down in March due to stress - and named veteran Norwegian diplomat Tor Wennesland to succeed Mladenov as the U.N. mediator between Israel and the Palestinians. 
If there are no objections by any of the 15 Security Council members by Tuesday evening then the appointments will be approved, ending months of bickering sparked by a U.S. push to split the Libya role to have one person running the U.N. political mission and another focused on conflict mediation.
The Security Council agreed to that proposal in September. Guterres then proposed Bulgarian diplomat Mladenov for the Libya role last month and on Friday named Wennesland, currently Norway's special envoy on the Middle East peace process, to replace Mladenov, according to letters seen by Reuters.
Mladenov has been the U.N. Middle East envoy since 2015. 
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. In October, the two major sides in the country’s war - the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) - agreed a ceasefire.
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.
In the Middle East, the Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

Saturday's incident in the poor Rio suburb of Belford Roxo shines a fresh light on aggressive tactics of Brazilian police, who critics allege often target poor young Black men in deadly raids.

The two officers, it added, ""were arrested and taken to the Rio de Janeiro Military Police Prison Unit."" Their weapons were confiscated and they have been questioned. 
In the video, which first aired on Brazilian news show Fantastico on Sunday, a motorcycle carrying two men careens around a corner, past the police. As it passes, one of the officers opens fire on the men, and they both fall off the bike.
The cops move them out of the road, and, according to images from another camera, handcuff them as they stand against a wall. They then put them in the back of their car, while one of the cops drives their motorbike away.
The two men, identified by local media as Edson Arguinez Junior, 20, and Jordan Luiz Natividade, 18, were later found dead, far from the scene of the arrest.
According to Fantastico, the two police officers failed to mention shooting at the motorbike. They said they released the two men shortly after taking them away in their car, after realizing there were no issues with them or their bike.

KANKARA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Usama Aminu was one of the lucky ones. He managed to escape when gunman abducted more than 300 pupils from his school in northwestern Nigeria.
""When I decided to run they brought a knife to slaughter me but I ran away quickly,"" he said, sitting on a mat and speaking softly as he described how he had been in bed at the all-boys school in Kankara when he heard gunshots on Friday night.
At first, he said, the boys thought the commotion was from soldiers trying to protect them, but the attackers, armed with AK-47s, were already inside the building, threatening groups who tried to leave their dormitories at the Government Science secondary school in an attack that has outraged Nigerians.
""They said they would kill whoever is trying to escape then I began to run, climbing one rock to another through a forest,"" Aminu said.
Many details of the raid and its aftermath remain unknown.
Police said on Friday they exchanged fire with the attackers, allowing some students to run for safety. According to Katsina Governor Aminu Bello Masari on Sunday, 333 students remained missing.
The president's office said on Monday the government was in contact with the armed men and was negotiating the release of the boys after security agencies had located them.
""We are making progress and the outlook is positive,"" Masari told reporters on Monday, after meeting President Muhammadu Buhari, who was on a week-long visit to his home state.
The governor said the president was fully committed to the rescue of the schoolchildren, after he had been criticised in Nigerian newspapers for not visiting the school.
It is still not clear who the gunmen were and officials do not yet know the motive of the attack. 
Attacks by armed gangs, widely known as bandits, are common throughout northwestern Nigeria. The groups attack civilians, stealing or kidnapping them for ransom.

Muhammad Abubakar, 15, was another pupil who got away, trekking through farmland and a forest in the dark. He said he was among 72 boys who had reached safety in the village of Kaikaibise where he ended up.
""The bandits called us back. They told us not to run. We started to walk back to them, but as we did, we saw more people coming towards the dormitory,"" he told Reuters.
""So I and others ran again. We jumped over the fence and ran through a forest to the nearest village.""
Abubakar, one of eight children, said he saw a number of boys being rounded up before they were marched out of the school, which has around 800 students. Seven of his friends are missing. 
As he was reunited with his mother, who sells firewood for a living, he said: ""I never thought I would see my parents again.""
Friday's raid evoked memories of the 2014 kidnap of more than 200 girls from a school in the northeastern town of Chibok by Islamist group Boko Haram.
Since then, about half of those girls have been found or freed, dozens have been paraded in propaganda videos and an unknown number are believed to have died. 
Despite the measures taken to find the boys and track down the assailants, there was growing anger at the precarious security situation in the country. On Monday, #BringBackOurBoys was trending on Twitter.
Late last month, Islamist militants killed scores of farmers in northeastern Borno, beheading some of them.
And in October the country was gripped by some of the worst civil unrest since its return to civilian rule in 1999, following weeks of largely peaceful protests against police brutality in which several demonstrators were shot dead.
Oby Ezekwesili, a former government minister and campaigner who organised the Bring Back Our Girls Movement after the Chibok abductions, said the insecurity that led to the latest abduction was the product of poor governance.
""Nothing of our government system was available to protect those children,"" she told Reuters. ""What else can define poor governance."" 
The presidency declined to comment when asked for a response to the criticism.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 75 lawmakers is urging the Trump administration to extend exclusions from import tariffs on medical products imported from China, including face masks, hand sanitizing wipes and examination gloves, that expire on Dec. 31.
In a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, the lawmakers said failure to extend the exclusions would hurt small businesses already suffering from stay-at-home orders aimed at containing the spread of the new coronavirus.
They said they recognized that the exclusions were granted in part to give U.S. companies more time to diversify their supply chains out of China. But companies needed more time to complete those efforts given continuing travel restrictions, they said.
""Extending exclusions before they expire will help with pandemic response, and it will save jobs, businesses and livelihoods. We strongly urge you to extend all active exclusions before they expire at the end of this year,"" the lawmakers said in the letter, which was dated Friday.
""Our economy remains in a fragile state due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and many of the expiring exclusions are critical to the pandemic response,"" the letter said.
The exclusions cover inputs for household and professional cleaning goods, personal protective equipment and medical supplies, including equipment needed to administer COVID-19 vaccines, they said.
The USTR in March granted exclusions from import tariffs https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-tariffs-idUSKBN20T2ON for dozens of medical products as the coronavirus outbreak widened.
The products were included in a fourth round of tariffs on Chinese goods imposed by President Donald Trump on Sept. 1, 2019. The tariff rate on the medical products was initially set at 15%, but was lowered to 7.5% on Feb. 15 as part of the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade agreement. 

The USTR had no immediate comment on the lawmakers' request.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo President Felix Tshisekedi said on Monday he believed he had the cross-party support needed to push through his plans for a new government, after ending an awkward coalition with his predecessor Joseph Kabila to seek a new majority in parliament.
Lawmakers voted on Thursday to oust a Kabila-appointed speaker, signalling a potential realignment of support that may allow Tshisekedi to nominate a more loyal cabinet.
Political analysts say the speaker's unpopularity helped Tshisekedi triumph by a margin of 81 votes in the 500-member lower house.
But it is unclear whether backing from his new political bloc, known as the Sacred Union, will translate into enough support in other crucial votes, such as the appointment of a new speaker and a motion of no confidence in the prime minister.
In a state of the nation address to parliament, Tshisekedi expressed confidence most lawmakers backed his plans, referring to ""strong convergence between the vast majority of the parties consulted and myself.""
Tshisekedi was long an opponent of Kabila but the two forged an uneasy alliance after a disputed election in 2018, with Kabila's allies maintaining a parliamentary majority and controlling cabinet.
The power struggle has frustrated Tshisekedi as he tries to pursue an agenda that includes addressing armed violence in the mineral-rich east, reforming the judiciary and securing financial support from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
""Unfortunately ... despite my best efforts, the sacrifices I have made and the humiliations I have tolerated, it has not been enough to make this coalition work smoothly,"" Tshisekedi said.
He is yet to name a facilitator who would help identify a new parliamentary majority, a move that could be subject to legal challenge in the constitutional court.
Kabila's allies are slowly being marginalised, said Fred Bauma from the Congo Research Group at New York University.

""One of the biggest concerns, however, is about the willingness and the capacity of Tshisekedi's team to implement deep reforms that are needed,"" Bauma said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin may face another challenge to his leadership on Tuesday, if the opposition in parliament seeks to block a third and final vote to pass the government's 2021 budget.
Muhyiddin's government plans to spend a record 322.5 billion ringgit ($79.61 billion) next year, up 2.5% from this year as it seeks to spur activity in an economy badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Opposition lawmakers led by veteran leader Anwar Ibrahim backed down from a plan to vote down the budget at the end of the policy stage debate last month, avoiding a potential political crisis as Muhyiddin faced the first real test of his wafer-thin majority in the 222-seat parliament.
A budget defeat would have been seen as a loss of confidence in Muhyiddin's leadership and could have triggered snap polls.
Two opposition sources said Anwar, who in September declared he had majority support from lawmakers to form a government, is expected to try to block the budget this time. 
""He's got 113, so we expect something to happen,"" said a senior opposition lawmaker, who asked not to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media.
The opposition bloc include up to 10 lawmakers from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the former ruling party, led by its president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi and former premier Najib Razak, according to the sources.
Anwar and Najib's offices declined to comment, while Ahmad Zahid's representative did not have any immediate comment.There was also no immediate comment from the prime minister's office.
Muhyiddin also faces pressure from his predecessor, Mahathir Mohamad, who on Monday called on lawmakers to consider replacing a ""weak"" government with one that is stable and focused on reviving Malaysia's economic fortunes.
""If the 222 members of parliament love this country, they will not choose the party or themselves... they are elected in order to govern this country,"" Mahathir told a news conference.

Four months since Lebanon's last government quit in the wake of a huge explosion in Beirut port in August, the main parties have been unable to agree on a cabinet even as the country sinks deeper into a crippling financial crisis.
Hariri, who was designated in October to form a government, gave Aoun a line-up last week, saying the atmosphere was positive. Aoun's office said at the time the two had agreed to try to bridge the gap between their proposals.
But the atmosphere soured very publicly on Monday.
In a statement prompted by criticism from an Aoun adviser, Hariri's media office urged Aoun to set aside party interests, namely the demand that one party get a third of the ministries, or effective veto power, referring to the Free Patriotic Movement founded by Aoun.
""This is what will never happen under any pretext,"" the statement said. 
A statement from the presidency meanwhile said Aoun objected to Hariri ""going it alone in naming ministers, particularly the Christians, without agreement with the president"". 
""The president never proposed names of party candidates to be ministers and did not present the prime minister-designate with a list of names,"" it said. 
The most recent draft line-up proposed by Hariri differed from the previous one discussed with Aoun, it added.
Under a sectarian power-sharing system, Lebanon's president must be a Maronite Christian and the prime minister a Sunni Muslim. Aoun is an ally of the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, listed as a terrorist group by the United States.
The financial crisis came to a head last year after decades of corruption and bad governance, sinking the currency by some 80%, freezing savers out of their deposits and causing poverty to soar.

Major decisions have been set to one side amid the political paralysis, notably what to do about subsidies on basic goods including fuel, which are being imported using the central bank's dwindling foreign currency reserves.

In announcing that it had imposed sanctions on Mohammad Baseri and Ahmad Khazai of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security, U.S. officials told reporters that their public identification would lead to further information about Levinson.
""The abduction of Mr. Levinson in Iran is an outrageous example of the Iranian regime’s willingness to commit unjust acts,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. 
As a result of the sanctions, all property of the two men falling under U.S. jurisdiction must be blocked and U.S. persons are generally barred from dealing with them. Non-U.S. persons risk being blacklisted for dealing with them and foreign banks could be punished for knowingly facilitating a significant transaction for them.
In a conference call, U.S. officials said all evidence the United States has gathered so far indicates that Levinson, who went missing on Iran's Kish Island in the Gulf in 2007, likely died in captivity. One official, anticipating U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's expected effort to restore the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran or to secure a wider agreement, said any deal must entail freeing U.S. citizens ""unjustly detained by Iran.""

At least three U.S. citizens are currently detained by Iran: Baquer Namazi, his son Siamak Namazi, and Morad Tahbaz.

Iran summoned Turkey's envoy last week after Erdogan recited an Azeri-Iranian poem lamenting the 19th century division of Azerbaijan's territory between Russia and Iran. Tehran appeared concerned his remarks questioned Iran's territorial integrity and could fan separatist tendencies among its Azeri minority.
""In my opinion, with the explanations (Turkish officials) gave, we can move beyond this issue, but the sensitivity of our people is very important,"" Rouhani told a televised news conference in Tehran
""Based on my past knowledge of Mr Erdogan, it is very unlikely that he had any intention of insulting our territorial integrity,"" Rouhani said. ""He always recites poetry in his speeches.""
Azeris are the largest minority in Iran, and millions live in an Iranian region which shares the same name as the independent state of Azerbaijan, a former Soviet Republic. Azeris speak a language very similar to Turkish, while mostly observing Shi'ite Islam, Iran's state religion.

Turkey has become a close ally of Azerbaijan, helping it make major territorial gains against Armenians in a war that ended with a ceasefire last month.

MILAN (Reuters) - Long queues have been forming outside food banks and help centres in Italy's financial capital Milan as the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus has deepened before Christmas.
As case numbers surged after the summer, Italy - the first European country to be struck by the pandemic and among the worst hit - has seen its stagnant economy dealt a blow by lockdowns to try to halt the spread of COVID-19.
""During this period of the pandemic, the numbers have gone up,"" said Luigi Rossi, vice-president of local aid group Pane Quotidiano, as a queue stretched down the block outside the centre in the south of Milan.
""We certainly believe that the more this crisis goes on, the more there will be.""
Even in prosperous Milan, which had been riding a major property boom before the pandemic, the crisis has bitten deeply as large parts of the economy have come to a halt. 
Many who had been just about managing have been forced to ask for help in a city that has prided itself on being Italy's economic motor and an exception to the malaise that has haunted the rest of the country for decades.
""There are so many people like me. It's the new poor,"" said Alberto, 66, who did not want to give his last name.
With the trade fairs that contributed heavily to Milan's pre-crisis economy now closed, he has been out of work and has been coming to the centre for the past five months.
""I've still got to pay the rent, I've got to buy food and even though my partner is working, it's not enough.""
Like the centres run by other charitable groups, Pane Quotidiano, which has operated in Milan for more than a century, has been flat out, open 7 days a week from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. and handling an average of 800 people a day.
While the government has imposed a firing freeze and offered support to companies furloughing workers, many have complained of long delays in getting payments. For the army of home carers, cleaners, restaurant staff and others employed unofficially and paid in cash, there has been no support at all.
""How can you get by?"" asked Maria-Rosa Mamone, 76, who came to the centre to get food and a Christmas present for her grandchild. With three people at home and 600 euros ($700) in rent to pay every month, she is struggling. ""At least I can come here. There's everything here, bread, milk...""

Some power and telephone links were also restored in regional capital Mekelle after a virtual communications blackout since federal troops' Nov. 4 offensive. But there were reports of massive fuel and food price hikes, plus water shortages.
Tigray is still off-limits to journalists without a permit. 
Abiy has declared victory over the former local ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The powerful TPLF dominated federal government for nearly three decades before he took office in 2018 - and they had feuded since then. 
Thousands of people are believed killed and nearly a million fled their homes during air-strikes and ground battles in Tigray that exposed bitter ethnic divisions around the vast nation.
The government seized Mekelle, home to 500,000 people, on Nov. 28, and released a video last week entitled ""Normalcy in the eyes of the residents"" featuring interviews with Tigrayans.
The government said mobile voice services in Mekelle and six other towns had been restored, and that electricity was also back in the regional capital. However, of 18 calls Reuters made to Mekelle on Monday, only three connected. 
The civil aviation authority said it reopened airspace in Tigray region at 2 pm (11 am GMT) on Monday.
'PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY'
A 40-year-old driver reached by phone in Mekelle said power was back but there was little water while food was extremely expensive. ""People are going outside because they are hungry,"" he told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
He said the price of fuel had jumped nearly 14 times from 22 birr ($0.57) before the conflict to 300 birr on the black market. A kilo of berbere, a popular spice, soared from 70 to 800 birr. Reuters could not verify the prices. 
""People are still afraid and worried,"" a journalist based in Mekelle told Reuters, also on condition of anonymity. Banks remained closed, and though water was available in some parts of the city, it was not yet in his neighbourhood, he added.

""(We) acknowledge and regret the Swiss authorities' failure to prevent adoptions from Sri Lanka until the 1990s despite strong indications of, in some cases, serious irregularities,"" the federal cabinet said in a statement. 
It called for greater support for people who were adopted in Switzerland at the time and who have struggled to penetrate a cloak of secrecy surrounding their origins.
The issue came to light after a Dutch television documentary in 2017 reported that thousands of Sri Lankan children were given up for adoption, often illegally, in European countries over the course of several decades. 
A study released earlier this year by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) at the government's request found that Swiss authorities approved the entry of 950 children from Sri Lanka between 1973 and 1997, although it was impossible to pinpoint the precise number of adoptions that took place.
The government now plans a broader historical analysis of illegal adoptions, it said, after concerns raised by a Swiss lawmaker in 2017 that some of the adopted children were either ""stolen or sold"" before arriving in Switzerland. 
""An additional research project to complement the ZHAW analysis will show whether there were also indications of systematic irregularities in adoptions from other countries of origin,"" the cabinet statement said. 
The Dutch government also responded to the 2017 television expose by creating a special investigative commission that is due to deliver a conclusive report in February 2021, after delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The commission has examined adoptions from Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the 1980s and possible involvement of Dutch government personnel in any alleged fraud.

Habib Chaab, an Iranian ethnic Arab separatist leader, was drugged and kidnapped by a network working ""on behalf of Iran's intelligence service"" after being lured into flying to Turkey by an Iranian intelligence operative, a senior official said.
Iran's state media said in November that Iranian intelligence ministry officers arrested Chaab over suspected involvement in a 2018 attack on a military parade that killed dozens of people, without saying when or how he was detained.
Chaab, who was based in Sweden, was persuaded to fly to Turkey to meet a woman who, unknown to him, worked for Iranian intelligence, the Turkish official said. 
When he arrived in Istanbul he went to a rendezvous point, where he was drugged and tied down, the official said. Istanbul police said Chaab was spirited from the city to Turkey's eastern province of Van, and from there across the border into Iran.
The 11 people were arrested two weeks ago, police said.
The account of Chaab's abduction was first reported by the Washington Post. There was no immediate public comment from Iran.
DISSIDENTS TARGETED
Chaab's detention comes one year after another Iranian dissident, Masoud Molavi Vardanjani, was shot dead on an Istanbul street. Two senior officials told Reuters that the killing was instigated by intelligence officers at Iran's consulate in Turkey.
Turkish broadcaster CNN Turk said the operation to detain the 11 suspected of abducting Chaab was also prompted by the seizure of other Iranian opposition figures.
On Saturday, Iran executed dissident journalist Ruhollah Zam, who was convicted of fomenting violence during anti-government protests in 2017, Iranian state television reported. Zam was captured in 2019 after living in exile in France. Zam's execution has stirred outrage in Europe.
CNN Turk said Turkey's intelligence agency had determined that there had been abductions, including that of Chaab, by people who formed Iran's intelligence network in Turkey and who were linked to a convicted Iranian drug smuggler, Naji Sharifi Zindashti.
Hurriyet newspaper said Chaab had been lured to Istanbul using his ex-wife, who asked to see him and promised to pay back debts to him. There he was put in a minibus and taken back to Iran by people linked to Zindashti, the paper said.
An Iranian ethnic Arab opposition movement called the Ahvaz National Resistance, which seeks a separate state in Iran's oil-rich southwestern province of Khuzestan, claimed responsibility for the 2018 attack that killed 25 people, almost half of them members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.
Islamic State militants also claimed responsibility. Neither claim provided evidence.

SAN JOSE DE GUANIPA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Francisco Belisario, a Venezuelan mayor, retired general and member of the ruling Socialist party, had enough. His loudest local critic had accused him of bungling the response to the coronavirus outbreak and other big problems.
In August, he wrote a state prosecutor and requested an ""exhaustive investigation"" of his nemesis, Giovanni Urbaneja, a former lawmaker who had become a gadfly to the mayor and other Socialist officeholders. Urbaneja, Belisario wrote in a letter reviewed by Reuters, was conducting a ""ferocious smear campaign"" on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and elsewhere. 
Urbaneja not only defamed him and President Nicolas Maduro, the mayor wrote. He violated Venezuela's Law Against Hate. The law, passed in 2017 but rarely used before this year, criminalizes actions that ""incite hatred"" against a person or group. 
Charge Urbaneja with hate crimes, the mayor implored the prosecutor.
Days later, several dozen masked officers raided Urbaneja's home and took him at gunpoint for ""a chat,"" according to the police report of his arrest and Urbaneja's wife. Urbaneja remains jailed, awaiting formal charges and a trial. 
The mayor, in a text message to Reuters, confirmed writing the letter seeking hate-law charges against Urbaneja. He defended the move, saying his foe's critique was unfair because the local coronavirus response is managed by the national health system, not the mayor's office. 
It was an increasingly common maneuver: In a review of more than 40 recent hate-law arrests, Reuters found that in each case, authorities intervened against Venezuelans who had criticized Maduro, other ruling party officials or their allies. 
Despite its growing use by prosecutors, the hate law is considered unconstitutional and illegitimate by many Venezuelan legal scholars consulted by Reuters. Not only does the law violate the right to free expression, they argue, it was also illegally enacted – drafted and rubber-stamped by a parallel legislature that Maduro created at the time to circumvent the opposition-controlled assembly. 
The law played an important role in a nationwide election this month, Maduro's opponents say, by cowing critics who had spoken out about the government in the runup to the vote. The election, widely considered a sham by the opposition, human rights groups and most Western democracies, finally gave control of the assembly, the last part of the national government not aligned with Maduro, to his allies.
Maduro is wielding the force of the state in a widening range of ways to tighten his grip on power in the impoverished South American country, now in its eighth year of economic crisis. 
To suppress dissent in poor neighborhoods, his government deploys special police, some of whom are convicted criminals, to conduct lethal raids and intimidate citizens. To appease enfeebled security forces, police and troops are often allowed to loot, extort and commit violent crimes.
Maduro himself has been indicted by the United States for narcoterrorism and other alleged crimes. 
Now, with little effective opposition to challenge the hate legislation, and most of the courts controlled by judges also loyal to Maduro, the law could be an even more formidable tool against dissent. 
""A law like this, in the hands of a judicial power without independence, lends itself to all sorts of persecution,"" said Alberto Arteaga, a criminal law specialist at the Central University of Venezuela. ""The criminal justice system is being used as a weapon.""
Tarek Saab, the government's chief prosecutor, is one of the architects of the hate law. In a brief telephone interview, he rejected claims that the act is being used for partisan purposes. He told Reuters that the legislation is an important instrument for defusing unrest.
""The voices of violence, terrorism and crime have been completely disarmed,"" he said. Saab declined to discuss individual cases reviewed by Reuters. 
Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications with Maduro and other senior officials, didn't respond to email and telephone requests for further comment. Spokespeople at the Justice Ministry didn't respond to Reuters' queries. 
This account of the crackdowns on Urbaneja and others reviewed by Reuters is based on previously undisclosed court records and interviews with detainees, their families and their attorneys. Their cases show how the sweeping but little-understood law is being used with increasing success to jail or cow those still daring to speak out against Venezuela's government. 
One hate detainee was a university professor who went on Facebook to blame the collapse of the oil industry on Maduro's government. After his arrest, agents circulated a mug shot of the academic with his alleged weapon – a smartphone.
The arrests share similarities. 
Most targets have been authors of posts on social media, chat rooms and text-message services, many of them criticizing the government's coronavirus response. In most of the 43 cases examined by Reuters, police or intelligence agents seized suspects on false premises, claiming they wanted to discuss unrelated issues. 
And lawyers, spouses and relatives of those arrested typically said they went days or weeks unable to contact detainees, with little or no documentation from police or prosecutors. ""It was anguish,"" said Lesnee Martinez, Urbaneja's wife, who waited two months before she was allowed to visit him in jail. 
The crackdown is low-tech. 
Targets are identified not by tracking software or other technology, but by loyalists and government technicians who point out disagreeable social media posts or text messages to prosecutors. Still, the effort is quashing discussion online and in messaging platforms that until recently were safe venues for Maduro critics. 
In addition to laws used widely to allege ""conspiracy"" and ""disorder"" by government opponents, the hate legislation is proving to be an effective weapon against critics, not least because of harsh penalties for those convicted. It provides for prison terms of up to 20 years, longer than the 18-year sentence for some murder convictions. 
But most cases don't ever reach trial, Reuters found.
Instead, defendants spend indefinite periods, often months, in pre-trial detention. They receive little information about their case from prosecutors and struggle to build a defense because lawyers are kept in the dark, too. 
Releases appear arbitrary. 
In a move the government said was meant to ""promote democratic debate,"" Maduro in August pardoned over 100 people, many of them opposition activists charged with conspiracy, hate and other crimes. But the government at the time made clear that those freed could go right back to jail if they were deemed again to be committing an offense. 
At least five of the 100-plus freed had been arrested under the hate law, Reuters determined. Three of the released hate suspects told Reuters that officials sought silence in exchange for their freedom. 
Other suspects report similar treatment. 
Luis Araya, a physician in the central state of Lara, said police detained him last April after he changed his profile photo on WhatsApp, the messaging platform, to include a black ribbon and a comment, in jest, that he was ""rehearsing"" for Maduro's death. 
A judge freed him the next day, but warned him against publishing ""messages against Maduro."" His discharge document, reviewed by Reuters, orders him to check in monthly until his case goes to trial. Court officials didn't respond to Reuters requests to discuss Araya's case. 
The arbitrary nature of arrests and releases, government opponents say, makes the law especially useful in silencing opponents. ""It has generated self-censorship,"" said Marianela Balbi, director of Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, a press and free-speech advocacy group in Caracas, Venezuela's capital. ""The intention is clear: Don't challenge public officials.""
""BRING ORDER TO THIS""
The law has its origins in deadly protests that rocked Venezuela in 2017.
That March, as Maduro sought to cement control amid a worsening economic meltdown, the Supreme Court, stacked with presidential appointees, ruled that the opposition-controlled National Assembly was ""in contempt"" of the government. The court said it would assume the role of the legislature.
Protests erupted across the country. Demonstrations continued through August, when Maduro created a new body, the Constituent Assembly, to supplant the old legislature. At least 125 people died in clashes between protestors and security forces. 
That October, Maduro appeared on state television with a group of cabinet members. He asked them to find ways to curb criticism on social networks. Such posts, he said, fuelled the unrest. ""Bring order to this,"" Maduro ordered. 
Ministers and other senior officials convened to address his demand. Among them was Saab, the chief prosecutor.
Saab had assumed the position weeks before when his predecessor, Luisa Ortega, broke with Maduro over the creation of the new assembly. A former public defender, Saab, 57 years old, is widely described by opponents as one of Maduro's lead henchmen. 
He was one of 13 Maduro officials sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury that year for ""the undermining of democracy"" and waging ""rampant violence"" against protestors. Saab has called the sanctions ""a badge of honor."" 
""Venezuela's peace is guaranteed,"" Saab said in a speech upon taking the prosecutor's position. 
Right away, Saab conducted a purge of the country's prosecutors and stripped authority from those who stayed. He fired as many as 300 officials considered disloyal and shut units focused on corruption and human rights abuses, seven former prosecutors told Reuters. 
""Everything was centralized,"" said one former prosecutor. ""All instructions came from him.""
In November, Maduro personally submitted a draft of the Law Against Hate for Peaceful Coexistence to the new legislature. After a debate of less than two hours, the Constituent Assembly passed it with a unanimous show of hands. Legislators applauded and waved flags, shouting ""long live the homeland!"" 
At a news conference the following day, Saab called upon Venezuelans to denounce violators. ""Remember, now there is a very clear law in Venezuela that allows us to prosecute,"" he said. 
The law is vague, opponents objected, banning conduct such as ""promoting national hate"" without clearly defining it. Its six pages and 25 articles of text are mostly a tract on peace, tolerance, democracy and other values it ostensibly aims to protect. The legislation doesn't specify what actions, statements, or other behavior constitute hatred. 
As a result, pro-Maduro prosecutors and judges have room to allege hate as they see fit. ""It's a legal justification to do what they want,"" Ortega, the former chief prosecutor, told Reuters. Ortega left Venezuela after resigning and now lives in Colombia. 
In Saab's first two years on the job, his office pressed few charges using the law. Espacio Publico, an activist group that tracks the law's implementation, reported just four arrests for inciting hatred in 2019. 
With the law's rollout, however, the government increasingly asked teams in the Information Ministry and at the state telecommunications regulator to scan Twitter and Facebook for critical comments, according to six people familiar with those efforts. 
This year, the country's decrepit health system came under greater strain. For years, doctors and hospital administrators have angered the government by criticizing a lack of basic infrastructure and supplies – from latex gloves to running water to disinfectant. Outrage over coronavirus preparedness spurred more intense criticism. 
Even before the virus was known to be infecting South America, doctors cautioned that Venezuela's testing capacity is scant, its health data unreliable. 
Their warnings, epidemiologists say, were justified: Venezuela has since reported what appear to be unrealistically low infection figures. The country, with roughly 30 million people, has confirmed 107,177 COVID-19 cases and 949 deaths, a fraction the rate registered in neighboring Colombia and across Latin America. 
Maduro pushed back. After opposition legislators in March said the government was ill prepared for coronavirus, the president in a speech said they were seeking to ""torture Venezuelan minds."" He accused them of ""manipulating"" the pandemic for political purposes. 
Within days, prosecutors ramped up use of the law. 
On March 21, National Police officers arrived at the home of Darvinson Rojas, a freelance journalist. The day before, Rojas had challenged the government's coronavirus statistics on Twitter, citing additional COVID-19 cases that had been reported by local authorities but left out of the national count. 
The officers, Rojas said, told him there was a coronavirus case in his building and that he needed to accompany them for a test at a nearby base. Instead, officers jailed him and interrogated him about his tweets. 
At a court hearing two days later, a prosecutor charged Rojas with inciting hatred and spreading ""false information,"" according to Rojas and his attorney, Saul Blanco. Blanco told Reuters the court didn't let him read the case file and he wasn't allowed to visit Rojas in jail. 
After 12 days in a cell, a court released Rojas pending further investigation. The court barred him from leaving the country and told him to limit his reporting to conveying government statistics. Officials from the court didn't respond to requests for comment. 
He's too frightened to report much on coronavirus now, Rojas told Reuters. ""I've left the subject alone,"" he said. 
""HATE AMONG VENEZUELANS""
Giovanni Urbaneja had long irritated Belisario, the mayor of San Jose de Guanipa, a small city in the eastern state of Anzoategui. Once a staunch Socialist, Urbaneja served as a state legislator when Venezuela was governed by the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro's mentor and predecessor.
After Chavez died and Venezuela's economy imploded, Urbaneja became disillusioned. With his wife, an attorney, he set up a foundation to provide legal assistance to victims of human rights abuses. He used the platform to speak out against Maduro and other ruling party officials.
In a letter to Reuters from jail, Urbaneja, 54, said mismanagement and embezzlement had destroyed the local economy. Once a booming oil town, it is now the site of abandoned drilling rigs, shuttered stores and homes darkened by blackouts that sometimes last days. 
Urbaneja didn't cite evidence for his accusations in the letter to Reuters or in the public statements that triggered the mayor's demand for hate-law charges.
Belisario, 70, previously commanded Venezuela's National Guard. He was elected mayor in late 2017. At first, Urbaneja said he supported the new mayor, believing his military experience would help him stomp out local corruption. But soon, Urbaneja found fault. 
In a Facebook post in December 2018, Urbaneja called Belisario a ""traitor,"" alleging the mayor was letting local police rob and extort citizens. The mayor, in an official statement a few weeks later, denied the allegations. He accused Urbaneja of belonging to an ""international conspiracy"" to topple Maduro. 
Last year, Urbaneja was invited by a private local radio station to discuss the public health system. On air, he said Belisario had failed to address a recent malaria outbreak. Minutes later, a local councilman and ally of Belisario burst into the studio and punched Urbaneja repeatedly, yelling that he was tired of the criticism. 
Urbaneja, who lost consciousness in the beating, reported the assault to the office of Jairo Gil, the state prosecutor. Gil, who is the prosecutor now pursuing the hate-law case against Urbaneja, didn't respond to questions from Reuters about the attack or the current investigation of his comments about the mayor. 
Jose Nassar, the radio host, confirmed details of the assault to a local newspaper. The alleged assailant, Ruben Herrera, was never charged. Neither Nassar nor Herrera responded to requests to discuss the incident. 
The mayor, on another radio station shortly afterward, denied any involvement. ""If this man's dead body appears around here one morning,"" he said of Urbaneja, ""it won't have anything to do with me."" In his text message to Reuters, Belisario said he never ordered any physical attack against Urbaneja. 
Tensions escalated anew with coronavirus. 
In a series of Facebook posts, Urbaneja accused Belisario and other government officials of misusing public health funds. ""COVID-19 is their great business,"" he wrote on August 9. The comments prompted Belisario's request for the hate-law investigation.
In his letter to Gil, the state prosecutor, the mayor said Urbaneja's posts were particularly worrisome at a time when Maduro's government is subject to intense international and domestic opposition. ""The peace of the republic is seriously threatened,"" he wrote, by people promoting ""violence, chaos, anarchy"" and ""hate among Venezuelans.""
Previously undisclosed court documents reviewed by Reuters show that after receiving the mayor's request, Gil promptly ordered police to review Urbaneja's social media accounts. Investigators then sent Gil a report with snapshots of Urbaneja's posts. The posts, they wrote, ""were against the nation's leaders."" 
On August 20, the documents show, Gil signed the order for Urbaneja's arrest. That evening, municipal police, guns drawn, raided Urbaneja's home. Martinez, his wife, held their one-year-old daughter as the officers hauled him away, she told Reuters. 
Ever since, Urbaneja has been detained at a police base just a few blocks from Mayor Belisario's office. He hasn't been charged and has had only one court hearing so far, at which a judge authorized prosecutors to continue investigating. 
The detention, legal experts say, violates a law stipulating that suspects can only be held for 45 days without being formally charged with a crime. 
In a handwritten letter to his lawyer, Adrian Moreno, Urbaneja said guards were keeping him ""totally isolated."" To keep him from becoming a bad influence, he wrote, guards prevent him from speaking with other inmates. 

Urbaneja blames his arrest on ""desperation among officials cornered by corruption,"" he told Reuters in a separate letter. ""They are trying to silence my voice.""

1199,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",Tough Christmas lockdown looming in Netherlands,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was expected to announce a tough month-long lockdown on Monday evening, including the closing of schools and shops, according to broadcasters NOS and RTL, as his government tries to slow soaring COVID-19 infections.
Rutte held emergency meetings on Monday about the rapid rise of infections and took the unusual step of inviting the heads of all political parties in parliament to join the talks. 
He was expected to announce the tighter lockdown measures in a rare television address to the country, broadcast from his office at 1900 local time (1800GMT).
NOS and RTL cited government sources as saying that all schools and non-essential shops would be closed until Jan. 19.
This would make the lockdown stricter than the one imposed during the first COVID-19 wave between March and May, when schools were closed but shops could open.
New coronavirus infections in the country of 17 million jumped by almost 10,000 in the 24 hours through Sunday morning, data released by national health authorities showed, the biggest rise in more than six weeks.
The Netherlands has recorded more than 600,000 cases and 10,000 deaths during the coronavirus pandemic.
Other public buildings, such as museums, cinemas and zoos, will also be closed, NOS reported, along with day-care centres and barber shops. 

Despite restrictions, shopping districts across the Netherlands have been crowded for weeks, with a spike in infections after the Dec. 5 gift-giving celebrations marking the birthday of Saint Nicholas.

The charges brought by Judge Fadi Sawan last week drew strong criticism from influential parties including the Shi'ite group Hezbollah and Sunni leader Saad al-Hariri.
Some politicians have suggested that Sawan was selective in deciding who to charge, and that he overstepped his powers by charging government ministers. Others have said he showed courage.
Diab, who took office in January, has said his conscience is clear over the Aug. 4 blast, which killed 200 people, injured thousands and devasted entire districts. He quit after the disaster but has continued to serve as a caretaker premier.
The explosion, one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts on record, was caused by a massive quantity of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely for years. 
Sawan contacted Diab's office last week to request an appointment on Monday but was told that he was declining to be questioned, the official source at the prime minister's office said. Sawan could not immediately be reached for comment.
After meeting with Diab on Friday, Hariri pledged not to let anyone violate the post of prime minister - a seat reserved for a Sunni Muslim in the sectarian power-sharing system.
The three former ministers charged by Sawan are members of parties allied to Hezbollah, which said on Friday the charges smacked of ""political targeting"". Two are members of the Shi'ite Amal Movement of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.

Lebanon's senior Christian cleric, Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, said on Sunday he hoped reactions to Sawan's move would not obstruct the probe or cause ""a national division on a sectarian basis for which we do not find any justification"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Coral populations from Australia's first ""Coral IVF"" trial on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016 have not only survived recent bleaching events, but are on track to reproduce and spawn next year, researchers say.
""I'm really excited,"" said Peter Harrison, director of Southern Cross University's Marine Ecology Research Centre, who led the development of the larvae restoration technique which involves collecting coral sperm and eggs during the annual mass spawning on the reef. 
After culturing larvae in specially designed enclosures for about a week, scientists distribute them to parts of the reef damaged by bleaching and in need of live coral.
Harrison's team, working with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, first used the tactic just off Heron Island in 2016, where more than 60 corals are now on the way to being the first re-established reproducing population on the reef through Coral IVF.
""This proves that the larvae restoration technique works just as we predicted and we can grow very large corals from tiny microscopic larvae within just a few years,"" Harrison said after visiting the restoration site in early December.
The corals varied in diameter, from just a few centimetres to the size of a dinner plate, and were healthy, despite a bleaching event that hit Heron Island in March. 
The March bleaching was the reef's most extensive yet, scientists said, and the third one in five years.
Bleaching occurs when hotter water destroys the algae which corals feed on, causing them to turn white.
A recent study from James Cook University found the reef had lost more than half of its coral in the past three decades and raised concern that it is less able to recover from mass bleaching events.
The Great Barrier Reef runs 2,300 km (1,429 miles) down Australia's northeast coast spanning an area half the size of Texas. It was world heritage-listed in 1981 by UNESCO as the most extensive and spectacular coral reef ecosystem on the planet.

Mozambique's northernmost province of Cabo Delgado, home to gas developments worth some $60 billion, is grappling with an insurgency linked to Islamic State that has gathered pace this year, with insurgents regularly taking on the army and seizing entire towns.
Valentin Tapsoba, the southern African head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), said families who were rebuilding their lives after the destruction caused by Cyclone Kenneth in 2019 have had to flee from militant attacks.
""This is a situation starting in one country but if all the countries don't get their act together to tackle it and wait too long, it could spread within the sub-region,"" Tapsoba told Reuters by phone from Pempa in Mozambique.
Zimbabwe presidential spokesman George Charamba said leaders from Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana and Tanzania were set to meet in Maputo on Monday over the insurgency.
Tapsoba said 424,000 people have fled the insurgency to Niassa, Nampula and Pempa and that the number could rise. He said Mozambican authorities put the figure at 570,000.
On Friday the Mozambican government, together with UN agencies and other local non governmental groups, will launch an international appeal for funding to help those fleeing Cabo Delgado, Tapsoba said.
UNHCR had raised a third of the $19.2 million it requires for shelter, water and sanitation and food next year, said Tapsola. 
""The numbers are still growing ... so it is a very big concern,"" he said.
The onset of the rainy season could make it difficult to reach the camps where thousands are living, which would be ""a nightmare for these people,"" he added.

Main Beach at Byron Bay, a popular tourist destination in northern New South Wales state and home to Hollywood A-listers such as Chris Hemsworth, has all but disappeared, Byron Mayor Simon Richardson told media on Monday.
Television news footage showed a concrete walkway along the beach collapsing into the sea.
""Right now around Byron, we've got some severe weather, massive swells, we're watching our beach disappear,"" he said. 
""What we've got here is yet another event. An extreme weather event coming on the back of climate change that our community's dealing with. It's about the fourth or fifth major event in the last couple of years.""
The wet conditions contrast with the fierce bushfires that ravaged world heritage listed Fraser Island in Queensland state in recent weeks. On Monday, fire evacuation points on Fraser Island were underwater due to high tides and huge waves.
The heavy band of rain and wild winds, generated by an intense low pressure system off the southern Queensland coast, battered the heavily-populated border regions between NSW and Queensland for the third day bringing more than 700 millimetres (27.6 inches) of rain in some places over 48 hours.
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) warned coastal erosion, hazardous rain and huge waves off the coast would continue through Monday and urged motorists to stay off the roads.
Australia is expecting a wetter than usual summer this year due to a La Nina weather phenomenon, typically associated with greater rainfall and more tropical cyclones, though a major heat wave had sweltered the east just weeks ago.
""Major coastal erosion is ongoing along numerous beaches in northeast (NSW) and southeast Queensland as spring tides combined with large waves and gale force easterly winds eat away sand from beaches,"" BoM meteorologist Dean Narramore said.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 01:55AM ET</span>",Explainer: What hardline Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab's return means for Indonesian politics,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian police arrested firebrand Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab on Saturday on suspicion of violating coronavirus protocols after the staging of several mass gatherings since his return from self-exile in Saudi Arabia last month.
The arrest comes after six of his bodyguards were shot dead by police last week and raises further concerns about a boiling over of tensions between authorities and Islamist groups in the world’s biggest Muslim majority nation.
WHO IS RIZIEQ SHIHAB?
As head of the hardline Islamic Defender’s Front (FPI), Rizieq has for years cut a controversial figure in Indonesian politics.
He was jailed in 2008 for inciting violence and left Indonesia in 2017 after facing charges of pornography, and insulting state ideology. Those charges have since been dropped.
Formed in 1998, in the tumultuous months after president Suharto stood down, the FPI initially had close links to security forces and became notorious for raiding bars and brothels, as well as violence against minorities, and preventing a Lady Gaga concert. It has also been involved in humanitarian work after natural disasters.
But moving from the fringes it has increased its political sway and in 2016 Rizieq was a key figure in a mass movement against Jakarta’s former Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, or Ahok, who was jailed for insulting Islam.
The huge 2016 rallies raised concern about a threat to Indonesia's pluralist tradition and its secular state. President Joko Widodo, known as Jokowi, also viewed them as among the biggest threats to his government. 
In the weeks since his return, Rizieq has declared plans for a ""moral revolution"".
WHY WAS RIZIEQ ARRESTED?
After twice ignoring police summonses, Rizieq turned himself in and was arrested.
He was charged with obstruction of law enforcement, incitement of criminal acts and violation of the quarantine law. He could face a maximum six years in prison if convicted. 
The charges relate to mass events including the tens of thousands of people who showed up to greet Rizieq at the airport and his daughter’s well-attended wedding.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE SHOOTOUT?
Police say they were tailing a convoy of Rizieq supporters after hearing the FPI was preparing to mobilise. Police say they acted in self-defence when they shot the six supporters dead after firearms were pointed at them.
The FPI has described the incident as an “extrajudicial killing” and said Rizieq and his entourage were unarmed and travelling to a dawn prayer when attacked by unknown assailants. 
Amnesty International Indonesia and Indonesia Police Watch have called for an independent investigation, and Indonesia’s human rights commission has since opened a probe.
HOW BIG A FORCE IS ISLAM IN INDONESIAN POLITICS?
With nearly 90% of the population Muslim, Islam has always been important in Indonesian politics. Every president has been Muslim and the 2016 rallies saw Islam take on an increasingly prominent political role.
In a move seen as an attempt to appeal to Islamic voters, Jokowi chose cleric, Ma’ruf Amin, as his vice presidential running mate in 2019 and after the election appointed his poll opponent, Prabowo Subianto, who had backing from Islamist groups, as defence minister.
WHAT COULD HAPPEN NOW?
Political analysts say given an opposition vacuum, the pandemic and the first recession in 22 years, Rizieq could harness frustrations with the government and pose a threat.
The 55-year-old has already met with several key opposition figures and there is a sense that he could be a kingmaker in the 2024 election. 
More immediately, the police clash has seen the FPI hail the dead as 'martyrs' and call for demonstrations.
According to sources and analysts the government grossly underestimated Rizieq’s continued appeal and quickly understood it needed to carefully calibrate its response to Rizieq.

Despite a more vocal backlash from pluralists and moderate Islamic groups toward Rizieq this year, the fatal clash is unlikely to have met the careful approach the administration had been aiming for.

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 14, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>",'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' novelist John le Carre dies aged 89,"By Guy Faulconbridge
(Reuters) - ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" author John le Carre, who cast flawed spies on to the bleak chessboard of Cold War rivalry, has died aged 89.
His agent said in a statement https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/news/a-statement-from-jonny-geller-ceo-the-curtis-brown-group that David Cornwell, known to the world as John le Carre, died after a short illness in Cornwall, southwestern England, on Saturday evening.
""His like will never be seen again, and his loss will be felt by every book lover, everyone interested in the human condition,"" said Jonny Geller, CEO of The Curtis Brown Group.
Le Carre was survived by his wife, Jane, and four sons. The family said in a brief statement he had died of pneumonia.
By exploring treachery at the heart of British intelligence in spy novels, le Carre challenged Western assumptions about the Cold War by defining for millions the moral ambiguities of the battle between the Soviet Union and the West.
Unlike the glamour of Ian Fleming's unquestioning James Bond, le Carre's heroes were trapped in the wilderness of mirrors inside British intelligence which was reeling from the betrayal of Kim Philby who fled to Moscow in 1963.
""It’s not a shooting war anymore, George. That’s the trouble,"" Connie Sachs, British intelligence's resident alcoholic expert on Soviet spies, tells spy catcher George Smiley in the 1979 novel ""Smiley's People"". 
""It’s grey. Half angels fighting half devils. No one knows where the lines are,"" Sachs says in the final novel of Le Carre's Karla trilogy.
Such a bleak portrayal of the Cold War shaped popular Western perceptions of the rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States that dominated the second half of the 20th century until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
The Cold War, for le Carre, was ""A Looking Glass War"" (the name of his 1965 novel) with no heroes and where morals were up for sale - or betrayal - by spy masters in Moscow, Berlin, Washington and London. 
Betrayal of family, lovers, ideology and country run through le Carre's novels which use the deceit of spies as a way to tell the story of nations, particularly Britain's sentimental failure to see its own post-imperial decline.
Such was his influence that le Carre was credited by the Oxford English Dictionary with introducing espionage terms such as ""mole"", ""honey pot"" and ""pavement artist"" to popular English usage.
British spies were angry that le Carre portrayed the MI6 Secret Intelligence Service as incompetent, ruthless and corrupt. But they still read his novels.
Other fans included Cold War warriors such as former U.S. President George H. W. Bush and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
SOLDIER, SPY
David John Moore Cornwell was born on Oct. 19, 1931 in Dorset, England, to Ronnie and Olive, though his mother, despairing at the infidelities and financial impropriety of her husband, abandoned the family when he was five years old. 
Mother and son would meet again decades later though the boy who became le Carre said he endured ""16 hugless years"" in the charge of his father, a flamboyant businessman who served time in jail.
At the age of 17, Cornwell left Sherborne School in 1948 to study German in Bern, Switzerland, where he came to the attention of British spies.
After a spell in the British Army, he studied German at Oxford, where he informed on his left-wing students for Britain's MI5 domestic intelligence service. 
Le Carre was awarded a first-class degree before teaching languages at Eton College, Britain's most exclusive school. He also worked at MI5 in London before moving in 1960 to the Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6.
Posted to Bonn, then capital of West Germany, Cornwell fought on one of the toughest fronts of Cold War espionage: 1960s Berlin.
As the Berlin Wall went up, le Carre wrote ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,"" where a British spy is sacrificed for an ex-Nazi turned Communist who is a British mole.
""What the hell do you think spies are?,"" asks Alex Leamas, the British spy who is finally shot on the Berlin Wall.
""They're just a bunch of seedy, squalid bastards like me: little men, drunkards, queers, hen-pecked husbands, civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives.""
By casting British spies as every bit as ruthless as their Communist foes, le Carre defined the dislocation of the Cold War that left broken humans in the wake of distant superpowers.
'MOSCOW RULES'
Now rich, but with a failing marriage and far too famous to be a spy, le Carre devoted himself to writing and the greatest betrayal in British intelligence history gave him material for a masterpiece.
The discovery, which began in the 1950s with the defection of Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, that the Soviets had run spies recruited at Cambridge to penetrate British intelligence hammered confidence in the once legendary services.
Le Carre wove the story of betrayal into the Karla trilogy, beginning with the 1974 novel ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" and ending with ""Smiley's People"" (1979).
George Smiley seeks to track down a Soviet mole at the top of Britain's secret service and battles with Soviet spy master Karla, ultimate master of the mole who is sleeping with Smiley's wife.
Smiley, betrayed in love by his aristocratic wife Ann (also the name of Cornwell's first wife), traps the traitor. Karla, compromised by an attempt to save his schizophrenic daughter, defects to the West in the last book.
ABSOLUTE FRIENDS?
After the Soviet Union collapsed, leaving Russia's once mighty spies impoverished, le Carre turned his focus to what he perceived as the corruption of the U.S.-dominated world order.
From corrupt pharmaceutical companies, Palestinian fighters and Russian oligarchs to lying U.S. agents and, of course, perfidious British spies, le Carre painted a depressing - and at times polemical - view of the chaos of the post-Cold War world.
""The new American realism, which is nothing other than gross corporate power cloaked in demagogy, means one thing only: that America will put America first in everything,"" he wrote in the foreword to ""The Tailor of Panama"".
He opposed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and his anger at the United States was evident in his later novels, which sold well and were turned into popular films but did not match the mastery of his Cold War bestsellers.
But in a life of espionage how much was true?

""I am a liar,"" le Carre was quoted as saying by his biographer Adam Sisman. ""Born to lying, bred to it, trained to it by an industry that lies for a living, practised in it as a novelist.""

HANOI (Reuters) - As Vietnam's ruling Communist Party started a week-long meeting on Monday, discussion has intensified over the top leadership that will emerge and set the tone for the next five years in the fast-developing Southeast Asian country.
A government statement said the latest plenum would include discussion of ""personnel documents"" - a euphemism for deciding who holds the most important posts, which will be formally assigned at the Communist Party Congress due in January.
The congress will shape policy five years after General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong, a party ideologue, emerged to lead an anti-corruption drive after ejecting a former leadership that had closer ties to business. 
""No matter who will be elected into the new leadership, there will be more continuity than change, and Vietnam will maintain its current trajectory,"" said Le Hong Hiep, a fellow at Singapore's ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.
Trong himself, one of the most powerful Vietnamese politicians in decades, may retain an important role, but questions have been asked over the 76-year-old's health as he has appeared frail at events in recent months.
During the last congress in 2016, Trong led a move to dispose former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung. Then in 2018, he inherited the presidential role in addition to his Communist Party chief position after the incumbent president died. 
Some of the highest profile scalps to have been claimed by Trong's anti-corruption crackdown have been allies of the former premier. Most analysts expect the crackdown will continue after the congress.
NO STAND OUT CANDIDATE
Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four ""pillars"": a president, prime minister, the chief of its Communist Party and the national assembly chair.
In theory, who can ascend to the highest levels of Vietnamese politics is governed by rules and limits on age and origin. There has never been a general secretary who was not from the northern half of Vietnam, for example, and politburo members over the age of 65 should retire.
In reality, the highly secretive process revolves around building a consensus and vying for control of the party's powerful decision-making politburo. Exceptions to those rules are often therefore granted, especially if a consensus on the top candidates cannot be reached.
Another question surrounds the fate of Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, who could fight for a second term or seek to further climb the party ranks.
The 66-year-old has represented Hanoi on the world stage as the face of Vietnam's many trade deals and pushed for regional multilateralism as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year.
A friendly face to business, Phuc has boosted his economic credentials by keeping Vietnam on track to post GDP growth of 2%-3% this year, despite the catastrophic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.
Phuc has been touted as a potential contender for party chief, but other candidates with closer ties to Trong and Vietnam's powerful security ministry and military will also be lobbying for the position.
Linh Nguyen, a Singapore-based analyst at risk consultancy Control Risks, said the outcome of this congress will likely be more unpredictable than previous years.
""The main reason is that unlike in previous congresses, we haven't seen very clearly the figures for top leadership positions this time,"" Nguyen said. 

""None of the current potential candidates are really standing out, most of them are overage, and we might see more political infighting among different factions closer to the date"".

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will chair a coronavirus meeting on Monday and could further restrict a travel subsidy programme in an effort to contain mounting infections, as his approval rating plummets over the handling of the pandemic.
Suga may temporarily halt the travel campaign to the capital Tokyo and the city of Nagoya, the large industrial hub of Aichi prefecture, the prime minister's office said.
The ""Go To Travel"" campaign, aimed at boosting regional economies and helping hotels and airlines, has been effective to some extent in stimulating demand for tourism, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told a news conference.
But while the government aims to promote economic activity, it also wants to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Kato added. ""That balance depends on the situation in each region,"" he said, without elaborating further.
Despite concerns by experts that a travel campaign may in fact help spread the virus, Suga has insisted an immediate halt to the entire travel campaign is not under consideration. 
Local media on Sunday flagged cuts to the travel campaign, while Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura on Saturday said he had asked the government to extend the suspension of the tourism programme imposed on the Osaka region.
While Japan has not seen the kind of massive outbreaks that have hit the United States and parts of Europe, infections have worsened as winter has set in, particularly in regions such as the northern island of Hokkaido and the city of Osaka.
The country saw more than 3,000 new infections for the first time in one day on Saturday and Tokyo, Japan's capital and largest city, confirmed 621 new cases.
Tokyo has asked bars and restaurants to close by 10 p.m. during a three-week period that ends this week. Governor Yuriko Koike is set to extend this period, Kyodo News reported. 
Japan's government has paused the travel campaign only in two hardest-hit areas.
""If the economy is destroyed, then it can become serious trouble,"" Suga said during an online town hall on Friday.
Over the weekend, polls found public support for the prime minister has eroded over his handling of the pandemic. A Mainichi newspaper poll on Saturday had his approval rating down to 40%, a 17% point fall from last month. 

Only three months in office after his predecessor Shinzo Abe abruptly resigned due to ill health, Suga has also come under pressure because of other controversies, including his rejection of scholars on a science advisory panel.

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2020 11:15PM ET</span>",Bird flu spreads to 10th Japanese prefecture,"By Aaron Sheldrick and Yuka Obayashi
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's worst bird flu outbreak on record spread to new farms and now affects more than 20% of the country's 47 prefectures, with officials ordering cullings after more poultry deaths. 
About 11,000 birds will be slaughtered and buried after avian influenza was discovered at an egg farm in Higashiomi city in Shiga prefecture in southwestern Japan, the agriculture ministry said over the weekend. 
Another outbreak started in Kagawa prefecture, where the outbreak emerged last month, the ministry said on Monday.
The outbreak in Japan and neighbouring South Korea is one of two separate highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemics hitting poultry around the world, according the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 
Both the strain circulating in Asia and the one in Europe originated in wild birds, it said. 
""The virus found in Japan is genetically very close to the recent Korean viruses and thus related to viruses in Europe from early 2020, not those currently circulating in Europe,"" Madhur Dhingra, a senior animal health officer at the FAO, told Reuters by email.
""This means that we currently have two distinct H5N8 HPAI epidemics in eastern Asia and Europe,"" she said. 
The FAO has issued an alert to African health authorities for heightened surveillance of farms to avoid the spread of the more recent European strain there.
In Japan, 10 of the country's 47 prefectures have been affected in the outbreak, with around 3 million birds culled to date, a record number.
All farms in Japan were earlier ordered to disinfect facilities and check hygiene regimes, and ensure that nets to keep out wild birds are installed properly, agriculture ministry officials told Reuters this week.
Japan has suspended poultry imports from seven countries, including Germany.
Japan has an egg-laying flock of about 185 million hens and a broiler population of 138 million head, according to the ministry of agriculture.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the cabinet had agreed in principle for the trans-Tasman, quarantine free travel bubble pending confirmation from the Australian cabinet, and no significant changes in circumstances of either countries. 
""It is our intention to name a date ... in the New Year once remaining details are locked down,"" Ardern said at a news conference in the capital city Wellington. 
New Zealand's has virtually eliminated COVID-19 within its borders by enforcing a tough lockdown and keeping its borders shut to all foreigners for most part of the year.
Ardern said more work was needed to ensure safe travels and New Zealand would move cautiously to finalise arrangements like managing airline crew, segregating travellers and others.
""Of course we want to progress on these issues including quarantine-free travel but we haven't taken risks before as that means New Zealanders won't be able to keep their freedom and I certainly don't want to take those risks right now,"" Ardern said.
A trans-Tasman travel bubble has been under discussions for months and many Australian regions have allowed New Zealanders to travel without quarantine requirements since October, but New Zealand had not reciprocated this move.
Australia also closed its international borders early in the pandemic and now, apart from New Zealanders, only allows returning Australian citizens to fly into the country.
Last week, New Zealand and the Cook Islands agreed to open a quarantine-free travel bubble by March next year, which was its first reciprocal travel bubble.
Reflecting on 2020 in her final post-cabinet press conference for the year, Ardern said it was a ""a year no one would have imagined"".
She said New Zealanders desperately want a break, adding that recent progress made on a COVID-19 vaccine was nothing less than remarkable. She said for 2021 everyone is trying to be as optimistic as possible. 

When asked to describe 2020 in two words, she gave one: ""horrendous"".

1212,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 13, 2020 10:40PM ET</span>","Australian state says work from home is over, but employees still shun office","SYDNEY (Reuters) - A work from home order to combat coronavirus in Australia's most populous state ended on Monday, a milestone for a country with very low COVID-19 numbers, but many companies plan to keep flexible work arrangements into 2021.
New South Wales (NSW) state, home to the country's biggest city Sydney, said it was going ahead with a plan to lift the public health order that has been in place most of the year as it reported no new local coronavirus infections for a 10th straight day.
But the move appeared to be symbolic since the state's employers, which include many of the country's biggest companies, and workers had no plans for an immediate change from work from home arrangements, 10 days from the start of the Christmas holiday period.
""There's still a big mountain to climb in terms of people coming back,"" said Jane Fitzgerald, executive director of the Property Council of Australia's NSW unit, by telephone.
The property council said Sydney central business district occupancy was currently 45%, compared to more than 90% before the pandemic. Two-thirds of property council members expected a ""material increase"" in CBD occupancy after three months or longer. 
The change puts NSW, home to a third of Australia's 25 million population, ahead of other states and territories in resuming pre-COVID arrangements for the white collar workforce.
Just Victoria state, the second most populous state, now has restrictions on office workers, with a 25% attendance limit, while most other states and territories have a general directive for employers to let workers log in from home if they prefer.
NSW said it was still encouraging employers to stagger start and finish times and advise staff to wear a mask on public transport.
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY), one of the country's biggest companies, which has headquarters in Sydney, said it would start returning to the workplace but ""we'll be working with our people on an approach that is successful for our customers, for teams and for individuals"". 

Australia has reported just over 28,000 cases of COVID-19 and 908 deaths since the pandemic began but estimates there are 56 active cases remaining, mostly returned travelers from overseas in hotel quarantine.

At least 40,000 Venezuelans live in Trinidad and Tobago, the majority fleeing their country's economic crisis, unemployment and lack of basic public services, often traveling in small rickety boats above their capacity, with limited supplies of fuel and food. 
Last year, at least two ships that set off from Venezuela en route to the archipelago disappeared at sea.
The bodies were found on Saturday, 7 nautical miles off the Venezuelan coastal town of Guiria, the Venezuela government statement said.
It added that the first 11 bodies appeared late on Saturday afternoon, while the bodies of two men and one woman appeared on Sunday. No one has come forward to formally report the disappearances, it said. 
Venezuelan authorities are investigating, the statement added, and they have not ruled out the possible involvement of criminal groups in the Guiria area. 
Trinidad and Tobago's statement said preliminary information suggested the lives lost could be related to a boat that left Guiria, in the northeast of Sucre state, on Dec. 6 with more than 20 people on board who have not been seen or heard from since. 
Omalirves, who did not provide her last name, said she had warned her friend Noebis Aspudillo, 27, who had been a passenger on the boat, about the precarious journey. Aspudillo had gotten increasingly desperate during the pandemic, Omalirves said, after she was laid off from the bread shop where she worked and her mother's heart condition got increasingly severe. 
Venezuela's prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Trinidad and Tobago's coast guard said it had not intercepted any vessels in the past week leaving from Guiria and that authorities were working with Venezuela in a joint search effort.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gunman shouting ""Kill me!"" opened fire from the steps of New York City's Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine just after an outdoor choir performance there on Sunday, and was himself shot dead by police, according to police and a Reuters photographer at the scene.
No one else was struck by gunfire thanks to quick action by three officers on the scene who confronted the suspect, New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea told reporters following the late-afternoon violence on Manhattan's Upper West Side.
The suspect, who was not identified, was struck at least once in the head during the gun battle and was rushed to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Shea said police fired a total of 15 rounds at the suspect.
Police recovered two semiautomatic handguns from the scene, and a bag apparently belonging to the suspect that contained a full can of gasoline, rope, wire, several knives, a Bible and tape, according to Shea.
""I think we can all surmise the ill intentions of the proceeds of this bag,"" he added. 
The shooting occurred outside the landmark cathedral for the Episcopal Diocese of New York, located at Amsterdam Avenue and West 112th Street, about 15 minutes after the conclusion of an outdoor choir performance on the church steps attended by about 200 people. 
The choir's annual Christmas holiday concert had been moved outside in keeping with COVID-19 health safety rules. The performers and most of the audience had either gone inside the church or left before the shooting began, Shea said.
Only about 15 people were still present when the gunman appeared at the top of the steps, screaming, ""Kill me,"" and ""shoot me,"" as he fired a handgun, sending bystanders running for cover in panic, according to a Reuters photographer who was on the scene.
Police officers who had taken cover ordered the suspect several times to drop his weapon before shooting him, the photographer said. Members of the choir were already back inside the church by the time of the shooting, which lasted several minutes, she said.
""Thankfully, this year with COVID, there was a much smaller event than normal,"" Shea said at the scene. ""It is by the grace of God today that we don’t have anyone struck."" 
Reuters photographs of the gunman showed him wearing a black winter coat, a white baseball-style cap and a face mask emblazoned with the flag of the Dominican Republic, as he stood wielding two pistols, one in each hand. He also was carrying a large backpack strapped to his shoulders. 
Footage from local news media showed police searching a car parked nearby as well.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter that ""quick action of our NYPD officers kept the crowd safe.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Crowds flooded the streets of several Italian cities on Sunday, forcing police to close off popular sites such as Rome's Trevi fountain, while the government debated which restrictions to enforce over the Christmas holiday period.
Italy on Saturday overtook Britain as the European nation with the highest death toll with a total of 64,520 COVID-19 fatalities. 
Almost 1 in 30 Italians have been infected since February, when Italy became the first Western country hit by the pandemic.
The easing of some restrictions Rome had imposed last month to fight a resurgence of the coronavirus brought crowds of shoppers to many sun-bathed city centres on Sunday, heightening concerns about a possible spike in infections in January.
Germany will close most shops from Wednesday until at least Jan. 10, after reporting 321 COVID-19 deaths and 20,200 new cases on Sunday. 
""All the main information websites today are full of pictures of city centres awash with unacceptable large gatherings,"" Domenico Arcuri, Italy's special commissioner for the healthcare emergency, told TV programme's Che Tempo Che Fa.
""We don't want to see those again ... we must avoid the third wave at all costs. It would be really complicated to launch the vaccination campaign amid a resurgence in cases.""
Arcuri said Italy hoped to kick off the campaign between Jan. 12 and 15.
At an emergency meeting on Sunday, the government discussed whether to loosen a ban that currently prevents people from leaving their hometown on Christmas day, allowing an exception for small towns. 
Vincenzo De Luca, governor of Naples' badly hit Campania region, said he would fight such a step. 

""If the government allows free movement of people for towns with less than 5,000 inhabitants we'll need to open a ward for democratic madness at the prime minister's residence,"" he told Che Tempo Che Fa.

Ahmady was also fined 600,000 euros ($727,000) - the sum Iranian authorities said he received for his research from institutions accused of seeking to topple Iran's Islamic government, Tasnim reported.
There was no immediate official comment on the sentence, which was also reported by other Iranian news agencies and a human rights groups, as well as by Ahmady's lawyer, who said that he would appeal.
""Ahmady was accused of acquiring illicit property from his cooperation in implementing subversive institutions' projects in the country,"" Tasnim said.
Ahmady, an ethnic Kurd who had researched controversial issues such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM) in Iran, was detained in August 2019 but released on bail three months later, according to human rights groups.
Ahmady said on Twitter he had been denied access to a lawyer during his detention.
""Contrary to all...hope for a fair trial, I was sentenced after being denied access to a lawyer during 100 days of detention and extrajudicial interrogations, and after two unprofessional trial sessions full of judicial violations,"" Ahmady tweeted.
Ahmady's lawyer, Amir Raesian, said his client had received an eight-year sentence for ""collaborating with a hostile government"".
""We will present an appeal request against this ruling and we are still hopeful,"" Raesian said on Twitter.
The reason for the apparent discrepancy about the length of Ahmady's sentence was not immediately clear.
After Ahmady's arrest, his wife told the New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran that his work was independent and published with government approval. 
Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting dozens of dual nationals to try to win concessions from other countries - a charge that the Islamic republic has regularly dismissed.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - The leaders of an anti-government alliance urged tens of thousands of supporters at a rally on Sunday to join a march to the Pakistani capital next months to demand the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who they say was installed by the military in a rigged 2018 election. 
An alliance of 11 major opposition parties - Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) - has been holding mammoth rallies in since its inception in September to seek Khan's ouster and press the military to stop interfering in politics. 
""The time to have a dialogue is over. There will be a march now,"" said opposition leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of the late former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. 
He ruled out the possibility of any dialogue with Khan or the military unless fresh elections were announced.
Khan, who says the protest campaign is aimed at blackmailing him into dropping corruption cases against its leaders, has criticised the rallies amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The opposition, which has held six mammoth rallies in recent months, says it plans to put pressure on the government to call a fresh election. The next election is due in 2023. 
Pakistan has reported 72 coronavirus deaths and 3,369 infections in the last 24 hours, the highest numbers since June. 
The protest campaign come as the country's economy struggles with high inflation and negative growth, which the opposition blames on Khan and the military.
""Who else do we blame,"" asked former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, addressing the rally via a video link from his home in London where he has been living since he left on a medical bail late last year.
Sharif after he fell out with the generals was convicted in 2018 on corruption charges. 
""Don't use the military's institution for your political ends,"" Sharif urged the military generals.

ADDIS ABABA/KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok visited Ethiopia briefly on Sunday with what three senior Sudanese government officials said was an offer to broker a ceasefire in its northern Tigray region, a proposal Ethiopia said was unnecessary because fighting had stopped.
Hamdok, who was accompanied by Sudanese security officials, planned to present his concerns about threats to Sudan's security along its border with Tigray during the visit, the officials said. However, Hamdok returned within a few hours from what Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed had earlier described as a two-day trip.
Fighting erupted on Nov. 4 between Ethiopia's government and the then-governing party in Tigray, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and more than 950,000 displaced, some 50,000 of them into Sudan, according to U.N. estimates.
Abiy government declared victory over the TPLF after its forces took control of the regional capital, Mekelle, on Nov. 29. The TPLF has said it is continuing to fight from mountains surrounding Mekelle.
Accounts from all sides are near-impossible to verify because most communications to Tigray have been down since the conflict began. The government has restricted access for journalists and foreign aid agencies. 
Abiy welcomed Hamdok, and later tweeted that he and the Sudanese delegation had good discussions, ""during which we reached an understanding on various issues that will further augment cooperation between our two countries"". 
He made no mention of an offer from Sudan to broker a ceasefire or mediate the Tigray conflict.
""Mediate what?"" Billene Seyoum, Abiy's spokeswoman, said when asked by Reuters for information about this offer.
""The military altercation has ceased with the command of Mekelle ... The provisional administration has [been] set up and a regional council formed in Tigray."" 
""Remnants of the criminal clique have fled,"" she added, referring to the TPLF.
Reuters has been unable to contact TPLF officials for nearly a week.
The first non-governmental aid convoy since fighting started arrived in Mekelle on Saturday, and a government-appointed transitional administration said it would take office on Sunday. 
Sudan's cabinet said that Hamdok and Abiy had agreed to resume negotiations within the next week about the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, an issue that has caused tensions between the two countries.
Ethiopia says electricity from the $4 billion dam will help create jobs but Sudan and Egypt worry it will restrict their access to Nile waters.
Hamdok and Abiy also agreed to call a meeting of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African regional bloc that Hamdok currently chairs, the Sudanese cabinet said in a statement.
Ethiopia has rebuffed previous offers to mediate in the Tigray conflict, including from the African Union. It accuses the TPLF of leading a renegade administration that launched a surprise attack on federal troops stationed in Tigray on Nov. 4. TPLF leaders deny they started the conflict.

Regional experts have suggested that Sudan could use its control over key border crossings as leverage to press both sides in Ethiopia to talk. But there are no public signs it is doing so.

More than 300 students from the all-boys Government Science school in Kankara taken Friday night remained missing on Sunday. 
""We will not rest until we see the end of this,"" state spokesman Abdul Labaran told Reuters.
Labaran said military and intelligence chiefs were in Kankara to lead the rescue. While 321 students were missing, he said some could have gone home to other states. 
All state schools in Katsina were ordered to close because officials did not know the attackers' motives, the education commissioner said. 
Abubakar Lawal came from Zaria, a city 120 kilometres (75 miles) south of Kanara. Two of his three sons at the school were among the missing.
""From yesterday I was here, praying that the almighty Allah should rescue our people,"" he said outside the dusty school grounds.
One of his missing sons, 17-year-old Buhari, was named after President Muhammadu Buhari, a native of Katsina state. 
Yahaya, 17, told Reuters he escaped on Saturday. He gave only one name for fear of reprisals. He said he sneaked away while the kidnappers transferred students to different locations in the forest. 
""We met someone with motorcycle who brought us to a nearby village,"" He said. ""From there someone bought us to Kankara.""
He said group leaders told the men not to harm them. 
Attacks by armed gangs, widely known as bandits, are common throughout northwestern Nigeria. The groups attack civilians, stealing or kidnapping them for ransom. Islamist militants are more common in the northeast. 

There is growing anger with the precarious security situation in Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. Late last month, Islamist militants killed scores of farmers in northeastern Borno, beheading some of them.

Tebboune, 75, appeared in a video posted on Twitter and broadcast on state television. He said he is expected to make a complete recovery within three weeks at the latest.
""I'm recovering...I will recover my physical capacities in a week, two weeks or three weeks,"" he said. ""We will soon be in the country to continue building a new Algeria."" 
Elected in December last year to succeed Abdelaziz Bouteflika who resigned after mass protests, Tebboune has promised to carry out political and economic reforms in the North African country, an OPEC member.
Early last month, Algerians approved changes to the constitution aimed at giving more powers to the parliament and prime minister as well as boosting political freedoms, although voter turnout was very low.
Tebboune said he had asked his staff at the presidency to coordinate with the election authority to prepare for a new election law, adding this law would pave the way for the post-constitution period.
""I have been following what is taking place in Algeria on a daily basis,"" he said.

Since taking office Tebboune has announced plans to reform the economy and diversify it away from oil and gas, seeking to ease financial pressure caused by a fall in energy revenue - which accounts for 60% of the state budget and 94% of total export revenue.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A U.S.-funded project using satellites to track and publish water levels at Chinese dams on the Mekong river was launched on Monday, adding to the superpowers' rivalry in Southeast Asia.
The 4,350-km (2,700-mile) waterway - known as the Lancang in China and flowing south through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam - has become a focus of competition.
Beijing has dismissed U.S. research saying Chinese dams have retained water to the detriment of downstream nations, where 60 million people depend on the river for fishing and farming.
The Mekong Dam Monitor, part-funded by the State Department, uses data from cloud-piercing satellites to track levels of dams in China and other countries. 
The information will be open for everyone in near real-time.
A separate indicator of ""surface wetness"" is to show which parts of the region are wetter or drier than usual: a guide to how much natural flows are being affected by the dams.
""The monitor provides evidence that China's 11 mainstream dams are sophisticatedly orchestrated and operated in a way to maximize the production of hydropower for sale to China’s eastern provinces with zero consideration given to downstream impacts,"" said Brian Eyler of the Washington-based Stimson Center, a global think tank which operates the virtual water gauges.
'POSITIVE BENEFITS'
China has been critical of past research, including a study by Eyes on Earth - part of the Mekong Dam Monitor project - which said water had been held back in 2019 as other countries suffered severe drought.
""The United States has been unable to provide good evidence throughout,"" the state-backed China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute said in a Dec. 4 report.
""The positive benefits of upstream Lancang river hydropower on downstream Mekong neighbours are clear and obvious,"" it said, adding that water stored in reservoirs during the flood season helped prevent both downstream floods and droughts.
China agreed earlier this year to share water data with the Mekong River Commission (MRC) - an advisory body to Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam that had long sought the information for better planning.
China and the United States have rival bodies working with Mekong countries: the Beijing-based Lancang-Mekong Cooperation and the Mekong-U.S. Partnership.

The two nations are also at odds in the South China Sea, where Washington challenges Beijing's claim to most of the waterway, a major conduit for trade that is also rich in energy resources.

""The fire has not been contained but is under control. Its smoke is irritating, but it is not enough to injure anyone, and flames have not reached people's homes,"" Khosro Kiani, an emergency official in southwestern Iran, where the blaze occurred, told the semi-official news agency Tasnim. 
Kiani said the oil had spilled down a hard-to-access valley, which firefighting equipment could not reach. 
The oil ministry's news agency SHANA said repair teams had shut off the Maroun pipeline, which feeds the Isfahan refinery, Iran's second largest with a capacity of about 375,000 barrels per day. 
Iran's ageing oil infrastructure has been long in need of rehabilitation, as refurbishment plans have been delayed by Western sanctions and local bureaucracy, analysts say.

There have been several earlier instances of spillage from the pipeline that have adversely affected the region's agriculture and fishing, the state news agency IRNA reported.

Belarus, a country of 9.5 million that Russia sees as a security buffer against NATO, has been rocked by mass protests since an Aug. 9 presidential election that Lukashenko said he won. His opponents say the vote was rigged.
More than 120 marches took place in the Belarus capital Minsk and other cities on Sunday, with numbers at each ranging from dozens to several hundred, according to local news outlet Nasha Niva. Police regularly arrest participants, issuing numbers of detainees on Mondays.
Some protesters marched in outlying residential areas of Minsk, waving white flags with a red stripe in the middle, a symbol of the opposition, and shouting ""long live Belarus"".
More than 30,000 people have been detained in Belarus since the start of the protests in August, according to opposition leaders.

Lukashenko has been in power for 26 years. The European Union imposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 50 Belarusian officials in protest over the election the West says was rigged and over Lukashenko's crackdown on opponents.

Separately, authorities in Armenia said six of their servicemen had been wounded in what they described as an Azeri military offensive that took place on Saturday.
The Baku government said the clashes, which also left two Azeri servicemen wounded, had taken place in an area that fell under its control when the fighting ended on Nov. 10 and territory in Nagorno-Karabakh previously controlled by ethnic Armenians was handed over to Azerbaijan.
It said the military operation on Friday and Saturday aimed to destroy or drive out enemy forces responsible for the deadly attacks on Azeri servicemen.
Yerevan said Armenian forces had repelled attempted intrusions into territories supposed to remain under the control of the rebel province's government, namely the Hin Tagher and Khtsaberd villages.

With as much as 475 millimetres (18.7 inches) of rain in the previous 24 hours, the Bureau of Meteorology issued a ""severe weather warning"" for the border area between New South Wales and Queensland states, a heavily populated area that includes the Queensland state capital Brisbane.
A week earlier, nearby Fraser Island was evacuated due to bushfires, dashing hopes that wetter weather would make seasonal fires less catastrophic than last year. Scientists attribute the erratic weather in the early Australian summer to a La Nina pattern - which typically features strong rain - combined with climate change. 
Fraser Island, the world's largest sand island, is now under the flood warning, which includes urging drivers to avoid roads where waters were already rising.
""These are dynamic weather systems and you should always expect the unexpected,"" bureau senior flood hydrologist Justin Robinson told a news conference.
The warning comes soon after Queensland opened its border to the neighbouring state after months of closure due to COVID-19. The authorities urged people travelling for end-of-year holidays to exercise caution since they may not be familiar with flood-prone areas.
""It isn't a time to take a chance and drive through those floodwaters,"" said New South Wales emergency services commissioner Carlene York. ""Be aware of your surroundings and where you might be parking your caravan or you may be driving.""
Emergency services had rescued four people, including some from cars trapped on flooded roads, and received about 700 calls for help, she said.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) -Tens of thousands of Indian farmers on Sunday intensified their protests against three new agricultural laws aimed at overhauling food grain procurement and pricing rules by allowing private companies direct access to the vast agrarian sector.
Angry farmers staged demonstrations near New Delhi after rejecting Prime Minister Narendra Modi's assurances that the laws would double farmers' income.
Six rounds of talks between government officials and farmer union leaders have failed to resolve the challenge faced by Modi's government.
""Hundreds of farmers will launch a tractor trolley march to New Delhi to voice our grievances against the new laws,"" said Kamal Preet Singh Pannu, a leader of Sanyukta Kisan Andolan (United Farmers' Protest), one of 30 groups against the laws.
""Government wants to discredit and crush our movement, but we will continue to protest peacefully,"" Pannu said.
Local authorities increased security measures, deploying police and putting up barricades to prevent farmers from entering New Delhi in large numbers. Opposition parties and some senior economists have lent support to the protests.
""I've now studied India's new farm bills & realize they are flawed and will be detrimental to farmers,"" Kaushik Basu, a former chief economic adviser to the federal government, wrote on Twitter.
""Our agriculture regulation needs change, but the new laws will end up serving corporate interests more than farmers. Hats off to the sensibility & moral strength of India's farmers,"" Basu said.
The farmers are protesting the three laws that the government says are meant to overhaul procurement procedures and grant them more options to sell their produce.

Ministers from Modi's government at an industry event on Saturday in New Delhi appealed to leading industrialists and businesses to explain the benefits of the new laws to farmers.

Malaysia has made several record busts of crystal meth in recent years. Authorities have said the intercepted shipments were part of a multibillion-dollar illicit drug trade that stretches across Australia, Southeast Asia and China. 
The latest discovery came on Wednesday when a Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) patrol encountered a recreational boat moving suspiciously off Penang island, MMEA Director-General Mohamad Zubil Mat Som said in a statement. 
A chase ensued when the boat's lone occupant, a 26-year-old Malaysian man, refused orders to stop. 
He then attempted to escape by jumping into the water but was later arrested, Mohamad Zubil said. 
Officials inspecting the boat found 130 sacks containing 2,118 kg (2.12 tonnes) of crystal methamphetamine disguised as packets of Chinese tea. 
The origin and destination of the drugs are still under investigation. The tea packaging, though, was similar to that found in previous shipments suspected to have come from Myanmar, Mohamad Zubil told Reuters. 
""This is the biggest seizure in MMEA's 15-year history,"" he said. 
Crystal methamphetamine is a highly addictive synthetic drug also known as speed, shabu and yaba. 
""As big as two-plus tonnes is - and it's massive - the syndicates that run the drug trade in Asia can easily replace shipments like this,"" said Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asian regional representative for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

Jemaah Islamiah's stated aim is to build an Islamic caliphate in Southeast Asia. 
Zulkarnaen, one of the commanders of the Bali attack, was arrested on Thursday by anti-terrorism police, spokesman Ahmad Ramadhan said in a statement on Saturday.
He said the officers met no resistance.
Reuters was unable to reach Zulkarnaen or find out whether he had any legal representation. According to a U.N. Security Council report, he also goes by the name Aris Sumarsono.
Zulkarnaen is believed to have been involved in making the bombs that were used in the Bali attacks and in the bombing of the J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta in 2009 that killed nine people. 
Jemaah Islamiah's former leader Para Wijayanto was arrested in 2019.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition, led by Juan Guaido, on Saturday concluded a ""popular consultation"" to repudiate President Nicolas Maduro's government after boycotting a congressional vote last Sunday. 
The consultation started virtually on Monday and ended with in-person participation. With 87% of responses reviewed, the opposition said just under 6.5 million people participated. Of those, over 3 million voted in person, and 2.4 million online. Close to 845,000 Venezuelans abroad took part, the opposition reported. 
The effort was aimed at helping the opposition demonstrate a broad rejection of Maduro, but it does not offer a clear path toward a change of government.
The legislative elections returned Maduro's allies to congress despite an economy in ruins, aggressive U.S. sanctions that stifle the OPEC nation's oil exports and the migration of some 5 million citizens. The Maduro government said 5.2 million Venezuelans voted in the election.
Congress was the last state institution not in the hands of the ruling Socialist Party. 
The idea of a popular consultation was proposed in August by Guaido, who is recognized by dozens of countries as Venezuela's legitimate president following Maduro's disputed 2018 re-election. 
Opposition leaders and most Western nations said the election was stacked in favor of Maduro, who has been widely criticized for his human rights record and for undermining democracy to stay in power.
On Thursday, Maduro said that ""no internet consultation has constitutional status... No one could think that an internet consultation has legal value.""
Blanca Marmol, a former supreme court magistrate who helped organize the popular consultation, told a news conference, ""This is, I want to emphasize, the last resource we have in the constitution.""
Organizers on Saturday reported incidents in 11 of Venezuela's 24 states, with police and ruling party supporters removing some opposition sites for the informal vote.
Marco Blanco, a 54-year-old taxi driver in the western Caracas neighborhood of Catia, said he was unaware of the vote.

1235,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2020 07:16PM ET</span>",Malaysia's Top Glove fired whistleblower before virus outbreak,"By Liz Lee and A. Ananthalakshmi
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Yubaraj Khadka, a worker in Malaysia for Top Glove Corp, took two photos in May of fellow employees crowding into a factory of the world’s biggest maker of medical-grade latex gloves. 
As the coronavirus pandemic raged, the photos seen by Reuters show dozens of workers lined up less than a metre apart to have their temperatures checked before starting the night shift as a precaution against the disease. 
The company required everyone to wear masks and gloves, but Khadka and five other workers told Reuters that social distancing was not enforced or followed outside the factory. 
Afraid of losing his job if he complained directly to management, Khadka, 27, sent the photos to a workers’ rights campaigner in his native Nepal who sent them on to the company and the Malaysian government, without identifying who took them. 
On Sept. 23, Top Glove sent Khadka a letter terminating his employment for sharing the photos. In the letter, seen by Reuters, the company said it identified him as the originator of the photos from CCTV coverage of workers entering the factory. 
Fast-forward almost three months, Top Glove’s complex of factories and dormitories in Klang, 40 km (25 miles) west of Kuala Lumpur, has become Malaysia’s biggest coronavirus cluster with more than 5,000 infections, about 94% of them foreigners, the country’s health ministry said in a statement on Dec. 1. 
Top Glove did not comment on that number at the time. It said on Wednesday that a total of 5,147 workers in its Klang factories have tested positive. 
The episode is another indicator of how the risk of infection by the virus has fallen most heavily on poorer, manual workers in crowded facilities across the world, from meat-packing plants to shipping warehouses.
On Nov. 23, Malaysia’s government ordered Top Glove to begin shutting its factories in stages, so workers could be tested. The country’s Labour Department said earlier this month it would file charges against Top Glove over its worker accommodation, which it found to be cramped and poorly ventilated.
""There was no one-metre distancing. That's what I wanted to show,"" Khadka told Reuters from Nepal, where he is looking for work. ""Even at the factory, after the first few months (of infections in Malaysia), the social distancing markers were thrown out."" 
After he was dismissed from his job as a quality assessor, he made his own way back to Nepal, paying $400 for his flight home and another $70 for a coronavirus test. It came back negative.
Top Glove told Reuters in a statement on Monday that it introduced temperature screening and more regular sanitisation of factories, offices, transport vehicles and dormitories at the beginning of the pandemic, and that it is in the process of improving its workers’ accommodation. “Our 21,000 workforce is the backbone and foundation of the company and crucial to our mission of ensuring safe human protection globally,” the company said. 
None of the workers has died. Top Glove said on Wednesday during its financial results call that 94% of workers tested are now fit to return to work. 
The company told Reuters it resolved matters with Khadka amicably, but declined to comment further on the issues raised by his photos and by a complaint from the workers’ rights campaigner, Andy Hall. 
Five current workers who spoke to Reuters corroborated Khadka’s account. They said that from March they were given masks, face shields and sanitisers, and markers were placed on factory floors to help maintain distance between workers. But they said there was no consistent enforcement of the rules and it was hard to maintain distancing in production areas, where they had to work closely in groups of two and three, and in packing areas where up to a dozen people have to work together.
Hall, 41, said he sent the photos to officials at Malaysia’s trade and health ministries and did not receive a reply. A Malaysia health ministry report in May said Top Glove's coronavirus prevention measures were ""very satisfactory,"" although it noted that social distancing in its factories could be improved and more hand sanitiser provided. Malaysia’s health ministry has not commented publicly since then on the conditions inside Top Glove’s factories. It did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters. 
The Malaysian government did not respond to questions from Reuters. 
HARD TO DISTANCE 
Top Glove makes a quarter of the world’s medical rubber gloves, up to about 250 million per day. Its profits have surged during the pandemic. 
For the financial year ended in August, the company reported a net profit of $470 million, more than five times the $90 million the year before. Its market value peaked at almost $20 billion in early August. The company said in September it was exploring listing its shares in Hong Kong. 
It runs 47 plants in all, 41 in Malaysia and the remainder in Thailand, China and Vietnam. Thirty-six of them produce gloves. It has about 16,000 factory employees, just over half of them in factories in Klang. Almost all of them are migrant workers from Bangladesh and Nepal, earning the minimum wage of $295 per month.
Production continued at Top Glove’s factories, according to the workers interviewed by Reuters, even after a spike of infections in migrant worker dormitories in neighbouring Singapore. 
The workers said canteens and entrances to the factories were often crowded, as were the buses to their dormitories, where up to 20 people live in one room. Photos taken by workers, seen by Reuters, show clothes and towels hung from bed frames, and food, dishes and electrical appliances stored under and around bunk beds. People seen in the photos of the dormitories are not wearing masks. 
The dormitories are provided by Top Glove. The company did not reply to questions from Reuters about the number of people living in the rooms. Since the outbreak, the company has moved some workers into hotels temporarily, but they will eventually move back to the dormitories. Top Glove told Reuters that wearing masks was mandatory for workers, but did not specify whether that included in dormitories. 
""We are mindful there is much more to be done to uplift the standard of our employee welfare and promise to rectify shortcomings immediately,"" Top Glove said in its quarterly earnings statement on Wednesday. 
It said it has spent about $5 million buying apartments for workers in the last two months and is renting more houses for them. It said it has earmarked about $25 million for investment in workers’ facilities and accommodation, including what it called ""mega-hostels.""
The workers, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their jobs, said there was no regular testing for coronavirus. Top Glove said on Wednesday that prior to the outbreak, workers were only tested before they flew home, in line with the requirements of most airlines. 
PRESSURE TO PRODUCE
Business started to boom for Top Glove in the first months of this year, as coronavirus infections spread across the globe.
The Malaysian government imposed strict lockdown measures in mid-March, in an effort to contain the country’s first big outbreak, which limited Top Glove to operating with only half its staff. 
Weeks later, Top Glove and many other Malaysian businesses deemed as essential were given exemptions by the government and allowed to operate with full staff.
The European Union, desperate for more gloves, had pressed hard for the exemption, as did other customers. Then-EU ambassador to Malaysia, Maria Castillo Fernandez, wrote to Malaysia’s Trade Minister Azmin Ali on March 25, saying: ""Any effort to exceptionally maintain full production of this particular sector with global implications will be greatly appreciated."" According to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, she suggested running factories 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
Fernandez, who now has a different EU role, declined to comment. EU representatives in Kuala Lumpur and Brussels declined to comment on the letter. Malaysia’s trade ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the letter from Reuters. 
""Almost every country in the world was panicking,"" said one senior executive in Malaysia’s rubber glove industry who does not work for Top Glove. ""We told the embassies, 'If you want us to help you, we want you to help us lobby our government to allow the glove industry to operate.'""
Once full operation was resumed in March, Khadka and five other Top Glove workers say supervisors told them to work harder and set bigger targets for production and packing as the company scrambled to fulfil demand. The company said it ramped up production and paid workers about $2 for every hour they voluntarily worked on what was supposed to be their one rest day per week. 
Even with imminent coronavirus vaccines, and the closure of some factories, Top Glove's business outlook is strong. Analysts expect profit for the current financial year to more than quadruple, based on rising demand for gloves. On Wednesday, Top Glove posted a record quarterly net profit. 

The day before, Reuters witnessed hundreds of workers lining up closely to exit one of the factories in Klang, using two fingerprint readers to mark their exit. There was no social distancing in effect and no hand sanitisers next to the fingerprint reader.

The religious branch of the co-ruling PJD party, the Unity and Reform Movement (MUR), said in a statement the move was ""deplorable"" and denounced ""all attempts at normalisation and the Zionist infiltration."" The Islamist PJD party was more nuanced, endorsing King Mohammed VI's actions support for the Palestinian cause while reiterating the party's ""firm position against the Zionist occupation."" 
Unlike its government coalition partners who backed the deal, it took the PJD two days to react after disagreements emerged between the party's senior leadership, according to a source close to the matter. 
A core element of the deal brokered by President Donald Trump was U.S. recognition of Morocco's claim to sovereignty over the Western Sahara. A decades-old territorial dispute has pitted Morocco against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, which seeks to establish an independent state.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel established relations on Saturday with Bhutan, a majority-Buddhist nation neighbouring India, as it looks to continue to expand its diplomatic links internationally.
Israel's accord with the Himalayan country did not appear to be related to its budding ties under U.S.-sponsored accords with Arab and Muslim countries, though Israeli officials sought to portray it as evidence of its growing acceptance abroad.
The agreement follows several years of secret contacts between Israel and Bhutan with the aim of establishing relations, Israel's foreign ministry said in a statement. 
""Israel's circle of recognition is growing and expanding,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said. ""The establishment of relations between us and the Kingdom of Bhutan will serve as another milestone in deepening Israel's ties in Asia."" 
Bhutan relied on India for guidance on its foreign and defence policy until a friendship treaty was revised in 2007. It maintains diplomatic relations with around 53 countries.
A signing ceremony was held between the Israeli and Bhutanese ambassadors to India on Saturday at the Israeli embassy in New Delhi, a joint press release posted on the Bhutanese foreign ministry's website said. 
""The establishment of diplomatic relations (will) create new avenues for cooperation between the two countries in water management, technology, human resource development, agricultural sciences and other areas of mutual benefit,"" it said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed the agreement, adding there had been contacts with other countries which wanted to establish relations.

Israel and Morocco on Thursday agreed to normalise ties in a deal brokered with U.S. help, making it the fourth Arab country after the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan to set aside hostilities with Israel in the past four months.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",UN chief urges leaders of every country to declare 'climate emergency',"By Matthew Green and Kate Abnett
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on every country to declare a ""climate emergency"" on Saturday, as world leaders marking the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate accord made mostly incremental pledges relative to the scale of the crisis.
Guterres made his call at a summit aimed at building momentum behind the Paris deal, buoyed in recent months by renewed commitment from China and the prospect of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden bringing the United States back into the pact. 
Nevertheless, the dozens of leaders who spoke mostly offered tweaks to existing commitments or promises of bolder moves before crucial talks in Glasgow in late 2021, rather than breakthrough new policies to hasten the end of fossil fuels.
""Can anybody still deny that we are facing a dramatic emergency?"" Guterres, a former Portuguese prime minister who has made climate change his signature issue, said via video.
""That is why today, I call on all leaders worldwide to declare a State of Climate Emergency in their countries until carbon neutrality is reached.""
With the impacts of climate change increasingly stark since the Paris deal was struck - ranging from wildfires in Australia and California to collapsing ice sheets - popular pressure has grown on leaders to listen to warnings from scientists.
Britain, co-hosting the summit, made one of the clearest new commitments, announcing late on Friday it would stop direct government support for overseas fossil fuel projects.
Campaigners hailed the move for putting pressure on other G7 economies to restrict support for oil and gas companies, reeling from the impact of COVID-19.
Pledges to back Paris from countries such as India, Germany and France were welcomed less in terms of substance and more for keeping alive hopes of faster action to meet the monumental challenge of halving global emissions by 2030 in line with the Paris deal.
DISAPPOINTMENT ON COAL
Chinese President Xi Jinping, who surprised many in September when he announced the world's biggest producer of climate-warming emissions would become carbon neutral by 2060, unveiled targets to speed the expansion of wind and solar power.
""China always honours its commitments,"" Xi said.
But China showed no signs of bowing to calls from Guterres and campaigners to wind down finance for new coal-fired power plants, a major source of emissions.
Japan and South Korea, which both pledged in October to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, likewise made no commitments on coal finance - though they did pledge to submit more ambitious emissions targets under the Paris accord.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, by contrast, drew praise for saying the country ""will not have any more power based on coal"". It was not immediately clear what the pledge would mean for Pakistan's existing plans to build coal plants under a deal with China. 
Young campaigners pointed to the gulf between government action and the changes needed to deliver on the Paris goal of holding the rise in average global temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius, and if possible 1.5C.
""It is the melting of permafrost; forest fires that hit closer to the home of the climate crisis deniers; droughts that ransack living beings of their resources; floods that reminded many of us that we have no escape,"" Selina Neirok Leem, a campaigner from the Marshall Islands, told the summit.
Major emitters such as Australia and Brazil did not make ambitious enough pledges to qualify to speak, diplomats said. Several state governors spoke from the United States, which left the Paris deal under outgoing President Donald Trump.
""TURN THE CORNER""
Guterres said economic recovery packages launched in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic should represent an opportunity to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon future - but said G20 countries had so far spent 50% more of their stimulus on sectors linked to fossil fuels than on low-carbon energy.
""This is unacceptable,"" Guterres said. ""The trillions of dollars needed for COVID recovery is money that we are borrowing from future generations.""
The European Union, whose plan to spend 30% of its 1.8-trillion-euro budget and COVID-19 recovery fund on climate action, boosted its own 2030 climate pledge on Friday, aiming to cut emissions at least 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the world to cooperate to reverse the process by which humanity has been quilting the planet in ""a toxic tea cosy"" of greenhouse gases.
""And at the same time, we can create hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs, across the planet as we collectively recover from coronavirus,"" Johnson said.
Investors and businesses also underscored their support for a low-carbon transition.

""We call on companies and governments around the world to do all we can to make 2021 the year we turn the corner for good,"" Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chief Executive Tim Cook told the summit.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 12, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Polish government remains intact as junior partner votes to stay,"WARSAW (Reuters) - The arch-conservative United Poland party decided on Saturday to remain in government despite its opposition to a European Union budget deal, the party's leader said, meaning the ruling coalition will keep its majority.
United Poland had called for a veto of the EU's 2021-2027 budget and coronavirus recovery fund because of a clause linking cash with respect for the rule of law.
It said the clause threatened Poland's sovereignty and would make funding dependent on the acceptance of liberal policies.
The eurosceptic party reacted with fury when Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a member of the largest coalition partner Law and Justice (PiS), agreed a compromise during an EU leaders' summit earlier this week.
But United Poland leader Zbigniew Ziobro, who is the country's justice minister, told a news conference on Saturday that the party's leadership had voted to stay in the coalition.
""The voting was secret, and by 12 votes of leadership members to eight the motion of one of our colleagues to leave the coalition was rejected,"" Ziobro said, though he reiterated his party's opposition to Morawiecki's deal.
""We believe the prime minister's decision was a mistake ... we believe there are things you can't measure in amounts of money,"" he said.
Many religious conservatives in predominantly Roman Catholic Poland say the EU's rule of law mechanism could be a first step to forcing the country to accept policies like gay marriage.
United Poland has drawn in hard-right voters opposed to LGBT rights and immigration.
Ziobro is the architect of judicial reforms which have brought Poland into conflict with the EU and which critics say aim to increase political control of the courts.

The coalition's other partner, Accord, led by Deputy Prime Minister Jaroslaw Gowin, has a more centrist and pro-European approach. It backed the EU compromise.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged countries on Saturday to work towards net zero carbon emissions and committed Vatican City - the world's smallest state - to reaching the target by 2050.
Francis, who has championed environmental causes since his election in 2013, told a U.N. climate summit the 108-acre (44-hectare) city-state surrounded by Rome would be doing its bit to fight climate change.
""The current pandemic and climate change, which are not only environmentally relevant, but also ethically, socially, economically and politically, affect, above all, the lives of the poorest and most fragile,"" he said in a video message to the summit.
""In addition to adopting some measures that cannot be postponed any longer, a strategy is needed to reduce net emissions to zero,"" Francis said.
He committed the Vatican ""to reducing net emissions to zero by 2050,"" as well as intensifying environmental management efforts and furthering the rational use of natural resources such as water and planting more trees.
A Vatican statement said the city-state was moving ahead with plans to substitute all its combustion engine cars with electric or hybrid vehicles.
It said the Vatican, which began installing solar panels in 2008 and banned single-use plastic bags last year, was now recycling 65% of its waste and aimed to reach 75% in 2023.
In his address, Francis said the Holy See was committed to promoting, in Catholic schools and elsewhere, ""an education for integral ecology"" to favour development and sustainability and encourage economic policies that respect the environment.
In 2015, Francis wrote a landmark encyclical ""Laudato Si"" (Praised Be) on the need to protect nature. It backed scientific evidence that human activity was to blame for global warming.

Francis also strongly backed the Paris agreement to limit the global rise of temperatures and has said he was saddened by U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from it.

Trump's administration said it was recognising Moroccan claims to Western Sahara as part of a deal under which Morocco agreed to normalise its relations with Israel.
In Algiers, the Foreign Ministry said the U.S. decision ""has no legal effect because it contradicts U.N. resolutions, especially U.N. Security Council resolutions on Western Sahara"".
""The proclamation would undermine the de-escalation efforts made at all levels in order to pave the way for launching a real political process,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The U.S.-Morocco deal comes at a key moment in the long-frozen conflict in Western Sahara between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front independence movement, which erupted again last month after three decades of truce.

The United Nations and other Western states are not expected to change their long-standing position calling for a referendum to resolve the dispute. The United Nations said its stance was unchanged.

Five people were arrested following a series of house searches, Nehammer told a press conference in Vienna. ""We have struck a massive blow against the right-wing extremist scene in Austria and organised crime, and how they are connected,"" Nehammer told reporters. 
The group had built up the arsenal with the goal of attacking society, democracy and basic freedoms, Nehammer added.
The raids were carried out as part of an investigation initially into drug-related crime, but officers also uncovered links between far-right groups and organised crime, the minister said.
The network was active in Germany, with officers from Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia also involved in the inquiry.
The raids led to the seizure of 25 semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons, believed to have been bought with the proceeds of drug trafficking, said Michael Mimra from the state criminal police office in Vienna.
The haul included Uzi sub-machine guns, AK-47 assault rifles, Scorpion machine guns and ammunition, Mimra said.
More weapons and ammunition were seized on Thursday, while more than 100,000 rounds of ammunition were found in a warehouse in lower Austria. 
Overall 76 automatic and semi-automatic weapons were recovered, along with 14 handguns and ammunition and six hand-grenades, as well as detonators and explosives. Some had been packed for transportation.
Investigations in Germany meanwhile had led to two arrests and the seizure of a large quantity of drugs, Mimra said. 

Investigators are now trying to establish the origin of the weapons, with forensic examinations underway to see if they have been used in crimes. ""The investigation has only just begun,"" Mimra said. ""It will last a while.""

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) -Britain is likely to complete its journey out of the European Union in three weeks without a trade deal, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday.
Britain quit the EU in January but remains an informal member until Dec. 31 - the end of a transition period during which it has remained in the EU single market and customs union.
Both sides say they want to agree arrangements to cover nearly $1 trillion in annual trade but negotiations are at an impasse, with Britain standing to lose zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the huge European single market.
""It's looking very, very likely we'll have to go for a solution that I think will be wonderful for the UK. We'll be able to do exactly what we want from Jan. 1. It will obviously be different from what we set out to achieve,"" Johnson told reporters.
""If there's a big offer, a big change in what they're saying then I must say that I'm yet to see it,"" said Johnson, the face of the ""leave"" campaign in Britain's 2016 Brexit referendum.
He later held a meeting with senior minister Michael Gove and officials to assess the country's preparedness for a no-deal departure, a government official said. 
Von Der Leyen was quoted by an EU official as telling leaders of the bloc's 27 member states attending a summit in Brussels on Friday that prospects for a deal had worsened.
""The probability of a no deal is higher than of a deal,"" the official said on condition of anonymity.
Johnson and von der Leyen have given negotiators until Sunday evening to break the deadlock over fishing rights and EU demands for Britain to face consequences if in the future it diverges from the bloc's rules.
Johnson must decide whether the deal on offer is worth taking or the future freedom and domestic political benefits afforded by leaving without one outweigh the economic costs.
A Brexit without a trade deal would damage the economies of Europe, send shockwaves through financial markets, snarl borders and sow chaos through the delicate supply chains which stretch across Europe and beyond.
NO DEAL?
As EU leaders lined up to warn of the failure of talks, investors started to price in the risk of a chaotic finale to the five-year Brexit crisis. 
British stocks fell, euro zone government bond yields fell and sterling fell about 1% against the dollar and euro. 
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said there were still fundamental issues unresolved in the trade talks. 
""Time is running out and we need to prepare for a hard Brexit,"" he said, referring to an abrupt rupture in trade arrangements.
EU leaders rejected a proposal from Johnson for a Brexit call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, EU officials said.
Johnson is under pressure from Brexit supporters in Britain not to cave to any EU demands that they say could undermine his promises to regain Britain's sovereignty.
Macron also faces domestic pressure, with French fishermen urging him to ensure the EU defends their fishing rights. 
Asked by a reporter about an EU proposal for a one-year contingency plan, under which EU fishermen would keep access to Britain's fishing waters, he said: ""I'm not asking to have my cake and eat it, no. All I want is a cake that's worth its weight. Because I won't give up my share of it either.""

The Bank of England said it had taken steps to keep banks lending through 2021 as Britain prepares for any market disruption from a big change in the trading relationship with the EU, while also dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A team of volunteer codebreakers has cracked a mysterious cipher sent more than 50 years ago to a newspaper by the San Francisco serial killer who called himself the Zodiac, the FBI said on Friday.
The Zodiac Killer - who was never caught - shot or stabbed seven people in the San Francisco Bay Area over the course of about year in 1968 and 1969, killing all but two of them. During his murderous spree, he sent a series of terrifying letters to the San Francisco Chronicle newspaper.
Some of the notes were in code, including a particularly complex missive with 340 characters that became known as the 340 cipher. 
""I hope you are having lots of fun trying to catch me,"" said the cipher, cracked last week by codebreakers David Oranchak, Sam Blake and Jarl Van Eycke, according to a video posted on YouTube by Oranchak. ""I am not afraid of the gas chamber because it will send me to paradice (sic) all the sooner because I now have enough slaves to work for me."" 
Like the murders themselves, solving the Zodiac ciphers has become an international fixation for true-crime followers.
Oranchak, whom the San Francisco Chronicle identified as a 46-year-old Web designer who lives in Virginia, said in the video he had hoped the cipher would yield information about the killer's identity.
""The message doesn’t really say a whole lot,"" he said. ""It’s more of the same attention-seeking junk from Zodiac.""
The San Francisco office of the FBI on Friday confirmed that the group had cracked the coded message, and said the investigation into the half-century-old case was ongoing.
""The FBI is aware that a cipher attributed to the Zodiac Killer was recently solved by private citizens,"" the FBI said in a statement posted on Twitter. ""The Zodiac Killer terrorized multiple communities across Northern California, and even though decades have gone by, we continue to seek justice for the victims of these brutal crimes."" 
No one was ever charged in the Zodiac case, and theories abound as to the killer's real identity. The case has inspired numerous books and movies, including 1971's ""Dirty Harry"" starring Clint Eastwood and 2007's ""Zodiac"" with Robert Downey Jr.

The federal government restricted access to Tigray after fighting began on Nov. 4 between its troops and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a political party that ruled the province. So far the conflict in Africa's second-most populous nation is believed to have killed thousands of people and displaced around 950,000. 
But the tempo of fighting seems to have slowed since the government announced the capture of the regional capital Mekelle late last month, although information is hard to verify due to the restrictions. 
Phone and internet connections are gradually being restored, but most of the region remains unreachable for journalists and outside aid agencies.
The convoy of seven white trucks that arrived in Mekelle was organised by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Ethiopian Red Cross, the ICRC said.
""Doctors and nurses have been ... weeks without new supplies, running water, and electricity,"" said Patrick Youssef, the ICRC's regional director for Africa. ""This medical shipment will inject new stocks, help patients,"" and reduce those impossible life-or-death triage decisions.""
BACK-TO-WORK ORDER
The government says it has defeated TPLF forces, and struck a deal with the United Nations to allow aid.
But some aid agencies and donors say the agreement is too restrictive and security remains a problem; one U.N. security team was shot at last weekend.
The government says Tigray is returning to normal, despite the continuing restrictions.
The federally-appointed provisional administration for Tigray, intended to replace the TPLF, said it would take office on Sunday and urged local government workers to resume their jobs on Monday.
""Peace and stability has been established in most of the towns in the region, including Mekelle. Businesses must return to normal from tomorrow,"" the state news agency quoted Mulu Nega, the head of the interim authority, as saying.
Government workers who were absent would be fired, he said, and gun owners must surrender their weapons to security forces by Tuesday.
It's unclear what will happen to civilians displaced by the fighting. 
Nearly 50,000 refugees, mostly Tigrayans, have crossed into eastern Sudan since early November. Nearly 15,000 are at Um Rakoba camp, where long lines of people waited for food with plates in their hands and new arrivals constructed shelters using tree branches.

""We don't have enough food or shelter here, but I am too scared to go back,"" said Tewelo Gabrageres, 35-year-old trader.

David Aruquipa, a 48-year-old businessman, and Guido Montaño, a 45-year-old lawyer, were initially denied the right to register their union in 2018 by authorities in Bolivia, who said the country's laws did not allow same sex marriage.
The couple, together for more than 11 years, took their case to court. While the Bolivian Constitution still does not contemplate same sex unions, Montaño and Aruquipa argued successfully the prohibition violated international human rights standards and constituted discrimination under Bolivian law.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab was arrested in Jakarta on Saturday on suspicion of having breached coronavirus restrictions by holding events that drew thousands of followers in the city, his lawyer said.
Police had been investigating the firebrand and politically influential cleric for violating COVID-19 control measures after several mass gatherings were held to celebrate his return from self-exile in Saudi Arabia last month.
Rizieq's lawyer, Aziz Yanuar, said his team would file a pre-trial motion to seek the release of the cleric - who was arrested after appearing at a police station in the capital earlier in the day.
Local media cited Jakarta police as saying Rizieq, who heads the Islamic Defender's Front (FPI), had been charged with the obstruction of law enforcement and incitement of criminal acts.
Police spokesman Yusri Yunus did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the details of Saturday's arrest, which came after six of Rizieq's supporters were killed in a shootout with police on Monday.
With a reputation for raiding bars, brothels and violently cracking down on religious minorities, the FPI has become politically influential in recent years.
In 2016, Rizieq was the figurehead of the mass 212 movement against Jakarta's former Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, or Ahok, who was jailed on blasphemy charges for insulting Islam.
The mass rallies raised concern about the rise of identity politics and political Islam in Indonesia.
Rizieq, 55, left the country a year later after facing charges over sending pornographic messages and insulting state ideology, remaining in self-exile in Saudi Arabia for three years.
When he landed in Jakarta on Nov. 10, tens of thousands of his supporters flocked to the airport in white Islamic garb, ignoring health protocols as they clamoured to greet him.

Iran said on Tuesday its Supreme Court had upheld the death sentence of Zam, who was captured in 2019 after years in exile. His Amadnews feed had more than one million followers.
State TV said on Saturday Zam, ""director of the counter-revolutionary Amadnews network, was hanged this morning"".
France and human rights groups had condemned the Supreme Court's decision.
On Saturday, press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the execution.
""RSF is outraged at this new crime of Iranian justice and sees (Supreme Leader Ayatollah) @ali_khamenei as the mastermind of this execution,"" the group tweeted. 
The son of a pro-reform Shi'ite cleric, Zam fled Iran and was given asylum in France.
In October 2019, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had trapped Zam in a ""complex operation using intelligence deception."" It did not say where the operation took place.
Nour News, a news agency close to the Revolutionary Guards, said last week that Zam was detained by Guards agents after he travelled to Iraq in September 2019 and brought to Iran.
Iranian officials have accused the United States as well as Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile of stoking the unrest, which began in late 2017 as regional protests over economic hardship spread nationwide.

Germany has been in partial lockdown for six weeks, with bars and restaurants closed but shops and schools open. Some regions have already imposed tougher measures.
The discussions on Sunday will include whether shops should be closed before the Christmas holiday and the timing of such a move, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told the RND newspaper group on Saturday that hospital intensive care units were beginning to be stretched to their limits and that Germany couldn't wait until after Christmas to react.
""We have to clarify how things will continue now,"" he said. ""Otherwise the pandemic will get completely out of control.""
Germany, which has Europe's largest economy, was more successful than many European countries in keeping the pandemic under control in the first wave in March and April, but it has been struggling to turn the tide in the second wave with what has been dubbed a ""lockdown lite"".

Daily new coronavirus infections have climbed to 28,438, while the daily death toll was 496, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>",Mexico's senior Catholic leader backs civil unions for gay couples,"By David Alire Garcia
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican Catholic Church's highest-ranking bishop agrees with recent comments by Pope Francis in support of legal protections offered by civil unions for gay couples, the prelate told Reuters, stressing that no family member should ever be rejected.
Mexico is the second-biggest Catholic country after Brazil with around 80% of its nearly 130 million people affiliated with the church. It has historically been conservative-leaning on social issues.
Cardinal Carlos Aguiar, archbishop of Mexico City, said in an interview that he backs the pope's comments from a documentary that premiered in October and used previously unseen footage from an interview he gave to Mexican broadcaster Televisa. The comments marked the first time a sitting pope had advocated any legal protections for gay couples.
""I completely agree,"" said Aguiar, a long-time ally of Pope Francis, who spoke ahead of Saturday's feast day of the Virgin of Guadalupe, one of the Mexican Church's most important annual celebrations. 
In the documentary, entitled ""Francesco,"" the pope says, ""Homosexual people have the right to be in a family, they are children of god,"" and ""what we have to have is a civil union law, that way they are legally covered.""
The pope's comments did not signal any change in church doctrine on homosexuality or support for same-sex marriage, which the Vatican emphasized after the remarks made headlines across the globe.
But Francis' more open and inclusive tone has marked a sharp contrast with his more conservative predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.
""All of us are children of god, all are members of the family, and if we're fighting so that families are united, regardless of their conduct, they don't stop being our children. And that's what Pope Francis said, everyone has the right to family,"" said Aguiar. 
The cardinal, who has lobbied against both abortion rights and same-sex marriage, argued that parents should never reject their openly gay children.
""Because if, as it happens unfortunately, a son in a family declares himself openly homosexual, then they don't want to have anything to do with him. And that can't be, it just can't be,"" he said, echoing Francis' sentiments.
""If they decide as a matter of free choice to be with another person, to be in a union, that's freedom,"" he said.
Like the Argentine pontiff, the 70-year-old Aguiar touts landmark church reforms in the 1960s that pushed the church closer to the faithful and also embraced a social teaching aimed at alleviating human misery, while focusing less on what Aguiar called the ""clerical mentality"" that prioritizes the institution.
""The key point was to move away from a church that defended itself from the world,"" he said.
Aguiar added that much work remains to address poverty and inequality in Mexico and the surrounding region. 
""Latin America is the part of the world that's most unequal,"" he said, ""and many of us here are Catholic!

""What kind of witness is that?""

(Reuters) -A car plowed into a crowd of about 50 people at a protest that spilled into the streets of Manhattan on Friday afternoon, injuring several people, according to New York City police and local news media reports.
The woman behind the wheel of the BMW sedan was detained for questioning by law enforcement, the New York City Police Department said. The incident occurred just after 4 p.m. at the corner of 39th Street and Third Avenue in the Murray Hill neighborhood adjacent to Midtown Manhattan, police said.
None of the injuries appeared to be life threatening, and the motorist involved remained at the scene, police said. Few other official details were immediately available.
Local media reports said six people were struck by the car, but it was unclear as to how many people were taken to hospitals.
Some accounts on social media described a chaotic scene around a stopped car surrounded by protesters, before the vehicle lurched into the crowd, sending some people and bicycles tumbling. Those reports could not immediately be confirmed by Reuters.
Police and several local media outlets said the protest was sponsored by the racial justice group Black Lives Matter.

A Reuters photographer at the scene and at least one media outlet said that demonstration was held in solidarity with nine undocumented immigrants staging a hunger strike in a New Jersey lockup, in custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

Mexico's Senate approved a bill on Wednesday widely seen as a broadside against the United States, after weeks of tension with Washington over counternarcotics operations. It will next be considered by the lower house.
The proposed law does not specifically target the United States, but was proposed by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador after a diplomatic flare-up over the arrest of former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos in Los Angeles in October on drug charges.
Lopez Obrador threatened to review security cooperation with the United States after the arrest, and U.S. prosecutors dropped the charges, pointing to ""sensitive"" foreign policy considerations.
Barr said the law under consideration would benefit transnational criminal organizations.
""We are troubled by legislation currently before the Mexican Congress, which would have the effect of making cooperation between our countries more difficult,"" he said in a statement.
""Our cooperation takes place within the longstanding framework designed to address jointly our shared challenges: that is why, for example, the United States recently returned former Secretary Cienfuegos to Mexico, in order to allow him to be investigated there,"" he added.  

Ricardo Monreal, Senate leader of Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), has said the legislation was not aimed at any particular country. But he has also complained pointedly that U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration was not transparent about matters such as how many DEA agents there are in Mexico.

RABAT/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel and Moroccan Jews on Friday celebrated an agreement to normalise relations between the two countries, but the largest party in Morocco's government faced internal wrangling over a move that some Moroccans regard as a betrayal of Palestinians.
The U.S.-brokered deal - the fourth such ""normalisation"" announcement involving an Arab country and Israel in as many months - also drew criticism from Moscow.
A core element of the deal brokered by President Donald Trump was U.S. recognition of Morocco’s claim to sovereignty over the Western Sahara. A decades-old territorial dispute has pitted Morocco against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, which seeks to establish an independent state.
Russia's foreign ministry said the U.S. decision to recognise Moroccan sovereignty was a breach of international law, the RIA news agency reported.
Winning global support for its claim over Western Sahara is Morocco's most important foreign policy goal. It has also often pursued a more open stance towards Israel and Israelis of Moroccan descent than have other Arab states.
Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita said on Thursday that King Mohammed VI has pursued a U.S. shift in its Western Sahara policy for three years, forging close ties with Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner.
But while the king has the final say on foreign policy, the moderate Islamist PJD - which gained the most seats in a 2016 election - did not appear wholly united on the announcement about Israel.
In a debate late on Thursday after the deal was announced, disagreements emerged among senior party leaders, according to one member who was present. Nearly a full day later, on Friday, the party had still not commented on the deal, long after its main coalition partners had welcomed the move.
MOROCCAN JEWS
Morocco was home to a large Jewish community before Israel was founded in 1948, and around 3,000 Jews still live there.
Around 50,000 Israelis travel to Morocco each year to visit religious sites and other tourist attractions, but there are no direct flights and tourists undergo a lengthy process to obtain visas. 
Suzanne Harroch, a Moroccan Jewish singer from Rabat, said the new arrangement would bring her closer to her relatives in Israel.
""The history of the Jews in Morocco dates back 3,000 years. This history was intrerrupted, but now with this decision normalcy will be restored,"" she said.
Her sentiments were echoed by Israeli cabinet minister Miri Regev, whose parents were among the estimated 250,000 Jews who emigrated from Morocco to Israel. She said older Israelis would now find it easier to go back.
""They will visit with their grandchildren, their kids, they can be proud of the glorious heritage they brought with them,"" Regev said.
Israeli airliners said they plan to launch direct flights and tour operators expect a jump in demand for tourism.
Davide Toledano, a businessman who heads Rabat's small Jewish community, said he expected Israeli investment in Morocco's agriculture and water sectors. 
Showing a photograph of himself with a former PJD head, he said relations between Moroccan Jews and Muslims were good. ""We received congratulations from our Muslim brothers,"" he added. 
But others said geopolitical considerations underlay the deal, ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's arrival in the White House in January.
""Morocco made a calculation that their ability to win American recognition over the Western Sahara (was) likeliest in a Trump administration,"" said David Makovsky, a former U.S. Middle East negotiator at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and official Palestinian media remained silent, but former Palestinian negotiator Hanan Ashrawi said Trump was ""emboldening"" Israel.

""We all know that this is extremely irresponsible because it encourages power politics and the violations of international law everywhere,” she told Reuters.

1264,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 06:21PM ET</span>",'A little person in history': the adolescents who signed up to test the COVID vaccine,"By Catherine Koppel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two adolescent siblings in the United States who signed up for a coronavirus vaccine trial said they did it because they wanted to make their own small contribution to history.
Nathan Williams (NYSE:WMB), 17, and his sister Delilah, 12, signed up for the trial after spending months in pandemic isolation. Their mother, Melanie Williams, is a nurse and hospital administrator who works on a ward dealing with COVID-19 patients.
""The first thing that came to mind was to be a man for others, primarily just to help everyone else before worrying about my own worries,"" said Nathan.
He enrolled first in  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine research trial at Ochsner Health, based in New Orleans, Louisiana, and was later joined by Delilah.
It was totally their decision, said Melanie.
""They would watch me come home and meticulously take my shoes off at the door and not bring anything in. And there was also a certain amount of time that we were distanced from each other because there was such an increase in cases in the inpatient arena,"" she said.
""I left the brochure on the table. I didn't have any conversations with them about it unless they asked me questions. And then it was sure, why not?""
A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to endorse emergency use of the vaccine, developed by Pfizer with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). The agency is expected to shortly authorize the shot for a nation that has lost more than 285,000 lives to COVID-19. 
The principal investigator of the trial for Ochsner Health said children like the Williamses were providing a great public service.
""We have a number of vaccines for the pediatric population,"" Dr. Julia Garcia-Diaz said, citing measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, pneumonia and the flu.
""And all of those vaccines ... had to be tested in children to ensure that it's safe and efficacious in that population. COVID is no different.""
The Williams siblings have experienced no side effects from the trial shots, which could have been vaccine doses or a placebo in the double-blind study. Tracking and reporting their temperatures and any symptoms is a small inconvenience in a global pandemic, they said.

""To think that I might be a little part of history is kind of exciting,"" said Delilah.
""And if I'm just a little person in history, that's fine with me.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council discussed on Friday human rights abuses in North Korea after the issue was raised by seven members who accused Pyongyang of using the coronavirus pandemic ""to crack down further on the human rights of its own people."" 
Germany, Britain, France, Belgium, Estonia, the United States and the Dominican Republic brought up the issue in a closed-door virtual meeting after diplomats said Russia and China objected to a public briefing on the situation. 
""The DPRK's human rights violations pose an imminent threat to international peace and security. The DPRK government diverts resources away from its people to its illicit ballistic missile and nuclear programs,"" the seven countries said in a statement, read by German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen. 
North Korea's formal name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). North Korea's U.N. mission in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Security Council meeting.
North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of human rights abuses and blames sanctions for a dire humanitarian situation. Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.
""The government's decision to prioritize its weapons programs over the needs of its people and their isolation from the international community, is inevitably worsening the impacts of the pandemic on the North Korean population,"" Heusgen said.
Between 2014 and 2017 the Security Council held annual public meetings on human rights abuses in North Korea. 
In 2018 the council did not discuss the issue amid now failed efforts by North Korea leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump to work toward Pyongyang's denuclearization.
Last year at least eight council members pushed for a meeting on human rights abuses, sparking Pyongyang to warn it would consider such a move a ""serious provocation"" to which it would ""respond strongly."" 

The United States instead convened a meeting on the threat of escalation by North Korea amid growing tensions between Pyongyang and Washington.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration moved forward with $1 billion in sales of drones and precision-guided weapons to Morocco on Friday, sending a notice to Congress about the potential deals, according to sources familiar with the notification.
The deal includes four MQ-9B SeaGuardian drones made by privately-held General Atomics, and Hellfire, Paveway and JDAM precision-guided munitions made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT), Raytheon (NYSE:RTN) and Boeing (NYSE:BA), the sources said. 
Reuters was first to report on Thursday that Washington was negotiating the sale and would notify Congress shortly.
News of the deal came as the White House announced an agreement brokered with U.S. help for Morocco to normalize relations with Israel.
Earlier this year the U.S. offered stealthy F-35 jet fighters to the United Arab Emirates in a side deal to the U.S.-brokered agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel to normalize relations. 
Congress is notified about major international weapons deals and given the opportunity to review them before they go through. Under U.S. weapons export law, members of Congress can attempt to block such sales by offering resolutions of disapproval, but sources said that was not expected in this case.
A deal with Morocco would be among the first drone sales after the Trump administration moved ahead with a plan to sell more drones to more countries by reinterpreting an international arms control agreement called the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).

This fall drone sales moved ahead to Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates. An effort to block the UAE sale failed in the U.S. Senate on Wednesday.

In making its claim that India attempted to manipulate international bodies through fake news websites and organisations, Pakistan's foreign minister cited a report by European non-government organisation EU Disinfo Lab.
The report highlighted a network of hundreds of fake media outlets and organisations that it said have pushed a pro-India agenda in the European Union (EU) and United Nations (UN) bodies to discredit the country's rivals, in particular Pakistan.
EU DisinfoLab did not detail any direct links between the alleged network and the Indian government and Reuters has no independent evidence of them.
""Today, India is manipulating and misusing the international system for its own nefarious designs,"" Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said at a press conference, adding that the Indian government was funding the network.
Qureshi called on the UN and UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to immediately investigate and de-list ""10 fake NGOs created by India to malign Pakistan.""
He also asked the European Union Parliament to begin an investigation into what he termed to be the manipulation of the body and its legislative process by ""fake organisations involved in anti-Pakistan propaganda under a fully funded disinformation and influence operation, run by India.""
New Delhi rejected the charges, saying it was Pakistan that was spreading disinformation.
""As a responsible democracy, India does not practice disinformation,"" Anurag Srivastava, India's foreign ministry spokesman, told a news conference.
The EU DisinfoLab report also said Indian press agency Asian News International (ANI) was the only press agency to extensively cover material from the disinformation network.
Qureshi accused ANI of amplifying propaganda against Pakistan, and he noted that the organisation had a partnership with Reuters, which, he said, was also being used to spread this information.
Reuters News, a unit of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), has had a minority stake in ANI for more than two decades. 
ANI editor Smita Prakash dismissed the allegation, saying in a Twitter post, ""An attempt has been made by Pakistan and its proxies to hurt ANI's credibility by hurling wild accusations of fake news.""
Reuters, in a statement responding to a request for comment, said it was ""reviewing these allegations"" in its capacity as a minority shareholder in ANI, but added that it has ""no involvement"" in ANI's editorial operations. 
""As is the case with all our editorial partners and suppliers, we review ANI's raw, unedited video content shot within India, and exercise our own news judgment about what we distribute and publish,"" the statement said. 
The two nuclear-armed South Asian nations have fought three wars since they became free nations in 1947, and remain deeply distrustful of each other.
Tension has sharpened since August 2019 when India ended the autonomy of its only Muslim-majority region, Kashmir, which is also claimed by Pakistan.
UNHRC spokesman Rolando Gomez said the organisation would look into these specific allegations, and that it was aware a number of accredited groups were pursuing their own political agenda or those of governments.
Delphine Colard, a European Parliament spokeswoman, said they were not aware of such a request made by Pakistan, but added: ""We take very seriously any effort to misrepresent the positions of the European Parliament or its elected members.""

SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (Reuters) - Willian Castro and his family huddled on the roof of a banana packing plant for three days as Hurricane Eta raged last month, seeking to escape the torrential rains and floods that swept through his home and thousands of others.
His city of San Pedro Sula in northern Honduras was one of the areas worst hit by Eta and Hurricane Iota, which struck just two weeks later, deepening the economic hardship caused by the coronavirus pandemic in Central America.
Castro, 34, worked as a barber from his home, which was destroyed in the storms. He is now considering following thousands of Hondurans before him who saw emigration north as a way out of poverty.
""We will have to start over,"" he said. ""We can't do it alone. If not, I'll have to think about what many have done in the past, go to the United States.""
A caravan of hundreds of Hondurans headed north this week, testing efforts by the Trump administration to discourage illegal immigration from Central America, an impoverished and often violent region from where thousands more are expected to take the same path soon. [L4N2IQ3KW]
For now, Castro is living in a friend's house near San Pedro Sula. Private organizations have given his family food, and neighbors who receive remittances from relatives in the United States have also helped. 
""The government has not given us anything,"" Castro said. 
Julissa Mercado, a spokeswoman for government disaster agency COPECO, said the area around San Pedro Sula received food aid, but that it was inevitable that some people would say they had not received assistance.
Nationwide, some 4.5 million people - half the Honduran population - have been impacted by the hurricanes and their aftermath, including landslides and rain that submerged entire communities, the government said. More than 85,200 homes were damaged and 6,100 destroyed.
In Castro's old neighborhood, the accumulated rainwater is a meter high in some areas, and downed power poles and trees, furniture and appliances still clutter the streets.
Some 95,000 people in San Pedro Sula have taken refuge in shelters. Thousands of others sleep each night in flimsy sheds made of wood and plastic sheets, on sidewalks or under bridges. 
President Juan Orlando Hernandez has called for help from other nations. ""It's the worst disaster that we have experienced in the history of the Republic of Honduras,"" he said on Thursday at an event recognizing first responders.
Even before the twin storms, which also killed 100 people, Honduras was expecting an economic contraction of 10.5% this year due to the pandemic.
""After losing their homes, assets and even their jobs, people who were already poor are now even worse off,"" said Nelson Garcia, director of the Mennonite Social Action Commission (CASM), a human rights organization.

Legal Action Worldwide (LAW) and international law firm McDermott Will & Emery said they filed a complaint on Thursday, with Myanmar's human rights commission on behalf of Setara Begum, whose husband Shoket Ullah was killed at Inn Din village in Rakhine state.
Her claim is the first complaint related to the Rohingya known to have been filed through Myanmar's human rights commission, according to LAW, a legal non-profit organisation based in Geneva.
Representatives of the human rights commission were not available to comment when contacted by Reuters and a government spokesman did not reply to an email requesting comment or answer phone calls.
Begum's husband Shoket Ullah, a 35-year-old fishermen, was among 10 men and boys killed by soldiers and villagers and buried in a shallow grave in September 2017, according to a subsequent Reuters investigation.
Myanmar's army said it sentenced the soldiers responsible for the killings to terms of 10 years with hard labour, but they were released after less than a year.
""My husband was killed and Myanmar has let those soldiers who did that go free,"" she said in a statement.
""I am seeking justice for my husband and for all Rohingya, who have faced many similar issues,"" said the 23-year-old.
Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who documented the killings in an investigative report, spent more than 16 months in jail after being convicted of obtaining state secrets. They were released in an amnesty in May 2019. 
More than 730,000 Rohingya were driven into neighbouring Bangladesh during the military campaign in 2017 that the United Nations has said was executed with genocidal intent. 
The country is facing charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice in the Hague and the International Criminal Court has approved an investigation into crimes against humanity.
Myanmar denies genocide and says its forces were carrying out legitimate security operations against militants who attacked police posts.
Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi has said any violations could be dealt with by Myanmar's justice system and her government last year invited Rohingya to submit complaints to the human rights commission. 
She told a hearing at The Hague last December that ""many of us in Myanmar were unhappy"" with the pardoning of the soldiers over the killings at Inn Din.

Erdogan was in the Azeri capital to review a military parade marking Azerbaijan's victory over Armenia in a war over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave that ended last month.
During the six-week conflict over the breakaway ethnic Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan, Turkey backed its ethnic Turkic ally Azerbaijan and accused Armenia of occupying Azeri territories. 
In Baku, Erdogan called for a change of leadership in Yerevan, while offering the country the chance to join the regional group and see its borders with Turkey reopen.
Broadcaster NTV quoted Erdogan as telling reporters on his return flight from Baku that the regional platform - which will include Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran and Armenia - would provide a ""win-win"" opportunity for all parties and that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""keen"" on the idea.
""If Armenia joins this process and takes positive steps, a new page can be turned in Turkey-Armenia ties too. As long as new opportunities come up, there is no doubt that Armenia's gains here will seriously increase too. Armenia stands to win the most from this,"" Erdogan was cited as saying.
""If Armenia develops this process positively, we will open our closed borders to Armenia. Our only concern is to contribute to regional peace,"" he said.
Armenia and Turkey signed a landmark accord in 2009 to restore ties and open their borders after a century of hostility stemming from the World War One mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman forces. But the deal was never ratified by the two governments and relations have remained tense.
The Nagorno-Karabakh fighting ended after a Russian-brokered ceasefire locked in Azeri gains and saw Moscow deploy peacekeepers to the region. Under a separate deal, Russia and Turkey will also jointly monitor the ceasefire.

Erdogan also said Turkey would play ""an important role"" in the reconstruction of areas taken by Azerbaijan in the conflict, saying he and Azeri President Ilham Aliyev had agreed to move on this within a year, according to NTV.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania's new centre-right government assumed office on Friday, led by Prime Minister Ingrida Simonyte who has appointed the most gender-balanced cabinet in the eastern European Union.
Simonyte, the only woman currently serving as prime minister in the bloc's eastern states, named seven women and eight men as ministers.
Bulgaria is the eastern EU state with the next highest proportion of women in its cabinet, with seven women among its 19 ministers. Poland has the worst gender parity record, with only one woman in its cabinet of 20. 
Both junior partners of Simonyte's coalition, which won the October general election, are led by young female politicians, and nine ministers in the cabinet are in their 30s.
""When you know what you need, it's easy"", Simonyte told reporters after taking the oath, in reference to the gender balance in her cabinet, a first for Lithuania.
Lithuania became the second-worst hit country by coronavirus in the European Union, behind Luxemburg, on the day Simonyte took office, and she went directly from the oath to a meeting to discuss additional measures to curb the spread of the virus.
Simonyte, 46, was the finance minister during the 2009-2010 crisis, when she oversaw cutting retirees pensions to avoid currency devaluation. In 2019, the self-professed Metallica fan made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency.
For a period lasting several months in 2019, the Lithuanian government included no women at all, with the then prime minister, Saulius Skvernelis, saying that personal ""qualities, competence and professionalism"" were more important than gender parity.
""We love women and we nurture them towards equality"", he said in 2019.
Elsewhere in the European Union, Belgium, France and Spain have same number of men as women in their cabinets, while Austria, Finland and Sweden have a female majority.
Simonyte will join premiers of Denmark, Finland and Germany as the only female heads of the government in the bloc.

BALAD, Iraq (Reuters) - Last month, Iraqi authorities gave families displaced by the war against Islamic State just 48 hours to pack up and leave the Al-Ishaki camp before it was closed. 
When the deadline expired, pick-up trucks and military vehicles arrived to take about 200 people back to their hometown.
Taama al-Owaisi and others who had lived for years in the camps did not want to leave but they say they were forced to.
An uncertain future awaits them – wrecked towns with no services, surrounded by paramilitaries who regard the returnees with suspicion for having survived life under Islamic State.
Hundreds of thousands of people fled their homes during the conflict in northern Iraq, which started in 2014 when IS captured vast areas and imposed its own rule and ended in 2017 with the hardline Sunni Muslim group's defeat by Iraqi forces backed by U.S. air power.
Cities, towns and villages - including Mosul, the capital of Islamic States's self-proclaimed caliphate - were left in ruins. 
Owaisi now squats outside an abandoned railway station in Balad, about 90 km north of Bagdhad. His home is two miles away, but he dares not negotiate militia checkpoints to reach it. 
Local people blame Shi'ite paramilitaries that control the predominantly Sunni area for abducting and killing eight men in October. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi said then his government was chasing the perpetrators and said Iraq should avoid ""sectarian rivalry"".
But his government is determined to close camps in most Iraqi provinces by the year's end-end, a move rights groups say could leave 100,000 people homeless with no aid.
The migration ministry says the closures are part of a program of ""safe and voluntary return"" but critics say they are badly coordinated and premature while much former IS territory lies in ruins or under the control of groups hostile to those returning.
Owaisi is one of about 23,000 people who have been moved from formal camps with basic services to informal camps since mid-October, according to the U.N. migration agency.
Lahib Higel, senior analyst at International Crisis Group, said the government was ""counting on someone else to take care of it, and by that I mean the international community"".
Migration minister Ivan Jabro denied anyone had been forced to return from camps. She told Reuters that returnees were offered help and support.
But more than a dozen displaced people in parts of northern Iraq including Balad, Mosul, Khazer and Qayyara told Reuters they had not received any support from the government.
When the trucks dropped Owaisi and about 40 other families off at a new site in Balad, he said there was nothing there. The earth had not been bulldozed, rubble remained uncleared, and there was no water or electricity.
Families set up their own tents and created their own camp, according to seven people interviewed there.
International aid groups later arrived and provided food, and water. There was no sanitation at the site for almost two weeks. Women went to outdoor toilets only at night because the darkness gave them some privacy.
Mothers complained their children were becoming ill because of the cold. They have no electricity to switch on the heaters.
EXPOSED AND SCARED
Suspicion and resentment around those who managed to survive living under IS runs deep, including in their own communities and tribes, but especially among the Shi'ite militias that helped defeat the group and remain in those regions.
The paramilitary groups have long denied taking any part in unlawful killings. But Ammar Hekmat Muhsin, deputy governor of Salahuddin province, said the killings of the eight men showed why people were nervous about returning home.
Balad's Mayor Muhawish Muhsin said the government has done very little to prepare for the return of its inhabitants.
The migration spokesman denied the areas displaced people have returned to are unsafe, saying that feeling safe is ""a state of mind""

A relative of those killed in the incident in Balad said: ""This is how it works in Iraq - those with muscles are the ones who survive.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The overflowing crowds and lavish pageantry surrounding a centuries-old annual pilgrimage to the shrine of Mexico's Virgin of Guadalupe, among the world's biggest religious gatherings, will be another pandemic casualty this year. 
The country's top Roman Catholic leader said closing the shrine for the first time was a painful but unavoidable decision as coronavirus infections intensified in Mexico City.
Nearly 11 million devotees of the Virgin of Guadalupe streamed into the Mexican capital's basilica and its adjacent plaza last year in the days leading up to her Dec. 12 feast day, according to the city government's count, dwarfing the annual Muslim hajj to Mecca.
Cardinal Carlos Aguiar, head of Mexico City's Catholic faithful, told Reuters that months of health data showed the pandemic intensifying, leading to consensus between civic and church leaders.
""We all shared the same worry and agreed,"" said Aguiar, who was picked to be archbishop of Mexico City by Pope Francis three years ago.
Still, groups carrying images of the Virgin of Guadalupe are regardless trekking on foot to the basilica from far corners of Mexico, either unaware of the announcement last month or making good on pre-pandemic promises to pay homage to one of the most revered feminine symbols of devotion in the Christian world. 
Legend holds that the devotion began a decade after the 1521 Spanish conquest of Mexico, when Jesus' mother Mary appeared to an Aztec man. Days later, when a disbelieving bishop asked for proof, an image of the brown-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe appeared emblazoned in shimmering gold and blue on the man's cloak, which currently hangs above the basilica's altar.
""We've never closed the church,"" said Aguiar. ""It's the first time in five centuries.""
The closure will be enforced by 1,200 police and soldiers along with a recently installed perimeter fence, and the festivities, including a highly-produced concert, will move online, along with the usual dash of glitz courtesy of Mexican broadcast partner Televisa.
Aguiar notes that pandemic restrictions dating back to March have forced the church, like many institutions, to creatively apply online tools like never before.
Asked if Mexico's status as a developing country has presented a special challenge due to uneven internet access, the 70-year-old prelate had a ready answer.
Citing Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) data from memory, he said eight of 10 Mexicans have internet access through their phones in the world's second-biggest Catholic country after Brazil.
""What's most surprising is that more than 70% of them have a smart phone,"" he said with a laugh.
Looking ahead to the Christmas holiday, he said the pandemic should encourage a renewed focus on immediate family to avoid further spread of the coronavirus and unnecessary loss of life.
Mexico currently has the fourth-highest death toll globally at more than 110,000 fatalities, according to the government's official tally.

""Let's take care of each other,"" he said, ""so that Christmas arrives with good news.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU leaders plan to discuss arm exports to Turkey with NATO allies and Washington, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday, after Greece pushed for an arms embargo on Ankara.
Merkel spoke after a summit where the EU's 27 leaders agreed to prepare limited sanctions on Turkish individuals over Ankara's energy exploration dispute with Greece and Cyprus, but postponed discussions on any harsher steps until March.
""We ... spoke about how questions about arms exports must be discussed within NATO. We said that we want to coordinate with the new U.S. administration about Turkey,"" Merkel told a news conference. Many EU states are also members of NATO.
Merkel's comments underlined a hardening stance on Turkey among EU governments, many of whom have in the past resisted punitive measures on Ankara, a NATO ally, candidate for EU membership and host to Syrians fleeing civil war who would otherwise seek refuge in Europe.
But EU states have also grown increasingly critical of Turkey's involvement in Libya and its purchase of a Russian weapons system, among other flashpoints. 
The United States is already poised to impose sanctions on Turkey over those Russian purchases, Reuters reported on Thursday.
Turkey's foreign ministry on Friday rejected what it called the EU summit's ""biased and illegal"" approach on the sanctions. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called on the United States and EU governments to stop being influenced by what he called anti-Turkish lobbies but, in an unusually conciliatory tone, said he believed issues could be solved through dialogue.
Tensions have flared over Turkey's decision to send oil-and-gas drilling ships to waters off southern Cyprus where Greek Cypriot authorities have already awarded hydrocarbon exploration rights to Italian and French companies.
Turkey says it is operating in waters on its own continental shelf or areas where Turkish Cypriots have rights. It has also repeatedly accused Greece of avoiding bilateral talks over their conflicting maritime claims and has accused the European Union of being biased towards Greece and Turkey.
The EU exported only 45 million euros ($54.53 million) worth of arms and ammunition to Turkey in 2018, including missiles, according to EU statistics office Eurostat, but sales of aircraft amounted to several billion euros.
The United States, Italy and Spain were the top exporters of arms to Turkey from 2015-2019, according the Sweden-based Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), a leading conflict and armaments think tank.
EU governments agreed in October 2019 to limit arms sales to Turkey but stopped short of a bloc-wide ban. The bloc currently bans arms sales to several states including Russia, Belarus, Syria and Venezuela.
The European Union and NATO are planning to hold a summit with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden after he takes office in January.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 09:37AM ET</span>",Argentina lower house approves landmark bill to legalize abortion,"By Nicolás Misculin and Lucila Sigal
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) -Argentina's lower house of Congress approved a bill to legalize abortion in the early hours of Friday morning, a big step forward for the legislation that could set the tone for a wider shift in conservative Latin America.
The draft law, which would allow the legal termination of pregnancies up to the 14th week, was passed with 131 votes in favor, 117 against and six abstentions. It will now move up to the Senate, where an even tighter vote is expected.
Supporters of the legislation, dressed in distinctive green scarves, cheered and hugged each other in the streets of Buenos Aires after the vote for the bill, which was backed by the government. 
Some of the opponents - who had also marched outside Congress through a mammoth debate on Thursday and stayed out all night for the decision - were in tears.
The votes in Argentina, the birthplace of Pope Francis, come amid calls for greater reproductive rights for women across the predominantly Roman Catholic region.
""This is a fundamental step and recognition of a long struggle that women's movements have been carrying out in our country for years,"" Elizabeth Gómez Alcorta, the government's Women, Gender and Diversity minister, said after the vote.
""We are going to continue working so that the voluntary termination of pregnancy becomes law.""
A similar vote to legalize abortion was narrowly defeated in a Senate vote in 2018 after passing the lower house.
Groups opposing the legislation wore light blue scarves as they marched.
""They don't want to show what an abortion is,"" said Mariana Ledger who was holding a cross and a dummy of a headless and bloodied fetus. ""This is it, and they don't want to show it. They are hiding the truth, we are not foolish people.""
Amnesty International welcomed the lower house vote and called on the Senate not to ""turn its back"" on women.
The initiative includes a parallel bill - which will face a separate vote - to assist women who want to continue with their pregnancy and face severe economic or social difficulties.
Argentine law currently only allows abortions when there is a serious risk to the mother or in the event of rape. Activists say, even in those cases, many women often do not receive adequate care.
Carlina Ciak, a 46-year-old pediatrician who stayed in the square outside Congress until after midnight, said the bill would help women from the most vulnerable groups who were often forced to seek dangerous illegal abortions.
""Abortion as a medical practice exists, even when illegal it never stopped being performed,"" the mother-of-two said.
The most affected women were from groups already suffering from ""misery, poverty, criminalization and all kinds of violence."" 

""For them, and for our daughters, we will fight until it becomes law,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States should target Hong Kong's financial sector with tougher sanctions to deprive China from its 'ATM' and to force Beijing to the negotiating table over its crackdown on the Asian financial hub, a former Hong Kong lawmaker told Reuters.
Sixtus ""Baggio"" Leung said he hopes to meet with advisers of President-elect Joe Biden to urge him to ramp up pressure on China, which tightened its grip over the former British colony with the imposition of new national security laws in June.
""There's a stronger way to respond to China's repression: Hong Kong financial system, which is one of the ATMs of China right now - if we can do something on this, it will be much more powerful,"" he said in Washington, after fleeing to seek asylum in the United States last month.
After being disqualified in 2016 from his post as an elected lawmaker, Leung, 34, was sentenced to four weeks in jail and served his time in September.
Leung suggested action should be taken to block Chinese banks from using SWIFT, a network used by banks globally to make financial transactions, and also target Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. currency ""to try to force China to back to the negotiation table"".
In October, the U.S. State Department warned international financial institutions doing business with individuals deemed responsible for China’s crackdown in Hong Kong they could soon face tough sanctions.
China, which promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy under its handover agreement with Britain in 1997, denies curbing rights and freedoms in the city, and has condemned U.S. sanctions as interference in China's internal affairs.
SITUATION DETERIORATING
Hong Kong democracy activists say conditions have deteriorated since China imposed security laws in June. Leung's comments risk falling foul of the new laws, which make anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison 
Earlier this week, Hong Kong police arrested eight more activists over an anti-government protest in July.
""Every day when we wake up, when we look at the mobile (phone) screen, the issue of first thing that pop up is: who of our friends are being arrested; who among our friends is being sentenced to jail,"" said Leung.
China and Hong Kong are expected to be among Biden’s thorniest challenges, with relations between Washington and Beijing at the lowest point in decades.
On Tuesday, his incoming national security advisor Jake Sullivan said he was 'deeply concerned' about Hong Kong crackdown. Biden’s transition team declined to comment, but referred Reuters to Sullivan’s tweet.
Washington has already unleashed a series of sanctions on senior officials from Hong Kong and China deemed responsible for Beijing's crackdown in the territory. But Leung says more is needed to stop China from obliterating its democracy.

""I cannot see the situation would change if we just sit here and do nothing,"" he said.

The country has been in partial lockdown for six weeks, with bars and restaurants closed but shops and schools open.
Some regions have already imposed tougher measures, and more and more state leaders threw their weight behind a nationwide lockdown as daily numbers of new infections and deaths hit new records.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said Germany needed a hard lockdown before Christmas if it wanted to slow the spread, while the country's health and economy ministers also said existing measures would have to be extended.
""This will lead to a lockdown that is similar in many ways to what happened in the early part of the year,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier told a virtual news conference.
Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, called for a national curbs ""as soon as possible"" and said state leaders should meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel to agree on curbs this weekend.
""We cannot wait until Christmas. We have to act quickly,"" he told a news conference.
A government spokeswoman said there was no fixed date for another summit with state leaders but said Merkel is open to further meetings. 
Germany, which has Europe's largest economy, was more successful than many European countries in keeping the pandemic under control in the first wave in March and April, but it has been struggling to turn the tide in the second wave.
Some regions have already tightened restrictions.
People in Baden-Wuerttemberg, in southwest Germany, will be banned from Saturday from going outside between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. except for work and essential reasons and will also be encouraged to stay at home during the day, state premier Winfried Kretschmann said on Friday.
Since Wednesday, people in Bavaria have been allowed to leave home only for essential reasons, while Berlin wants to close shops and extend the school Christmas holidays.
Daily new coronavirus infections climbed to nearly 30,000, while the daily death toll was almost 600, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday.

The number of deaths in Germany in the second full week of November was around 8% above the average seen in the years 2016-2019, the RKI said.

The refugees are being taken from the capital Addis Ababa back to two camps they had fled from during a month of fighting between the military and a rebellious regional force because it is now safe and stable in Tigray, the government said in a statement.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's Chartres cathedral, a vast 13th century building with 18 staff on the payroll, is a costly place to run, and the one million a year who normally come to see its famous blue stained-glass windows are an essential part of balancing the books. 
This year, however, the COVID-19 epidemic has slowed that flood of visitors to a trickle, throwing the UNESCO world heritage site into a financial crisis.
""It is very difficult to survive,"" Father Emmanuel Blondeau, rector of Notre-Dame de Chartres, told Reuters.
The Catholic church nationally has lost 90 million euros ($109 million) in revenue this year, the Conference of French Bishops (CEF) estimates. It has furloughed hundreds of staff and may have to close or sell some places of worship next year, CEF's finance head Ambroise Laurent told Reuters.
While the state covers their upkeep, churches have to pay for their own staff, heating and lighting.
That makes the crisis particularly acute for cathedrals, which feel obliged to stay open for the few believers who do come to pray - meaning high fixed costs that are no longer being covered by their usual revenue from collections, ceremonies and candle sales. 
At Chartres, candle sales alone would normally raise about 5,000 euros ($6,070) per week, but that has fallen to around 500 euros, said the rector.
Before the epidemic, the cathedral employed 18 people. That is now down to 14, who alternate between working part-time and government furlough. 
After a dismal spring, visitors - including German and Austrian pilgrims - trickled back in the summer. But from Sept. 21, when Chartres and its region were declared a quarantine zone for COVID-19, they all but stopped coming. 
The Notre-Dame-du-Puy cathedral in Le Puy-en-Velay, central France, is another World Heritage site and a major stage on the Santiago de Compostela pilgrims' route. It too has seen visitor numbers and income - mainly from candles and collections - plummet.
Yet shutting its great wooden doors to save money is not an option. ""This is a place of pilgrimage, we need to remain open, anyone should be able to come,"" said its rector, Jean-Loic Ollu.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - American women, who traditionally make most of the healthcare decisions in their families, are more wary than men of the new, rapidly developed COVID-19 vaccines, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, presenting a potential challenge to efforts to immunize the public.
The Dec. 2-8 national opinion survey showed that 35% of women said they were “not very” or “not at all” interested in getting a vaccine, an increase of 9 points from a similar poll conducted in May when vaccines were still being developed. 
Some 55% of women said they were “very” or “somewhat” interested in getting vaccinated, a drop of about 6 percentage points in the same time span. Meanwhile, 68% of men said they would get vaccinated, which is unchanged from May. 
Overall, 61% of Americans said in December that they are open to getting vaccinated - a 4 point decline since the May poll. The latest survey also recorded a sharp drop in the number of parents willing to give their children the vaccine - 53% versus 62% in May.
Convincing women to accept the vaccine will be critical for slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus because mothers tend to be the ones who make doctor's appointments and keep up with immunizations, said Rupali Limaye, director of behavioral and implementation science at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
""Women just tend to be more careful. They tend to do a lot more reading,"" Limaye said, so assuring them that no shortcuts were taken in the vaccine approval process will be crucial.
Mothers make about 80 percent of health care decisions for their children and are more likely to be the caregivers when a child falls ill, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
And a 2018 World Health Organization study found that by empowering Southeast Asian women and improving their access to medical information, child vaccine coverage and health outcomes improved.
Among women who said in the Reuters/Ipsos survey they were not interested in the vaccine, 60% said they were “nervous about getting vaccinated right away with a new vaccine that has been approved so quickly.” And 48% of those disinterested women said “the risks of taking a new vaccine outweigh any benefits.”
Another 38% said they were not interested in the vaccine because they do not trust the companies making them and 27% said they do not think a vaccine will adequately protect them.
Britain this week began inoculations with a vaccine developed by Germany’s BioNTech and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) - less than a year after the genetic code of the new coronavirus was first published. A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday gave a green light to emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine and FDA authorization was expected within days.
Scientists believe that ""herd immunity"" against the virus could be achieved once about 70% of the population has been exposed to it, either through natural infection or a vaccine.
POLITICAL SPLIT
One of the respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll, was Alice Bayless, a 56-year-old nurse in Merritt Island, Florida, who said she does not plan to get the COVID-19 vaccine even if the hospital where she works makes it available.
""They rushed it through so quickly they are barely getting FDA approval on it,"" she said. ""I just want to wait and see what happens.""
Bayless said older people and those with underlying health conditions should be vaccinated, but there is no rush for people not at high risk of severe COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus that has killed 290,000 people in the United States, the most in the world.
Tameka Dumas, 47, of Grenada, Mississippi, said she, as did many poll respondents, would like to first see how someone fares in the year following the vaccination. 
""I think it has been rushed to get on the market too fast,"" she said.
Politics also comes into play. According to the poll, Republicans, who have been generally less likely than others to wear protective face masks or express concerns about the virus, also appeared to be less likely to get vaccinated: 53% said they were interested in a vaccine, compared with 75% of Democrats. 
African Americans were less likely to get the vaccine: 49% said they were interested in the vaccine, compared with 63% of whites and 61% of Hispanics. And 56% of adults between the ages of 18 and 34 were interested in a vaccine, compared with 69% of those who are 55 or older.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,419 U.S. adults, including 1,216 who said they were not interested in getting a coronavirus vaccine. The poll has as credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 2 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 points for smaller groups like African Americans.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday U.S. sanctions over Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 missiles would be disrespectful to a NATO ally, after sources said Washington was poised to take the step likely to further strain relations.
The report of imminent U.S. sanctions targeting Turkey's defence industry over missiles comes as EU leaders at a summit discussed separate sanctions against Turkish officials over gas exploration in disputed parts of the Mediterranean.
Both developments -- examples of Erdogan's long-strained relations with Western allies -- have caused anxiety among investors. The U.S. moves, earlier than expected and potentially wider in scope, are likely to have the greater immediate impact. 
The lira tumbled nearly 2% after Reuters cited sources saying U.S. sanctions are set to be announced as soon as Friday. The currency later rebounded as investors weighed up the impact.
The U.S. measures under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) would be enacted by U.S. President Donald Trump as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office on Jan. 20. 
""For America to get up and confront Turkey with a matter like CAATSA is disrespectful to a very important NATO partner,"" state-owned Anadolu agency cited Erdogan as saying.
In a later speech to officials from his AK Party, Erdogan took a more conciliatory tone, calling on both U.S. and EU politicians to ""break from the influence of anti-Turkey lobbies"".
""There are no issues that we cannot solve with dialogue and cooperation,"" he said.
The lira, which has hit a series of record lows and is among the worst performers in emerging markets this year, weakened past 8 to the dollar for the first time in two weeks. By 1226 GMT it had rebounded to 7.89, flat on the day.
A 25% currency depreciation has worsened economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic this year.
Ankara acquired the S-400 ground-to-air defences in mid-2019 and says they pose no threat to NATO allies. Washington disagrees, and last year removed Turkey from an F-35 jet programme. 
'DEEP CRISIS'
Two sources familiar with the matter, including a U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters Trump had given aides his blessing for the sanctions. 
He would likely need to select from a list of 12 CAATSA options ranging from mild to harsh.
Even mild U.S. sanctions would further roil U.S.-Turkish relations that ""have been in deep crisis for quite some time"" over a range of other issues, said Galip Dalay, fellow at Robert Bosch Academy. ""Domestically it will increase further anti-Americanism... and it is unlikely to change Turkish policy.""
Erdogan was quoted by Turkish media as saying he had no problems during Trump's four years in office and that Biden also knows him well. 
A treasury desk trader at one bank said the simultaneous U.S. and EU moves were negative but would not directly harm the Turkish economy in the short term, and have only a limited market impact if they remain mild.
The economy has slumped badly twice in as many years. The lira rebounded from a record low of 8.58 last month after Erdogan replaced top economic policymakers and pledged a new market-friendly era.
Timothy Ash at Blue Bay Asset Management said Trump would be expected to choose lighter sanctions and ""clear the air"" for Biden to reset relations. ""Surely it can only get better from here,"" he said. 
In Brussels, EU leaders agreed a statement paving the way to punish individuals accused of planning or taking part in what the bloc says is unauthorised drilling off Cyprus. They shied away from a threat in October to consider wider measures. 

Turkey, which says it is exploring for hydrocarbons in waters within its rights, called the EU approach ""biased and illegal"".

1287,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Charges in Beirut blast investigation hit political pushback,"BEIRUT (Reuters) -Leading Lebanese parties lambasted charges brought against the prime minister and three former ministers over the Beirut port explosion on Friday, highlighting the political minefield facing the investigation.
The heavily armed, Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah movement said the charges smacked of political targeting, joining a wider pushback by influential parties against the allegations of negligence made by Judge Fadi Sawan.
Four months since the port blast that killed 200 people, injured thousands and destroyed entire districts, victims are still awaiting the result of the investigation. Leaders had promised it would come within days.
The August explosion, one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts on record, was caused by a massive quantity of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely for years. 
Sawan charged caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab, whose cabinet quit after the blast, and three former ministers with negligence on Thursday. 
In a visit to Diab on Friday, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri accused Sawan, the judge leading the inquiry, of breaching the constitution. He pledged not to let anyone violate ""the post of prime minister"" - a seat reserved for a Sunni Muslim in Lebanon's power-sharing system.
Officials who were informed about the nitrate included Diab and President Michel Aoun, who were warned in July that it could destroy the capital if it exploded, according to documents seen by Reuters. 
Diab, who says his conscience is clear, has also accused Sawan of a constitutional breach. So has Ali Hassan Khalil, one of the ex-ministers, a close Hezbollah ally and senior aide to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
While Iran-backed Hezbollah said it supported a transparent inquiry, it rebuked Sawan's step. 
""We absolutely reject the absence of unified standards that has led to what we believe to be political targeting against some people and ignoring others,"" it said.
The other two former ministers charged - Ghazi Zeaiter and Youssef Finianos - are also Hezbollah allies.
Zeaiter, a parliamentary deputy from Berri's bloc, called the charges against him ""a blatant violation"" that he would not remain silent about. He served as public works and transport minister in 2014, soon after the Rhosus ship carrying tonnes of the highly explosive chemical arrived at Beirut port.
Finianos has yet to comment. The United States has imposed sanctions on Finianos and Khalil, accusing them of enabling Hezbollah, which Washington deems a terrorist organisation. 
There has been debate about whether ministers enjoyed immunity in the case. Melham Khalaf, head of the Beirut bar association, praised Sawan's move, saying it showed courage. 
Former premier Najib Mikati suggested that while Diab has been charged, President Aoun, who was also informed about the presence of the dangerous material, was not.

Aoun said in August he had directed the Supreme Defence Council, a grouping of security and military agencies chaired by the president, to ""do what is necessary"".

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have detained a Chinese national working for the Bloomberg news bureau in Beijing on suspicion of endangering national security, the news agency and China's foreign ministry said on Friday.
According to a Bloomberg report, Haze Fan was seen being escorted from her apartment building by plain clothes security officials on Monday, shortly after she had been in contact with one of her editors. 
""Chinese citizen Ms. Fan has been detained by the Beijing National Security Bureau according to relevant Chinese law on suspicion of engaging in criminal activities that jeopardize national security,"" the Chinese foreign ministry said in response to a Reuters query.
""The case is currently under investigation. Ms. Fan's legitimate rights have been fully ensured and her family has been notified,"" the ministry said.
The Beijing National Security Bureau could not immediately be reached for comment.
""We are very concerned for her, and have been actively speaking to Chinese authorities to better understand the situation. We are continuing to do everything we can to support her while we seek more information,"" a spokeswoman for New York-based Bloomberg said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
Fan has worked for Bloomberg since 2017 and previously worked for CNBC, CBS News, Al Jazeera and Reuters, Bloomberg reported.
Chinese nationals working for foreign media outlets in China are categorized as news assistants.
Foreign media operating in China have come under increasing pressure, and China has expelled more than a dozen foreign journalists at U.S. media organizations this year by cancelling their press credentials amid worsening relations between Beijing and Washington.
In August, authorities in Beijing detained Cheng Lei, a China-born Australian citizen working for Chinese state-run broadcaster CGTN, on suspicion of illegal activities that endangered China's national security.

In September, Australia helped two Australian foreign correspondents leave China after they were questioned by China's state security ministry.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 08:06AM ET</span>",Analysis-World watches as first-mover Britain probes adverse reactions to Pfizer vaccine,"By Alistair Smout
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain hailed ""V-Day"" when it became the first country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Yet, as first mover, it has also become the first to report cases of adverse reactions, allowing other nations to watch and learn. 
Officials from around the world are keen for British authorities to give them as much information as possible about the two reported cases of anaphylaxis among thousands of people inoculated since mass-vaccination began on Tuesday.
Anaphylaxis is an over-reaction of the body's immune system, which health specialists describe as severe and sometimes life-threatening. While such allergic reactions are rare in any individual vaccine recipient, they are not unusual during large-scale rollouts, scientists, experts and industry figures said.
The reports nonetheless led to Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) beefing up its guidance for the shot at midnight leading into Thursday, specifically warning that anyone with a history of anaphylaxis should not take it.
In the United States, regulators and public health officials are determining whether to approve the vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech, and what advice to issue.
William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the British regulator was being cautious in its approach to the shot, which uses new genetic mRNA technology.
""They're being very, very careful. These are new vaccines using a new technology. They've gotten a signal here that they need to investigate,"" he said. 
""We'll benefit from their investigation."" 
Schaffner, who is a non-voting member of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, said the group would likely discuss the topic when it discusses the use of Pfizer's vaccine on Friday.
Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said his agency was trying to learn from the UK experience.
""We're working very closely with our UK partners to understand what went on with respect to those allergic reactions,"" he told CBS News ahead of a meeting of outside advisers to weigh whether to recommend approval of the vaccine.
Canada's health ministry, which approved the vaccine on Wednesday, also said it would look at the reported reactions in Britain, but added that adverse events were to be expected and would not necessarily change the risk/benefit of the shot.
'BENEFITS OUTWEIGH RISKS'
The MHRA, which last week became the first regulator in the world to approve the vaccine, said it was looking into the reports of anaphylaxis as a matter of priority.
""Anaphylaxis is a known, although very rare, side effect with any vaccine,"" the watchdog said. ""Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against COVID-19 outweigh the risks.""
Its updated guidance to health professionals reads: ""Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.""
That fleshed out an earlier change, in response to the reports of adverse reactions, that had more broadly warned against those with a history of a ""significant allergic reaction"" to a vaccine, medicine or food taking the shot.
A vaccination resources database for doctors in France estimates the number of anaphylaxis events at below 1 per 100,000 doses, although it says it can happen to ""any patient with any type of vaccines"". 
Paul Turner, an expert in allergy and immunology at Imperial College London's who has been advising the MHRA, said it was unlikely the adverse reactions were due to food allergies. 
They may have been caused by a component of Pfizer's vaccine called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which helps stabilise the shot and is not in other types of vaccines, he added.
""As we've had more information through, the initial concern that maybe it affects everyone with allergies is not true,"" he said. ""Likewise, people with a known allergy to just one medicine should not be at risk,"" Turner told Reuters.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they were supporting the MHRA investigation.
Pfizer has said people with a history of severe adverse allergic reactions to vaccines or the candidate's ingredients were excluded from their late-stage trials, which is reflected in the MHRA's emergency-approval protocol.
'CAN GET A HANDLE ON IT'
The British regulator insisted no corners were cut when it issued emergency use approval for Pfizer's vaccine last Wednesday, adding that the highest standards were maintained, despite raising some eyebrows abroad with the move.
Top U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci apologised for casting doubt on the MHRA's rigour last week, while the EU drug regulator has said its process was more appropriate for the pandemic. 
The founder of German biotech firm CureVac, whose own COVID-19 vaccine based on mRNA technology is in clinical trials, said the side effects seen in Britain were unsurprising.
""It is quite clear, with the immune system, that this can also explode. This applies to all immunisations, including the flu vaccination, for example,"" Ingmar Hoerr told RTL/ntv.
""But that's not so bad, you can get a handle on it. You can take medication that brings the immune system down again.""

1290,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 07:51AM ET</span>",Joe Biden and Kamala Harris jointly named Time's 'Person of the Year',"By Barbara Goldberg and Steve Gorman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris were jointly named Time magazine's 2020 ""Person of the Year"" on Thursday, chosen from a list of finalists that included the man Biden vanquished at the polls - President Donald Trump.
The Democratic former vice president and his running mate, a California senator whose election broke gender and racial barriers, together ""offered restoration and renewal in a single ticket,"" Time said in a profile of the pair, published online with its announcement.
Following the most tumultuous U.S. presidential campaign in modern times, waged in the throes of a deadly pandemic, economic devastation and a strife-torn national reckoning with racism, Biden and Harris prevailed in an election that drew the highest voter turnout in a century. 
Time editor-in-chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal credited the victors with succeeding in ""an existential debate over what reality we inhabit.""
""For changing the American story, for showing that the forces of empathy are greater than the furies of division, for sharing a vision of healing in a grieving world, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are Time's 2020 Person of the Year,"" 
Trump, the 45th U.S. president and Time's 2016 Person of the Year - so honored a month after his upset election victory as the Republican nominee that year - was among three other finalists in the running this year, Time said.
The two others, both group candidates, were the healthcare workers battling the COVID-19 pandemic, and participants in the racial justice movement sparked by the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The Person of the Year is usually an individual, but multiple people have been named in the past. The title is one, according to the magazine, signifying ""who affected the news or our lives the most, for better, or worse.""
Time began its tradition in 1927. Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg last year became the youngest individual winner of the accolade. 
Biden, 78, who served two terms as vice president to Barack Obama, will become the oldest person to assume the office of U.S. president when he is sworn in on Jan. 20. Harris will become the first woman, the first Black and the first person of Asian descent to be inaugurated vice president.
Trump, who has continued to espouse baseless claims that the 2020 election was rigged against him and that he is the rightful winner, is not expected to attend the inauguration. 
Along with its Person of the Year honor, Time magazine named the Korean pop group BTS as its Entertainer of the Year, and basketball star LeBron James was crowned Athlete of the Year.

The winners and finalists for various categories were due to be feted during a prime-time special television broadcast on NBC on Thursday night.

""But people should not be too anxious. Remember there are a number of vaccine candidates coming online at the same time,"" WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told a U.N. briefing in Geneva.
""One vaccine may not be suitable for particular individuals, but you may well find another vaccine is.""
On Tuesday, Britain became the first country to roll out the Pfizer-BioNTech shot. Its medicine regulator subsequently said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a medicine or food should not get the shot, after two reported incidents of the reaction.
A panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to endorse emergency use of the vaccine, paving the way for the agency to authorize the shot for a nation that has lost more than 285,000 lives to COVID-19.
The WHO is reviewing data from phase 3 trials of many COVID-19 vaccine candidates, Harris said. The agency has not yet issued emergency use authorisation for any vaccines, but ""the primary thing we look at is safety"", she added.

1293,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai charged under national security law,"HONG KONG (Reuters) -Hong Kong democracy activist and media tycoon Jimmy Lai, 73, has been charged under the city's national security law on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces, his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper reported on Friday, citing a police source. 
Lai, an ardent critic of Beijing, would be the highest profile person charged under the sweeping new law imposed on the Chinese-ruled city in June. 
He was due to appear in court on Saturday, according to Apple Daily, a popular tabloid known for its feisty and critical coverage of China and Hong Kong. 
The security law, which punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail, has been condemned by the West and human rights groups as a tool to crush dissent in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city. 
Authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing say it is vital to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the global financial hub over the last year. 
""The goal is to hold Jimmy Lai, and shut Jimmy Lai up,"" Mark Simon, an associate of Lai, told Reuters. 
Hong Kong police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The publishing tycoon is one of the financial hub's most prominent democracy activists, while his Next Media group is considered one of the key remaining bastions of media freedoms in Hong Kong. 
Tensions between China and the United States have escalated in recent weeks as Washington accuses Beijing of using the security law to trample wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Authorities have intensified a crackdown on opposition forces in the city, dismissing lawmakers from the legislature, conducting widespread arrests and jailing high-profile democracy activists such as Joshua Wong. 
Lai was denied bail earlier this month following his arrest on a separate charge of fraud related to the lease of a building that houses his Apple Daily, an anti-government tabloid.
He was arrested in August when about 200 police officers swooped on his offices. Hong Kong police later said they had arrested nine men and one woman for suspected offences including ""collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud"" and others.
The tycoon had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor"".

CHICAGO (Reuters) - When hospital cleaner Evelia De La Cruz was assigned to the COVID-19 ward in March, she was afraid. 
A 60-year-old immigrant from the southern coast of Mexico, De La Cruz was tasked with stripping sheets and sanitizing beds as first a handful, and then a deluge, of coronavirus patients brought infection to her Chicago hospital.
""I prayed for God to give me the courage,"" she said.
Some of De La Cruz's colleagues refused to work the COVID-19 wards, she said, leaving the hospital understaffed. She has been laboring seven days a week, at times for weeks on end. 
""Every day I went to work, even on my days off, because I know that the patients need me, the hospital and the country needs me,"" she said.
Throughout the northern hemisphere spring, as the coronavirus ravaged through international cities, residents of Rome, Madrid, New York City and beyond took to their balconies to applaud frontline medical workers who, often overlooked in non-pandemic years, had become symbols of sacrifice in terrifying times. 
Ten months and over a million and a half global deaths later, nurses and doctors continue to risk their lives every day as they report to the hospitals. 
Yet, their ability to work has relied on a less visible category of frontline staff: cleaners and janitors like De La Cruz.
These workers also risk infection and death but receive far fewer accolades.
In the United States, many are immigrants from Latin America, a population already hard-hit by the pandemic.
Since the outbreak began, the only time De La Cruz took more than the occasional day off was in July, when she herself was infected with the virus. 
After a month-long recovery, she returned to disinfecting the coronavirus-contaminated areas of the hospital.
She keeps a vase filled with fresh flowers in her home, where she prays for the health of her family and for an end to the pandemic.
""I'm proud to serve the sick and this country,"" said De La Cruz, who has lived in the United States for three decades. 
Her neighbors sometimes stop to thank her, she said.

""'You're so brave,' they tell me,"" she said.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The U.N.-backed Lebanon Tribunal on Friday sentenced a Hezbollah member convicted of conspiring to kill former Lebanese prime minister Rafik al-Hariri in a 2005 bombing to five terms of life imprisonment.
Salim Jamil Ayyash was found guilty in August of homicide and committing a terrorist act over the deaths of Hariri and 21 others in the attack on Beirut's waterfront. 
The trial was conducted in absentia and Ayyash remains at large. Three alleged accomplices were acquitted due to insufficient evidence.
""The attack was intended to spread terror in Lebanon and indeed did,"" Australian Judge David Re said in reading out the court's decision. ""The trial chamber is satisfied it should impose the maximum sentence for each of the five crimes of a life sentence to be served concurrently.""
Hariri's assassination plunged Lebanon into what was then its worst crisis since its 1975-90 civil war, setting the stage for years of confrontation between rival political forces.
""Mr Ayyash's crimes are extremely grave, he had a central role in the attack,"" Judge Janet Nosworthy said.
""Lebanon is a parliamentary democracy, its politicians and leaders should be removed from office at the ballot box rather than by the bullet or a bomb,"" she said.

Prosecutors had called for a life sentence for each of the five counts Ayyash was convicted of.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States executed convicted felon Brandon Bernard on Thursday, despite objections by some of the jurors in his trial who pleaded with the Trump administration to show mercy, the federal Bureau of Prisons said.
Bernard's death marked the ninth execution since Attorney General William Barr resumed the use of the federal death penalty earlier this year following a 17-year hiatus. 
Bernard was convicted in 2000 along with an accomplice, Christopher Vialva, of carjacking and murdering Todd and Stacie Bagley, married Christian youth ministers from Iowa, on the Fort Hood army base in Texas. 
At the time of the crime, Bernard was 18 years old. Vialva kidnapped and shot the couple at close range as they lay inside the trunk of the car. Afterwards, Bernard set the car on fire.
The Justice Department executed Vialva on Sept. 24. 
""I’m sorry,"" a media witness quoted Bernard as saying, shortly before the execution. ""That’s the only words that I can say that completely capture how I feel now and how I felt that day.""
Five jurors from the trial of the two men had backed Bernard's clemency petition, saying his lawyers did a poor job defending him at trial. Though they still agree that both Bernard and Vialva were guilty, they said Bernard did not seem to have intended to kill the Bagleys.
Attorneys for Bernard say that through their own investigation, they discovered prosecutors withheld crucial information that could have proven Bernard was a low-level member of a youth gang, making him less of a threat in the future to re-offend.
'TERRIBLE MISTAKE'
His fight for clemency garnered the attention of celebrity Kim Kardashian, who on Twitter pleaded for the government to show mercy.
""Brandon made one terrible mistake at age 18. But he did not kill anyone, and he never stopped feeling shame and profound remorse for his actions,"" his attorney Robert Owen said. 
The American Civil Liberties Union has been fighting to at least temporarily halt all federal executions due to pandemic concerns. 
Their effort comes after the spiritual adviser to former inmate Orlando Hall contracted COVID-19 after he traveled to the federal death chamber at the prison in Terre Haute, Indiana for Hall's November execution.
Since then, the Justice Department has revealed in court filings that at least eight, or 20%, of the Bureau of Prison staff who participated in Hall's execution, have since tested positive for COVID-19.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday evening denied a stay of execution for Bernard, with its three liberal justices dissenting.
""Today, the court allows the federal government to execute Brandon Bernard, despite Bernard’s troubling allegations that the government secured his death sentence by withholding exculpatory evidence and knowingly eliciting false testimony against him,"" wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor in her dissent.
""Bernard has never had the opportunity to test the merits of those claims in court. Now he never will.""
Several more inmates are set to be executed before Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20, including Alfred Bourgeois, who is scheduled to be executed on Friday for torturing and killing his young daughter, according to a Justice Department summary of the case.

KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan commissioned the first of a new fleet of coastguard ships on Friday, an advanced catamaran that can be armed with missiles during war, as the island bolsters its defences in the face of what it sees as a growing threat from Beijing.
President Tsai Ing-wen has made military modernisation a priority for the Chinese-claimed island. Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.
    Attending the commissioning of the domestically made, T$1.05 billion ($37.30 million) Anping in the southern city of Kaohsiung, Tsai praised its ""specific"" ability of being able to be used in time of conflict.
    ""If necessary, it can be immediately be transformed into an important force for defence,"" she said at the shipyard, where she also named the second ship to follow the Anping, the Chengkung. 
    ""This also means that while the coastguard strengthens law enforcement, national defence forces will be strengthened too.""    
    The Anping is a similar vessel to the Tuo Chiang-class of corvettes, on which it is based, and has space for launchers for Hsiung Feng anti-ship and sea-to-land missiles but has added equipment for rescue operations.
    The Tuo Chiang vessels are state-of-the-art, highly manoeuvrable stealth vessels, meant to take out larger warships while operating close to Taiwan's shores. 
    The first is already in service, and has been referred to by Taiwan's navy as the ""aircraft carrier killer"" due to its missile complement. China has two carriers in operation and is building at least one more.
    With Taiwan's armed forces dwarfed by China's, Tsai has championed the concept of ""asymmetric warfare"", including adding weapons that are mobile and harder to attack, to make any Chinese offensive costly and difficult.
    While the United States remains Taiwan's most important arms supplier, Tsai has also boosted the island's indigenous defence industry, most notably the planned building of eight submarines.
    Taiwan's coastguard is often involved in confrontations with Chinese fishing and sand-dredging ships which Taiwan says operate illegally in its waters.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The imminent release of a man convicted for the rape of a child in South Korea has re-ignited a debate over what to do with criminals who escape harsher punishment by using intoxication as an excuse and the lenient sentences given for sex crimes against minors.
Cho Doo-soon, who was 57 when he was convicted in 2009 of raping an 8-year-old girl so violently that she was left with permanent internal injuries, is set to be released from prison on Saturday to live in his old home in Ansan near Seoul.
The victim and her family moved a few weeks ago from their home which is about 1 km (half a mile) away, her father told Reuters. 
Cho has served a 12-year sentence, commuted from 15 years for the fact he was drunk, leading to widespread anger.
Lawmakers have proposed a bill that makes the life sentence mandatory for child rapists but it has not calmed the public's outrage and fear over the fact that Cho will be free to roam the city although he will be wearing a GPS device that tracks him.
A petition calling for Cho to be kept in prison for life has gathered 610,000 signatures and more than 110,000 have signed another petition demanding continued confinement.
“South Korean law is lenient on liquor, as they think alcohol is the least entitled pleasure for the working class,” said forensic psychologist Lee Soo-jung of Kyonggi University.
The public outcry comes amid calls for crackdowns on sexual violence against women and children, including a rash of hidden-camera crimes, ""revenge porn"", and online networks that blackmail women and underage girls into sharing sexual and sometimes violent images of themselves.
A man convicted of running one of the world’s largest child pornography networks, for example, was only sentenced to a year and a half in prison.
However, last month, the leader of an online sexual blackmail ring was sentenced to 40 years in prison.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries struck a deal on the bloc's new climate target on Friday after haggling through the night at a summit in Brussels, pulling the political trigger on a policy revamp to make every sector greener.
Leaders from the 27-country bloc agreed to cut their net greenhouse gas emissions at least 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels, upgrading an existing target to cut by 40% this decade.
The new target aims to put the EU on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050, a deadline scientists say the world must meet to avert the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.
""Europe is the leader in the fight against climate change. We decided to cut our greenhouse gas emissions ... at least 55% by 2030,"" European Council President Charles Michel, who chaired the talks, said in a tweet.
""It puts us on a clear path towards climate neutrality in 2050,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said of the new target. 
For Brussels, the deal offers a chance to assert its climate leadership on the global stage. The EU will present its target at a United Nations virtual summit of world leaders on Saturday.
The target is a hard-won political compromise between wealthier, mostly western and Nordic EU countries that want more ambitious climate action, and eastern states with coal-dependent power sectors and energy-intensive industries that wanted specific conditions attached to emissions cuts.
Poland held out alone until dawn for a deal that would guarantee promised funding from the EU carbon market for poorer countries would not be reduced. 
It also sought assurances that future national emissions-cutting targets, set by Brussels for certain sectors, would be based on gross domestic product - meaning that less prosperous states would be required to cut less.
A majority of countries had opposed these demands on grounds that they would pre-empt detailed policy proposals the EU's executive Commission will make to deliver the target.
Those proposals will overhaul the EU carbon market, speed a shift to electric vehicles and aim to mobilise the huge low-carbon investments needed - including a requirement for extra energy sector investments of 350 billion euros ($424 billion) a year this decade. 
The ""at least 55%"" target is as-good-as-final, but will need approval from the European Parliament, which supports a more ambitious 60% emissions cut.

""They are setting us up for a tough negotiation,"" said Jytte Guteland, parliament's lead lawmaker on the issue.

In a verdict read to the court, a judge said Nguyen Duc Chung, 53, the former Hanoi People’s Committee chairman, was the main instigator in the case involving the alleged smuggling of electronic equipment through a technology company into Vietnam. 
The judge said the hiding of profits amassed by the company caused around 1 trillion dong ($43.24 million) of losses to the state budget. 
Reuters could not immediately reach Chung's lawyers for comment. Chung had pleaded guilty at the start of the trial and he apologised to the Communist Party for his actions.
Three other people, including a former policeman received prison sentences of between 18 months and 4 1/2 years over the case, said the judge.
The once high-flying Chung, who had also been a former police chief of Hanoi, took up the position of chairman of Hanoi in late 2015.
During his tenure, Hanoi successfully struck a deal to host Vietnam's first Formula 1 race, which was then cancelled following his arrest in August and due to the pandemic.
His sentencing comes as the Vietnam government has stepped up its fight against corruption, with several senior officials arrested and jailed ahead of the Communist Party's five-yearly congress. 
Government critics say the corruption crackdown is politically motivated.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. military agreed on Friday to return 12 sites to South Korea, including some in central Seoul, clearing the way for civilian construction projects after years of squabbling over the hand-back.
U.S. forces have been stationed in South Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War. In recent years, the allies have disputed the cost of maintaining the 28,500 U.S. personnel at various bases despite what many see as a growing North Korean threat.
The 12 sites are among 80 that U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) agreed in 2002 to hand over to South Korea for redevelopment but the plans have been delayed by haggling over clean-up costs.
The two sides finalised the handover plan for the 12 sites on the condition that the discussion of clean-up costs continued, South Korean government agencies said in a statement.
""We reached the decision comprehensively considering social and economic issues in the communities caused by the delays and their requests for the swift return,"" Choi Chang-won, a vice minister of government policy coordination, told a briefing. 
Residents in some areas have protested for years to get the sites returned to civilian use saying the U.S. facilities stifled development plans and undermined property prices.
Among the 12 sites are six in the capital, Seoul, including two at the Yongsan Garrison in the city centre, which housed the USFK headquarters until it was moved to the new, sprawling Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul, in 2018.
The government plans to refurbish the sites and build residential and commercial facilities to help curb spiralling apartment prices, the government agencies said.
The health ministry and Seoul authorities are considering a plan for a public hospital specialising in infectious diseases at one of the sites in the capital.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 02:26AM ET</span>","One year on, Wuhan market at epicentre of virus outbreak remains barricaded and empty","By Cate Cadell
WUHAN, China (Reuters) - For over six years, 38-year-old Wuhan restaurant owner Lai Yun started most days the same way - with a trip to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, just ten minutes walk from his house.
""I'd send the kids to school, have breakfast and then walk over to the market. It was very convenient,"" he said.
That changed on Dec. 31, 2019, after four cases of a mystery pneumonia were linked to the market and it was shuttered overnight. By the end of the month, the city had begun a gruelling 76-day lockdown that came with just hours notice and barred people from leaving their homes.
Almost a year since the outbreak began, COVID-19 has claimed more than 1.5 million lives, and the Wuhan wet market where it was initially detected stands empty even as the city around it has come back to life. 
It's become a symbol of the fierce political and scientific battle raging around the origin of the virus with Beijing continuing to spar with the United States and other countries, accusing them of bias.
A team of World Health Organization experts has yet to visit Wuhan, let alone the market. Health authorities in China and abroad have warned that origin tracing efforts could take years and yield inconclusive results.
In Wuhan, where the stigma of being the first coronavirus epicentre hangs heavy, over a dozen residents and business owners told Reuters they don't believe the virus began in the city.
""It certainly couldn't have been Wuhan... surely another person brought it in. Or surely it came from some other product brought from outside. There were just certain conditions for it to appear here,"" said a wet market vendor in the city's centre who gave his name as Chen.
In recent months, Chinese diplomats and state media have said they believe the market is not the origin but the victim of the disease, and have thrown support behind theories that the virus potentially originated in another country.
RESTRICTED ACCESS
Experts say the market still plays a role in the investigation and is therefore unlikely to be demolished, though much of that research will rely on samples taken immediately after the outbreak began.
""The first cluster of cases was there, so at least it would be of interest to find out the origin of those and put forward a few hypotheses, like whether it's more likely from the wild animals or perhaps points to a human superspreader,"" said Jin Dong-Yan, professor of virology at the University of Hong Kong.
Access to the area remains heavily restricted. People who visited before the lockdown remember a bustling building with hundreds of stalls divided into sections for red meat, seafood and vegetables.
Recently, the local government has added leafy green plants and traditional Chinese paintings to the semi-permanent blue barricades encircling the area. Inside, wooden boards line the stalls and windows.
On the second floor above the empty market, shops selling glasses and optometry equipment reopened in June. 
This week, a guard at the entrance to the eyeware market took temperatures and warned journalists not to take videos or photos from inside the building.
""Maybe some people have some bad feelings about it, but now it's just an empty building ... who feels anxious about an empty building?"" said a shop assistant selling contact lenses, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject.
While Wuhan hasn't reported any new locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 since May, for some who relied on the market making ends meet is still a struggle.
Lai, who reopened his Japanese restaurant in June, says the market's closure and subsequent public panic about the safety of imported seafood has increased the cost of procuring some ingredients five-fold.
""Our goal for the next year is to just survive.""

The Australian Federal Police estimated the street value of the find at up to A$79 million ($60 million).

1309,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>","U.S., allies to raise human rights in North Korea at U.N. Security Council","By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nearly half the 15-member U.N. Security Council plan to raise the issue of rights abuses in North Korea during a closed-door meeting on Friday - a move likely to anger Pyongyang - after Russia and China objected to a public briefing, diplomats said.
The United States, Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, the Dominican Republic and Estonia told council colleagues they will raise the implications of North Korea's ""ongoing human rights violations against its people on international peace and security,"" according to an email seen by Reuters on Thursday. 
They had initially requested a public briefing on the issue by U.N. human rights officials, but diplomats said Russia and China had objected. The Chinese, Russian and North Korean U.N. missions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Between 2014 and 2017 the Security Council held annual public meetings on human rights abuses in North Korea. 
In 2018 the council did not discuss the issue amid now failed efforts by North Korea leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump to work toward Pyongyang's denuclearization.
Last year at least eight council members pushed for a meeting on human rights abuses, sparking Pyongyang to warn it would consider such a move a ""serious provocation"" to which it would ""respond strongly."" 
But the United States, which was the monthly council president at the time, instead convened a meeting on the threat of escalation by North Korea amid growing tensions between Pyongyang and Washington. 
North Korea has repeatedly rejected accusations of human rights abuses and blames sanctions for a dire humanitarian situation. Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.
A landmark 2014 U.N. report on North Korean human rights concluded that North Korean security chiefs - and possibly leader Kim himself - should face justice for overseeing a state-controlled system of Nazi-style atrocities. The United States blacklisted Kim in 2016 for human rights abuses.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 12:40AM ET</span>","Ahead of U.N. climate summit, urgent calls to 'fix the future'","By Matthew Green and Valerie Volcovici
LONDON (Reuters) - When the Paris Agreement on climate change was finalized after two weeks of fraught negotiations and years of past failures, diplomats hugged and shed tears of joy. They had haggled over verb tenses, cut deals, and in the end, brought 196 countries into the accord.
Five years later, governments are lagging far behind in implementing the deal, struck on Dec. 12, 2015. Annual greenhouse gas emissions hit a new high last year. And climate change impacts are intensifying, from the thawing Arctic to raging wildfires in Australia and the U.S. West. 
""Emissions are not being reduced at the rate that science says we need,"" said Alden Meyer, a longtime veteran of the U.N. talks and an analyst for the E3G climate change think-tank. 
The Paris Agreement aims to hold the rise in average global temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, and preferably 1.5C -- a threshold beyond which climate impacts are projected to sharply intensify.
Temperatures have already risen by more than 1C since pre-industrial times, and scientists say that the world's fossil fuel-dependent economies will have to undergo wholesale transformation to bring those goals within reach. 
As delegates prepare for a one-day online U.N. climate summit on Saturday, negotiators point to signs of progress: rapid advances in renewable energy, growing appetite for greener investments, and pledges on emissions by the European Union and China. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to rejoin the accord. 
""Am I optimistic? Yes, by choice, and by evidence,"" said Christiana Figueres, a Costa Rican diplomat who played a key role in brokering the Paris deal as then executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.
""FIX THE FUTURE""
The Paris accord makes no specific mention of the fossil fuels responsible for the bulk of planet-warming emissions. But the implication in the 25-page text is clear: the world needs to rapidly end the 250-year reign of coal, oil and natural gas.
Pledges so far to reduce emissions put the world on track for a catastrophic 3C or more of warming this century, with countries planning to produce double the amount of fossil fuels needed to hit the 1.5C target in the next decade alone.
Scientists say it is now imperative that the world halve carbon emissions over the next 10 years. And government action still falls far short of that.
""If you look at the immediate action that we need right now, it's like we are still in a state of denial,"" Swedish activist Greta Thunberg told reporters on Tuesday.
At the summit on Saturday, diplomats will be watching for signs that countries are preparing to ramp up climate efforts ahead of a major round of U.N. climate talks in Glasgow due to take place in November 2021.
""What we have to do is translate what we can do into what we will do – and that is where many of us worry,"" said British climate economist Nicholas Stern.
Perhaps the most encouraging sign for the Paris deal is the number of countries that have begun to pledge to slash carbon emissions to net zero -- meaning they will release only as much as they remove from the air -- by 2050.
""We are seeing the payoff of the push we all made in Paris,"" said Meyer. ""Net-zero was a radical concept not too long ago.""
Britain and the European Union adopted the target last year, and China - the largest emitter - surprised many in September by announcing of goal of net-zero by 2060. Subsequent pledges by Japan and South Korea mean more than 50% of global emissions are now under net-zero targets, U.N. officials say.
Assuming Biden adopts a similar goal after he takes office in January, and that governments do far more to keep existing pledges, warming could be held to 2.1C by 2100, according to research network Climate Action Tracker https://climateactiontracker.org/press/global-update-paris-agreement-turning-point.
Experts say governments now have a fleeting opportunity to harness massive post-pandemic economic recovery packages to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy. So far, however, much of that money has been spent supporting the status quo.
Nevertheless, rapid expansion of wind and solar along with strong uptake of electric vehicles this year marked a sharp contrast with the faltering fortunes of oil and gas companies hit by collapsing demand.
Young activists, who form the vanguard of growing global protests for climate action, aim to push even harder.

""You already determined our present, which is obviously catastrophic,"" Ugandan campaigner Vanessa Nakate said of older generations. ""Now fix the future.""

1311,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 11, 2020 12:15AM ET</span>",Bushfires in a wet year have Australia's scientists looking to climate change,"By Byron Kaye
SYDNEY (Reuters) - In a summer that was supposed to be unusually cool and wet, Australian builder Rob Lye did not expect to be trapped by a bushfire on sub-tropical Fraser Island and battling with his neighbours to protect their homes.
With climate change overriding some of Australia's more moderating weather forces, scientists say wildfires like the one that tore through half of the island's forest in recent weeks are increasingly likely.
""We just found a safe spot to settle and rest while the fire was burning,"" said Lye, 52, of the island's Happy Valley township. 
""It wasn't pleasant,"" he said, adding that the local community, many of whom opted against following an evacuation order, saved all 50 or so houses before sheltering for safety as fire tore through the island on Monday.
The first major bushfires of the 2020-21 fire season first broke out in the southern hemisphere spring even as Australia was still recovering from last season's record infernos, which not long ago would have been considered a once-in-a-generation event.
Research released in March found that human-caused global warming made the 2019-20 fires at least 30% more likely to occur.
""For any specific event, it's actually very difficult to say 'the dry condition and the fire is attributable to climate change',"" said Wenju Cai, a climate scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.
""But one thing we are sure of is that climate change will make soil and land dry faster,"" Cai said. ""It's the background conditions that can be attributed to climate change.""
The fire on Fraser Island burned through 80,000 hectares (198,000 acres) of wilderness on the heritage-listed island off the country's northeast. The fact that fire could do so much damage in a La Nina year – which normally brings high rainfall and lower temperatures – offers yet another sign that global warming is making Australian weather less predictable.
""What we're seeing at Fraser Island I haven't seen in my lifetime,"" said Richie Merzian, climate and energy director at think tank The Australia Institute.
""That doesn't mean that it is a direct manifestation of climate change, but we know that (climate change) is definitely part of the picture, and it is making these things worse.""
  
PERFECT STORM
There were signs that 2020 would not be a typical La Nina before the Fraser Island fire sparked in mid-October. The country was experiencing its hottest spring on record, and rainfall over southeast Queensland, home of Fraser Island, was ""well below average"", the Bureau of Meteorology said.
Australia has had nine of its 10 hottest years on record since 2005, prompting authorities to warn that fire risk will continue to grow. This year is also on track to feature among the hottest years on record.
There is a ""very clear linkage"" between climate change and high temperatures, low humidity and dry fuel - the main ingredients of bushfire risk, said Mark Howden, director of Australian National University's Climate Change Institute and vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
On Fraser Island, property owners like Lye said their efforts were helped by planning a year earlier, when fires destroyed millions of hectares in the country’s southeast.
Residents want to get permission for controlled burns, to diminish forest fuel and reduce wildfire hazards. But securing permission for such burns is difficult on Fraser Island, home to the world's only tropical forest that grows on sand. 
With the island's wildfire now coming under control, evacuees have been able to return to survey the damage.
""I was in tears because I didn't realise how close it had come. It literally had burned to the grass on the edge of all the houses,"" said Elspeth Murray, head of the Happy Valley Community Association.
""You fight hard on the day, and then it hits you afterwards.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian man from China's Muslim Uighur community was reunited with his family, including a three-year-old son he had never met, after Beijing agreed they could depart Xinjiang.
Sadam Abudusalamu posted on Twitter photographs of his family arriving at Sydney airport on Thursday and thanked Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne, human rights activists, and ""everyone who worked so hard to reunite us"".
In 2017, Chinese authorities banned Abudusalamu's wife Nadila Wumaier and son from leaving Xinjiang by confiscating their passports, in what became a high-profile human rights case in Australia. 
Abdusalamu had come to Australia as a student over a decade ago, and married Wumaier in Xinjiang in 2016. Their son Lufty was born in Xinjiang, and granted Australian citizenship in 2019, after Abdusalamu urged the Australian government to help the family.
In February, after China's deputy head of mission in Australia, Wang Xining, said on ABC Television Wumaier didn't want to leave Xinjiang, she posted a photograph to Twitter holding a sign saying 'I want to leave and be with my husband'.
Payne said in July the Australian embassy in Beijing had formally requested the Chinese authorities allow Wumaier, a Chinese citizen, to leave.
China has been criticised at the United Nations Human Rights Council by countries including Australia and the United States for the arbitrary detention and restrictions on freedom of movement of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. China has rejected the criticism.
The family's lawyer Michael Bradley confirmed to Reuters that Lufty, 3, and his mother had arrived from China two weeks ago, and had flown to Sydney on Thursday after quarantining at a hotel in Brisbane.
Bradley, who was at the airport, said Abudusalamu was overjoyed to see his wife, and meet his son. 
""We are just thrilled it has ended this way. It has been a long saga,"" Bradley added.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 09:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. says reports of Eritrean troops in Ethiopia's Tigray are 'credible',"By Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes reports of Eritrean military involvement in the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region are ""credible,"" a State Department spokesperson told Reuters on Thursday, despite denials by both nations.
The spokesperson called on any Eritrean soldiers there to pull out.
""We are aware of credible reports of Eritrean military involvement in Tigray and view this as a grave development. We urge that any such troops be withdrawn immediately,"" the spokesperson said. 
Reuters was first to report on Tuesday that the U.S. government believed Eritrean soldiers had crossed into Ethiopian territory, effectively helping Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government battle a rebellious northern force.
Abiy won a Nobel Peace Prize last year for making peace with Eritrea, but the presence of Eritrean troops on Ethiopian soil would alarm Western allies and risk further inflaming the conflict. 
Eritrea has for years faced accusations of large scale rights abuses, including jailing opponents and forcing citizens into lengthy military or government service. It accuses Western powers of smear campaigns and luring Eritreans abroad, which they deny.
Ethiopia hosts the African Union, its security services work with Western allies, and its troops serve in peacekeeping missions in South Sudan and Somalia.
The State Department spokesperson noted reports of human rights abuses in Tigray.
""We are also aware of reports of human rights violations and abuses in the region. All parties must respect human rights and international humanitarian law,"" the spokesperson said.
""We and other international partners continue to urge an independent investigation of the reports and accountability for those found responsible.""
Ethiopia has denied Eritrea entered the conflict, though Abiy did say last week that some government troops retreated into Eritrea early in the conflict and were given assistance. Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh has called claims it entered the conflict ""propaganda.""
Claims by all sides are near-impossible to verify because most communications to Tigray are down, and the government tightly controls access.
Abiy and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace pact ending two decades of hostilities in 2018 and now regard the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) as a mutual foe.
The TPLF claims to have killed and captured large numbers of Eritrean troops in the last month, but has provided no evidence. It has fired rockets into Eritrea at least four times, the U.S. State Department says.
Reuters, citing diplomatic sources, reported on Tuesday that Eritrean troops were believed to have entered Ethiopia in mid-November through three northern border towns: Zalambessa, Rama and Badme.

Mesfin Hagos, a former Eritrean defence minister who broke with Isaias, said in an article for online publication African Arguments that the Eritreans sent in four mechanized divisions, seven infantry divisions and a commando brigade, citing sources in the defence ministry, opposition and personal contacts.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. set to sanction Turkey over Russian defense system - sources,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Phil Stewart
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is poised to impose sanctions on Turkey over its acquisition last year of Russian S-400 air defense systems, five sources including three U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday, a move likely to worsen already problematic ties between the two NATO allies.
The long-anticipated step, which is likely to infuriate Ankara and weigh on Turkey's relations with the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, is expected to be announced as early as Friday, sources have said.
The sanctions would target Turkey's Presidency of Defence Industries and its head, Ismail Demir, sources have said. They would be damaging but narrower than the severe scenarios some analysts have outlined.
Two sources familiar with the matter, including a U.S. official speaking on the condition of anonymity, said President Donald Trump had given aides the blessing for the sanctions. 
The Turkish lira weakened as much as 1.4% following the news. U.S. sanctions could harm a Turkish economy struggling with a coronavirus-induced slowdown, double-digit inflation and badly depleted foreign reserves.
A senior Turkish official said sanctions would backfire and hurt ties between the two NATO members.
""Sanctions would not achieve a result but be counter-productive. They would harm relations,"" the official said. ""Turkey is in favor of solving these problems with diplomacy and negotiations. We won't accept one-sided impositions,"" he said.
The decision will have repercussions far beyond Turkey, sending a message to U.S. partners around the world that might consider buying Russian military equipment and have been warned repeatedly about U.S. sanctions.
Turkey's leader, President Tayyip Erdogan, had hoped to prove U.S. threats hollow, betting the relationship he developed with Trump would insulate Ankara from punitive U.S. action.
Having forged a working relationship with Erdogan, Trump long opposed U.S. sanctions against Turkey despite the advice of advisers. Officials in his administration internally recommended sanctions against Ankara in July 2019, when the Turkish government started taking delivery of the S-400s, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
But sanctions appeared likely even if Trump did not act, the sources said. 
The final version of the $740 billion annual U.S. defense authorization legislation, which the Senate is expected to vote on as early as this week, would force Washington to impose sanctions within 30 days.
One of the U.S. officials said one of the reasons Trump was finally willing to move ahead with Turkey sanctions was to ""decouple"" the issue from NDAA bill, which carries a provision that would require him to impose measures on Ankara. This way, Trump can avoid looking like his hand is being forced, the official said.
KICKED OUT OF F-35 PROGRAM
Still, the increasing U.S. pressure is not without risk. Washington does not want to push Erdogan even closer to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose goal is to weaken and divide the NATO alliance.
Russia delivered the ground-to-air S-400s last year and Turkey tested them as recently as October. Ankara said they would not be integrated into NATO systems and pose no threat, and has called for a joint working group on the issue.
But the United States maintained that the S-400 does pose a threat, and announced last year it was removing Turkey from the F-35 fighter jet program over Ankara's decision.
 Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s F-35 stealth fighter jet is the most advanced aircraft in the U.S. arsenal and is used by NATO members and other U.S. allies.
The U.S. State Department could still change plans and widen or narrow the scope of planned sanctions against Turkey.

However, sources said the announcement of the sanctions in their current form was imminent.

SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (Reuters) - Central American authorities on Thursday began trying to break up a caravan of hundreds of Hondurans who set off for the United States to escape the impact of back-to-back hurricanes, testing efforts to stem immigration from the battered region.
Honduran authorities set up checkpoints, stopping groups aiming to join the caravan and encouraging them to return home instead, including turning around a bus with about 50 people in the western department of Ocotepeque, local media said.
Guatemala's migration authorities warned the travelers they would need negative coronavirus tests and passports to enter the country. An earlier caravan of thousands moving through Central America was broken up by Guatemalan security forces in October.
The caravan is the first since Joe Biden defeated U.S. President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 presidential election. 
The president-elect has vowed to pursue a ""humane"" migration policy and promised a $4 billion plan to address underlying factors driving migration from Central America.
But the destruction caused by hurricanes Eta and Iota, which killed hundreds and displaced over half a million people across the region, may pose an early challenge for Biden's strategy. 
""We were living underneath a bridge, with houses made of plastic sheets,"" caravan member Yey Rivera said by telephone.
Rivera, 24, said after the storm destroyed his home and government aid never arrived, he joined the caravan hoping to find work in the United States to send money back to his family.
""What hurt me most was leaving my mother alone under the bridge,"" he said. ""(But) I have to be strong to help her.""
By midday on Thursday, a small group of migrants reached the Guatemalan border town of Corinto.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 06:50PM ET</span>",Morocco joins other Arab nations agreeing to normalize Israel ties,"By Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Israel and Morocco agreed on Thursday to normalize relations in a deal brokered with U.S. help, making Morocco the fourth Arab country to set aside hostilities with Israel in the past four months. 
It joins the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Sudan in beginning to forge deals with Israel, driven in part by U.S.-led efforts to present a united front against Iran and roll back Tehran's regional influence.
In a departure from longstanding U.S. policy, President Donald Trump agreed as part of the deal to recognize Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara, a desert region where a decades-old territorial dispute has pitted Morocco against the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, a breakaway movement that seeks to establish an independent state.
President-elect Joe Biden, due to succeed Trump on Jan. 20, will face a decision whether to accept the U.S. deal on the Western Sahara, which no other Western nation has done. A Biden spokesman declined to comment.
While Biden is expected to move U.S. foreign policy away from Trump's ""America First"" posture, the Democrat has indicated he will continue the pursuit of what Trump calls ""the Abraham Accords"" between Israel and Arab and Muslim nations.
Trump sealed the Israel-Morocco accord in a phone call with Morocco's King Mohammed VI on Thursday, the White House said.
""Another HISTORIC breakthrough today! Our two GREAT friends Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco have agreed to full diplomatic relations – a massive breakthrough for peace in the Middle East!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Mohammed told Trump that Morocco intends to facilitate direct flights for Israeli tourists to and from Morocco, according to a statement from Morocco's royal court.
""This will be a very warm peace. Peace has never - the light of peace on this Hanukkah day has never - shone brighter than today in the Middle East,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement, referring to a Jewish eight-day holiday starting on Thursday night.
Palestinians have been critical of the normalization deals, saying Arab countries have set back the cause of peace by abandoning a longstanding demand that Israel give up land for a Palestinian state before it can receive recognition.
Egypt and UAE issued statements welcoming Morocco's decision. Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979.
""This step, a sovereign move, contributes to strengthening our common quest for stability, prosperity, and just and lasting peace in the region,"" Abu Dhabi's crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, wrote on Twitter.
But Senator Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the U.S. Senate's Armed Services Committee, denounced Trump's ""shocking and deeply disappointing"" decision to recognize Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara. Inhofe said people living in the area should vote in a referendum to decide their future.
""The president has been poorly advised by his team. He could have made this deal without trading the rights of a voiceless people,"" Inhofe said in a statement. 
A senior U.S. official said Trump knew about Inhofe's opposition to recognizing Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara. But Inhofe's argument lost ground with the president when the senator refused to hold up the annual defense spending bill when Trump demanded it be used to repeal a law granting liability protection to tech companies, the official said.
The Morocco deal could be among the last that Trump's team, led by White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and U.S. envoy Avi Berkowitz, will negotiate before giving way to Biden's incoming administration.
Kushner told reporters on a conference call it was inevitable that Saudi Arabia would eventually strike a similar deal with Israel. A U.S. official said the Saudis were not likely to act until after Biden takes office, and even then there would be strong internal opposition that could block such a move in the near term.
FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
Under the agreement, Morocco will establish full diplomatic relations and resume official contacts with Israel. 
""They are going to reopen their liaison offices in Rabat and Tel Aviv immediately with the intention to open embassies. And they are going to promote economic cooperation between Israeli and Moroccan companies,"" Kushner told Reuters.
Trump's agreement to change U.S. policy on the Western Sahara was the linchpin for getting Morocco's agreement and a major shift away from a mostly neutral stance.
In Rabat, Morocco's royal court said Washington will open a consulate in Western Sahara as part of Morocco's deal with Israel. 
A White House proclamation said the United States believes that an independent Sahrawi state is ""not a realistic option for resolving the conflict and that genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty is the only feasible solution.""
""We urge the parties to engage in discussions without delay, using Morocco's autonomy plan as the only framework to negotiate a mutually acceptable solution,"" it said.
Washington had supported a 1991 ceasefire between Morocco and the Western Sahara's Polisario Front independence movement that called for a referendum to resolve the issue. Last month, after a border incident, the Polisario pulled out of that deal and announced a return to armed struggle. 
A representative of the Polisario Front said it ""regrets highly"" the U.S. change in policy, which it called ""strange but not surprising.""

""This will not change an inch of the reality of the conflict and the right of the people of Western Sahara to self determination,"" the Polisario's Europe representative Oubi Bchraya said.

The indigenous women wrestlers have become symbolic at home and abroad of the power of women, reclaiming the pejorative Spanish term ""chola"" used for indigenous groups and proudly making it part of their heritage and strength.
Hit by the pandemic, the cholita wrestlers are now returning after a nine-month hiatus, but face an ongoing challenge with the lucrative tourist crowd still missing from matches. 
""I will show that I am a good wrestler, and not just in the ring. I will also show that I have won against the pandemic, we will recover what we have lost,"" said fighter Patricia Torres, who goes as ""Gloria La Luchadora"" in the ring. 
""I've been wrestling for about 10 years. I am a single mother of two children, and I have a trade. Because of the trade I am in, I am able to dedicate enough time to my children, to take them to school and to study.""
Torres said that the green light for wrestling to resume in late November was a blessing, as some spectators were able to return to the stands, even if the pandemic was far from over.
""It's very beautiful to have the public here, who have come out to have a look at fighting cholitas,"" she said.
""Before the pandemic, we were a part of the cultural heritage that wasn't recognized, tourists came from all over the world to see just us, the fighting cholita luchadores of wrestling.""

1318,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>",Analysis-Washington's Western Sahara pledge the ultimate prize for Morocco,"By Angus McDowall
TUNIS (Reuters) - Morocco's decision to normalise ties with Israel has handed Rabat its biggest step yet towards the prize it values most - global recognition of its claim to Western Sahara. 
Washington's support for Moroccan sovereignty over the desert territory represents the biggest policy concession the United States has made so far in its quest to win Arab recognition of Israel. 
For King Mohammed VI, that has trumped any fears of angering Moroccans who back Palestinian rights or harming his image as ""defender of the faithful"" among conservative Muslims by making peace with an Israeli state that has annexed East Jerusalem. 
In a news conference to announce the decision in a royal proclamation, Moroccan Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita warned that ""those who criticise this deal are against Morocco's sovereignty over Sahara"". 
How far that admonition was necessary is uncertain. 
""This news came as a shock to me and to the Moroccan people. We strongly reject it,"" said Khalid Soufiani, a pro-Palestinian activist.
However, while Islamist and pan-Arab parties have opposed normalising ties with Israel, others including Berber rights activists have supported it. 
""Restoring ties with Israel is good news that serves Morocco's supreme interests,"" said Munir Kejji, an activist for the Amazigh Berber people. 
The deal comes at a key moment in the long-frozen conflict in Western Sahara between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front independence movement, which erupted again last month after three decades of truce. 
The U.S. move seems unlikely to lead other Western states - or the United Nations - to abandon their own longstanding position calling for a referendum to resolve the dispute. The U.N. said its stance was unchanged. 
However, it adds momentum to a diplomatic campaign by Rabat that had already gathered steam this year and has so far led 17 African and Arab states to open consulates in Western Sahara. 
POLISARIO VOWS TO FIGHT ON
The Polisario, which pulled out of a 1991 ceasefire deal last month following a border incident involving its supporters and Moroccan troops, said its guerrilla struggle would continue.
Three decades on from that truce, Morocco's military has grown its strength and technological capabilities with U.S. help. It is currently negotiating the purchase of new drones with Washington. 
Though the Polisario has announced constant bombardment of Moroccan frontier defences deep in the desert since quitting the truce, neither side has reported any deaths from fighting.
Peace with Israel may be a smaller step for Morocco than for some other Arab states. 
Morocco is the ancestral home of nearly 1 million Israeli Jews and Bourita said 70,000 Israelis visited the kingdom last year alone. It opened a liaison office in Israel in 1994, but closed it in 2002 during the second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising.
Still, after rumours earlier this year that Morocco would agree a deal with Israel, Prime Minister Saad Dine El Otmani, head of the moderate Islamist PJD party, said Rabat rejected ""any normalisation of ties with the Zionist entity"".
King Mohammed sought to sweeten the pill by saying in his proclamation that he still backs a two state solution and regards Jerusalem as a sacred city for three religions. 

But in agreeing Thursday's deal, he is betting that nationalist fervour over Western Sahara carries more weight than popular support for the Palestinian cause.

In a disconnected ceremony at the end of a disconcerting year, Swedish television streamed the handovers from Stockholm City Hall on the day when a packed audience traditionally honours the prizewinners.
""This is, indeed, a different Nobel Prize ceremony,"" King Carl XVI Gustav, who usually hands out the awards, said in a message from the royal palace.
With the coronavirus pandemic raging, all this year's winners stayed at home, too.
Michael Houghton, joint winner of the Medicine prize along with Harvey Alter and Charles Rice for work on the Hepatitis C virus, was in his garden in California.
Houghton's attire - a comfy, zip-up sweater - was a far cry from the high fashion usually worn for the ceremony and glitzy banquet, attended by royalty and the cream of Swedish society.
Literature winner Louise Gluck received her prize in her garden in Boston, in a sheepskin coat. 
Some of the other winners wore suits, while physics laureate Reinhard Genzel came closet to donning the regulation white tie and tails by wearing a tuxedo.
Some wore masks, others not, to accept the medal and diploma that accompanies the 10 million Swedish crown ($1.18 million) awards, established in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel.

1320,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 02:33PM ET</span>","Lebanese judge charges PM, ex-ministers over Beirut port blast","By Ellen Francis and Tom Perry
BEIRUT (Reuters) - The judge investigating the Beirut port explosion has charged Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab and three former ministers with negligence over the blast that killed 200 people and devastated swathes of the capital.
Diab, whose cabinet resigned over the August blast after taking office in early 2020, said his conscience was clear and accused the judge of breaching the constitution.
Four months after one of the largest non-nuclear explosions on record, which injured thousands of people, victims are still awaiting the result of the investigation. Lebanese leaders had promised it would come within days.
The explosion added to the challenges facing Lebanon, where decades of waste and corruption have triggered the country's worst ever financial crisis. 
Lebanon's sectarian leaders are still haggling over who will be in the new cabinet.
Judge Fadi Sawan called Diab and former finance minister Ali Hassan Khalil in for questioning next week, along with former public works ministers Ghazi Zeaiter and Youssef Finianos, state news agency NNA said on Thursday. 
DIVIDED OPINION
Zeaiter, who said he would comment once he was officially informed, headed the public works ministry in 2014, soon after the Rhosus ship carrying tonnes of ammonium nitrate arrived at Beirut port.
The highly explosive chemicals were stored for years in poor conditions at the port, which lies in the heart of the capital.
There was no immediate comment from Finianos.
Khalil, a top aide to Lebanon's influential Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, said he had no role in the case as former head of the finance ministry, which oversees customs.
He said on Twitter that he was surprised by the judge's allegations which ""violated the constitution and the law"".
Families of some of the victims say Judge Sawan told them he had sent Berri a memo calling for immunity to be lifted from several former ministers and premiers, but the speaker had not accepted his proposal.
The judicial council that appointed Sawan said on Thursday he sent a letter last month telling parliament his investigation had revealed ""serious suspicions"" linked to some government officials. Parliament replied it found no such suspicions based on the information provided, the council said.
Sawan decided to interrogate a number of officials ""as defendants"", including ministers, and was doing his job to find the culprits, it said.
A parliamentary office statement in November said that when asked about the letter, parliament speaker Berri said: ""We have done what needs to be done and replied to him"".
The probe has sparked legal debate in Lebanon about whether ministers enjoy immunity in this case.
Thursday's move showed Sawan sided with those saying immunity does not apply, said Nizar Saghieh, head of The Legal Agenda, a research and advocacy organisation.
""This is a positive thing, meaning it has opened the door to bringing the ministers to account."" 
A senior judicial source said it was up to a special court, which includes seven lawmakers and eight judges, to indict the ministers rather than Sawan.
Several officials have been detained since the blast, including the port and customs chiefs, with dozens testifying as witnesses, including Diab.
But many Lebanese remain sceptical that senior politicians will be held to account, fearing the truth will never emerge from a system riven by corruption.
Security officials had warned Diab and President Michel Aoun the nitrate could destroy the capital if it exploded, according to documents seen by Reuters and senior security sources. 

Aoun has said he had no direct authority over the port.

BAKU/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday renewed a call for a change of leadership in Armenia, while offering the country the chance of joining a regional cooperation group alongside Azerbaijan.
Erdogan made the comments in Baku, where he reviewed a military parade marking Armenia's defeat by Azerbaijan in a war in the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Erdogan, who provided military and diplomatic backing to Azerbaijan during the fighting, offered indirect support for opponents of Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who is under pressure at home to resign over his handling of the conflict, which ended last month.
""We wish for the Armenian people to rid itself of the burden of leaders who console them with the lies of the past and trap them into poverty,"" said Erdogan. 
He had discussed with his Azeri counterpart forming the cooperation initiative alongside Russia, Iran and Georgia. Armenia could also participate and see its border with Turkey reopened if it took positive steps, Erdogan told a news conference.
Armenia and Turkey signed a landmark peace accord in 2009 to restore ties and open their shared border after a century of hostility stemming from the World War One mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman forces. The deal was never ratified and ties have remained tense.
The Karabakh fighting was brought to a halt after Russian peacekeeping troops deployed under a deal that locked in territorial gains by Azerbaijan, a close ally of Turkey.
Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is populated and, until recently, was fully controlled by ethnic Armenians after a bloody war in the 1990s which saw them seize other outlying regions belonging to Azerbaijan too. 
Erdogan, who reviewed the parade in Baku with Aliyev, said there was also now a need to hold ethnic Armenian forces accountable for what he said were their war crimes and destruction of villages, cities and mosques.
Armenian forces deny such accusations. They say Azeri forces and foreign mercenaries are the ones responsible for large-scale cultural destruction and atrocities. Baku denies that. 
At Thursday's parade, helicopters bearing the flags of Turkey and Azerbaijan flew over the nearby Caspian Sea, almost 3,000 Turkish troops marched across Baku's main square, and Azeri tanks and soldiers filed past the two men.

PARIS (Reuters) -France will not reopen museums, cinemas and theatres next week as planned because COVID-19 infection rates are not falling as fast as the government had hoped, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday. 
France's government had announced that a lockdown imposed at the end of October to get to grips with a second coronavirus wave would be partially lifted by Dec. 15, including the re-opening of cultural venues.
But that was contingent on the number of new cases of infection falling to around 5,000 a day. France is on target to miss that target.
""We are not yet at the end of this second wave, and we will not reach the objectives we had set for Dec. 15,"" Castex told a news conference.
""We cannot let down our guard. We have to stay focussed, and find our way through the next few weeks with lots of vigilance,"" he said.
Though transmission rates are several times lower than they were at the peak of the second wave, France is currently recording an average of 11,368 new cases each day, according to Reuters data.
Theatres, cinemas and museums are now scheduled to re-open at the beginning of January, Castex said. 
The decision drew angry reactions from the cultural world.
""We are tired of not being given more consideration. Once more culture is being left on the side of the road,"" Phillipe Lellouche, a French actor and director, told BFM TV
Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot did not even attend the news conference, he noted.
SAVING CHRISTMAS
France will stick to its previously announced plan to end a stay-at-home order on Dec. 15 and replace it with a nightly curfew, Castex said. 
But in a departure from the plan, the curfew will run from 8 p.m. each night - an hour earlier than planned - and will not be waived for New Year's Eve.
""The best way to welcome 2021 is to take care of each other,"" Health Minister Olivier Veran said.
The curfew will, though, be waived for Dec. 24, Christmas Eve, because ""Christmas has a special place in our lives and traditions,"" Castex said.

While the State Department has authorized the sale of the unmanned aerial vehicles, the sources said, it was not known if the U.S. officials have approved exporting the drones with weapons attached, two of the people said.
The deal must be approved by members of Congress, who may receive notification as soon as Friday, one of the people said. Congress could block a final agreement but that was not expected two of the people said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday let three American Muslim men sue several FBI agents who they accused of placing them on the government's ""no-fly list"" for refusing to become informants, rejecting a challenge to the lawsuit by President Donald Trump's administration.
In an 8-0 decision, the justices upheld a lower court ruling allowing the men, all U.S. citizens or permanent residents who were born abroad, to sue for money damages under a 1993 federal law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The men said they refused to spy on U.S. Muslim communities as allegedly requested by the FBI agents because doing so would have violated their religious beliefs.
The 1993 law was aimed at ensuring that the government had compelling reasons to substantially burden any person's exercise of religion. The case hinged on a part of the law that provided for ""appropriate relief against a government,"" without defining what type of relief may be appropriate. 
""The question here is whether 'appropriate relief' includes claims for money damages against government officials in their individual capacities. We hold that it does,"" wrote conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who authored the ruling. 
The case, which began in 2013, involves New York City residents Muhammad Tanvir and Jameel Algibhah and Connecticut resident Naveed Shinwari. They said they were put on the no-fly list despite no evidence showing they threatened airline or passenger safety. The men's separate encounters with the FBI spanned from 2007 to 2012.
Their inclusion on the no-fly list meant they could not visit family in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen, sometimes for years. They said the actions of the FBI agents harmed their reputations and cost them employment.
As the lawsuit progressed, the government told the men there was ""no reason"" why any of the three could not take flights, indicating that they did not remain on the no-fly list.
A trial judge had thrown out the claims, but the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 revived the case, ruling that the law allows individual federal officers to be sued for damages. 
In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department said that the 2nd Circuit ruling, if allowed to stand, would clear the way for a slew of lawsuits against countless federal employees that could deter them from performing their duties. These employees, it said, included national security officials, criminal investigators and correctional officers.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a Trump appointee who was not a member of the court when the case was argued in October, did not take part in the decision.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -The Netherlands on Thursday ordered the expulsion of two Russian diplomats accused of spying on the Dutch high-tech sector, the AIVD national intelligence agency said.
The latest diplomatic incident will likely raise tension between the two states, already at odds over the murder trial in the Netherlands of three Russians for the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 over eastern Ukraine in 2014.
The Dutch government would review legal options to fight espionage by foreign diplomats in the Netherlands, who currently enjoy immunity from prosecution.
One of the diplomats, working for the Russian foreign intelligence agency SVR, ""occupied himself with spying in the technology and science fields,"" the AIVD said in a statement.
""The Russian intelligence service developed contacts with people with access to sensitive information in the high-tech sector,"" it said, sometimes paying the sources for information.
""The interest of the Russian intelligence officer went towards getting more information about artificial intelligence, semiconductors and nanotechnology. Many of these technologies have both civilian and military applications.""
The Netherlands presented no evidence of unlawful acts by the Russian diplomats, Russia's embassy in The Hague said, according to the Interfax news agency.
Russia will give ""an adequate and timely"" response to the expulsion of the Russian diplomats, Leonid Slutsky, head of the lower house of the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee, was quoted as saying by Interfax.
In April 2018, the Netherlands disrupted an attempt by Russian intelligence agents to hack the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague.
Four Russians who were caught with spying equipment at a hotel located next to the OPCW headquarters, were expelled.
The second spying incident in as many years has prompted the Dutch government to review ways to make foreign spying punishable, the AIVD said.

The proposed resolution was introduced on Wednesday by Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat, and Senator Jim Risch, a Republican.
It was the first such call by U.S. lawmakers since war between Ethiopian federal forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) broke out on Nov. 4.
The conflict is thought to have killed thousands and displaced more than 950,000 people, according to United Nations estimates, about 50,000 of them into Sudan.
Concern has mounted over reports of civilians targeted by both sides. That poses a policy dilemma for the United States, which considers Ethiopia an important ally in a volatile region, especially against al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militants al Shabaab in neighbouring Somalia.
The government has said it will investigate any reports of atrocities or mass killings, but will only allow independent investigations if it is unable to do them itself. 
The Ethiopian army has captured Tigray's regional capital Mekelle and declared victory but TPLF leaders say they are fighting back on various fronts around the highland city.
The Senate resolution introduced by Cardin and Risch also called on Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and the TPLF to cease hostilities and pursue a peaceful resolution to the war.
""The ongoing fighting in Tigray has already cost thousands of lives and created a humanitarian crisis of disastrous proportions, threatening the long-term stability not only of Ethiopia, but the entire region,"" Cardin said in a statement after the resolution was introduced.
Civilians fleeing fighting in Tigray last month told Reuters that they witnessed bombing by government warplanes, shooting on the streets, and people being hacked to death with machetes.
Rights group Amnesty International said scores and probably hundreds of people were stabbed or hacked to death in the town of Mai Kadra in Tigray less than a week after the war began.
Ethiopia's state-appointed human rights commission's initial report found that an estimated 600 civilians were killed in that attack.
TELECOMS CLAIM
Accounts from all sides are difficult to verify because most phone lines and internet connections to the region have been down throughout the conflict. Foreign journalists cannot leave the capital, Addis Ababa, without permits. 
On Thursday, state monopoly Ethio-Telecom blamed Tigray's communications outages on sabotage from outside.
""We have substantial evidence that external entities, other than Ethio-Telecoms security staff, accessed our premises and caused service outage in the North Region,"" it said, without naming them or providing evidence.
The CEO and another official at Ethio-Telecom did not respond to requests for comment, but state-run Ethiopia News Agency reported that the assailants wore Tigrayan uniforms.
Aid agencies meanwhile complained of bureaucratic delays to food and other aid deliveries to Tigray, home to more than 5 million people of whom 600,000 relied on food handouts even before the conflict. 
The government says it is delivering aid to areas it controls. On Thursday the Ministry of Peace announced that 1.2 million tonnes of food aid, including wheat, had arrived in Mekelle.
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet on Wednesday called events in Tigray ""worrying and volatile"" and and called for independent monitoring of the human rights situation. [nL8N2IP2IS]
Abiy's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum responded on Thursday that there was ""nothing volatile about Tigray or Ethiopia"".
""The federal government is well equipped and able to restore order and is undertaking such activities as cities and towns slowly return to regular activities,"" she said. 
A U.N. team visiting refugees in Tigray was shot at over the weekend. The government said it had failed to stop at two checkpoints. 
In response to that, another U.S. Senator, Bob Menendez said in a tweet: ""Attacks on humanitarians must STOP. Refugees & all civilians must be PROTECTED.""
On Wednesday U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Ethiopia and the United Nations had now agreed on joint missions to assess humanitarian needs.

AL KHAZER, Iraq (Reuters) - Excluded, vilified and sometimes simply abandoned: such is the price paid by thousands of children in Iraq born to suspected Islamic State militants. 
At the Hassan Sham camp for displaced people in northern Iraq, five-year-old Aisha, whose father disappeared after joining Islamic State, is pestering her mother because she wants to go to school. 
""She's always crying, saying she wants to go to school. But I tell her she can't: she doesn't have the nationality,"" says her mother, declining to give her name.
Like thousands of other children born to parents who lived in areas governed by Islamic State between 2014 and 2017, Aisha has no official birth certificate, and no easy way to obtain one.
Without papers, basic services including education and health care are difficult to access. In 2018, the Ministry of Education issued a directive allowing undocumented children to register in schools, but humanitarian NGOs say this is not consistently applied on the ground. 
""There are a lot of complexities about registering children born during the years ISIS ruled. Many have not been registered yet,"" Karl Shembri, the regional media advisor of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), told Reuters.
""They don't have civil documents, which excludes them from their basic rights as Iraqi citizens,"" he said.
In 2019, the NRC estimated that around 45,000 undocumented children were living in Iraqi camps. 
To register Aisha with the authorities, her mother said she must first be given security clearance to rule out any ties with Islamic State.
A maze of bureaucracy awaits her, involving local authorities, courts and security agencies, as well as administration fees she says she cannot afford.
In another tent, a mother of eight says she worries most about her grandchild, Dima, who was born at the camp but whose parents were married by Islamic State mullahs in their community in Salahuddin province.
Not only is Dima without an official birth certificate, but her parents did not get a valid marriage licence - required by Iraqi law for the registration of every child.
""There were no certificates issues by the courts, by the government. And the ISIS certificates don't work for the government. We tore it into pieces and threw it away,"" the grandmother said.
SOCIAL STIGMA
The Iraqi authorities are aware of the children's plight. The Ministry of Interior told Reuters that the government has established an inter-ministerial committee tasked with addressing the issue.
Spokesman for the Ministry of Migration Ali Abbas said they counted around 400 families in camps in northern Iraq with children lacking civil documents.
""Children born under ISIS have a problem,"" Abbas said. ""When there is no marriage certificate, how do we know that a woman is truly the mother of the child?""
Faced with this legal impasse, some mothers are forced into difficult, sometimes unbearable, choices. 
""A common practice to resolve that is for the woman to marry someone else as an adoptee, or marry someone in the family, like the husband’s brother,"" said senior Iraq analyst at Crisis Group, Lahib Higel.
But fear and hatred of Islamic State persists and children whose fathers had links to the groups are treated as outcasts, preventing their reintegration.
In a tent nearby, the 24 year-old mother of two undocumented children is packing up. She received a marriage proposal, an unexpected opportunity for her to leave the camp and start a new life as the second wife of a man back in her hometown in Salahuddin province.
However, her husband-to-be asked her to come without her children, three and five, and she agreed to leave them behind with their grandmother at the camp. 
""She left the children and went to remarry. Her new husband doesn't want them, he says they are ISIS children,"" the grandmother said.
This is not an isolated case, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, Belkis Wille, told Reuters.
""Many times women will say that their new husband will refuse to take in the new children because they are perceived as 'contaminated with ISIS blood', so these children get left behind with dwindling services, no education and away from their mothers,"" Wille said. 
Holding back the tears as she hugged her children goodbye, the young mother climbed into the taxi that would take her to her new husband. Neighbours soon gathered, promising to help out. The crying children calmed down when they were given sweets, unaware that their mother would not be back.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 10:31AM ET</span>","Spanish state takes over Franco's palace, evicts heirs","MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish state on Thursday took over former dictator General Francisco Franco's summer palace, complete with its vast art trove, and evicted his heirs as part of the leftist government's efforts to erase the legacy of his rule.
As state attorney general Consuelo Castro arrived at the palace in the northwestern region of Galicia to conduct a final inspection and formally take possession, she was greeted by a small group of protesters flanked by a banner that read: ""Make them give back what was stolen: Francoism never again.""
The move followed the removal of Franco's remains from a mausoleum near Madrid last year and other initiatives to remove dictatorship-era symbols approved by various leftist governments since Franco's death in 1975.
Built between 1893 and 1907 by the writer Emilia Pardo-Bazan, the Pazo de Meiras palace was valued at more than 5 million euros ($5.93 million) by the family last year. 
Franco took full possession of the palace, bought with public donations in 1938 during the civil war, in his name in 1941, and used it as the official summer residence.
More than half a million people died during the 1936-39 civil war and an estimated 150,000 were killed later by Franco's government, historians estimate. Public opinion is still divided over the legacy of the dictatorship that ended with Franco's death in 1975.
In September, a court ruled the transfer of ownership to Franco was illegal as the donations had not been destined for the general himself but to the head of state, and ordered the heirs to vacate the premises. Their susequent appeal was rejected.
A court-ordered inventory of the property, published on Tuesday, lists almost 700 objects of significant historic and artistic value, including two statues from the Santiago de Compostela cathedral, and some 13,000 books.
""This handover needs to be the start of an investigation into the possessions of Franco's family,"" said Emilio Silva, head of the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory.
Benito Portela, mayor of Sada, where the Pazo is located, said he wanted the palace to be converted into a musuem dedicated to Emilia Pardo-Bazan. 

""It should be a space for the recovery of the memory of a writer, a pioneer in various fields who was misunderstood in her own time,"" he told RNE radio.

LES DIABLERETS, Switzerland (Reuters) - An ice cave which forms naturally on a high-altitude glacier in the Swiss Alps became accessible on Thursday, to the delight of visitors who came to marvel at the huge blue vault of the ""ice cathedral"".
Varying in size and shape from year to year, the cave has a rounded ceiling made of thick ice about 5 metres (yards) high, and is about 20 metres long. 
The site can be reached on foot in 15 minutes from the chairlift at Glacier 3000 above the resort of Les Diablerets, but at your own risk, organisers said. 
""It's the first time we indicate it and open it officially.
The last years ... we had kind of an ice cave but it was different, it was more steep. And this year it looks like an ice cathedral, so it's really beautiful,"" Bernhard Tschannen, CEO of Glacier 3000, told Reuters inside the cave.
This year the cave's interior is quite flat, making access easier, he said.
The natural cave, also known as ""the Mill"", forms through a siphon effect. Each spring and summer, the cavity fills with water from the snow melt, forming a lake. In autumn, the plug disappears and the water drains, leaving the cave.
""It's magnificent, but even that isn't the right word. I've never seen anything like it. Almost as it's not of this world in fact. It's magnificent, I can only recommend it if you have the chance to go,"" Helen Tromp, a Dutch woman living nearby said after visiting. Brice Rozes, touring the site on his day off, said: ""It's very impressive. The vault is incredible. Standing beneath it, you can just imagine the weight above. It's beautiful.""

Section 112 of the Thai criminal code sets jail terms of three to 15 years for anyone convicted of defaming, insulting or threatening King Maha Vajiralongkorn and his closest family. 
""If our country were truly democratic, we would be able to talk about monarchy reforms or criticise the institution,"" Panusaya ""Rung"" Sithijirawattanakul, one of the protest leaders, said at a public event focused on the lese majeste law.
""Many wouldn't have to seek asylum, be jailed, flee for their lives, or die just because they talked about the monarchy...No one should have to face this just by talking about other human beings who fancy themselves as gods.""
The Palace did not comment and has not done so since the start of the protests. The government did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Panusaya said she and 24 others had now been summoned to acknowledge lese majeste charges over comments made at protests since July. 
Over 1,000 protesters against the lese majeste law gathered on Thursday at a venue commemorating a Thai student-led uprising in 1973 that helped end a military government at the time. 
Before the recent charges, the law had not been used since 2018. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had said this was at the request of the king. Protesters also seek the removal of Prayuth, a former junta leader.
A hashtag that translates as #Abolish112 was trending on Thai-langauge Twitter on Thursday.
The protests have become the biggest challenge to the monarchy in decades, breaking taboos with open criticiscm of an institution that the constitution says must be revered.

Protesters want the king to be made clearly accountable under the constitution. They also seek to reverse changes that gave him control of the royal fortune and some army units.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 08:52AM ET</span>","Financier Joseph Safra, Brazil's richest man, dies at 82","SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Joseph Safra, the Lebanese-Brazilian financier who has died aged 82, was Brazil's richest man and for many years the world's wealthiest banker. 
Safra helped run and expand his family's private-banking and wealth management empire, catering to an affluent clientele from São Paulo to New York and Monte Carlo. He died of natural causes, according to a statement issued by Banco Safra. 
As a member of Brazil's most prominent Jewish business clan, Safra was credited with making Banco Safra one of Brazil's soundest banks. He was deeply involved in Jewish community affairs in Brazil, spending a great deal of his time and fortune funding health, education and charity projects and paying for the construction of synagogues and community centers.
The Safras stood out among a number of Brazilian families whose businesses grew transnational, yet remained loyal to their ethnic roots. While banking was the axis of his activities, Safra also sought to diversify his wealth by investing in paper and pulp, global real estate, telecoms and cattle ranching.
Safra, who arrived in Brazil as a teenager more than five decades ago, ranks as the world's wealthiest banker, with an estimated fortune of $19.9 billion, according to Forbes Magazine. 
His family's roots in banking dated back five generations. Joseph Safra's predecessors banked the Ottoman Empire's caravan trade between the Syrian city of Aleppo, Alexandria in Egypt and Constantinople in Turkey. 
PRIVACY
He seldom granted interviews, saying he avoided speaking Portuguese in public for fear of ""being misunderstood."" However, his efforts to keep a low profile were punctuated by ruthless boardroom battles, even with members of his own family.
A fluent speaker of Arabic, English and four other languages, he migrated to Brazil from Beirut with his father Jacob and brothers Edmond and Moise to set up a trade financing shop. He reportedly paid $2.5 billion for Moise's 50 percent stake in Banco Safra in 2006, putting an end to years of disputes over the direction of the bank.
The Safras were also known in Brazil for their obsession with personal security. Edmond, Joseph's older brother and one of the most prominent private bankers of the past century, died in 1999 in an arson attack on his Monte Carlo penthouse that shocked the banking world.
Joseph Safra will be remembered for his active philanthropy, Shliach Rabbi Yossi Schildkraut said in an interview. 
Both Joseph and Moise funded the construction of the largest synagogue in Brazil, an ornate structure serving Sao Paulo's Sephardic Jews, and the restoration of the country's first synagogue, in the northeastern city of Recife.
""He was always ready to help, even if that didn't mean being around to discuss the day-to-day events,"" Schildkraut said in an interview years ago. ""His devotion to the preservation of the Jewish traditions in Brazil is priceless.""

Joseph Safra is survived by his wife Vicky and his four children.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>",Special Report-China launches 'gray-zone' warfare to subdue Taiwan,"By Yimou Lee, David Lague and Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Months after eliminating a popular challenge to its rule in Hong Kong, China is turning to an even higher-stakes target: self-governing Taiwan. The island has been bracing for conflict with China for decades, and in some respects, that battle has now begun.
It's not the final, titanic clash that Taiwan has long feared, with Chinese troops storming the beaches. Instead, the People's Liberation Army, China's two-million-strong military, has launched a form of ""gray zone"" warfare. In this irregular type of conflict, which stops short of an actual shooting war, the aim is to subdue the foe through exhaustion.
Beijing is conducting waves of threatening forays from the air while ratcheting up existing pressure tactics to erode Taiwan's will to resist, say current and former senior Taiwanese and U.S. military officers. The flights, they say, complement amphibious landing exercises, naval patrols, cyber attacks and diplomatic isolation.
The risk of conflict is now at its highest level in decades. PLA aircraft are flying menacingly towards airspace around Taiwan almost daily, sometimes launching multiple sorties on the same day. Since mid-September, Chinese warplanes have flown more than 100 of these missions, according to a Reuters compilation of flight data drawn from official statements by Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense. The data shows that in periods when political tension across the Taiwan Strait peaks, China sends more aircraft, including some of its most potent fighters and bombers.
These encroachment tactics are ""super effective,"" Admiral Lee Hsi-ming, who until last year was the commander of the Taiwanese military, told Reuters in an interview. ""You say it's your garden, but it turns out that it is your neighbor who's hanging out in the garden all the time. With that action, they are making a statement that it's their garden - and that garden is one step away from your house.""
Under President Xi Jinping, China has accelerated the development of forces the PLA would need one day to conquer the island of 23 million - a mission that is the country's top military priority, according to Chinese and Western analysts. With Hong Kong and the restive regions of Tibet and Xinjiang under ever-tighter control, Taiwan is the last remaining obstacle to the Communist Party's monopoly on power. In a major speech early last year, Xi said that Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a Chinese province, ""must be, will be"" unified with China. He set no deadline but would not rule out the use of force.
There has been a ""clear shift"" this year in Beijing's posture, a senior Taiwanese security official responsible for intelligence on China told Reuters. Chinese military and government agencies have switched from decades of ""theoretical talk"" about taking Taiwan by force to debating and working on plans for possible military action, the official said.
In a speech Tuesday, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen alluded to the shift. The island democracy is under unrelenting pressure from ""authoritarian forces,"" she warned, without going into detail. ""Taiwan has been at the receiving end of such military threats on a daily basis.""
Admiral Lee, the retired Taiwanese military chief, believes the only thing holding back the PLA from a full assault is that it hasn't yet achieved the overwhelming firepower needed to overrun the island. Even so, China's military build-up over the past 20 years means it is now ""far ahead"" of Taiwan, he said. ""Time is definitely not on Taiwan's side,"" he said. ""It's only a matter of time for them to gather enough strength.""
The Chinese government was asked detailed questions for this article, including queries about the gray-zone tactics and its overarching strategy on Taiwan. In a written statement, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said Beijing is committed to ""peaceful reunification"" with Taiwan, a formulation it has used for decades. It added that ""so-called experts' remarks quoted in the story by Reuters are groundless, purely hearsay, and full of prejudice and show a Cold War mentality."" It continued: ""They even include absurd remarks about the country's central leadership. We are strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to such reports.""
Taiwan's defense ministry said in a statement it is stepping up naval and air patrols and improving combat readiness to counter China's gray-zone tactics. The military ""sticks to the firm stance of 'not provoking and not being afraid of the enemy,' and the principle of 'the closer they get to the main island, the more active is our response.'""
DIRE WEAKNESSES
As the threat mounts, the Taiwanese military is in poor shape to meet it.
Interviews with current and former Taiwan government officials, serving and former military officers, conscripts, reservists and U.S. and other foreign military experts point to dire weaknesses. With the exception of some elements of Taiwan’s military, including the air force, special forces and parts of the navy, decades of isolation and underfunding by successive governments have left the military hollowed out. In any Chinese invasion, much of the island's expensive hardware would be unlikely to survive a barrage of PLA precision missiles and air strikes, current and retired Taiwanese officers say. Crack, resilient ground forces would be crucial to repel beach landings by Chinese troops and counter airborne assaults, they say.
In addition, Taiwanese service members and Western observers say, Taiwan is suffering a serious and worsening decay in the readiness and training of its troops, particularly its army units.
One army conscript told Reuters he had only fired between 30 and 40 rounds with his rifle during training and was never taught how to clear a jammed firearm. ""I don't think I'm capable of fighting in a war,"" said Chen, the soldier, speaking on condition his full name not be disclosed. ""I don't think I'm a qualified soldier.""
President Tsai is coming under pressure at home and in Washington to shore up the island's defenses. Her government is planning to increase defense outlays by more than 10% next year to T$453.4 billion ($16 billion), according to a Reuters calculation based on government figures.
""The military has been whittled down,"" said Grant Newsham, a retired U.S. Marine Corps colonel who spent most of last year on the island evaluating its defense capability in a Taiwan government-funded research project. ""It is almost as if fighting to defend the country is somebody else's responsibility,"" said Newsham, now a researcher at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies.
Taiwan's defense ministry rejected the idea that it couldn't defend itself or that its expensive hardware wouldn't withstand a Chinese attack. The island's air defenses have been bolstered and its ""asymmetrical and mobile combat capacity"" has been reinforced, the ministry said in a written response to questions.
Taking Taiwan would be an even greater feat for Xi than putting down the democracy movement in Hong Kong, but also a far greater challenge.
PLA troops have been garrisoned in Hong Kong since the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Yet the city's protest movement was quashed this spring not by military force, but by a combination of aggressive policing, the imposition of a draconian national security law and the eruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, which enabled the government to ban all mass gatherings.
For Xi, democratic Taiwan is now the last outpost of resistance to his dream of a unified and rejuvenated China that can displace the United States as the major power in the Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan has remained effectively independent since 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's defeated Republic of China government retreated to the island after the Chinese Civil War.
Bringing Taiwan under Beijing's wing would give the PLA a commanding position in Asia. It would entrench the Chinese military in the middle of the so-called first island chain - the string of islands from the Japanese archipelago in the north, down to the Philippines and on to Borneo, which enclose China's coastal seas. The PLA Navy could dominate the shipping lanes to North Asia, giving Beijing a powerful lever over Japan and South Korea. And the PLA Navy would have free access to the Western Pacific.
AMERICA'S DOMINANCE
Standing in the way of that dream is the United States. It would be catastrophic to America's dominance in the region if Chinese forces took control of Taiwan, most military analysts believe, whether by gray-zone tactics or full-scale invasion. America's global prestige and role as security guarantor in Asia would be shattered, they say.
Already, Beijing's recent assertiveness, including its fortification of contested islets in the South China Sea, has galvanized an American-led response. The administration of President Donald Trump has been rushing new weapons into service and realigning U.S. forces in Asia to counter China. Regional powers Japan, India and Australia are tightening cooperation with the Americans.
It isn't clear how President-elect Joe Biden will respond to Xi's stepped-up pressure on Taiwan. A spokesman for Biden's transition team declined to comment.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said China has ""engaged in an increasingly menacing campaign to intimidate Taiwan."" America's defense backing for Taipei, the spokesperson said, goes beyond arms sales. ""We support Taiwan with training and encourage asymmetric approaches to warfare.""
Since the United States switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, U.S. administrations have been required by law to supply Taiwan with the means to defend itself. But Washington has also maintained a policy of ""strategic ambiguity,"" declining to give explicit security guarantees to the island.
In the past three decades, the PLA has assembled a massive array of missiles and a huge navy designed to keep U.S. forces at bay. There is danger for Taipei in neglecting its own defenses, five former senior American commanders told Reuters: Taiwan is putting its fate in the hands of Washington, but there's a chance the United States and its allies might be defeated by China in a war over the island or delayed from reaching it in time to save the day.
Taiwan's defense ministry told Reuters it is increasing the island's self-reliance by developing its domestic defense industry and is making progress in the production of home-made weapons, including training jets and submarines.
Communist Party leaders have always insisted Beijing would prefer to take Taiwan without war. Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office blamed the current tension on Taipei. Tsai's ruling party and supporters of separatism, the office said, ""have colluded with external forces and continuously engaged in Taiwan independence.""
But there is no sign the Taiwanese are willing to embrace unification. The widening crackdown in Hong Kong on pro-democracy forces has offered them a glimpse of what life might be like under Communist Party rule.
Any hot military campaign would be a grave risk for Xi and the Communist Party, to be sure. Beijing could expect to become an international pariah. And, despite Taiwan's weaknesses, an amphibious landing across the Taiwan Strait, 130 kilometers (80 miles) wide at its narrowest point, could be extremely difficult and bloody. The Taiwanese military has had 70 years to fortify the few landing sites suitable for beach assaults and could hammer an exposed invasion force.
For these reasons, some believe all-out war remains highly unlikely. Two Taipei-based diplomatic sources, citing briefings from Western security officials, said they haven't changed their assessment of the probability of conventional conflict. ""There are no signs of war preparations in China,"" said one of the sources.
The risks for China may explain in part why Xi, for now, has opted for gray-zone warfare. Without firing a shot, China's military is sorely taxing Taiwan's air force.
The theater of action is Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). An ADIZ is an area that stretches beyond a territory's air space where air traffic controllers request incoming flights to identify themselves. When PLA aircraft enter Taiwan's ADIZ, fighters scramble in response. On occasion, air-defense missile units are put on alert. So far, most of the Chinese aircraft being intercepted and shadowed are entering the south-west corner of Taiwan's zone.
The pace is unrelenting. Taiwan Defense Minister Yen De-fa said in October that the air force had scrambled 2,972 times against Chinese aircraft this year at a cost of T$25.5 billion ($903 million). The defense ministry said that for the year to early October, its aircraft had flown 4,132 missions, including the scrambles to intercept PLA aircraft and training flights. That's an increase of 129% on the whole of last year, according to Reuters calculations.
There is pressure at sea, too. Last month, the ministry told parliament that for the year to early November, Taiwanese ships had conducted 1,223 missions to intercept PLA vessels, an increase of about 400 such missions from the previous year.
'COLLISION AND COLLAPSE'
By increasing the tempo of these operations, the PLA can inflict disproportionate stress on Taiwan's much smaller force. The Chinese military has more than 2,000 fighters, bombers and other warplanes, compared with Taiwan's 400 fighters, according to the Pentagon's annual report on Chinese military power, published in September. Over time, fuel costs, pilot fatigue and wear and tear on Taiwanese aircraft will threaten the readiness of the island's air force if this pressure continues, according to Taiwanese and U.S. military analysts. The constant threat is also designed to exact a psychological toll on the defenders, they say.
A senior Trump administration official said the United States has advised the Taiwanese they don't need to scramble fighters every time Chinese sea patrol planes enter the southwest corner of Taiwan's ADIZ. Most of the interlopers remain over 100 miles away from the island – close, but not close enough to be a threat. ""It's unnecessarily taxing,"" the official said.
That's not the view in Taipei, where the PLA missions reached a climax on Sept. 18 and 19. That is when U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Keith Krach was visiting Taiwan to attend a memorial service for former President Lee Teng-hui, revered by many as the father of the island's democracy. Krach was the most senior State Department official to visit the island in four decades. Beijing made its displeasure clear. Almost 40 PLA aircraft, mostly fighters and bombers, flew missions toward the island on those two days, according to a tally from Taiwan defense ministry flight-tracking data. On multiple occasions, Chinese fighters crossed the sensitive median line in the Taiwan Strait, which serves as an unofficial buffer.
Beijing is making this flashpoint ""ever more unstable and ready for collision and collapse,"" said Ian Easton, a senior director of the Project 2049 Institute, an Arlington, Virginia-based security research group that studies the PLA. ""One could call this new gray-zone conflict a war of nerves.""
The PLA mostly relies on three kinds of aircraft - anti-submarine, electronic-warfare and airborne early-warning-and-control - to conduct its regular missions into Taiwan's ADIZ, the flight-tracking data show. The use of these aircraft allows the PLA to gather intelligence on the island's defenses, as well as Taiwanese and allied submarine activity in the area, Taiwanese, U.S. and other Western military intelligence officers say.
The PLA conducts drills in the Taiwan Strait ""to safeguard national sovereignty"" and in response ""to the interference of external forces and the provocations by the 'Taiwan independence' forces,"" Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office said. ""We will never allow anyone… to separate any part of Chinese territory from China.""
One of Taiwan's biggest challenges is basic: putting boots on the ground.
Taiwan has been gradually shifting from a conscript military to a volunteer-dominated professional force. By all accounts, the volunteers are well trained. That's not the case for recent conscripts.
Evidence from internal government reports seen by Reuters and accounts of serving personnel, conscripts and reservists show that this shift has been poorly managed. Taiwan has struggled in recent years to obtain sufficient recruits to field the 188,000-strong professional force the top brass calculate is needed to fight off a Chinese attack. Defense Minister Yen told parliament on Oct. 22 that the military would meet its target to enlist 90% of this force by the end of the year.
Taiwan still has a draft, but the service period for conscripts was slashed in 2013 from one year to four months. This is too short for useful training, and the instruction is often inadequate, six recent conscripts and former officers told Reuters.
In his four months of training last year, a 24-year-old navy conscript surnamed Lin spent a total of 40 minutes on two warships docked at the southern port of Kaohsiung. In an interview, he said he fired about 16 rounds from a rifle on one occasion, after the magazine was loaded for him. Only half of his intake cohort of 400 conscripts could swim a required 50 meters.
""The four month training was just a waste of time,"" said Lin, who spoke on condition his full name not be used. In Taiwan, military members who disclose operational details could be deemed to have violated the law. ""I would much prefer to go to work. If they want to train us, they need to do it properly.""
Another 24-year old, the army conscript surnamed Chen, described his firearms training to Reuters. In modern armies, trainees might typically fire hundreds of rounds. Not Chen: In four months, he said he twice fired between six and 10 rounds from a rifle, at a distance of 25 meters from the target. And he twice fired about the same number of rounds from 175 meters. He said he was taught how to reload a magazine, but not how to clear the rifle if it jammed. Chen said he also was trained on an anti-tank missile and a grenade launcher - but only about 10% of his intake of 150 conscripts were selected to fire each weapon.
""They only taught me how to fire a rifle,"" Chen said, ""and the rest of the training was irrelevant to real fighting.""
The defense ministry said it has increased the frequency and intensity of training. Conscripts are being trained as part of the reserve force with an emphasis on urban warfare and physical fitness. In refresher training, they will assemble in the same unit and focus on beach defense, urban combat and defending key facilities. And conscripts will fire three times as many rounds from their rifles.
'A MESS'
The troubled switch to a full-time force has contributed to a gutting of the reserves, a crucial component of the island's ability to reinforce full-time units and repulse invading troops. The 2.31 million-strong reserve force only exists on paper, according to Taiwanese and foreign military experts.
""The reserves really are a mess,"" said Newsham. ""Pretty close to useless.""
In interviews, reservists called up for refresher training of between one and seven days complained of wasting time on pointless drills, lectures and films. There were no realistic exercises or clear explanations of what action would be required in a crisis, they said.
A reservist surnamed Lee said he was called up for five days of training last year, the second time since he finished his conscription service in 2015. He described the experience as ""an opportunity to make friends."" On occasion, instructors knew the students were bored, abandoned their lectures and opened the floor to trainees to introduce themselves. One of Lee's fellow reservists, a car dealer, took the opportunity to make a sales pitch.
""I'm certainly not trained properly to fight in a war,"" Lee said. ""The retraining only lasted five days, in which we only fired rifles once.""
There are signs that the Tsai administration is working to boost readiness and firepower and to reform the reserves. In October, Yen revealed a proposal to build a better trained force within the reserves, made up of 268,000 troops, who could be ""immediately"" mobilized to join the standing military in an emergency. In the annual Han Kuang Exercise held in July in central Taiwan, two battalions of reservists were called up to take part in a live-fire artillery drill with regular units. A senior Taiwan official familiar with the island's security planning told Reuters the United States had been urging the military to include the reservists in the drill.
Prominent military thinkers on the island are calling for a more radical shake-up. Foremost is Admiral Lee, the former head of the military, who has set out his ideas in a number of articles.
Before his retirement last year, Lee proposed that the island avoid a war of attrition with a massively powerful China. Instead, Lee suggests Taiwan prepare to absorb PLA missile and air strikes. The key, he argues, is to preserve the ability to strike back at an invading force despite the likely loss of major conventional hardware, including big warships and jet fighters.
At the heart of Lee's proposal are several changes. One, Taiwan should maintain a small number of large, expensive weapons to preserve public morale and counter Beijing's gray-zone operations. At the same time, though, the island should bristle with big numbers of smaller, cheaper but lethal weapons, including mobile anti-ship missiles, portable anti-aircraft missiles, advanced sea mines and fast missile boats. Camouflaged and dispersed in urban, coastal, jungle and mountain areas, these weapons would be harder for PLA forces to find and destroy and could pummel an invasion force well before it reached land.
Another crucial element is dramatic reform of the reserves and civil defense units, creating urban and guerrilla warfare units. These would engage in protracted warfare with Chinese troops that do manage to land.
For now, it's unclear whether Tsai's administration will adopt Lee's proposals. But Lee's thinking has strong backing in Washington. The outgoing U.S. national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, said in October that the Taiwanese should ""turn themselves into a porcupine"" militarily, adding: ""Lions generally don't like to eat porcupines.""
Lee, however, says Taiwan shouldn't rely on America's help.
""How do you defend Taiwan? All I can hear is that the United States will intervene,"" he said. ""What reason is there to believe that the United States will sacrifice the lives of its own children to defend Taiwan?"" He added: ""My best bet is my own strength, to stop people from bullying me.""

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>",Japan plans vaccine freezer buying binge as Tokyo reports record cases,"By Kiyoshi Takenaka and Ju-min Park
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Thursday it will buy 10,500 deep freezers to store novel coronavirus vaccines as it prepares for the ""extraordinary task"" of protecting its people, while the capital, Tokyo, reported a record number of new infections.
Japan, with a population of 126 million, has agreements to buy a total of 290 million doses of vaccines from  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc, or enough for 145 million people. 
Pfizer's vaccines need to be kept at around minus 75 Celsius (minus 103 Fahrenheit), and Moderna's at about minus 20C, posing complex logistics challenges in rolling them out.
""An extraordinary task awaits us,"" Tokuaki Shobayashi, director general of the health service bureau at the ministry of health, told a media briefing on preparations.
A 90-year-old grandmother in Britain became the world's first person to receive a fully tested COVID-19 shot on Tuesday.
Though Japan has seen far fewer coronavirus cases than many Western countries, new infections are on the rise as colder weather keeps people indoors. 
In all, it has recorded more than 165,000 infections and about 2,500 fatalities as of Wednesday, with Tokyo particularly hard hit.
The capital reported a record 602 new cases on Thursday, with nationwide daily infections at 2,078, according to public broadcaster NHK. 
Top officials said the situation called for ""maximum caution"" as the spread showed little sign of easing.
BETTER LATE?
Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi this week ordered the military, known as the Self Defence Forces (SDF), to send nurses to a hard-hit city in Hokkaido prefecture in the north.
The government will also send nurses from the SDF to Osaka, in western Japan, where the number of coronavirus cases is rising, Kyodo news agency reported on Thursday.
The health ministry said it is too early to say when Japan would get the vaccines, but AstraZeneca has announced that, of the 120 million doses to be allocated to Japan, 30 million would likely be supplied in the first quarter of 2021.
The government will oversee the vaccination operation and shoulder the costs. Front-line medical workers, the elderly and people with underlying health conditions will be given priority to get vaccinated.
Doctors and nurses will give the vaccines at clinics and hospitals, while facilities with parking lots such as gyms, shopping malls and community centres were being considered as vaccination venues, the ministry said.
Major Japanese manufactures of freezers include PHC, Nihon Freezer and Ebac. The government also plans to buy dry ice in bulk to maintain cold supply chains.
Infectious disease specialist Norio Sugaya said coming late to vaccination had its upsides.
""Truth be told, it would have been good if we had been able to have this started by the end of the year,"" Sugaya said.
""But we will be able to learn more about potential side effects and about how to build up the whole vaccination system that can maintain minus 70 Celsius.""

Britain's medicines regulator has advised people with a history of significant allergies not to get the Pfizer vaccine after two people reported adverse reactions on the first day of its rollout there.

U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, due to take office on Jan. 20, has spoken of the need to revitalise alliances with like-minded democracies as a core source of strength in dealing with China.
EU Ambassador Nicolas Chapuis, speaking at an energy forum in the Chinese capital, said the EU hoped to reach agreement with the new U.S. administration on policy towards China.
""Let's cooperate with China as much as we can, when we can, when China is ready to cooperate. And let's disagree when we must,"" Chapuis said.
""We need to have a common understanding to say 'no' to bullying and intimidation, coercive diplomacy, 'wolf-warrior' diplomacy,"" he said, referring to China's increasingly assertive foreign policy.
Chapuis also called for European countries to work with Australia, New Zealand and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to ""find common ground"" about the disputed South China Sea.
China claims almost the entire South China Sea and warns other countries not to interfere in its dealings with Southeast Asian countries that also claim parts of the waterway and worry about China's increasingly militarised presence there.

""Freedom of navigation is essential. The South China Sea is not only a China issue, it is an international issue,"" Chapuis said.

1348,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Italian prosecutors seek answers from four Egyptian suspects over Regeni murder,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors said on Thursday they had wrapped up their investigation into the disappearance and murder of student Giulio Regeni in Cairo in 2016, and named four senior members of Egypt's security forces as possible suspects.
In a statement, the prosecutors said all four were suspected of having a role in the ""aggravated kidnapping"" of Regeni, while one of them, a major in Egypt's general intelligence, might also face charges of ""conspiracy to commit aggravated murder"".
The prosecutors gave the four men 20 days to submit statements or ask to be heard in the case. After that time, the investigators will decide whether or not to seek their trial.
There was no immediate comment from Egyptian authorities.Egyptian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in his killing.
Regeni, a 28-year-old postgraduate student at Cambridge University, vanished in Cairo in January 2016. His body was found almost a week later and a post mortem examination showed he had been tortured before his death.
The prosecutors' move came just over a week after Egypt announced that it was temporarily suspending its investigation into the murder of Regeni, saying it had reservations about the evidence Italy had compiled.
Italian and Egyptian investigators had been working together to try to solve the crime. But judicial sources told Reuters last year that Italy was frustrated by the slow pace of developments in Egypt and decided to press ahead with its own line of inquiry in an effort to move things forward.
Italy originally placed five Egyptians under investigation in the case, but the prosecutors said on Thursday there was insufficient evidence to proceed against one of them.
Regeni disappeared on the fifth anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising that ended the 30-year rule of Hosni Mubarak.
Intelligence and security sources told Reuters in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security. 
The police denied this and in a statement on Nov. 30, Egypt's public prosecution said it had evidence against a criminal gang accused of robbing Regeni but believed that ""the material perpetrator"" of the murder remains unknown.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 10, 2020 06:37AM ET</span>",Not without India: World's pharmacy gears up for vaccine race,"By Abhirup Roy, Euan Rocha and Krishna N. Das
PUNE, India/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India, the world's biggest vaccine maker, is getting set for the massive global blitz to contain the coronavirus pandemic with its pharmaceutical industry and partners freeing up capacity and accelerating investments even without firm purchase orders. 
India manufactures more than 60% of all vaccines sold across the globe, and while its $40 billion pharmaceutical sector is not yet involved in the production of the expensive  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) shots, the nation will play a pivotal role in immunizing much of the world.
Indian companies are set to produce eight, more affordable vaccines designed to fight COVID-19, including AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s Covishield, called the ""vaccine for the world https://in.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-astrazeneca/astrazeneca-says-covid-19-vaccine-for-the-world-can-be-90-effective-idINKBN2830HC"" by its developers.
""There are many vaccines being produced in countries around the world but there's only one nation that has the manufacturing capacity to produce sufficient quantities to satisfy the demands of citizens in every country, and that's India,"" said Australia's ambassador to India, Barry O'Farrell, after touring vaccine manufacturing sites in India with many other diplomats.
Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker, has already stockpiled more than 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca shot, even as it awaits emergency-use approvals from both British and Indian authorities. 
SII plans to make a total of 400 million doses of Covishield by July and is setting up new production lines to roll out roughly one billion shots a year.
Pharmaceutical packager Schott Kaisha, meanwhile, is stepping up production of vaccine vials and Deutsche Post (OTC:DPSGY)'s DHL is working out how best to distribute the shots within the country and around the world.
""Because of the large volumes coming out of India and of course the affordable vaccines, there is no other country that will contribute more towards ending the pandemic than India,"" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla told Reuters at the company's sprawling campus in the western city of Pune. Here, automated machines fill and seal thousands of vials with the AstraZeneca shot every hour before they are moved to a vast, high-ceiling cold room.
But much of India's vaccine production could be, at least initially, for domestic use.
With nearly 10 million infections, the world's second-highest after the United States, India's government is likely to order a huge chunk of the vaccines for its 1.3 billion people.
CALCULATED RISK
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has yet to specify how much India will require, but his government has said some vaccines may be approved in the next few weeks and that it was ""committed to partnering with all interested countries in vaccine-related efforts"".
Poonawalla said he expects to sell hundreds of millions of doses at home. Even as immediate local demand is met, nearly half of its production would go overseas, the company has said.
India's Bharat Biotech, which has also sought emergency approval for its government-backed vaccine candidate, is in discussions with more than 10 countries in South America, Asia and Eastern Europe to sell its product.
Russia, meanwhile, has signed deals with Indian companies to make the country the production and export hub for its Sputnik V vaccine, starting with more than 100 million doses a year.
Many companies in India's vaccine supply chain are laying out investments without deals in hand.
""We've taken a calculated risk,"" said Rishad Dadachanji, a director at Schott Kaisha that is in supply talks with around 10 vaccine makers at home and abroad.
It is increasing its annual manufacturing capacity by 300 million to 1.5 billion vials by November.
Executives at rival firms SGD Pharma India and Piramal Glass said they were expanding their production base, or re-allocating manufacturing lines to focus on vials.
SGD plans to add 100 million units to its current capacity of 350 million glass vials, while Piramal says it can double its specialised vial capacity at just a month's notice ""to meet any unforeseen demand.""
SYRINGES AND COLD STORAGE
Others that are likely to benefit from an expected surge in demand are: pharmaceutical firms Dr Reddy's Laboratories (NYSE:RDY), Cadila Healthcare and Hetero; logistics company FedEx (NYSE:FDX); cold chain storage specialist Snowman Logistics and Hindustan Syringes & Medical Devices, among others.
Hindustan Syringes says it will increase capacity by 42% to 1 billion units by the first half of next year. It has already shipped some 140 million syringes that disable themselves after one use for the global vaccine distribution program COVAX.
But because the Indian government has not yet signed any contracts with vaccine suppliers, some ancillary companies have been left guessing what kind of products they should prepare for as specifications may vary from vaccine to vaccine.
Vial maker SGD's managing director, Sardar Akshay Singh, warned that a last-minute rush to secure vaccines for India could hit exports - similar to the way officials stalled shipments of masks and sanitizers early in the pandemic to meet local demand.
""We have been feeding the government a lot of information but they've not come up with a plan so far,"" said Sunil Nair, CEO of India's biggest cold chain operator, Snowman.
The company's ongoing expansion will nevertheless double its vaccine handling capacity to 200 million doses by March.
It operates some 500 trucks fitted with containers refrigerated by Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR), has vendors on standby if more are required, and says it can deliver vaccines from production site to inoculation centres within hours thanks to its countrywide reach.
SII, which also has COVID vaccine tie-ups with U.S. biotech firm Codagenix,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Austria's Themis, has scaled back production of shots for other diseases and is readying more cold rooms, buying more trucks and hiring more workers.
For DHL, the world's largest courier and logistics company, vaccine transportation work has already begun in India. It recently brought in Russia's Sputnik V vaccine for trials and says it will play a crucial role in exporting vaccines, and distributing them within the country.

""The next 12-24 months are going to be significantly exciting and there's going to be a lot of capacity issues, but I think it's a positive headache to have,"" DHL Express India head R.S. Subramanian said.

The sight of Sydykov in a trance-like state, dressed in traditional Kyrgyz garb and a fur hat, is striking. But every Kyrgyz will know that he is reciting the Epic of Manas, a poem half a million lines long about the history of their homeland, and that he is one of the manaschi, the professional storytellers who have passed it down over the generations.
The epic is recited at many public events, including at the political rallies which ultimately toppled the Bishkek government two months ago, bringing nationalist politician Sadyr Japarov to power.
Last month, Sydykov, a well-known manaschi, launched a challenge to promote his art by reciting the Epic of Manas non-stop for over 14 hours on Bishkek's Ala Too Square. Other manaschi performed similar feats, with one reciting the poem on top of a mountain 4,000 metres above sea level.
The poem strikes a chord with the current mood, recounting the story of a medieval military and political leader credited with reuniting scattered Kyrgyz tribes and reclaiming their homeland in the northeastern part of the Tian Shan mountain range.
""To Kyrgyzstan, Manas is sacred,"" Sydykov says. 
Sydykov's campaign to promote Manas coincides with a nationalist resurgence in Kyrgyzstan's society and politics. Even before Japarov's rise to power, a right-wing movement gained prominence whose name, Kyrk Choro (Fourty Knights) is a reference to the Manas epic.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A bill to legalize abortion in Argentina, which is being pushed by center-left President Alberto Fernandez, is set to be debated in the lower house of Congress on Thursday amid widespread protests for and against the law.
The legislation, which would provide for the legal termination of pregnancy up until the 14th week, could set the tone elsewhere in predominantly Roman Catholic Latin America, with a number of countries seeing drives to give women greater reproductive rights.
The draft law is expected to be narrowly approved by congressional deputies before moving up to the Senate, where an even tighter vote is anticipated. The South American country is the birthplace of Pope Francis, and most people are nominally Catholic.
A spokesman for the ruling party told Reuters a debate of almost 30 hours was expected in the lower house, meaning that the bill - which could undergo modifications to achieve broad consensus - would be likely to face a vote on Friday morning.
""We are confident that the votes will be there ... We are working on the consensus that is needed,"" Elizabeth Gómez Alcorta, the government's Women, Gender and Diversity minister, told the official news agency Télam on Wednesday.
Protesters supporting the bill said they would conduct an overnight vigil, wearing their trademark green scarves, outside the gates of Congress to await news of what they hope will be an approval this time round after a similar vote to legalize abortion was narrowly defeated in 2018.
Opposition groups, with light blue scarves, have also pledged to take to the streets to demonstrate against the bill.
The initiative includes a parallel bill which will face a separate vote to assist women who want to continue with their pregnancy and face severe economic or social difficulties.
Argentine law currently only allows the voluntary interruption of pregnancy when there is a serious risk to the mother or in the event of rape, although activists say many women often do not receive adequate care.

The country has seen a gradual rise in agnosticism in recent years. While the current Peronist government is strongly behind the bill, that was not the case in 2018 during the conservative administration of Mauricio Macri.

The Danish government ordered a cull of some 17 million mink in early November after outbreaks of coronavirus hit hundreds of farms and authorities found mutated strains of the virus among people.
The logistical challenge of disposing of such a large number of dead animals prompted authorities to bury some of the mink in pits in a military area in western Denmark under two metres of soil.
The government later said it wanted to dig up those mink again after some resurfaced from the mass graves, most likely due to gasses from the decomposition process pushing the mink out of the ground.
The new study says groundwater in the area may already have become contaminated and urges authorities to take swift action, Radio4 reported.
The report was commissioned by the Danish Environmental Protection Agency in late November and was prepared by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and the Technical University of Denmark, Radio4 said. 
The Danish Environmental Protection Agency did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. 
The agency is currently conducting additional examinations to assess the environmental impact of the graves, including geophysical probes and drillings. It said on Wednesday it expected the results of those early next year. 
Before the interring of the dead mink, authorities had said the burials would not pose a risk to drinking water or protected areas.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders are set to agree sanctions on Turkish individuals on Thursday over a energy exploration dispute with Greece and Cyprus, but will postpone any harsher steps until March, according to a new draft summit statement.
Shying away from a threat made in October to consider wider economic measures, EU leaders will agree to punish individuals accused of planning or taking part in what the bloc says is unauthorised drilling off Cyprus.
The EU said it would seek to coordinate possible further measures with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office in January.
Turkey says it is operating in waters on its own continental shelf or areas where Turkish Cypriots have rights. Its president Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday he was not concerned by any sanctions the bloc might impose.
The EU asset freezes of as-yet unnamed individuals and companies will be in addition to two officials already on a sanctions list set up in November 2019, as first reported by Reuters on Wednesday.
""Turkey has engaged in unilateral actions and provocations and escalated its rhetoric against the EU,"" according to the draft statement prepared by EU envoys that leaders are expected to endorse after a summit discussion over dinner on Thursday.
EU leaders will tell officials ""to adopt additional listings ... in view of Turkey's unauthorised drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean,"" the latest draft said. 
Senior EU diplomats described the proposed sanctions as symbolic because the bloc was reluctant to severely punish Turkey, a NATO ally and candidate for EU membership, whose economy and currency are already weak. 
In 2011, the internationally-recognised Greek Cypriot government began exploring for natural gas with a U.S. company despite warnings from Turkey, which does not recognise the divided island's status and claims exploration rights.
Tensions flared in August when Ankara sent a seismic exploration ship into Cyprus' exclusive economic zone and also in waters claimed by Greece. The EU, led by Germany, has been trying to negotiate a settlement but without success.

Angered by Turkish foreign policy in Syria and Libya, France has supported Greek calls for tougher sanctions. The European Parliament last month called for punitive measures. Athens has called for a formal arms embargo on Turkey.

The agreement, first announced in November and revived in July, was brokered by Riyadh to end a standoff between Yemen's internationally recognised government and southern separatists who are both part of the coalition that has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement since 2015.
The separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), whose forces are backed by Riyadh's ally the United Arab Emirates, has been locked in a power struggle with the Saudi-backed government in the south, where it has been based since being ousted from power in the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis in late 2014.
The coalition said in a statement it would on Thursday start supervising the separation of forces in Abyan governorate to return to battlefronts with the Houthis and from inside Aden port city to outside the governorate.
It said consensus had been reached on a new cabinet of 24 ministers, including from STC and Yemeni ""political components"", and that the government would be announced ""as soon as implementation of the military aspect is completed within one week"". 
The dispute within the anti-Houthi camp was one factor holding up United Nations efforts to negotiate a nationwide ceasefire to pave the way for a resumption of political negotiations, last held in December 2018, to end the wider war.
The conflict, seen widely in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed more than 100,000 people and caused what the United Nations says is the world's largest humanitarian crisis. 
The Houthis, who hold Sanaa and most big population centres, deny being puppets of Iran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.

BADALONA, Spain (Reuters) - Flames ripped through an abandoned warehouse occupied by scores of immigrant squatters in a Barcelona suburb, killing at least two people and injuring at least 19 overnight.
The fire, which sent a huge cloud of smoke into the air, was under control by Thursday morning, but authorities said parts of the building had collapsed and there was a risk the whole structure could fall, complicating rescue efforts. 
Undocumented immigrants often slept in the warehouse in the large industrial suburb of Badalona, Catalonia region's acting president Pere Aragones and other officials said.
""It was a squat which we had for years known could end in tragedy,"" Badalona mayor Xavier Garcia Albiol told journalists at the site.
Many people who were sleeping inside when the fire broke out late on Wednesday managed to escape, Aragones told broadcaster TVE.
""We don't know exactly how many people there were at the time of the fire,"" Aragones added. ""We still need to see if there could be someone who remained trapped inside.""
The building had housed as many as 180 people in the past, a Catalan interior department spokesman said. 
Emergency services treated 19 people, including three in a critical state and four others seriously injured, officials said.
Miquel Samper, in charge of interior affairs in the regional Catalan government, said the origin of the fire was not known yet.

Badalona is a large coastal Barcelona suburb with a population of about 220,000, making it the fourth largest city in the Catalonia region.

MADRID (Reuters) - There will be far fewer corporate parties over Christmas as big gatherings are banned due to the pandemic, but in Spain, better-than-expected sales of seasonal gift baskets are going some way to making up for foregone festivities.
Ranging from a small present to elaborate parcels containing wine, liquor, Iberian ham and assorted sweets, the holiday baskets are a common way in Spain to thank employees for their work over the last year.
With many customers struggling because of COVID-19, companies specialising in the packages had expected 2020 to be a bust, as was the case during the 2008 financial crisis. 
Instead, they were surprised to find that while business from the hardest-hit sectors like tourism was down, other industries increased orders and new clients appeared.
""A big chunk of the budget from cancelled Christmas dinners has gone to Christmas gifts. That includes companies that are doing it for the first time this year,"" said Moises Barroso Barrios, commercial director of gift company Rojas Barrios.
""This has given us a big boost.""
Pepa Alarcon, marketing director of Lotes de Espana company - one of the leaders in the sector - said one reason employers were sending gift baskets was to maintain motivation among staff, most of whom were working at home.
""As they cannot get together they have decided to go for the Christmas parcel. The idea is to get together while keeping a distance,"" Alarcon told Reuters.
This year the value of the average order had risen to 50-60 euros per basket from 30-40 the previous year, Alarcon said, adding that the company was hoping to match last year's sales.
""That would be good for us, considering that at first we thought we would have a significant drop in sales.""

With the focus in 2020 being very much on health, some companies have branched out. Rojas Barrios is offering a special deal with a private health insurance firm along with its baskets.

BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - One person has died and nearly 600 have been hospitalised since Saturday in a southern Indian state due to a mysterious infection that caused many to fall unconscious after suffering giddiness, seizures and nausea.
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?
The first patients were admitted to hospital on Saturday in Eluru, a town in Andhra Pradesh state.
By Sunday, according to the federal health ministry, there were more than 200 people hospitalised, suffering dizziness, headache and vomiting. Patients including children and women fainted, and that evening a 45-year-old man died.
By Wednesday, the number of patients had jumped nearly three-fold.
As of Thursday, over 85% of the patients had been discharged. 
The cause of their illness has yet to be identified. Tests ruled out COVID-19 infection. 
WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL CAUSES?
Eluru is home to over 200,000 people, and is known for its weaving industry.
Investigations have focused on whether the illness could be linked to some groundwater contamination, excessive use of pesticides or mass application of chlorine as part of a coronavirus disinfection drive.
Doctors have also found traces of lead and nickel in the blood samples of some patients. The elevated lead levels could have been a trigger, especially as the levels appeared to drop among patients a day after hospitalisation, doctors say.
The state government says officials are also checking if dumping or burning of used batteries could have caused the illness, without elaborating further.
They are also testing the area's drinking water and milk samples.
A senior health official has also said exposure to organochlorides found in pesticides and used in mosquito control could be a potential cause.
WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO LEAD OR CHLORINE
High levels of lead in the bloodstream can impair development of brains, nervous systems and vital organs such as heart and lungs.
Organochlorides are banned or restricted in many countries after research linked them to cancer and other health risks. It was not immediately clear how extensively the chemicals are used in India, though they are found in DDT used in mosquito control.
World Health Organization experts are surveying neighbourhoods in and around Eluru, collecting various information, including on food sources. 
Health authorities are running various tests and the state's chief minister has promised corrective measures once investigations are completed.

LAGOS (Reuters) - A group of activists and celebrities, including a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, have signed an open letter to Nigeria's president demanding that he hold accountable security personnel accused of shooting anti-police brutality protesters. 
The letter, published in the New York Times on Thursday to mark International Human Rights Day, comes nearly two months after what witnesses and Amnesty International say was a fatal clash in Lagos between peaceful protesters and military and police. The military and police deny shooting protesters.
The demonstrators had called for an end to police brutality and a much-hated unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). 
Black Lives Matter co-founder Opal Tometi, 36, an American with Nigerian parents, organized the letter after watching the protests descend into violence. Tometi said she has friends and family in Nigeria, but said it was not difficult to get others to sign on. 
""We care about the issues of police brutality no matter where they're occurring,"" she told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. ""The violence that people have been met with is intolerable."" 
Spokesmen for President Muhammadu Buhari did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Police disbanded SARS on Oct. 11, and the government asked each state to form judicial panels to investigate claims of brutality. 
But protesters have outlined a campaign of harassment since the shootings, and some still do not know what happened to their missing friends and family. 
The letter, signed by supporters including climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg, also asks the government to release jailed protesters, lift a ban on protests and allow an independent human rights monitor investigation into ""the actions that led to the killings at Lekki Toll Gate."" 

""People are missing and people have died as a consequence of speaking out,"" Tometi said. ""We will not abide it.""

Beijing will also implement reciprocal sanctions against some U.S. officials, members of Congress, personnel at non-governmental organisations, and their family members, over their ""vile"" behaviour on Hong Kong, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference.
China urges the United States not to go further down this ""dangerous and mistaken path"", Hua added. 
She declined to give any names of those sanctioned or to say when the sanctions would start.
The United States on Monday imposed financial sanctions anda travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their role in adoptinga national security law for Hong Kong and over Beijing's disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators inHong Kong.
The U.S. action was widely seen as part of an effort by outgoing President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and to box President-elect Joe Biden into taking a similarly hardline position on Beijing at a time of bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress. Biden takes office on Jan. 20.

In August the Trump administration slapped sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other top officials over what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms during a crackdown on the territory’s pro-democracy movement.

Malalai Maiwand, a reporter at Enikas Radio and TV in Nangarhar, was killed along with her driver in an attack on their vehicle in Jalalabad, capital of the eastern province of Nangarhar, taking the total number of journalists and media workers killed this year in Afghanistan to 10. 
""She was on the way to office when the incident happened,"" Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor, said.
The area has been a hotbed of militant activity, most notably involving Islamic State, but no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
Afghan interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said that in the last decade and a half, the vast majority of journalists killed have been victims of the Taliban.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied the group's involvement in the incident. 
Enikas has been targeted before, with its owner, Engineer Zalmay, kidnapped for ransom in 2018. 
Maiwand is also not the first of her family to be targeted. Five years ago, her mother, also an activist, was killed by unknown gunmen.
""With the killing of Malalai, the working field for female journalists is getting more smaller and the journalists may not dare to continue their jobs the way they were doing before,"" Nai, an organisation supporting media in Afghanistan, said in a statement.
Last month, Elyas Dayee, a Radio Azadi journalist, was killed in a bomb blast in the southern Helmand province, and Yama Siawash, a former TOLOnews presenter, was killed in a similar blast in Kabul.
The Afghan government, German embassy, EU delegation and Britsh ambassador condemned growing attacks on journalists and activists. 
International donors and governments have also expressed apprehension about a possible reversal of progress on women's rights over the last two decades if the Taliban return to any sort of power with the withdrawal of foreign troops from the country next year. 
The Taliban's hardline rule was marked by oppressive laws for women up until the group was toppled following a 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Pyongyang squandered an opportunity to fundamentally reinvent its relationship with the United States during Donald Trump's presidency, Washington's top North Korea envoy said on Thursday, adding he will urge his successors to continue engagement.
Speaking to a think tank in Seoul during a visit to meet with South Korean security officials, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun admitted he was disappointed denuclearisation negotiations had stalled and that more progress was not made during his time leading those efforts.
""Regrettably, much opportunity has been squandered by our North Korean counterparts over the past two years, who too often have devoted themselves to the search for obstacles to negotiations instead of seizing opportunities for engagement,"" he said, according to his prepared remarks.
Still, he defended Trump's decision to focus on top-level diplomacy with leader Kim Jong Un, and to eschew small steps in favour of seeking a major agreement under which North Korea would surrender its nuclear weapons and the two sides would normalize relations.
""This vision was a bold one, and it made the many advocates of incrementalism uncomfortable,"" Biegun said.
After trading insults and nuclear threats that had pushed their countries to the brink of war, Trump and Kim met for the first time in Singapore in 2018, where they signed a general declaration calling for denuclearisation and new relations between the two old adversaries.
After working-level talks Biegun helped lead, the two leaders held their second meeting in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi in 2019 but failed to reach a deal.
Subsequent talks failed to make progress and Pyongyang has rebuffed Biegun's calls for more engagement, saying the U.S. does not appear serious about dropping its hostile policies.
Biegun called for North Korea to resume talks in the coming months.

With Democratic president-elect Joe Biden due to replace Trump in January, Biegun said he had a message for the incoming team: ""The war is over; the time for conflict has ended, and the time for peace has arrived.""

Taiwan's National Communications Commission said last month it would not renew CTi's broadcasting license, citing evidence of interference from a tycoon with major business interests in China, amid fears of Beijing's efforts to win support on the Chinese-claimed, democratic island.
CTi's major shareholder, Tsai Eng-meng, runs one of China's largest food firms, Want Want China Holdings Ltd.
The company and Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang party have denounced the regulator's decision not to renew the license as censorship aimed at silencing voices critical of President Tsai Ing-wen.
Tsai and her government have rejected that, saying the decision was made by an independent body and not subject to interference.
Sky Liang, the vice president of CTi's news department, told Reuters it would keep broadcasting, but online, and that its YouTube channel had gained some 440,000 new subscribers in the last few weeks, taking its tally to 1.7 million.
""We've been forced to become new media. Doubtless this is a big challenge, but everyone has prepared themselves psychologically,"" Liang said, adding they were looking at Instagram and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as other areas for development.
The channel is due to go off air at midnight on Friday, though it has lodged a legal appeal to stop this.
Formerly a dictatorship, Taiwan is an exuberant democracy but it has a deeply partisan media, and many Taiwanese view CTi, which began operations in 1994, as being pro-China or ""red media"", a reference to China's ruling Communist Party.
Liang said that was an unfair, ""malicious"" accusation, and that they took neither instructions nor money from Beijing.
""I've been at CTi for a long time, and as a senior executive in the news department. I've never come under any pressure from China or (its) Taiwan Affairs Office on what news to report or not report.""

SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (Reuters) - A few hundred Hondurans formed a caravan bound for the United States on Wednesday after hurricanes battered the country, posing a fresh challenge to efforts to stem illegal immigration from Central America on the cusp of a new U.S. administration.
Mostly younger migrants with backpacks and some women carrying children left the northern city of San Pedro Sula on foot for the Guatemalan border after calls went out on social media to organize a caravan to the United States.
If the exodus grows, it could become the first major caravan to hit the road since Joe Biden defeated U.S. President Donald Trump in a presidential election last month.
Striking just two weeks apart in November, Hurricanes Eta and Iota hammered infrastructure, homes and crops, killing about 100 people in Honduras. The neighboring countries of Guatemala and Nicaragua also suffered widespread damage.
""We lost everything, we have no choice but to go to the United States,"" an unidentified middle-aged man in the caravan with his wife and cousin told Honduran television.
The man said he was from La Lima, a municipality on the southeastern edge of San Pedro Sula that was hard hit by flooding caused by Eta and Iota.
Guatemala's migration authorities warned the approaching migrants that to enter the country, they would need negative coronavirus tests and passports.
Central Americans had already begun leaving their homes following the devastating hurricanes.
Trump, who is due to leave office on Jan. 20, has made curbing illegal immigration a top priority, and has put pressure on Mexico to help him. A caravan of thousands moving through Central America was broken up in October.

Biden has vowed to pursue a ""humane"" migration policy and offer help to Central America to ease migratory pressures.

UIWANG, South Korea (Reuters) - How many disposable masks does it take to make a stool? 
Kim Ha-neul knows it takes 1,500. 
Bothered by the waste caused by disposable face masks, many of which are made of polypropylene, the South Korean furniture design student has come up with an eco-friendly solution, melting them to make stools he calls ""Stack and Stack"". 
""Plastic is recyclable, so why don't we recycle face masks, which are made of plastic?"" the 23-year-old said.
In June, Kim set up a mask collection box at his school, the Kaywon University of Art and Design in Uiwang city, south of Seoul. He has since gathered 10,000 used masks, and has received more than a tonne of defective ones from a factory as well. 
To lessen the risk of coronavirus transmission, Kim keeps them in storage for at least four days. Then, removing elastic bands and wires, he wields a heat gun over the masks in a mould, melting them down at temperatures over 300 degrees Celsius (570 degrees Fahrenheit).
The result? Three-legged stools 45cm (18 inches) recycled from white, pink, blue and black masks, which Kim displayed in his graduation exhibition. 
Next, Kim hopes to make other furniture pieces from the recycled masks such as a chair, table or some lights. He is also urging the government and private companies to recycle face masks by setting up a separate box for their collection.
In September alone, South Korea produced more than a billion face masks for domestic use, government data showed.
Though the stools are not yet for sale, fellow students were impressed by the idea and rough-surfaced design.

""It has such a strong message,"" said art student Park Sung-chan, 20. ""This will remind us what we've been through in 2020 with the coronavirus and is also environmentally friendly.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea authorities scrambled on Thursday to build hospital beds in shipping containers to ease strains on medical facilities stretched by the latest coronavirus wave, which shows little sign of abating with 682 new cases.
The resurgence of infections has rekindled concerns about an acute shortage of hospital beds, prompting Seoul city to begin installing container beds for the first time since the start of the pandemic. 
Health authorities plan to step up testing by launching temporary sites at some 150 locations across the greater Seoul area. 
""We're in a critical situation where our anti-virus efforts and medical system's capacity could reach their limits before long,"" Health Minister Park Neung-hoo told a meeting, vowing to mobilise all available resources. 
""Above all, we will secure sufficient treatment centres and hospital beds for critical cases so that they can receive proper treatment in a timely manner."" 
In Seoul, with a population of 10 million, only around 3% of hospital beds were available for severe cases, and 17% for all patients, according to Park Yoo-mi, a quarantine officer at the city government. 
The city has dispatched 50 epidemiological investigators to 25 districts to help track down potential patients, in addition to 10 sent from the central government, Park said. 
A total of 274 military and police officers and other administrative staff will also be mobilised for epidemiological surveys starting Friday, she added. 
Thursday's 682 new infections came a day after the daily tally hit 686, the second-highest since the country's first case was confirmed in January, even as tougher social distancing rules took effect this week, according to the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). 
New cases have been persistently around 600 over the past week, driven by smaller, harder-to-trace clusters around the densely populated capital city of Seoul, whereas the early two waves were centred on a handful of groups or regions. 
The governor of South Korea's most populous province Gyeonggi, with 13.5 million people, said on Wednesday he plans to conduct mass testing in some areas to discover potential cases.
President Moon Jae-in called for buying more COVID-19 vaccines after authorities announced deals with four global drugmakers as part of a drive to inoculate 44 million people, or 60% of the country's population. 

Total infections rose to 40,098, with 564 deaths, KDCA data showed.

Opposition leaders and most Western nations said the election was stacked in favor of Maduro, who has been widely criticized for his human rights record and for undermining democracy to stay in power. 
Candidates from the ruling Socialist Party and allied parties took 253 of 277 seats in the new parliament, according to figures posted on the National Electoral Council's website on Wednesday. 
Democratic Action, a long-time opposition party that is now widely accused of being in league with the government, won 11 seats, according to the council's data. 
Earlier in the year, the supreme court had put opposition parties in the hands of politicians expelled from those parties for alleged links to Maduro - one of the reasons the opposition had called for a boycott.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido, the current chief of parliament, is calling on sympathizers to participate in a Dec. 12 consultation that will ask citizens whether they reject the results of Sunday's vote and if they want a change of government.

Maduro says Guaido is a puppet of the United States and that Venezuela's economic situation is the result of U.S. sanctions that have crippled the OPEC member's oil exports and prevented it from importing fuel.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Amnesty International accused Airbnb of acting in bad faith towards investors ahead of its stock market debut on Thursday by failing to inform them of its politically sensitive business activities in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Airbnb did not provide comment on Amnesty's charge. A company spokesman referred Reuters to a statement it made in 2019 saying it would not take profits from its listings in the West Bank. 
Amnesty, which wants Airbnb to delist rental properties in the settlements, said in a statement that the company should have mentioned them in the ""Risk Factors"" section of a Nov. 16 regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The San Francisco-based booking company is holding an initial public offering on Nasdaq on Thursday.
""Airbnb stock is expected to be purchased by investment and pension funds across the world, which could mean that a large number of people will indirectly hold investments in Airbnb without understanding the full ramifications,"" the human rights group said.
Most countries regard the settlements that Israel built on land captured in a 1967 war as illegal. Israel disputes that, citing security needs and historical and religious links to the territory, which Palestinians seek for a future state.
Airbnb has around 200 properties for rent in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Amnesty said.
Saleh Higazi, Amnesty's deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said in a press release that Airbnb ""needs to do right by future investors and stop benefiting from illegal settlements"".
Heeding calls from Palestinians and human rights activists, Airbnb in 2018 said it would remove the settlement properties. But following legal challenges in the United States, it reversed the decision in 2019 while committing to donate profits from the bookings.
""Any profits generated for Airbnb by any Airbnb host activity in the entire West Bank will be donated to non-profit organizations dedicated to humanitarian aid that serve people in different parts of the world,"" Airbnb said in its April 2019 statement.

Airbnb was one of 112 companies the United Nations' human rights office said have business ties to settlements, a list that also included other travel firms and a steel producer.

The lawyers, in a statement, provided no details on what the back taxes were for. But the newspaper El Pais said earlier the former monarch sought to settle certain alleged illegal credit card transactions with the revenue service to avoid being charged in an investigation and to be able to return to Spain. 
""In any case, His Majesty King Juan Carlos remains, as always, at the Tax Service's disposal for any procedure it considers necessary,"" the lawyers said.
Prosecutors at Spain's Supreme Court have opened several investigations into Juan Carlos' business dealings, including those linked to a high-speed train contract in Saudi Arabia.
Juan Carlos' son, King Felipe, is the current head of state. 
""The monarchy is not in danger,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told TV channel Telecinco in an interview, when asked about the scandals involving Juan Carlos, whose formal title is the King Emeritus.
Sanchez defended the system of Spain's constitutional monarchy and called for respect for the ""presumption of innocence"" in the face of judicial investigations of the former monarch. 
Juan Carlos has been living in United Arab Emirates since he left Spain.
Through his lawyers, he has repeatedly declined to comment on corruption allegations. Spanish monarchs have immunity during their reign but Juan Carlos' abdication in 2014 in favour of his son potentially leaves him vulnerable to prosecution.

Guaido is recognized as the nation's legitimate leader by dozens of countries that disavowed President Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election. Guaido at the same time said the constitution put him in line to assume power as he was head of parliament. 
But the Socialist Party won a majority of votes in the Dec. 6 legislative election that was boycotted by the opposition, undermining Guaido's claim to the presidency and fueling doubt about the U.S. plan to maintain the interim government. 
""The new administration should understand that this plan has been exhausted and (it) cannot give continuity to the status quo: the interim government,"" the BBC quoted Capriles as saying. 
Guaido's press team declined to comment.
Press advisers for Capriles did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Capriles criticized the current plan, under which lawmakers would continue to describe themselves as legitimate parliamentarians even after their five-year term expires on Jan. 5, the BBC reported.

NAIROBI/GENEVA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's prime minister shifted focus away from war on Wednesday, opening a cross-border highway to Kenya at the opposite end of his country, while the United Nations voiced alarm at continuing fighting in the northern Tigray region. 
Abiy Ahmed cut the ribbon on a mega-highway linking south Ethiopia with Kenya's Indian Ocean port of Mombasa, alongside Kenyan counterpart President Uhuru Kenyatta, reflecting Ethiopian aspirations to become a regional powerhouse.
""Just like the infrastructure, we should work on peace and security,"" he said at the border town of Moyale, refraining from mentioning Tigray. ""Peace is a foundation for everything we are aspiring to transform (in) the life our people.""
War since Nov. 4 between Ethiopia's federal forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) is thought to have killed thousands and displaced more than 950,000 people, according to U.N. estimates, some 50,000 of them into Sudan.
The conflict may also hurt an economy that had been soaring, albeit from a low base, becoming the world's fastest growing in 2017, driven by agricultural exports and heavy infrastructure spending it hoped would drive a manufacturing boom. 
Ethiopia was for years trying to position itself as an emerging industrial hub that would draw its 115 million population - the second largest in Africa - off subsistence farms and into factories. 
For more than a decade, the government poured billions of dollars into hydro-electric dams, industrial parks, railways and highways. Then when Abiy took power in 2018, he began opening up sectors like telecoms to private investment.
Those aspirations are now at risk. Instability that began even before the Tigray conflict - due to ethnic clashes and other problems - may scare off investors already skittish about the impact of COVID-19 and rapidly-rising Ethiopian government debt. Foreign textiles firms worry about existing investments.
Abiy and Kenyatta later flew to inspect the building of a port at Kenya's Lamu, which will service Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan via planned rail lines, roads and a pipeline. 
'WORRYING, VOLATILE'
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in Geneva that events in Tigray were still ""worrying and volatile"" and called for civilians to be protected.
""Fighting continues between federal forces and the TPLF, and affiliated militias on both sides,"" she told reporters, citing clashes near the towns of Mekelle, Sherero, Axum, Abiy Addi.
A government spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TPLF leaders could not be reached.
Abiy declared victory after capturing the regional capital Mekelle, but TPLF leaders say their combat continues from surrounding hills.
About 1,000 federal soldiers held by the TPLF, some of whom were abducted on Nov. 3, the day before the war erupted, were freed in an operation by the federal army and police, state-controlled media said late on Wednesday, without elaborating.
Both sides' claims are difficult to check, as most communications in Tigray are down and access is severely restricted. Journalists need a permit to travel outside the capital Addis Ababa. 
Aid agencies signed a deal with the government last week for safe access to Tigray, home to more than 5 million people, of whom 600,000 needed food handouts even before the war.

But the shooting at, and then detention of, a U.N. security team on its way to a refugee camp by Ethiopian federal forces on Sunday highlighted how difficult implementing that deal will be. The government said the U.N. team defied two checkpoints.

The Oil Ministry gave no details about the assailants behind the explosive devices that targeted the wells in Khabbaz oilfield, 20 km (12 miles) southwest of Kirkuk.
In a statement issued through its official channel on Telegram, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, though it did not provide any evidence to back up its claim.
Technical teams isolated the two burning oil wells and there was no impact on output, two sources from the state-run North Oil Company (NOC), who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.
The field produces about 25,000 barrels per day, oil officials said. The ministry said production from the two wells that were targeted did not exceed 2,000 bpd.
The ministry statement said a fire erupted at the two oil wells after explosive devices were set off half an hour apart, with one going off at 1:30 a.m. (1030 GMT) and the second at 2:00 a.m (1100 GMT).

Tehran's move, which allows the seizure of assets within Iran of sanctioned individuals, is symbolic and unlikely to have any impact on the U.S. ambassador.
""Highlighting his key role in Yemen's humanitarian crisis, Iran puts Christopher Henzel's name on its sanctions list,"" the ministry said in a statement on its website. 
On Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury blacklisted Hasan Irlu, Iran’s ambassador to the Houthis, describing him as a pillar of Iranian efforts to project its power in Yemen, Syria and elsewhere.
Yemen has been locked in conflict since 2014, when the Iran-aligned Houthis group seized Sanaa, the capital, and then much of the country's north.

Iran's regional foe Saudi Arabia is leading a Sunni Arab coalition fighting the Houthis in the impoverished state on the tip of the Arabian peninsula. The conflict is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

The sanctions also apply to three entities headed by Wan, who is also known as ""Broken Tooth,"" the agency said in a statement.
The United States also blacklisted one Liberian individual and one Kyrgyz individual under Executive Order 13818, which targets corruption and serious human rights abuse.
Under the sanctions, all property of the three individuals and companies that fall under U.S. jurisdiction is frozen.
OFAC regulations generally bar Americans from dealing with designated individuals. A senior U.S. official told reporters non-U.S. actors who deal with them also risk being blacklisted.
Treasury said it targeted Wan for his activities at the helm of the 14K Triad, saying the group engaged in drug trafficking, illegal gambling, racketeering, human trafficking and other criminal activities.
The Treasury also designated three entities owned or controlled by Wan: Cambodia-based World Hongmen History and Culture Association; Hong Kong-based Dongmei Group; and the Palau China Hung-Mun Cultural Association, based in Palau.
It said the World Hongmen group had co-opted elites in Malaysia and Cambodia, continuing a ""pattern of overseas Chinese actors trying to paper over illegal criminal activities by framing their actions in terms of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)"" and other major initiatives of the CCP.
Treasury also blacklisted Raimbek Matraimov, a former deputy of the Kyrgyz Customs Service, alleging his involvement in a customs scheme in which at least $700 million was laundered from the Kyrgyz Republic.

It also designated Harry Varney Gboto-Nambi Sherman, now a prominent lawyer, Liberian senator and head of the Liberian Senate Judiciary Committee, who was indicted but later acquitted for his role in a bribery scheme in Liberia.

The probe never rose to the level of a full investigation and Fatou Bensouda's office concluded that British authorities had examined the allegations.
The ICC only intervenes when it finds that a state is unable or unwilling to take action against alleged atrocities.
In a final report, Bensouda wrote that her office had found a reasonable basis to believe that in 2003 British soldiers in Iraq carried out the war crime of willful killing or murder against at least seven Iraqi detainees. They also believed there were credible allegations of torture and rape.
""The preliminary examination has found that there is a reasonable basis to believe that various forms of abuse were committed by members of UK armed forces against Iraqi civilians in detention,"" it said. 
However, the United Kingdom had taken genuine action to investigate the crimes itself, prosecutors found.
In June, British independent investigators looking into allegations of war crimes committed in Iraq told the BBC that of the thousands of complaints they had investigated all but one had been dismissed.
Despite this outcome, which Bensouda said deprived the victims of justice, the ICC prosecutor concluded that British authorities had not been unwilling to carry out investigations or prosecutions and closed the ICC probe.
The ICC has been under fire by Washington for opening a full-fledged investigation into war crimes allegedly committed by U.S. troops on the territory of ICC member Afghanistan. The government of President Donald Trump this year imposed sanctions on Bensouda because of the probe.
Last month, a report by Australian authorities said the country's special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, leading other countries to re-examine the conduct of their troops.
Australia said 19 current and former soldiers would be referred for potential criminal prosecution.

Like other European countries, Finland has struggled with the question of what to do with its citizens who joined the violent Islamist movement that seized swathes of Syria and Iraq, and with their children who were born or taken there.
Many Europeans and their children ended up in camps in Syria after the group was defeated there two years ago. Fifteen children of Finnish women have been brought to Finland so far.
Parliament's constitutional committee found that Haavisto, who had pushed for the children to be brought to Finland quickly last year, had broken the law by trying to replace an official who refused to act. But it said the breach did not meet a threshold to press charges.
""I want to express a feeling of relief,"" Haavisto said after the ruling. ""It was clear all the time that helping the children in distress was also our legal responsibility.""
Haavisto says he pressed for quick action last year because winter was approaching and conditions were deteriorating at the al-Hol camp in northeastern Syria where the children were being held with their Finnish mothers.
The Prosecutor General has been investigating whether Haavisto broke the law by trying to replace the official.
While decisions by the parliamentary committee are usually unanimous, members of parliament from Haavisto's Greens group filed a rare objection to the ruling that censured him.

Parliament, which is likely to follow the constitutional committee's recommendation, will vote on whether to charge Haavisto. No date for the decision has been set.

Ashrawi, 74, did not give a reason for her resignation in a statement announcing the move. But she said that the PLO's Executive Committee, on which she served, had been marginalised ""and [excluded] from decision-making"".
The 15-member committee, the most senior body of the PLO, is headed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and is not often convened by the 85-year-old leader.
""The Palestinian political system needs renewal and reinvigoration with the inclusion of youth, women and additional qualified professionals,"" Ashrawi said in her statement. 
""I believe it is time to carry out the required reform and to activate the PLO in a manner that restores its standing and role.""
Ashrawi said she had tendered her resignation to Abbas, who also heads the Palestinian Authority (PA) that administers limited self-rule in the occupied West Bank under interim peace deals with Israel.
Ashrawi said Abbas deferred a decision on whether to accept her resignation to the PLO's Central Council.
Critics accuse Abbas of allowing Palestinian political institutions to stagnate. There have been no presidential or parliamentary elections for the PA for more than a decade.
Her negotiating days date back to the earliest public, U.S.-mediated talks with Israel in 1991 at the Madrid Conference, where as PLO spokeswoman she articulated the Palestinian quest for statehood to the world. 
Following the signing of the Oslo Accords with Israel in 1993, Ashrawi served in the cabinet of the newly-formed Palestinian Authority. 
A champion of women's rights, Ashrawi was the first woman elected to the Executive Committee in 2009. She was re-elected to the group in 2018 and has headed its Department of Public Diplomacy and Policy.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has ruled out buying the Russian coronavirus vaccine since its development lacked ""good practice"", its health minister said as Ankara steps up efforts to inoculate 50 million citizens by spring.
The Haberturk news website quoted Health Minister Fahrettin Koca on Wednesday as saying the Russian vaccine did not meet ""good laboratory practice"" conditions.
""Russia was not able to fulfil this. Therefore, it was not possible for the WHO (World Health Organization) and the world to purchase this vaccine,"" Koca said. ""It is not possible for this vaccine to receive a licence from us either. Therefore, it is out of our area of interest.""
He did not specify which Russian vaccine he was referring to, but Turkey has spoken of conducting Phase III trials for ""Sputnik-V"", the world's first registered coronavirus vaccine.
The Russia Direct Investment Fund, which backs the Sputnik vaccine's development and is responsible for its marketing abroad, declined to comment.
Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine, doing so before large-scale trials were complete - which stirred concern among scientists and doctors about the safety and efficacy of the shot.
Turkey, with a population of 83 million, has signed a contract to buy 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd, and expects to begin vaccinations this month, prioritising health workers. 
New daily coronavirus infections and deaths on Tuesday hit the highest levels since the coronavirus was first detected in Turkey in March. With more than 33,000 cases, Turkey currently has the fourth highest daily rate globally.
Koca said Turkey needs more vaccines with the aim of inoculating 50 million people by the end of April, adding that it was working to bring forward the delivery of 25 million doses of vaccine from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech.
""They will be able to give us 25 million doses by the end of 2021. We are trying to pull this forward. We want it before the summer. There is a fire going on. We need to extinguish it as soon as possible,"" he told Haberturk.
Koca also said Turkey would not pay for the Sinovac vaccine if it ""did not like it"".
""We put this in the contract when we gave our order...If our results are not effective enough, we have the right to return the vaccines and not pay even five cents.""

Ankara has imposed full weekend lockdowns and weekday curfews to combat the sharp rise in deaths and infections. President Tayyip Erdogan has said citizens should be patient until the vaccines arrive.

Prime Minister Jean Castex told reporters the law would give authorities tools to ""combat political and ideological undertakings which go against our values ... and sovereignty and sometimes go as far as criminal acts.""
The cabinet formally supported the proposed legislation on Wednesday, allowing it to go forward to the lower house of parliament, where the government and its allies control a majority of seats.
The debate around the law has become more charged since the Oct. 16 beheading of schoolteacher Samuel Paty by a man who said he wanted to punish the teacher for showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a civics class on free speech.
In the days before the killing, some people shared angry posts on social media about the teacher.
French officials say it is no longer enough to police acts of violence and that there is a need also to sanction behaviour which they say is not explicitly criminal but is out of step with the values of the French state.
The proposed law includes tougher measures against online apologists for acts of violence, the risk of expulsion for foreign nationals with multiple wives, and checks on anyone who educates their child outside mainstream schools.
Officials deny the proposed law targets Islam or Muslims.
Jean-Luc Mélenchon, leader of left-wing opposition party La France Insoumise, said: ""We don't accept the stigmatisation of Muslims that this draft contains.""

1384,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 10:31AM ET</span>","Don't mix Sputnik vaccine with alcohol, says Russian official. Some recoil","By Polina Nikolskaya and Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A health official's warning that anyone getting vaccinated against COVID-19 with Russia's Sputnik V vaccine should give up alcohol for almost two months has caused a backlash among some Russians who call the request unreasonable.
Anna Popova, head of the consumer health watchdog, told the Komsomolskaya Pravda radio station on Tuesday that people should stop drinking alcohol at least two weeks before getting the first of two injections. They should continue to abstain for a further 42 days, she advised. 
Sputnik V, licenced under an accelerated process before the end of clinical trials, has been given to doctors, soldiers, teachers and social workers in the first instance with a large-scale nationwide roll out due to begin this week. There are 21 days between the two Russian vaccine jabs. 
""This really bothers me,"" said Elena Kriven, a Moscow resident. ""I'm unlikely to not be able to drink for 80 days and I reckon the stress on the body of giving up alcohol, especially during what is a festive period, would be worse than the (side effects of the) vaccine and its alleged benefits,"" she said.
Kriven was referring to the main New Year public holiday. Many Russians will spend the first 10 days of 2021 relaxing at home or abroad, a period associated with higher alcohol use.
Russians are among the heaviest drinkers in the world, though consumption has fallen sharply since 2003. 
Popova warned alcohol would reduce the body's ability to build up immunity to COVID-19.
""It's a strain on the body. If we want to be healthy and have a strong immune response, don't drink alcohol,"" she said.
Her advice was contradicted by Alexander Gintsburg, the vaccine's developer. The Sputnik V Twitter channel on Wednesday published his very different advice above an image of Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio raising a glass of champagne.
""One glass of champagne won't hurt anyone, not even your immune system"", said Gintsburg. 
He said it would be prudent to reduce alcohol use by a reasonable amount while the body built up immunity, but said there was no need to give up completely. 
It was crucial however, he said, to refrain from alcohol three days before and after the two injections required. He said such advice was the same for anyone getting vaccinated around the world and not specific to Russia or Sputnik.
The topic generated lively discussion on social media. 
""You should have spoken (about alcohol reduction) in the first place,"" wrote one Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) user, Pavel Goriachkin. ""It's absolutely impossible for most people in our country.""
Another user, Konstantin Roninyo, wrote:
""Even I won't sign up for this despite drinking rarely. Having a drink at New Year is sacred!""
Others said the contradictory advice and their own experience showed there was no need to follow Popova's recommendations.

""I boozed like there was no tomorrow between the first and second jabs,"" said one Moscow resident, who didn't want to be identified. ""And I've got antibodies coming out of my ears"".

Sweden, which has not opted for the kind of lockdown adopted by many other European nations, has suffered many times more COVID-19 deaths per capita than its Nordic neighbours, with the total reaching almost 7,300 on Wednesday.
Stockholm and the surrounding region are among the areas hardest hit with 2,836 deaths. Infection rates are picking up again after a lull in the summer and autumn, and intensive care wards are now full.
""We need help,"" Bjorn Eriksson, the director of healthcare for the Stockholm region, told a news conference.
There were 814 COVID-19 patients being treated in Stockholm hospitals and geriatric wards on Wednesday, up from 748 last Friday, the region said. That compares with roughly 1,100 patients during the spring outbreak of the disease. 
Eriksson said 83 patients were treated in intensive care in Stockholm.
""That corresponds more or less to all intensive care beds we normally have,"" he said.
Faced by a surge in new cases in recent weeks, Sweden's government has tightened restrictions on public gatherings while high schools have been told to switch to distance learning for the rest of the term.
On Wednesday the government said it wanted parliament to grant it more power to implement lockdown measures such as closing shopping malls and gyms.
So far, however, measures have mostly been voluntary and media have been full of pictures of crowded shopping streets in the run-up to Christmas.

The filing rejects claims that Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, sent a hit squad to kill former spy chief Saad al-Jabri, and says the crown prince is immune from prosecution in the United States.
Jabri, who currently lives in exile in Canada, in August filed a 107-page lawsuit in a U.S. court alleging the crown prince ""dispatched a ""hit squad"" to kill him in October 2018, but Canadian authorities foiled the attempt.
The lawsuit against MbS and 24 others was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia.
In filings on Monday, MbS's lawyer Michael Kellogg (NYSE:K) dismissed the claims, describing them as ""steeped in drama"" likening the crown prince to one of Shakespeare's greatest villains. ""Regardless of its merits as literature, the Complaint fails as a legal pleading,"" he wrote in an 87-page document.
Kellogg wrote that Jabri ""can say whatever he wants to the newspapers but this case does not belong in federal court"". 
Jabri was a longtime aide to Prince Mohammed bin Nayef. Crown Prince MbS ousted Nayef as heir to the throne in a 2017 palace coup that left him the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally.
Kellogg's filing says the court lacks ""personal jurisdiction"" over MbS, as well as ""subject-matter jurisdiction"" over Jabri's claims under the doctrine of foreign official immunity. 
""He (MbS) is entitled to status-based immunity from any suit in U.S. court. He is also entitled to conduct-based immunity because (Jabri's) claims arise from the Crown Prince's alleged official acts,"" Kellogg wrote.

The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters emailed request for comment.

LISBON (Reuters) - The head of Portugal's SEF border service resigned on Wednesday after months of backlash over the fatal beating of a Ukrainian man detained at Lisbon airport for trying to enter the country without a valid visa.
Ihor Homenyuk, 40, died in March at an airport detention centre run by SEF where he was taken after refusing to board a flight out of the country. 
Three immigration officers accused of beating up Homenyuk with an expandable baton after the man became ""agitated"" over his detention have been charged with murder, prosecutors said in September.
The death raised an outcry that resurfaced on Monday over unconfirmed reports that SEF planned to install panic buttons in detention facilities, which human rights activists said was an inadequate response to the incident.
The interior ministry, which oversees SEF, said agency chief Cristina Gatoes resigned as part of a restructuring plan to more clearly separate police and administrative functions in dealing with immigrants and travellers.
The ministry declined further comment on the resignation, and the SEF did not immediately respond to a Reuters question on whether it was linked to the Ukrainian man's death.
""After learning the circumstances of the Ukrainian citizen's death at Lisbon Airport, resignation was the only possible action,"" opposition PSD lawmaker Ricardo Leite wrote on Twitter, referring to Gatoes' departure. 
""The resignation is a first, delayed step - but unless it is accompanied by structural changes as promised by the interior minister in March, it is insufficient,"" said Ana Logrado, spokeswoman for the Humans Before Borders rights group.

""The crime committed against the Ukrainian citizen was not an isolated event,"" Amnesty International's Portuguese branch chief Pedro Neto said, adding there had been other incidents of abuse against foreigners arriving in Portugal, and that more investment in training of border officers was needed.

The robbery, which raises questions about the security of sensitive military-related installations, took place as maintenance work was being carried out on the Ilyushin Il-80 plane.
The aircraft was modified from a Soviet jet airliner during the late Cold War to serve as an aerial command post for top officials to control their troops during a crisis. 
The theft came to light earlier this week in reports by Russian media, including the REN TV channel, which said signs of a break-in via the cargo hatch had been spotted last Friday and that 39 electronic units had been removed. 
Police in the southern region of Rostov said in a statement that a search for the culprits was under way. They have not reported any arrests so far. 
Police said the aircraft had been at an aerodrome in the city of Taganrog, but gave no details about the nature of the stolen equipment except for its estimated worth -- more than 1 million roubles ($13,600)
Russian military experts speculated that the items had been stolen because some of the units had been assembled using precious metals such as gold and platinum. 
The incident comes after President Vladimir Putin ploughed vast funds into overhauling the Russian military amid tensions with the West that are at their highest since the end of the Cold War. 
The Kremlin said measures would be taken to stop such a theft occurring again.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will impose sanctions on more Turkish individuals and companies responsible for drilling in contested waters in the Mediterranean, according to a draft statement prepared for EU leaders to agree at a summit on Thursday.
If agreed, the EU will ""prepare additional listings"" on the basis of a sanctions list already in place since 2019 and ""if need be, work on the extension"" of its scope, according to the draft statement seen by Reuters.
Such sanctions would be among the more conservative measures available to EU leaders, who vowed in October to use ""all instruments"" to pressure Turkey to stop exploring for hydrocarbons off the coast of Cyprus and Greece.
France had voiced support for ""sectorial"" sanctions on the Turkish economy. But imposing them on a NATO ally and EU candidate country is seen by Germany, Spain and Italy as a step too far that would put Turkey in the same camp as Russia, which is viewed as hostile to the bloc. 
The hydrocarbons dispute is part of wider issues with Turkey including the divided island of Cyprus and Turkey's foreign policy in Libya and Syria, which the United States and the EU say undermines Western goals. 
However, Turkey's role as a host for Syrian migrants fleeing civil war who would otherwise seek refuge in the EU limits European appetite to punish Ankara, diplomats say.
The draft statement also sought to delay retaliation, saying the European Commission and the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell should prepare ""options on how to proceed"" for the next EU summit in March.
""The EU will seek to coordinate on these matters with the U.S."", the draft said, something diplomats said was a recognition of hopes for closer foreign policy ties with Washington once U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.
Negotiations over the two-page statement are still ongoing and Greece and Cyprus, which accuse Turkey of drilling for hydrocarbons off its continental shelf, believe the sanctions do not go far enough.
""We welcome additional listings,"" a Cypriot diplomat said. ""We would like to see preparations for targeted sectoral measures at a later stage, in February or March, should Turkey's behaviour not change,"" the envoy said.

The EU created a sanctions programme last year to punish unauthorised exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, freezing assets of people and companies accused of planning or participating in activities in Cyprus' exclusive economic zone or on its continental shelf.
So far, only senior officials of Turkey's state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corporation (TPAO) have been put on the sanctions list but Cyprus proposed a list of more names earlier this year.
Cyprus' internationally recognised government discovered offshore gas in 2011 but has been at loggerheads with Turkey over maritime zones around the island, where it has granted license to multinational companies for oil and gas research.

Turkey, which does not have diplomatic relations with Cyprus' government, says it is operating in waters on its own continental shelf or areas where Turkish Cypriots have rights.

(Reuters) - An enormous iceberg is heading toward South Georgia Island in the southern Atlantic, where scientists say a collision could devastate wildlife including penguins, seals and albatross. 
Scientists have spent weeks watching this climate-related event unfold, as the iceberg - about the same size as the island itself – has meandered and advanced over two years since breaking off from the Antarctic peninsula in July of 2017.
The peninsula is one of the fastest-warming places on Earth, registering a record high temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius (69.35 degrees Fahrenheit) on Feb. 9. The warming has scientists concerned about ice melt leading to higher sea levels worldwide. 
The gigantic iceberg - dubbed A68a - is on a path to collide with the South Georgia Island, a remote British overseas territory off South America. Whether that collision is days or weeks away is unclear, though, as the iceberg has sped up and slowed down with the ocean currents along the way, said Geraint Tarling, a biological oceanographer with the British Antarctic Survey who has been tracking the icy mass.
A collision is still uncertain, as the currents could carry the iceberg past the island, Tarling said. 
""The currents around the island are complex, and it is still possible it may miss,"" Tarling said. 
Images captured by a British Royal Air Force aircraft and released on Tuesday show the magnitude of the monstrous, 4,200-square-kilometer iceberg, its surface carved with tunnels, cracks and fissures. A number of smaller ice chunks can be seen floating nearby. 
""The sheer size of the A68a iceberg means it is impossible to capture its entirety in one single shot,"" British officials said in a statement. 
Scientists fear that the iceberg, in hitting the island, could crush marine life on the sea floor. Should it lodge at the island's flank, it could block penguins and seals off from their normal forage routes to feed their young. 

A68a could also be an obstacle to government ships conducting fishery patrols and surveillance around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, British officials said.

1391,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>",Majority in Swedish parliament backs 'NATO option' after Sweden Democrats shift,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Swedish parliamentary majority in favour of readiness to join NATO as a possible security policy option has emerged for the first time after the far-right Sweden Democrats party shifted position on the military alliance. 
However, the government, which decides foreign and security policies, remained opposed to adopting such a ""NATO option"".
The introduction of a ""NATO option"" would not mean Sweden would apply for membership of the U.S.-led Western alliance but rather that Sweden would consider it down the road if deemed necessary for security. 
The Sweden Democrats, better known for their anti-immigrant positions, said they still oppose NATO membership as such, but now favour taking on such an option in order to align Swedish defence policy with the ""NATO option"" stance of neighbouring fellow Nordic state Finland. 
""We have long advocated entering into a defence alliance with Finland and are now taking a decisive step in that direction,"" Sweden Democrat party leader Jimmie Akesson said in a commentary published by the Aftonbladet daily.
""With Sweden announcing a so-called NATO option, like Finland, we strengthen security in our immediate region."" 
Fellow Nordic nations Norway, Denmark and Iceland are NATO members.
Parliament's defence and foreign affairs committee decided on Wednesday to call on the government in the legislature next week to add a NATO option to security policy, Sweden Democrats parliamentarian Roger Richthoff said.
Four parties in parliament expressly back Sweden joining NATO, though not the minority ruling coalition comprised of the Social Democrats and Greens.
Foreign Minister Ann Linde (NYSE:LIN) of the Social Democrats told TT news agency the government had no such plans. ""These kinds of sudden changes based on fairly weak majorities, it's not good. It undermines the credibility of Swedish security policy.""
The government remains convinced that the nation is best served by independence from alliances and that this contributes to security in northern Europe, she added.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, now with 30 members, was founded in 1949 to confront the threat of the communist Soviet Union, which broke up in 1991. 

Post-Soviet Russia has accused NATO of fostering instability in Europe. Some analysts say that by remaining outside NATO, Sweden feels safer from Moscow. Sweden was also neutral during World War Two and was not invaded by Nazi Germany.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's lower house of parliament gave the go-ahead on Wednesday for Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to approve a contested reform of the euro zone's bailout fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), at an EU summit on Dec. 10-11.
Last week some 60 rebels from the co-ruling 5-Star Movement, which has always opposed the reform, threatened to vote against the government, leaving it potentially vulnerable in Wednesday's votes in both houses of parliament.
However, coalition negotiations produced a resolution which most 5-Star deputies agreed to, authorising Conte to approve the ESM changes while pursuing other reforms of EU financial management aimed at overturning austerity.
At the end of a heated debate the Chamber of Deputies approved the resolution by 314 votes to 239.
The more eagerly awaited vote in the upper chamber, the Senate, where Conte normally has a much slimmer majority, will be held after 1700 GMT on Wednesday. Assuming the government wins it, Conte will sign off on the revamped ESM at the summit.
The reform, which Italy has held up for months due to 5-Star's resistance, must then be ratified by national parliaments before it comes into force on Jan. 1, 2022.
CLIMBDOWN
The resolution approved by the Chamber is a climbdown for 5-Star, which has always presented the ESM as a pernicious instrument for enforcing what it sees as outdated euro zone austerity rules, and argued that the reform only made it worse.
""We have to say clearly this is not a vote to activate the ESM and it's not a vote to ratify the reform... It is a vote to give a full (negotiating) mandate to the prime minister,"" 5-Star deputy Filippo Scerra told the Chamber.
Claudio Borghi, speaking for the right-wing League, the main opposition party, said Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri could eventually be prosecuted for betraying the national interest by pursuing the ESM reform without a parliamentary mandate.
He goaded 5-Star's deputies who had always opposed the reform along with the League, saying they had the opportunity to be ""patriots"" but ""from today will be seen as traitors"".
Proponents of the reform stress that it would allow the ESM to act as a financial backstop for another EU kitty, The Single Resolution Fund, set up to help failing banks.
However, 5-Star is concerned about other aspects, such as a greater role for the ESM in assessing the debt repayment capacity of countries that use the fund and in overseeing the reform programmes they must undertake. These tasks are performed jointly with the European Commission.
Above all, 5-Star opposes a change stipulating that bonds issued by euro zone states from 2022 have conditions attached that would make debt restructuring easier and more orderly.

Critics say this will also make restructuring more likely, hitting Italian savers and investors who hold most of the country's sovereign debt, which amounts to around 160% of gross domestic product.

EU foreign ministers said on Monday Turkey had failed to help end a row with Greece and Cyprus over potential gas resources in the eastern Mediterranean, but they left a decision on sanctions for a summit of EU leaders that starts on Thursday.
NATO ally Turkey has been at odds with EU members Greece and Cyprus over the extent of their continental shelves in the east Mediterranean. Tensions flared in August when Turkey sent its Oruc Reis survey vessel to waters claimed by Greece.
""The EU has never acted honestly, it has never kept its promises (towards Turkey). But... we have always been patient. We are still being patient,"" Erdogan told reporters ahead of a visit to Azerbaijan,
""Any sanctions decision that can be taken against Turkey do not concern us much,"" Erdogan said, adding that Greece had ""run"" from negotiations with Turkey despite agreeing to resume talks over their conflicting maritime claims.
""On the eastern Mediterranean, we will continue to protect whatever our rights there are,"" he said. ""It is never possible for us to compromise here. But if Greece really acts honestly as a neighbour, we will continue to be available at the table.""
After withdrawing the Oruc Reis vessel for what it said was maintenance ahead of a previous EU summit in October, Ankara redeployed it shortly after, citing unsatisfactory results from the summit. It withdrew the vessel again last week.
The chair of EU summits, Charles Michel, has warned Turkey not to play ""cat and mouse"" by withdrawing ships before EU summits, only to redeploy them afterwards.

France, with support from the European Parliament, is leading the EU push for sanctions. On Monday Erdogan said Turkey would not ""bow down to threats and blackmail"", though he also repeated his call for dialogue.

(Reuters) - Shortly before school began in September, administrators in Schenectady, New York, laid off more than 400 teachers, aides and other employees -- roughly one out of every five school workers.
Now teachers in this aging industrial city outside Albany must handle classes of up to 32 students, with few aides to help. Pre-kindergarten has been canceled and high school is taught entirely online. A support program for kids who often come to school hungry and unwashed has been eliminated. 
""Our poor kids are suffering, and we really don't know who to blame,"" said Carol Mould, who quit her job as a nurse to supervise her 6-year old and 9-year-old boys. 
With budgets battered by the coronavirus pandemic, state and local governments across the United States have laid off nearly 700,000 workers this year, according to U.S. government data, equal to 8.4% of the workforce. Advocates warn that Schenectady's experience could become commonplace if Washington does not provide more help. 
""Some people say that maybe we're just the canary in the coal mine,"" said schools Superintendent Aaron Bochniak.
Congress approved $280 billion in state and local aid in March, but has been deadlocked since then, with some Republicans objecting to aid for what they view as free-spending local and state governments. Lawmakers are scrambling to pass some form of coronavirus stimulus in a year-end spending package, though it is not clear if it will include school aid.
Declining tax revenues and additional costs due to the pandemic, such as buying laptops for students who need them to work from home, will amount to a nationwide educational shortfall of up to $246 billion, or 18% of projected spending, over the next two years, according to Michael Griffith, a senior researcher at the Learning Policy Institute. 
RAINY-DAY FUNDS RUNNING DRY
States have been able to cover much of the gap so far by tapping rainy-day funds using onetime budget maneuvers. That probably won't be possible next year. 
""Everything you can do to cushion the blow as a state has been done at this point,"" Griffith said. 
At least 14 states cut education spending this year in response to the COVID-19 crisis, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Some communities, like Littleton, Colorado, voted to raise property taxes to offset state cuts. Others, from Vancouver, Washington to Frederick County, Maryland, have handed out hundreds of pink slips.
In New York, the state government reduced school payments by 20% in July, August and September, and warned it might have to extend those cuts through the school year. So far, it has not done so. 
Because that aid is tilted toward poorer schools, affluent areas have been less affected.
The whiter, wealthier suburbs outside Schenectady boosted school budgets by 2% over the summer, in line with previous years. 
In Schenectady, a former manufacturing hub of 66,000 people, the city government raised property taxes and trash-collection fees. The school board laid off 423 teachers, janitors and other workers.
Many students were already struggling before the pandemic. Only 16% of grade schoolers were found to be proficient in math in 2019, one-third the statewide average. 
State aid accounts for 69% of the school budget, and officials decided they needed to slash costs immediately.
Layoffs fell most heavily on the social workers and teachers' aides who had been hired to support students who were struggling with academic or behavior problems -- a reflection, educators say, of difficult home lives in a city where nearly one in five households lives in poverty. 
Those students are now more likely to fall behind, officials say. ""It's an awful thing as a school community to grapple and deal with,"" said Bochniak, the superintendent.
Because state aid is partially determined by a district's overall budget, this year's could lead to lower levels of state aid for years to come. 
In Schenectady, those laid off in September are trying to move on with their lives. Social worker Lindsey Esposito has found work elsewhere, but says she worries that her former students are not getting the help they need.

""These kids are struggling. They were struggling before COVID, and everybody looks past them,"" she said. ""You get frustrated about it, but you just figure you've got to move on.""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Mining giant Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) Ltd should pay restitution to Indigenous Australians affected by its destruction of two ancient rock shelters to expand an iron ore mine, an inquiry panel said on Wednesday. 
The panel released an interim report in which it also recommended Rio Tinto should fully reconstruct the rock shelters in Western Australia's Pilbara region at its own expense, and laid out broader industry guidance that included reviewing consent practices and a moratorium on mining in the affected places. 
The inquiry did not spell out what, if any, financial compensation Rio Tinto should pay to the traditional owners as part of a negotiated restitution package. But it said the agreement should include keeping places where artefacts and other material could be stored and displayed for their benefit.
The parliamentary inquiry into the legal destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelter in May held 13 public hearings, and received more than 140 submissions from miners, heritage specialists and Aboriginal and civil society groups. 
The committee now aims to finish its report in the second half of 2021, once it has heard testimony from other states after COVID-19-related disruptions. 
The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people whose lands were impacted said in statement they hoped the inquiry's findings prompted a ""fundamental reset"" of the sector, particularly in the relationships between traditional owners and miners. 
While it had started the long road to healing and repairing its relationship with Rio, ""there is still a long way to go,"" it added. ""Rio Tinto now needs to turn its words into actions.""
The inquiry has sparked some industry change, with miners reviewing processes and their relationships with traditional owners of the land on which they operate.
But there is room for more, the inquiry found.
While castigating Rio for its failures, the inquiry said the company could yet ""re-establish itself as a leader"" if it followed best practice, particularly around consent. 
In a statement, Rio Tinto reiterated its apology, set out reforms it has made to its practices, and said that it was pushing hard to remedy the destruction that caused significant pain to the PKKP. 
Rio is expected to announce its new chief executive any day, after Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other senior leaders agreed to step down in August due to the procedural failings it found led to the disaster and the way it was initially managed. 
Even if Rio did have to pay some compensation, in the context of its $123 billion valuation, the amount was not likely to be material, said Glyn Lawcock of UBS.
Still, recommendations to overhaul legislation could result in delays to industry mine expansion plans in the years ahead, Lawcock added.
West Australia's outdated Aboriginal heritage laws that favour development are under review and not expected to be considered by lawmakers until next year. 
Until they are reformed, in the absence of clear consent of traditional owners, all miners should hold off new applications that would damage Aboriginal heritage sites, the inquiry said. 
Australia should also set down laws to ensure no 'gag' clauses can be stitched into agreements that restrict Indigenous people from objecting to development on their land, it said. 

""The ultimate cause of the destruction of the caves was that insufficient value has been placed on the preservation of Indigenous culture and heritage — a living culture with a timeless heritage,"" the inquiry found. ""That must change.""

1405,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 05:01AM ET</span>",Pakistani film explores social media's role in anger over blasphemy,"By Umar Farooq
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The creator of an animated film on blasphemy in Pakistan is hoping it will prompt discussion on tolerance at a time that rights advocates say hate speech on social media is increasingly triggering violence.
The short film ""Swipe"" is about a boy obsessed with a hypothetical smartphone app that allows people to vote on whether someone should be killed for blasphemy and offers a glimpse of a stark future of what rights groups say is a worrisome present.
""The screen is what alienates people and what they say through a screen they probably wouldn’t say to another person in front of them,” Arafat Mazhar, the director of the 14-minute animated film, told Reuters.
Blasphemy is a crime in Pakistan and officially carries the death penalty. While no executions for blasphemy have been carried out, enraged mobs sometimes kill people accused of it.
Rights groups say the blasphemy law is often exploited to settle scores and increasingly it is accusations made on social media that have triggered violence.
The film, produced by a studio in the city of Lahore and released last month, shows what could happen if people could see photos of those accused of blasphemy on an app, and then had the option of swiping right to condemn them to death or left to forgive them.
If at least 10,000 people condemn someone, then members of the public go and kill them. 
The boy protagonist scans the app checking out the accused, including a man who did not forward a religious message on social media and women accused of wearing too much perfume or being immodestly dressed.
Driven to score ""points"" on the app and enraged by the accusations, the boy goes on a right-swiping spree and in the frenzy accuses his own father of blasphemy.
RISK
Mazhar hopes the film should make people think about rash accusations. But taking a critical view, or even just questioning the blasphemy law, carries huge risk.
In 2011, the governor of Punjab, Pakistan's largest province, Salman Taseer was shot dead by one of his police guards after he spoke out in defence of a Christian woman, Asia, Bibi, accused of blasphemy.
The guard, Mumtaz Qadri, was lionised by many and his arrest, sentencing and later execution lead to an outpouring of anger and even violence at huge protests.
Bibi spent eight years on death row. She eventually had to flee Pakistan after the Supreme Court acquitted her.
Mazhar says he wants to connect with the sort of ordinary people who hailed Qadri as a hero.
""I've been surrounded by people from the religious conservative community growing up,” Mazhar said. 
""I've seen them as kind, compassionate people but with tendencies to endorse and empathize with people like Mumtaz Qadri from time to time, and it's a very difficult process to try and empathize with these people but I have no choice, I have to relate to my own community.” 
The film comes as cases of violence triggered by online accusations are becoming all too common.
""It's happening almost every day,” Hassan Baloch, a researcher with the hate-speech monitoring group Bytes 4 All, told Reuters. 
""What begins online is being translated offline, often in violent and dangerous ways."" 
In July, a teenager shot and killed a U.S. citizen of Pakistani origin in a court where he was on trial after being accused of posting blasphemous messages.
In August, police filed a blasphemy case against an actor and singer over a music video they shot in a mosque after social media outrage.

The same month, hundreds of people, most of them members of the Shiite minority, were arrested after complaints of blasphemy were posted on social media.

China has approved three vaccine candidates developed by Sinovac and state-owned Sinopharm for emergency use.
Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine, doing so before large-scale trials were complete, stirring concern among scientists and doctors about the safety and efficacy of the shot. 
The Russian vaccine Sputnik V is being developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Research Institute and marketed by Russia's sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). 
Cooke said the agency was not under any pressure to accelerate procedures to authorise the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech or one by  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA). 
""If anything, the pressure is scientific, because we want to be certain to do what is best for citizens"" she said, adding that EMA acted independently.
She said the agency was still expecting to complete its review of the Pfizer and BioNTEch vaccine by Dec. 29 and to finalise its review of the Moderna vaccine by Jan. 12. 

The European Union Commission authorises vaccines based on EMA's scientific advice after consultation with the 27 EU states.

The list from Xinjiang's Aksu prefecture, obtained by HRW, is of detainees flagged by a Chinese predictive policing programme, called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), which collects data and identifies candidates for detention.
The list from 2018 includes the names of Xinjiang Uighurs, phone numbers and reasons for detention in China's camp system, including studying the Koran, wearing religious clothing or travelling internationally. 
""The Aksu list is the first time we have seen the IJOP in action in detaining people,"" said HRW's Maya Wang. 
It ""provides further insights into how China's brutal repression of Xinjiang's Turkic Muslims is being turbocharged by technology"", she said.
Human Rights Watch did not identify the source of the list, citing the person's safety. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the list. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, asked about the group's report at a daily briefing in Beijing, said it was not worth refuting. Human Rights Watch was ""full of bias"", Zhao said.
U.N. experts and advocates say at least a million ethnic Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim and speak a Turkic language, have been detained at some point in Xinjiang camps.
China maintains that the heavily guarded centres are educational and vocational institutes, and that all the people who attended have ""graduated"" and gone home. Access to the camps is restricted and it is not possible to independently verify whether all the camps have closed.
Human Rights Watch said it was able to confirm the identities of people on the list with Uighurs now living abroad, including the identification of 18 members of the same family.
The rights group said the list is further evidence that the government selected Xinjiang Uighurs for detention based on religion, personal relationships, contact with overseas relatives and even age. 

Other reasons for detention listed include activities like repeatedly switching off a smartphone, having ""unstable thoughts"" or ""being generally untrustworthy"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - A senior U.S. envoy on Wednesday said the trust and alliance between Washington and Seoul will remain firm regardless of the upcoming change in administrations, South Korea's foreign ministry said.
The remarks came as the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, who helped lead unsuccessful efforts to turn U.S. President Donald Trump's personal outreach to North Korea into progress in denuclearisation talks, met with South Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Choi Jong-kun. 
Choi asked Biegun to play a bridging role to ensure the achievements the two allies have made together make progress before President-elect Joe Biden takes office next month.
Choi said the two allies have made significant achievements in the past three years under South Korean President Moon Jae-in, in building peace on the Korean peninsula, cooperation in COVID-19 responses, and relocation of U.S. military installations in South Korea.
Neither side publicly mentioned an ongoing multi-billion dollar dispute between the two allies over how much Seoul should pay toward maintaining the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops on the peninsula.
Biegun also met with South Korea's chief nuclear negotiator Lee Do-hoon to discuss North Korea's denuclearisation issues, the U.S. embassy in Seoul said in a Twitter post.
Biegun is also scheduled to meet a number of South Korean officials, including the foreign minister and the minister of unification, who handles relations with North Korea.
The visit may be the last for Biegun in his current role, after Trump lost his bid for re-election to Democratic challenger Biden, who will take office in January.
While Biegun has said he is ready for discussions at any time, North Korea says it won't return to the negotiating table until the United States drops its hostile policies.
The visit comes as North Korea lashed out at South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha for casting doubt over its claim that there were no coronavirus outbreaks there, warning of consequences for her ""impudent"" comment.

Farmers have been demonstrating for two weeks against the deregulation that will allow them to sell produce to buyers beyond government-regulated wholesale markets, where growers are assured a minimum price.
Small growers fear the change, part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s liberalising reforms, will mean the end of price support for staples such as wheat and rice and leave them at the mercy of big business.
The government is set to discuss the laws on Wednesday, sources said, with hopes that an offer of amendments to the legislation will end the opposition.
""We're open to amendments but a complete withdrawal of the laws is just plain impossible,"" said a senior government official in the agriculture ministry in New Delhi, who declined to be identified.
Talks between leaders of farmers' unions and the government officials have failed to break the deadlock with the farmers demanding the complete rollback of the reforms.
Hannan Mollah, the general secretary of All India Kisan Sabha (All India Farmers' Union), said his members would discuss intensifying their campaign of opposition.

Modi's government is facing criticism from opposition parties that have criticised the reform as a boon for big business but a disaster for India's traditional agricultural markets.

1414,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 01:01AM ET</span>",Ethiopia's war risks leaving manufacturing dreams in tatters,"By Ruma Paul, Anna Ringstrom and Joe Bavier
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - When Bangladeshi textile firm DBL set up shop in Ethiopia two years ago, the African nation was the garment industry's bright new frontier, boasting abundant cheap labour and a government keen to woo companies with tax breaks and cheap loans.
Last month, as fighting raged in the northern Tigray region, DBL's compound was rocked by an explosion that blasted out the factory's windows, radically altering its business calculus. 
""All we could do was to pray out loud,"" said Adbul Waseq, an official at the company, which makes clothes mainly for Swedish fashion giant H&M and is one of at least three foreign garment makers to have suspended operations in Tigray.
""We could have died,"" Waseq told Reuters.
For over a decade, Ethiopia has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure such as hydro-electric dams, railways, roads as well as industrial parks in an ambitious bid to transform the poor, mainly agrarian nation into a manufacturing powerhouse. 
By 2017, it was the world's fastest growing economy. 
A year later, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took office, pledging to loosen the state's grip on an economy with over 100 million people and liberalise sectors such as telecoms, fuelling something akin to glasnost-era headiness among investors.
But for two years Ethiopia has been pummelled by challenges: ethnic clashes, floods, locust swarms and coronavirus lockdowns. 
Now, fighting which erupted on Nov. 4 between the army and forces loyal to Tigray's former ruling party, and fears it could signal a period of prolonged unrest, have served investors with a harsh reality check.
Any hesitation by investors could spell trouble as the country's manufacturing export push isn't yet generating enough foreign currency either to pay for all the country's imports or keep pace with rising debt service costs. Even before the pandemic, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had warned that Ethiopia was at high risk of debt distress.
Abiy's government said that, amid the crises it's facing, Ethiopia was pushing ahead with reforms that will build the foundations for a modern economy. 
""Despite the unprecedented shock from COVID and continued insecurity in different parts of the country, the Ethiopian economy showed remarkable resilience,"" Mamo Mihretu, senior policy adviser in the prime minister's office, told Reuters.

PRODUCTION SUSPENDED
Ethiopia is a relatively small textiles producer with exports in 2016 of just $94 million compared with $29 billion for Vietnam and $253 billion for China in the same year, World Bank trade data showed. Its top exports are agricultural, such as coffee, tea, spices, oil seeds, plants and flowers.
But Ethiopia's push into the textile industry over the past 10 years has been emblematic of its manufacturing ambitions.
As fighting neared Tigray's regional capital, Mekelle, textile companies began shutting down and pulling out staff.
""It seemed that the conflict was getting closer to the city, and our worry was that we wouldn't be able to leave,"" Cristiano Frati, an electrician evacuated from a factory run by Italian hosiery chain Calzedonia, told an Italian newspaper.
Calzedonia said on Nov. 13 it had suspended operations at the plant, which employs about 2,000 people, due to the conflict. It has declined to comment further. 
DBL, meanwhile, has flown its foreign staff out of Ethiopia. 
""Everything has become uncertain,"" its managing director M.A. Jabbar said. ""When will the war end?"" 
Another foreign company, Velocity Apparelz Companies - a supplier to H&M and Children's Place (NASDAQ:PLCE) - has also temporarily shut down, a company official told Reuters.
H&M said it was ""very concerned"" and was closely monitoring the situation.
""We have three suppliers in Tigray, and the production there has come to a halt,"" the company told Reuters, emphasising that it would continue to source from Ethiopia where it has about 10 suppliers in total.
Indochine Apparel, a Chinese firm that supplies  Levi Strauss & Co  (NYSE:LEVI), said its operations in the Hawassa industrial park in the south of the country were unaffected.
Levi Strauss said it was monitoring the situation and confirmed there had been no impact on its supply chain so far.
'NOT A PRETTY PICTURE'
Ethiopia's apparel sector was struggling even before the fighting in Tigray because of the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Some facilities did not survive the collapse in orders while others slashed wages or laid off staff.
The malaise has not been limited to the garment sector.
Even before the conflict, insurance companies underwriting political risk had stopped providing cover beyond Ethiopia's northern Amhara region and the federal capital Addis Ababa, a risk consultant who advises corporate clients said.
""Ethiopia is not a pretty picture right now,"" he said. 
Like most sources contacted by Reuters, the consultant asked not to be named, fearing a backlash from government authorities.
Abiy's efforts to ease a repressive political climate had already uncorked ethnic clashes before the war in Tigray. Violence in other parts of the country which intensified in 2019 had disrupted projects, notably in agriculture.
""The fighting started around the time we were going to start planting,"" said the head of an agri-industry project that was forced to delay its investment last year. 
Swedish furniture giant IKEA opened a purchasing office in Ethiopia last year. However, it closed it down in September after shelving plans to source from the country due to the political and social situation, COVID-19 and changes to the cotton market in Africa, the company told Reuters.
Meanwhile, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, a bottling partner of the Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), told Reuters that the fighting in Tigray, which accounts for about 20% of its sales volumes in Ethiopia, had halted business there. 
That comes on the heels of delays in the construction of two new bottling plants - part of a $300 million five-year investment plan announced last year - due to the pandemic and an excise tax increase.

https://graphics.reuters.com/ETHIOPIA-CONFLICT/DASHED-PROMISE/gjnpwkgzepw/chart.png
'FEW WAYS OUT'
With the fall of Mekelle at the end of last month, Abiy declared victory over Tigray's former ruling party (TPLF).
""The swift, decisive, and determined completion of the active phase of the military operation means any lingering concerns about political uncertainty by the investment community will be effectively settled,"" Abiy's adviser Mamo said.
The TPLF has vowed to fight on. 
For the government, there is little margin for error. Ethiopia's external debt has ballooned five-fold over the past decade as the government borrowed heavily - notably from China - to pay for infrastructure and industrial parks. 
Foreign direct investment inflows, meanwhile, have declined steadily since a 2016 peak of more than $4 billion, slipping to about $500 million for the first quarter of this fiscal year.
Inflation is hovering around 20%. 
""There are very few ways out of this. They aren't going to get more money from the IMF. They can't go to the markets. Their best bet is a global economic recovery next year,"" said Menzi Ndhlovu, senior country and political risk analyst at Signal Risk, an Africa-focused business consultancy.
Still, Ethiopia passed a landmark investment law earlier this year and implemented currency reforms.
And the government is pushing ahead its plans to open up the telecommunications sector. It opened tendering for two new telecoms licences at the end of November and plans to sell off a minority stake in state-owned Ethio Telecom.
Sources following the process, which should provide the beleaguered economy with a hefty injection of dollars, said interested companies were not deterred by the current unrest.
But for now, Ethiopia's grand manufacturing dreams have been dealt a setback.

""Who will go there in this situation?"" asked DBL's Waseq, who has returned to Bangladesh. ""No one.""

1415,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 09, 2020 12:45AM ET</span>","In conservative Indonesia, a gay ex-policeman takes his battle to court","By Stanley Widianto
JAKARTA (Reuters) - The first gay Indonesian policeman to sue the conservative country's police force for wrongful dismissal due to sexual orientation was back in courts this week, determined to be reinstated.
Tri Teguh Pujianto, a 31-year-old former police brigadier was fired in 2018 after 10 years on the job, after police in a different town apprehended him and his partner on Valentine's Day when they were saying goodbyes at his partner's workplace.
The landmark case in the world's largest Muslim-majority nation was initially thrown out last year after a judge told Teguh he had to wait until the police internal appeals process was completed. That is now over and Teguh refiled his suit in August in what rights groups say is the first case of its kind.
""This is my fight, my last-ditch effort,"" Teguh told Reuters. 
""Why won't they judge my service for all those years? Why exaggerate my mistakes, which I don't think were mistakes anyway?""
With the exception of sharia-ruled Aceh province where same-sex relations are banned, homosexuality is not illegal in Indonesia although it is generally considered a taboo subject.
The Southeast Asian country is, however, becoming less tolerant of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community as some Indonesian politicians become more vocal about having Islam play a larger role in the state.
A survey by the Pew Research Center this year also showed that 80% of Indonesians believe homosexuality ""should not be accepted by society"".
Discrimination and violent attacks against LGBT people have increased in recent years and police have prosecuted members of the community using anti-pornography and other laws. Lawmakers from four political parties this year have also been trying to garner support, so far unsuccessfully, to pass a bill requiring LGBT people to seek treatment at rehabilitation centres.
The Central Java police have accused Teguh of violating ""ethical codes of the national police… by the deviant act of having same-sex intercourse,"" a court document shows.
Teguh's legal team said they are challenging what they call the ""elastic"" nature of the police code of conduct given there is no mention of sexual orientation in police regulations. 
Representatives for the Central Java Police, National Police and the National Police Commission did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
Dede Oetomo, a gay scholar who runs the advoacy group GAYa NUSANTARA, said Teguh had made history, whether he wins his case or not.
""He's broken the mould because he's brave,"" he said. ""My hope is that more activists will emerge from cases like his.""
Teguh now runs a barber shop, a side business that he started in 2013. He said he's always had the support of family and his friends in the force for his efforts to regain what has been his dream job since high school.
Asked why he is persevering, Teguh said he was fighting not only for himself.

""I want to fight for basic human rights, so there will no longer be arbitrary actions taken against minorities,"" he said.

The eruption on White Island, also known by its Maori name of Whakaari, left nearly all survivors struggling with severe and long-term injuries.
""In a nation that has experienced so much pain and loss in recent times, 9th December 2019 was devastating,"" Ardern said at a commemoration event in Whakatane, a town close to the island.
She sent a message of love to survivors and affected families and thanked the first responders and medical professionals who helped.
There were 47 people on the island when the volcano erupted at 2:11 p.m., exploding twice in quick succession and spewing plumes of ash up to 12,000 feet into the air.
The majority were tourists from countries like Australia, the United States, Britain, China, Germany and Malaysia who were on the Royal Caribbean’s Ovation of the Seas cruise ship that was travelling around New Zealand.
The volcano, which had been marketed as ""the world's most accessible active marine volcano"", had shown signs of unrest for several weeks before the eruption. 
New Zealand's workplace regulator last month filed charges against 13 parties, who it said had not met health and safety obligations in taking the tourists to White island. The island has been shut to tourists since the eruption.
Of the 22 who died, 17 were Australians.
""Together with many others in Australia and New Zealand, my colleagues and I across the Australian Government honour the memory of those who were lost in the disaster, and reflect on the resilience of those who survived and of their families,"" Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.
Video messages from families who could not make it to the commemoration event due to COVID-19 restrictions were also played.
Avey Woods, the mother of New Zealand tour guide Hayden Marshall-Inman who was killed on the island, said she still waits for text messages from her son.
""I won't lie, it's extremely hard, you can be at the shop and suddenly you're full of tears. All our family has been torn apart, everybody has been torn apart through this,"" she said.

The 24-year old activist was jailed on Dec. 2 along with Joshua Wong for their roles in an unlawful rally near police headquarters in 2019, the toughest and most high-profile sentencing of opposition figures this year.
Chow's hearing came after around 16 activists were arrested since Monday, part of a relentless crackdown on opposition forces in the Chinese-ruled city.
Critics say Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government is curtailing opposition and wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed after the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, a charge authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong reject. 
Chow, along with Wong and Nathan Law, founded the now-disbanded democracy group Demosisto in 2016. The party was dissolved hours after Beijing passed a contentious national security law for the city on June 30 amid fears it could be targeted under the legislation.
Chow was also arrested in August under the new security legislation on suspicion of “colluding with foreign forces,” but is yet to face any charges.

Under the national security law, Beijing punishes what it broadly defines as sedition, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.

The opposition accuses police chief and deputy security minister Mauricio Arriaza of failing to make Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya comply with a lawmakers' order to give account of the government's spending during the coronavirus pandemic.
Opposition lawmakers had ordered prosecutors to investigate Arriaza, prompting Bukele in October to name him deputy security minister to confer on him immunity from prosecution.
Lawmakers were about to vote to strip Arriaza of immunity when he announced his resignation as deputy security minister. 
He remains chief of police, but his loss of immunity increases the pressure on the government to open up about its spending and weakens the authority of a key ally of Bukele.
The opposition argues Bukele's government has made unlawful use of public funds in the crisis, allegations that he denies.
On Twitter, Bukele celebrated the fact that Arriaza had denied the opposition-controlled national assembly the chance to take away his immunity. But his resignation is still a blow against Bukele in his ongoing disputes with lawmakers.
Arriaza would now face ""common justice"", Bukele said, noting that that was ""no guarantee"" of a fair trial either.

Lawyers for Arriaza confirmed his resignation and rejected the accusation against him.

Chinese authorities, citing the risk of the coronavirus, blocked access by Canadian diplomats for many months. Barton said he was allowed virtual visits in October after months of pressure and also spoke to the two individually last month.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president is expected to congratulate U.S. President-elect Joe Biden next week on his victory once it is certified, three officials told Reuters, after weeks of waiting that have upset allies of the incoming U.S. leader.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is among a handful of world leaders yet to recognize Biden's election victory over Republican President Donald Trump, including Russia's Vladimir Putin and Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro.
Lopez Obrador aims to send Biden his congratulations the day after the U.S. Electoral College on Dec. 14 votes to certify the election, the government sources said.
The Electoral College vote has historically been a formality. This year it took on outsized importance after Trump and his lawyers sought to overturn Biden's win with unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. 
Judges dismissed those claims time and again due to lack of evidence.
Biden, a Democratic former vice president and long-time senator, will formally assume the presidency on Jan. 20.
Roberto Velasco, a senior Mexican diplomat responsible for North America, went to Washington last week and held meetings aimed at making inroads with Biden's Democrats, according to two other sources with knowledge of the visit.
Velasco did not hold formal meetings with Biden transition officials, one of the sources said. A Democratic congressional aide confirmed that he had met with Velasco.
Among major bilateral issues for Mexico as it seeks to engage the new Democratic administration will be immigration, trade and the environment, the source said. 
Lopez Obrador's office and the foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the plans or Velasco's visit.
In a newspaper column referring to the visit published on Tuesday, Velasco wrote that he met with Senate and House of Representatives advisors on the foreign relations committees. He did not mention the transition or Biden.
Since taking office two years ago, Lopez Obrador has sought to build a constructive relationship with Trump, who angered many in Mexico during his 2015-16 presidential campaign by labeling Mexican migrants rapists and drug runners.
As president, the Mexican leftist has gone out of his way to avoid confrontation with Trump, in marked contrast to his time in opposition, when he likened the American's migration policies to Adolf Hitler's treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany.
Trump last year threatened to slap tariffs on all Mexican exports if Lopez Obrador did not stem the flow of mostly Central American migrants headed to the U.S. border.
In response, Mexico deployed tens of thousands of national guard troopers to its northern and southern borders. Since then political tensions and migrant crossings have lessened.
Mexican officials say Lopez Obrador has held back from recognizing Biden's victory amid Trump's claims of fraud to avoid provoking the departing U.S. president.

Friction has risen between the two countries in recent weeks following the October arrest and subsequent release of Mexico’s former defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos. In a retaliatory move that could be an early test for diplomacy under Biden, Lopez Obrador has sent a bill to Congress aimed at tightening up the rules of how foreign agents, such as those from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, operate in Mexico.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",Leading cardinal says Church needs rules on status of ex popes,"By Philip Pullella
ROME (Reuters) - Cardinal George Pell, a leading Roman Catholic conservative, said the Vatican needs clear rules to govern the status of future popes who resign rather than rule for life and that such a move would help Church unity.
Pell is one of the highest-ranking Church figures to speak publicly on the need for rules since 2013, when former Pope Benedict, 93, became the first pontiff in 700 years to abdicate.
Church law says a pope can resign, as long as he does so willingly and not under pressure, but it lacks specific rules on his status, title, and prerogatives.
""The protocols on the situation of a pope who has resigned need to be clarified, to strengthen the forces for unity,"" Pell, 79, writes in his book, ""Prison Journal"", which is being published this month and recounts 13 months he spent in solitary confinement.
Pell, who has always maintained his innocence, was cleared of sex abuse charges in his native Australia in April and has returned to Rome. He was Vatican treasurer until 2018. 
Since stepping down, Benedict has occasionally allowed his views on specific subjects to be aired outside the Vatican, to the joy of some fellow conservatives who have used them as ammunition to contest his successor Pope Francis' more open-minded and inclusive papacy.
""While the retired pope could retain the title of 'pope emeritus', he should be re-nominated to the College of Cardinals so that he is known as 'Cardinal X, Pope Emeritus', he should not wear the white papal soutane (cassock) and should not teach publicly,"" Pell writes. 
Days before Benedict abdicated on Feb. 28, 2013, he scripted his own rules, investing himself with the title pope emeritus, deciding to continue to wear white and to live in the Vatican.
But his presence has caused some confusion among the faithful, with some extreme right-wing conservatives still refusing to recognise Francis as pope.
""There is only one pope,"" Pell said in a wide-ranging 90-minute interview with Reuters late on Monday in his Rome apartment across the street from a Vatican gate.
In the book, Pell writes that ""probably the measures would be best introduced by a pope who had no surviving predecessor"". That means that in the present Vatican situation, Francis would have to wait until after Benedict dies.
Others have suggested that since a pope is also the bishop of Rome, a former pontiff should be called 'bishop emeritus of Rome'.
He would then be subject to the same written rules, last updated in 2004, that cover retired bishops.

Those rules say any bishop emeritus ""will want to avoid every attitude and relationship that could even hint at some kind of parallel authority to that of the diocesan bishop, with damaging consequences for the pastoral life and unity of the diocesan community"".

In light of the panel's finding, over a dozen commanders have been suspended or relieved and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy said he expects to make widespread changes. 
The panel members said the culture at Fort Hood, the largest active duty armored post in the United States, must be changed from top to bottom. 
The panel of five experts was created in July after a series of crimes and deaths, including the murder of Vanessa Guillen, a 20-year-old soldier at the base whose remains were found in June and whose death helped propel the #MeToo movement into the military. 
In September, Fort Hood officials said there had been a record five homicides this year on the base. 
""The murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillen shocked our conscience and brought attention to deeper problems,"" McCarthy said at a news conference announcing the panel's findings. 
Guillen had disappeared from the base in April. Her family said she had complained to them about being sexually harassed before her disappearance, but Army officials say no sexual harassment reports were filed. 
The Guillen family - along with several Latino advocacy groups - insisted on answers, and in response to their pushing, President Donald Trump in July announced the formation of the investigative panel.
The U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command announced on July 1 that one military suspect in Guillen's case had taken his own life in Killeen, Texas, and a civilian suspect had been arrested.
The panel, which said it interviewed over 500 women at Fort Hood, found that only about half of the ""credible accounts"" of sexual assault and harassment that it heard about from those women were ever reported to commanders. 
The reason was a lack of confidence among the women that any action would be taken, the panel said, adding that most were also fearful of retribution. 
""The problems that we saw are cultural,"" said panel member Jack White, an army veteran and Virginia-based lawyer. 
White said that front-line commanders had a lack of deep understanding of the rank and file at the base. A better knowledge would have made them more aware of the severity of the problems on the base and instilled more confidence among enlisted soldiers that their complaints might be taken seriously, he said.
Panel member Jonathan Harmon, a trial lawyer and army veteran, said that he heard repeatedly from platoon sergeants and squad leaders that they did not have time to get to know their soldiers. That meant they did not know of problems facing the soldiers, or even if any had gone missing.

""For those of us who had served in the military before, that was very, very shocking,"" he said.

Iran has blamed Israel for the Nov. 27 killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was seen by Western intelligence services as the mastermind of a covert Iranian nuclear weapons programme. Tehran has long denied any such ambition. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the killing. 
""The perpetrators of this assassination, some of whom have been identified and even arrested by the security services, will not escape justice,"" ISNA quoted adviser Hossein Amir-Abdollahian as telling Iran's Arabic-language Al Alam TV.
""Were the Zionists (Israel) able to do this alone and without the cooperation of, for example, the American (intelligence) service or another service? They certainly could not do that,"" Amir-Abdollahian said.
Iran has given contradictory details of Fakhrizadeh's death in a daytime Nov. 27 ambush on his car on a highway near the capital Tehran.
A senior Revolutionary Guards commander has said the killing was carried out remotely with artificial intelligence and a machine gun equipped with a ""satellite-controlled smart system"".
Witnesses earlier told state television that a truck had exploded before a group of gunmen opened fire on Fakhrizadeh's car. 
Experts and officials told Reuters last week that Fakhrizadeh's killing exposed security gaps that suggest Iran's security forces may have been infiltrated and that the Islamic Republic is vulnerable to further attacks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A United Nations analysis of photos of four anti-tank guided missiles in Libya found that one ""had characteristics consistent with the Iranian-produced Dehlavieh"" missile, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reported to the Security Council.
However, he said in his biannual report - submitted to the council late Monday - that the U.N. secretariat was ""unable to ascertain if this anti-tank guided missile had been transferred to Libya"" in violation of Security Council sanctions on Iran. 
The 15-member council banned weapons exports by Iran in 2007. Under a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and key global powers, which is enshrined in a Security Council resolution, the arms restrictions were lifted in October this year.
Israel accused Iran of violating sanctions and submitted photos of the anti-tank guided missiles in Libya to Guterres in May. Just weeks later, Iran wrote to Guterres and ""categorically rejected"" the Israeli claims as ""totally baseless."" 
Israel said the photos surfaced in November 2019 and that the weapons were being used by militias linked to Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), which has been fighting the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA). 
""Based on the Secretariat's analysis of the photographs provided, the Secretariat established that one of the four anti-tank guided missiles had characteristics consistent with the Iranian-produced Dehlavieh, though no production date for this anti-tank guided missile was visible,"" Guterres' report said.
""The Secretariat is unable to ascertain if this anti-tank guided missile had been transferred to Libya in a manner inconsistent with resolution 2231 (2015),"" the report said. 
Guterres reports twice a year to the Security Council on the implementation of the 2015 resolution. 
Libya has also been subjected to a U.N. arms embargo since 2011. Independent U.N. experts report separately to the Security Council on the implementation of those measures. 
Guterres also told the council that - based on photographic analysis - 476,000 rounds of 7.62mm ammunition, seized by Australian forces in June 2019 in international waters off the Gulf of Oman, did not appear to have been manufactured by Iran.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Farmers' protests against new laws liberalising agricultural markets spread across India on Tuesday, as farm organisations called for a nationwide strike after inconclusive talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
In eastern and western states, farmers blocked roads and squatted on railway tracks, delaying hordes of people getting to work, and preventing perishable produce from reaching markets.
Farmers from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, neighbouring New Delhi, have been at the vanguard of the agitation since last month, and have set up protest camps in and around the capital.
""We will not allow the government to change the rules because they want to hurt farmers' income by filling the pockets of big companies,"" said Gurwinder Singh, a 66-year-old farmer from Punjab, a state known as the food bowl of India.
The reforms enacted in September loosened rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce that have protected farmers from an unfettered free market for decades. 
Assured of floor prices, most currently sell the bulk of their produce at government-controlled wholesale markets, known as mandis.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has said the reforms would not hurt farmers' incomes. More talks between the government and farmer organisations are due on Wednesday.
Home Minister Amit Shah late on Tuesday invited leaders of protesting farmers' unions for talks.
""Most likely, the government on Wednesday will give a written proposal about the likely amendments in the laws. Once we receive the proposals, we will examine them,"" farmers' leader Hanan Molla told reporters after the meeting.
Social media has fanned sympathy for the farmers' cause among the Indian diaspora abroad. During recent days, thousands of people have protested in support of the farmers outside the Indian embassy in central London. 

During the coronavirus pandemic, protest sites around New Delhi have turned into camps, with entire families cooking and sleeping in the open and Sikh religious organisations were providing them with face masks, water and food.

Ruhollah Zam, whose Amadnews social media feed had more than one million followers, was convicted of fomenting violence during anti-government protests in 2017.
The son of a pro-reform Shi'ite cleric, Zam fled Iran and was given asylum in France.
In October 2019, Iran's Revolutionary Guards force said it had trapped Zam in a ""complex operation using intelligence deception"". It did not say where the operation took place.
""Yes, the Supreme Court has upheld the sentence passed by the Revolutionary Court in this case,"" judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili told a news conference streamed on a judiciary website. 
Nour News, a news agency close to the Revolutionary Guards, said on Tuesday: ""After traveling to Iraq in September 2019, he (Zam) was arrested by agents...of the Revolutionary Guards intelligence service and brought to Iran.""
The French foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Rights group Amnesty International strongly criticised the decision.
""Iran's Supreme Court upholding the death sentence of #RouhollahZam, a journalist and dissident, is a shocking escalation in Iran's use of the death penalty as a weapon of repression,"" it said.
Iranian officials have accused arch-foe the United States as well as Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile of fomenting the unrest, which began in late 2017 as protests about economic hardship and spread nationwide.
Officials said 21 people were killed during the unrest and thousands were arrested. The unrest was among the worst Iran has seen in decades, and was followed by even deadlier protests last year against fuel price rises.

Zam's Amadnews feed was suspended by messaging service Telegram in 2018 for fomenting violence but had reappeared under another name.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - A United Nations team visiting refugees in Ethiopia's war-hit Tigray region had failed to stop at two checkpoints when it was shot at over the weekend, the government said on Tuesday, proclaiming it did not need a ""baby-sitter"".
The U.N. security team was seeking access to the Shimelba camp for Eritrean refugees when they were fired at on Sunday. A U.N. spokesman in Nairobi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's army has battled the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) in the northern region since Nov. 4.
Thousands are feared dead and the U.N. estimates that more than 950,000 people have been displaced by the conflict, around 50,000 of them into neighbouring Sudan. The Ethiopian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. estimate.
Redwan Hussein, spokesman for the Ethiopian government's task force for Tigray, told reporters that the U.N. team passed through two checkpoints without stopping while driving hastily to an unauthorized area.
""When they were about to break the third one they were shot at and detained,"" he said. 
Two diplomatic sources told Reuters the U.N. team encountered uniformed Eritrean troops, though both Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied any incursion over the border by President Isaias Afwerki's military.
Abiy and Afwerki signed a peace pact ending two decades of hostilities in 2018 and now regard the TPLF as a mutual foe.
Ethiopia's army has captured the regional capital Mekelle and declared victory, but TPLF leaders say they are fighting back on various fronts around the highland city. 
""There are a few remnants of the militia or special forces not yet controlled ... kind of hooligans, outlaws,"" Redwan said. 
ETHIOPIA: 'WE CALL THE SHOTS'
Most communications in Tigray are down and access to the area is severely restricted, making it hard to verify either side's statements. It was not immediately possible to reach the TPLF for comment on the latest government statements.
The United Nations and aid agencies are pressing for safe access to Tigray, which is home to more than 5 million people and where 600,000 relied on food aid even before the conflict.
""The agreement we entered with the U.N. was in the belief that the U.N. would coordinate with us but the government would call the shots,"" Redwan said, emphasizing that Ethiopia was capable of helping its own people.
He also said the government would investigate any reports of atrocities or mass killings and allow independent probes if needed. ""Ethiopia is being run by a strong functional government,"" he added. ""It doesn't need a babysitter.""
In Mekelle, a doctor reached by Reuters said the hospital where he works was ""totally non-functional"" due to lack of electricity, fuel for generators, oxygen and medical supplies. Medics were unable to perform emergency surgery or effectively treat patients for problems such as childbirth complications and diabetes. 
""Patients are dying outside and inside the hospital,"" he wrote in a message, saying that he was aware of three women who died after delivering babies at home and an infant on a ventilator who died because there was no oxygen.
Ethiopian federal troops were inside the hospital and have not intimidated medical staff or looted, the doctor added.
'PEOPLE CAN NO LONGER WAIT'
The government has said it was delivering aid in areas that it controlled, but relief agencies are increasingly frustrated at the difficult access to Tigray. 
The Norwegian Refugee Council said it had waited weeks for clearance to deliver food, shelters and other essentials.
""Children, women and men in Tigray have now borne the brunt of this conflict for more than a month without any emergency assistance from outside the region,"" it said.
""These people can no longer be made to wait. Aid must not be left at a standstill.""
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it had begun distributing clean water in Mekelle. 
U.N. refugee agency UNHCR voiced concern at reports some among the 96,000 Eritrean refugees in north Ethiopia were fleeing - within Tigray but also to Sudan and other regions of Ethiopia including Amhara and the capital Addis Ababa. 

Many refugees say they have fled repression and forced conscription; Eritrea's government accuses Western powers of smearing it and luring its citizens away.

Venezuela and the United States cut off diplomatic ties last year after the Trump administration, together with dozens of other countries, recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American country's rightful leader, arguing that Maduro had rigged his 2018 re-election. 
Maduro calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to overthrow his government to control the OPEC nation's vast oil resources.
""We hope that once the new government of Joe Biden is installed, that they have time to think, and we hope they open the possibility of dialogue between Venezuela and the United States,"" Maduro told reporters at a news conference from the presidential palace in capital Caracas. 
Maduro said that in early 2017 Delcy Rodriguez - Venezuela's current vice president who was serving as foreign minister at the time - was invited to Trump's inauguration but did not attend because it was ""not convenient."" 
He added that a Trump intermediary later invited him to a meeting with the U.S. president during the United Nations General Assembly in late 2018. Maduro said he was open to the meeting, but that the U.S. ""establishment"" prevented the meeting from happening.
Trump said publicly at the time that he would be open to meeting Maduro, but that no such meeting was on his agenda.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>","U.S. to blacklist Iranian official, university - U.S. official","By Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed terrorism sanctions on Iran's envoy to the Houthis, describing Hasan Irlu's recent dispatch to Yemen as a signal Tehran plans to increase its support to the Houthis and make it harder to resolve the five-year war in the Gulf state.
The U.S. Treasury, confirming a Reuters report, described Irlu as an official of Iran's elite Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and a central element in Tehran's efforts to project its power in Yemen, Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
The Treasury also imposed terrorism-related sanctions on Iran's Al-Mustafa International University, which it said uses its branches around the world as a Quds Force recruitment platform for intelligence collection and operations.
It also blacklisted Yousef Ali Muraj, an Iran-based Pakistani citizen whom the Treasury accused of supporting Quds Force efforts to carry out operations in the Middle East and the United States.
Irlu, Muraj and the university were all targeted under U.S. Executive Order 13224, which allows Washington to block the assets of foreign individuals and entities that commit, or pose a significant risk of committing, acts of terrorism.
The decision to target Irlu, who was sent to Iran earlier this year to serve as Iran's envoy to Yemen's Houthi movement, appears in part a signal to the Houthis, who have been battling a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen since 2015.
""Iran's support for the Houthis fuels the conflict in Yemen and exacerbates the country’s instability,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. ""By dispatching Irlu to Yemen, the (Quds Force) is signaling its intent to increase support to the Houthis and further complicate international efforts to reach a negotiated settlement to the conflict.""
The United Nations is trying to revive peace talks stalled since late 2018 to end a war that has been in a military deadlock for years, with the Houthis holding the capital, Sanaa, and most big urban centers.
Washington and Saudi Arabia see the Yemeni group as an extension of Iranian influence in the region. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, in an effort to support the Saudis, had threatened to blacklist the Houthi movement.
As a result of Tuesday's action, all property of those designated, as well as any entities that are 50 percent or more owned by them, that fall under U.S. jurisdiction are blocked, and U.S persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them.

In addition, foreign banks that knowingly facilitate significant transactions for them, or people who provide material support to them, risk losing access to the U.S. financial system or having their own property blocked.

1430,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 12:11PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.S. thinks Eritrea has joined Ethiopian war, diplomats say","By Phil Stewart and David Lewis
WASHINGTON/NAIROBI (Reuters) - The United States believes Eritrean soldiers have crossed into Ethiopia to help Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government battle a rebellious northern force, despite denials from both nations, a U.S. government source and five regional diplomats said.
Abiy and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace pact ending two decades of hostilities in 2018 and now regard the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) as a mutual foe.
The U.S. assessment creates a potential policy predicament as Washington views Ethiopia as a major ally in the volatile Horn of Africa but accuses Eritrea of severe rights abuses.
Evidence of Eritrean involvement cited in the U.S. view of the month-long war includes satellite images, intercepted communications and anecdotal reports from Tigray region, five diplomats and a security source all briefed on the U.S. assessment told Reuters. 
A U.S. government source confirmed Washington's growing consensus, which has not previously been reported but matches accounts by some residents, refugees and TPLF leaders. 
""There doesn't appear to be a doubt anymore. It's being discussed by U.S. officials on calls - that the Eritreans are in Tigray - but they aren't saying it publicly,"" the U.S. government source, who has been privy to the internal calls, told Reuters.
A senior diplomat from another country concurred, saying ""thousands"" of Eritrean soldiers were believed to be engaged. 
The U.S. State Department did not confirm the U.S. conclusions, though a spokesman said it would view any proven Eritrean involvement with great concern and that its embassy in Asmara was urging restraint to officials.
Contacted by Reuters on Saturday, Eritrea's Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed said: ""We are not involved. It's propaganda."" 
Ethiopia has denied its old foe entered the conflict, though Abiy did say last week some government troops retreated into Eritrea early in the conflict and were given assistance. His spokeswoman told Reuters queries should be directed to Eritrea. 
Claims by all sides are near-impossible to verify because most communications to Tigray are down, and the government tightly controls access. 
Abiy won a Nobel Peace Prize last year for making peace with Eritrea, but the presence of Eritrean troops on Ethiopian soil would alarm Western allies. Ethiopia hosts the African Union, its security services work with Western allies, and its troops serve in peacekeeping missions in South Sudan and Somalia.
Eritrea has for years faced accusations of large scale rights abuses, including jailing opponents and forcing citizens into lengthy military or government service. It accuses Western powers of smear campaigns and luring Eritreans abroad, which they deny. [L8N2ID2YQ]
POLICY CONUNDRUM
Ethiopia-Eritrea ties were mostly icy under the TPLF-dominated government that ruled Ethiopia for nearly three decades in increasingly autocratic fashion before Abiy took office in 2018. 
Cameron Hudson (NYSE:HUD), a former CIA officer and director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said the U.S. government was divided about speaking publicly over Eritrea. 
""That is, I think, due to a divide within the State Department between those seeking to maintain access to Abiy and those willing to call his own abuses,"" said Hudson, now senior fellow at the Africa Center at the Atlantic Council think tank.
The TPLF claims to have killed and captured large numbers of Eritrean troops in the last month, but has provided no evidence. It has fired rockets into Eritrea at least four times, the U.S. State Department says.
Eritrean troops are believed to have entered Ethiopia in mid-November through three northern border towns: Zalambessa, Rama and Badme, two of the diplomats told Reuters.
The diplomatic sources and the U.S. government source did not have information on the numbers Washington believes have crossed, nor their weapons or role in the war. 
Mesfin Hagos, a former Eritrean defence minister who broke with Isaias, said in an article for online publication African Arguments that the Eritreans sent in four mechanised divisions, seven infantry divisions and a commando brigade, citing sources in the defence ministry, opposition and personal contacts.
Some Ethiopian refugees in Sudan told Reuters they saw Eritrean soldiers in the north of Tigray, and that the border town of Humera had been hit last month by rocket or artillery fire from the Eritrean side of the border.
""People died, and they were scattered,"" said a barber from Humera, adding that he saw about 40 bodies after one barrage and helped bury some of them.
Soldiers suspected to be Eritreans were also spotted in the regional capital Mekelle, said a resident and two diplomats in touch with inhabitants. Some were reported to be in Eritrean uniforms, one of the diplomats said. Others wore Ethiopian uniforms, but spoke Tigrinya with an Eritrean accent and drove trucks without license plates, the resident said.
The United Nations has expressed concern about reported violence against 96,000 Eritrean refugees in Tigray. 
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters that Eritrean soldiers had raided two camps and abducted some residents but provided no evidence.
Eritrea's Osman denied that, saying: ""We are not repatriating Eritrean refugees. If Eritreans want to come back, they can.""
A U.N. security team trying to visit one of the camps on Sunday encountered uniformed Eritrean troops, two diplomatic sources told Reuters. The team - including two international staff - was denied access, shot at and detained, they said. 
U.N. officials declined to comment. Eritrea did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
But Redwan Hussein, a spokesman for the Ethiopian government's task force for the Tigray crisis, told reporters the U.N. team had broken through two checkpoints. ""When they were about to break the third one they were shot at and detained,"" he said.
Ethiopian officials have accused the TPLF of manufacturing fake Eritrean uniforms to bolster their claims and increase pressure on the government to accept international mediation. 

The TPLF denies this.

The 11th carrier-vessel in the French Navy's will be equipped with the new electromagnetic aircraft launch system developed by U.S. company General Atomics, French officials said.
The carrier will be 300 metres (984 ft) long and have a deadweight of 75,000 tons. It will be able to carry up to 30 Rafale fighter jets or the successor of the Dassault warplane currently being developed by France, Germany and Spain.
France's military had initially lent towards a ship with conventional propulsion, but together with Macron later opted for a nuclear-powered vessel, despite heavier construction costs, for technical and strategic reasons.
""Out strategic future, our status as a great power, lies with the nuclear industry,"" Macron said during a visit to a nuclear sector components maker.
France is continental Europe's only nuclear power. Britain is a nuclear power too, though its relationship with the European Union -- from trade to security -- once it leaves the EU's orbit on Jan. 1 remains uncertain.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Banks that process payments for humanitarian aid to Iran will not be penalised under U.S. sanctions, the U.S. Treasury has said, following a European appeal for leniency.
In a statement explaining the workings of its sanctions, U.S. authorities said foreign banks would not be punished for financing the supply of health and medical items such as hand sanitizer, ventilators or personal protective equipment.
""The United States maintains broad exceptions ... that allow for the commercial sale and export of humanitarian goods,"" officials wrote.
It also made clear that there were other exceptions to processing payments with the country, such as covering staff costs at international organisations with missions in Iran.
In late October, Germany, France and Britain urged the Trump administration to reconsider broad, new sanctions against Iran's banks, arguing they would deter legitimate humanitarian trade, diplomatic correspondence shows. 
That letter came after the United States imposed sanctions against 18 Iranian banks as part of a campaign to exert ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran over its nuclear programme. 
The order barred Americans further from dealing with the Iranian banks and extended secondary sanctions on foreign companies that did business with those lenders. 
For foreign banks, violations could mean losing access to the U.S. market and raise the spectre of hefty penalties. 
The Iran nuclear accord of 2015 was a key achievement for President Barack Obama's international diplomacy until President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in May 2018 and started imposing a new round of unilateral sanctions on Tehran.
Financial support for trade, one of the central tenets of the agreement, has since shrivelled, hitting Iran's economy hard. Tehran, meanwhile, has cited the general absence of such support from European powers as a reason for ignoring parts of the nuclear deal. 

In the letter from Germany, France and Britain, officials had highlighted the ""acute ... humanitarian needs of the Iranian population"", arguing for leniency.

The United Nations Security Council banned North Korean coal exports in 2017. The 15-member body has unanimously boosted sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. 
""The DPRK (North Korea) continues to circumvent the U.N. prohibition on the exportation of coal, a key revenue generator that helps fund its weapons of mass destruction programs,"" U.S. Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. 
""The North Korean regime often uses forced labor from prison camps in its mining industries, including coal, exploiting its own people to advance its illicit weapons programs,"" he said.
An annual report to the U.N. Security Council by independent sanctions monitors earlier this year said North Korea continued to flout council resolutions ""through illicit maritime exports of commodities, notably coal and sand"" in 2019, earning Pyongyang hundreds of millions of dollars.
The U.S. action freezes any U.S. assets of those sanctioned and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
The blacklisted ships - Calm Bridge, Asia Bridge, Lucky Star and Star 18 - ""loaded coal directly from North Korean ports and transported their cargo throughout the region,"" the U.S. Treasury Department said.
The shipping companies sanctioned are China-based Weihai Huijiang Trade Ltd, Always Smooth Ltd, and Good Siblings Ltd. Always Smooth and Good Siblings are also registered in Britain, the Treasury Department said. 
It also designated Hong Kong-based Silver Bridge Shipping Co-HKG, Vietnam-based Thinh Cuong Co Ltd and Korea Daizin Trading Corporation, which operates in North Korea and Vietnam.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea’s demands for an end to sanctions.

Kuwait and Saudi Arabia said last Friday that progress had been made towards resolving the dispute that has seen Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt sever diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar since mid-2017.
In the first public comment by the UAE on the matter, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash in a Twitter post also praised Riyadh's ""good endeavours on behalf of the four states"" and said the UAE looked forward to a ""successful"" Gulf Arab summit, which is due to take place this month.
Qatar's emir has not attended the annual summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) since 2017 although his premier was present at last year's gathering, that made no public mention of the dispute.
All countries involved are U.S. allies. Qatar hosts the region's largest U.S. military base, Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, and Saudi Arabia and the UAE host U.S. troops.
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia did not provide specific details on the progress, but a source in Washington, which along with Kuwait has worked to end the rift, told Reuters a tentative deal was reached by the parties and that it could be signed in a few weeks.
An Egyptian foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement on Tuesday that Cairo hoped the efforts would result in a ""comprehensive solution that addresses all causes behind the crisis and guarantees serious and strict commitment"".
The boycotting nations accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism. Qatar, which denies the charge, says the embargo aims to undermine its sovereignty and that any resolution should be based on mutual respect.

Doha had been set 13 demands, ranging from closing Al Jazeera television and shuttering a Turkish base to cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran.

These examples may sound extreme, but can easily represent over time the cumulative amount of microscopic pieces of plastic we consume every day.
People could be ingesting the equivalent of a credit card of plastic a week, a 2019 study by WWF International concluded, mainly in plastic-infused drinking water but also via food like shellfish, which tends to be eaten whole so the plastic in their digestive systems is also consumed.
Reuters used the findings of the study to illustrate what this amount of plastic actually looks like over various periods of time. (Open https://reut.rs/3qsC89K in an external browser to see a visualisation of the amount of microplastic we consume.)
In a month, we ingest the weight of a 4x2 Lego brick in plastic, and in a year, the amount of plastic in a fireman's helmet.
This may not sound like much, but it can add up. At this rate of consumption, in a decade, we could be eating 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) in plastic, the equivalent of over two sizable pieces of plastic pipe.
And over a lifetime, we consume about 20 kg (44 lb) of microplastic.
Plastic production has surged in the last 50 years with the widespread use of inexpensive disposable products. As plastic is not biodegradable, but only breaks down into smaller pieces, it ultimately ends up everywhere, cluttering beaches and choking marine wildlife, as well as in the food chain.
Standing on the shoreline of a wildlife-protected saltmarsh in southern England, Malcolm Hudson (NYSE:HUD), a professor of environmental science at the University of Southampton, shows Reuters small, bead-like plastic pellets that permeate the marsh.
Hudson says that most research has been done on these microplastics, but there are increasing amounts of even smaller particles called nanoplastics in the environment that are far more difficult to detect, which we are likely ingesting as well.
""It could pass into our blood or lymphatic system and end up in our organs,"" said Hudson.
""Those plastic particles are little time bombs waiting to break down small enough to be absorbed by wildlife or by people and then potentially have harmful consequences.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China summoned the acting top U.S. diplomat in Beijing on Tuesday to protest U.S. sanctions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong, and vowed to take ""reciprocal"" retaliation.
The United States on Monday imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their role in adopting a national security law for Hong Kong and Beijing's disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.
This is likely the first time that all 14 vice chairpersons of China's lawmaking body, the National People's Congress, have come under U.S. sanctions.
The sanctions came just after China's top diplomat Wang Yi urged the United States to maintain dialogue at all levels and encourage exchanges between legislators and other groupings of people. 
China criticized the sanctions. Its foreign ministry said on its website on Tuesday that Chinese vice foreign minister Zheng Zeguang had summoned the acting representative in the U.S. embassy to express ""solemn protest and strong condemnation"".
In a statement on its website, the U.S. embassy said its Chargé d’Affaires Robert Forden told Zheng that Beijing has used the law repeatedly to suppress freedom of expression and assembly in Hong Kong and to arrest Hong Kong residents who have peacefully raised their concerns over Beijing’s oppressive policies.
Zheng threatened ""reciprocal"" retaliation from China.
""U.S. barbaric actions will only invoke the intense anger of the Chinese people against anti-China forces in the United States and cause 1.4 billion Chinese people, including our compatriots in Hong Kong, to fully recognise the U.S. devious intentions and strengthen the resolve of the Chinese government in implementing the Hong Kong National Security Law,"" he said.
Earlier on Tuesday, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Chinese foreign ministry's office of the commissioner to Hong Kong issued separate condemnations of the U.S. sanctions.

Speaking at a news conference with his Hungarian counterpart in Ankara, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu reiterated that Ankara wanted to join the bloc as a full member, and said EU statements accusing Ankara of stoking tensions were wrong.
EU member Greece had continued ""provocative"" steps despite Turkey's diplomatic efforts, he said.
On Monday, EU foreign ministers said Turkey had failed to help end the row with EU members Greece and Cyprus over natural gas resources, but they left any decision on retaliatory sanctions for an EU summit on Thursday.
""They need to be fair and honest here. If they also think strategically and with common sense, not just at the summit but always, and we achieve a positive atmosphere, we can improve our ties,"" Cavusoglu said. ""We can only solve our problems with dialogue and diplomacy.""
""We want to improve our ties with the EU. We are not saying this because there is a summit or because there are sanctions and other things on the agenda,"" he added. ""We always wanted to improve our ties on the basis of full membership.""
NATO member and EU candidate Turkey has been at odds with Greece and Cyprus over the extent of their continental shelves in the eastern Mediterranean and rights to offshore hydrocarbon resources. 
Tensions flared in August when Turkey sent its Oruc Reis survey vessel to waters claimed by Greece.
After withdrawing Oruc Reis for what it said was maintenance ahead of a previous EU summit in October, Ankara sent it back shortly after, citing unsatisfactory results from the summit. It withdrew the vessel again last week, a move welcomed by NATO and the EU.
European Council President Charles Michel warned Turkey not to play ""cat and mouse"" by withdrawing ships before EU summits, only to redeploy them afterwards. Ankara has said the vessel's returns were opportunities for diplomacy, but that Greece and the EU squandered them.

The EU's Parliament has called for sanctions against Turkey. France is leading the push in the bloc to sanction Turkey at the summit, but President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Turkey would not ""bow down to threats and blackmail"" while repeating a call for dialogue.

More than half of arrivals on the Greek island of Lesbos from Nov. 1 were from Somalia, whose nationals crossed from Turkey, Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi told a news briefing. 
""Currently there are between two and three thousand migrants on the Turkish west coast,"" Mitarachi said.
Of a total of 214 migrants reaching Lesbos, 142 were from Somalia, he said.
Somalians were obtaining student or healthcare visas for Turkey, and from there, with assistance from criminal gangs, attempting to cross into Greece, he said. 
""These people are essentially arriving legally in Turkey, for the express purpose of illegal trafficking into Europe,"" the Greek official said.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing conflict, mainly from the Middle East, flowed from Turkey into Greece and further into Europe in 2015 and 2016, when a deal between the European Union and Turkish authorities restricted the flow. 
The deal has largely held, even though Greece and Turkey, regional rivals, frequently exchange barbs of the other not meeting its commitments. 
""There should be no doubt; this isn't about geopolitics, it's about illegal trafficking of people into the European Union. We are simply asking Turkey to uphold its obligation by helping us to proactively manage, and limit, illegal migration.""

Equipment including sniper rifles and anti-improvised explosive device gear was handed over during a visit by acting U.S. Defence Secretary Christopher Miller, who is on a two-nation visit in Southeast Asia.
""The modernization of the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines) will ultimately allow us to respond more effectively to both traditional and non-traditional security threats to our maritime nation,"" Philippines Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said in a statement. 
The Philippines is by far the largest recipient of U.S. military assistance in the Indo-Pacific region, having received 33 billion pesos worth of planes, ships, armoured vehicles, and small arms since 2015, the U.S. Embassy in Manila said. 
Miller' trip came just a few weeks after U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien's visited Manila to deliver $18 million worth of precision-guided munitions.
Last year, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo assured the Philippines it would come to its defence if attacked in the South China Sea.
The United States and China have been at loggerheads over issues from technology and human rights to Chinese maritime militarisation, with each accusing the other of deliberately provocative behaviour.

Hundreds chanted ""Nikol, traitor"" and ""Armenia without Nikol"" in the streets of Yerevan, answering an opposition call to protest after a deadline of midday Tuesday set by the opposition for Pashinyan to quit passed with him still in power. 
Pashinyan, who swept to power in a peaceful revolution in May 2018, accepted a Russian-brokered ceasefire deal last month to end a bloody conflict between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces over the Nagorno-Karabkh enclave and surrounding areas.
Pashinyan's opponents want him out over what they say was his disastrous handling of the six-week conflict that handed Azerbaijan territorial gains. 
Pashinyan has accepted responsibility for the conflict's outcome, but said he is now responsible for ensuring national security and stabilising the ex-Soviet republic of around three million. 
Ishkhan Saghatelyan, an opposition politician for the Armenian Revolutionary Federation party, announced the start of coordinated civil disobedience in a televised address on Tuesday after the deadline passed. 
""Nikol, you will go anyway. Leave peacefully,"" he said. 
""...from now until 17:00 Armenia's citizens have the legitimate right to use their right to peaceful actions of disobedience to express their demand and to make it heard,"" he said. 
The opposition has said it plans to block streets nationwide and to paralyse the national transport network if needed. 
Armenian spiritual leader Karekin II said in a statement that he had met Pashinyan and urged him to resign.

Pashinyan did not comment on the protests publicly on Tuesday.

A government source said last month dozens of ethnic Uzbeks remained in the Al-Hol and Roj camps in the Kurdish-controlled part of Syria ""in deplorable conditions"".
Kurdish fighters have seized much of northern and eastern Syria from Islamic State and have since held thousands of militants in prisons, while their wives and children - numbering tens of thousands - are living in camps.
UNICEF said in August eight children had died in al-Hol, where it said children from 60 countries were languishing and COVID-19 infections among camp workers had worsened conditions.
Thousands of people from the predominantly Muslim Central Asia, where Uzbekistan is the most populous nation, are believed to have joined Islamic State, with men often bringing their families along.
While many Western countries stall over returning their citizens, fearing possible attacks, Uzbekistan repatriated 220 women and children from Syria last year. There have been no recent reports on their whereabouts.
It said on Tuesday the new returnees would first enter a medical facility and then get help with jobs and accommodation. 
""The necessary conditions will be created for them to return to a peaceful life and fully adapt to society,"" It did not say where they would live.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Scientists are using the Netherlands' largest football stadium to model how a cheering football crowd might spread aerosols through the air by spraying fine droplets, made to resemble saliva, over the empty stands.
Their hope is that by finding out more about the behaviour of aerosols or airborne particles, which could spread the coronavirus within a crowd, they will be able to remove them from the air and get fans back into stadiums and concert halls.
""There is almost no information in scientific literature about the behaviour of aerosols in this kind of environment"", lead researcher Bert Blocken told Reuters. 
The tests are taking place at the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam, home of Ajax Amsterdam.
""We want to get a fundamental insight in the behaviour of aerosols in a stadium filled with football supporters. By air cleaning technologies you can drastically reduce concentrations and make stadiums safe in terms of aerosol transmission of the virus,"" he added.
There is growing consensus among scientists that transmission via aerosols plays a part in the spread of the novel coronavirus, although it is unclear to what extent.
The research could provide insight in how to minimise the concentration of aerosols and limit their epidemic risk, said Blocken, a professor in aerodynamics at the Technical University of Eindhoven. 
A computer model will extrapolate the data gathered during weeks of testing to show the effects for a full capacity crowd of around 55,000.
Researchers also hope to get permission soon to experiment with a real crowd of 730 football fans, seated close together.
The final goal is to get capacity crowds back into stadiums, Blocken said, possibly through the use of large scale COVID-19 testing, face masks and ventilation.
That would be exactly what the Johan Cruyff Arena needs to survive, its director told Reuters.
""This is a very costly building, and the income is less than half of what is normal, so we are making a loss every month"", said Henk Markerink.

""We try to keep the ship afloat, but this shouldn't take too long because in the end this cannot be financed.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Milan's La Scala opera house staged a three-hour televised medley of arias and ballet late on Monday after the coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of the traditional season opener for the first time since World War Two.
Masked members of the choir and orchestra performed the national anthem in an empty auditorium that in other years would be packed with Italy's political, business and showbusiness elite for one of the highlights of Milan's cultural calendar.
Organisers called the show ""A riveder le stelle"" (""to see the stars again"") in reference to the final phrase in Dante Alighieri's ""Inferno"", signalling hope that the pandemic which has brought Europe's economy to its knees will soon be overcome.
""This was an extraordinary experience but I hope not to repeat it,"" conductor Riccardo Chailly said.
Italy shut its theatres and concert halls in October to contain a resurgence of the pandemic after the summer and the restrictions are due to stay in place until at least after the Christmas holiday season.
Some performances were live and others pre-recorded. They included star dancer Roberto Bolle, who performed a ballet solo surrounded only by light beams. 
Organisers also took viewers to normally off-limits rehearsal and backstage areas of La Scala, the 242-year-old theatre at the heart of Milan's musical life. 
With the Lombardy region around Milan among the worst affected areas in Europe and still recording thousands of new coronavirus infections every day, it is still unclear how La Scala will stage its planned new season.

In October dozens of La Scala singers and musicians tested positive for the virus, forcing all members of the chorus into quarantine along with members of the orchestra.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan faces military threats on a daily basis from ""authoritarian forces"", President Tsai Ing-wen said on Tuesday, as the United States announced a new $280 million arms sale package to the Chinese-claimed island, the sixth this year.
China expressed anger at the weapons sale, as it always does, threatening unspecified retaliation.
The outgoing Trump administration has ramped up support for the island democracy, with 11 arms sale packages in total, and on Monday the U.S. government notified Congress of the sale of a new Field Information Communications System.
Such sales - $5 billion worth this year - have riled China, adding to existing tension between Beijing and Washington, with China placing sanctions on U.S. companies involved and stepping up its military activities near Taiwan, including regular air force missions.
Addressing a security forum in Taipei, Tsai spoke of the threats in the region, including the ""increasingly militarised"" South China Sea, which China claims large parts of and where it has built artificial islands with air and naval facilities.
""Authoritarian forces consistently attempt to violate the existing norms-based order,"" Tsai said. ""Taiwan has been at the receiving end of such military threats on a daily basis.""
SECURITY PARTNERSHIP
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the latest sale demonstrated that the U.S. commitment to bolstering the island's defence capabilities remained unchanged and he expressed its gratitude. 
""Taiwan and the United States will continue to consolidate their security partnership to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" it added.
China's Foreign Ministry denounced the arms package, urging the United States to stop selling weapons to Taiwan and saying Beijing would take ""necessary countermeasures"", though it gave no details.
""I hope they can distinguish whether the United States is actually helping them or harming them,"" spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters, referring to Taiwan's grateful response to the sale.
Taiwan's government has moved to reassure its people that the new administration of President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, will not lessen U.S. backing for the island.
Speaking at the same forum in Taipei, Kurt Campbell, a former U.S. official who has advised Biden, said there was strong bipartisan support for Taiwan.

""There is a broad group of people across the political aisle that understand the profound strategic significance and our strategic interests in maintaining a strong relationship with Taiwan,"" said Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia under former President Barack Obama.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The sister of a missing Thai pro-democracy activist presented evidence to a Cambodian court on Tuesday that she said showed her brother was in the capital Phnom Penh at the time of his alleged abduction by unknown gunmen.
Wanchalearm Satsaksit, 37, was bundled into a vehicle in front of his Phnom Penh apartment in June, New York-based Human Rights Watch said. Cambodian police have previously said they were unaware a kidnapping had taken place.
After attending a hearing at the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, Wanchalearm's sister, Sitanun Satsaksit, told reporters it was up the Cambodian judiciary to investigate further. 
""We had sufficient evidence to show to the judge that Wanchalearm was here in Phnom Penh and the abduction also happened here in Phnom Penh,"" she said. A judge will decide whether there is enough evidence to proceed with the case.
Wanchalearm was speaking on his mobile phone to Sitanun when he was abducted, the elder sister has said previously.
After holding a Buddhist prayer ceremony for her brother last week, Sitanun said she planned to submit photographs and videos to the court show that Wanchalearm was in the city. 
Amnesty International urged Cambodian authorities on Tuesday to redouble efforts to look into Wanchalearm's disappearance, saying the investigation had ""moved at a snail's pace and key evidence appears to have been ignored.""
""The Cambodian authorities need to show that they are undertaking a credible investigation,"" said Yamini Mishra, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director. 
Cambodian national police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun, who had previously said police were unaware of the incident, on Tuesday said authorities were working on the case, but declined further comment.
At least eight other Thai activists who fled the country after a 2014 military coup have disappeared from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, with some later found dead, associates and rights groups say.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Mount Everest is higher than previously thought, Nepal and China said on Tuesday, settling a long-running conflict over the height of the world's tallest peak that straddles their shared border.
Kathmandu and Beijing had differed over its exact height but after each sent an expedition of surveyors to the summit they have agreed that the official height is 8,848.86 metres (29,031.69 feet), a bit more than their previous calculations.
Everest is an ""eternal symbol of ... friendship between Nepal and China,"" said Nepali Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali, announcing the findings of their surveys on a video call with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi.
Nepal had never previously measured the height of Mount Everest on its own but had used the 8,848 metres (29,028 feet) estimate made by the Survey of India in 1954 that includes snow.
A Chinese measurement in 2005 determined that the rock height of the summit was 8,844.43 metres (29,017 feet), about 3.7 metres (11 feet) less than the 1954 estimate.
Mountaineers had suggested a 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 which killed nearly 9,000 people in Nepal may have altered the height of Everest. 
Nepal, which is home to another seven of the world's 14 highest peaks, sent its first team of surveyors in May last year to measure Everest. Chinese surveyors then climbed the peak in spring this year, when the mountain was closed by both countries for other climbers due to the coronavirus pandemic.
EARTHQUAKE
Damodar Dhakal, spokesman for Nepal’s Department of Survey, said the Nepali surveyors had used the Global Navigation Satellite System to get ""the precise height"" of the giant peak. 
Garrett Madison of the U.S.-based Madison Mountaineering company said he was excited about climbing the ""new heights"" on Mount Everest next year.
""Surely some new records for climbing the 'highest Everest' will happen in 2021,"" the 42-year-old ten times Everest summiteer told Reuters in a text message. ""Hopefully I get Everest summit #11 in 2021!""
Many Western climbers use the slightly greater height of 8,850 metres (29,035 feet) determined in 1999 by the National Geographic Society and Boston's Museum of Science, in a survey that used satellite-based technology to measure the peak.
The 2015 earthquake, which occurred during peak climbing season, triggered massive avalanches that killed 18 people at the base, halting the season's mountaineering activities.
The following year, climbers who scaled the summit said an Everest landmark, Hillary Step – a 13 metre (40 feet) near-vertical rock formation below the summit - had collapsed from the impact of Nepal's worst earthquake ever recorded.
Everest has been climbed 10,184 times by 5,789 people from both sides since it was first scaled by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953, according to the Himalayan Database, which maintains records on climbs.

At least 311 people have died on its slopes.

ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis made an unannounced, pre-dawn visit to a Rome landmark on Tuesday to pray after he was forced to cancel the traditional public ceremony because of the coronavirus.
Popes traditionally go to Rome's Spanish Steps area on the afternoon of Dec. 8, the Roman Catholic feast of the Immaculate Conception, to place a wreath of flowers at the base of a 12-metre column bearing a statue of the Madonna.
The event, usually attended by thousands of people lining the streets and considered the start of the Rome Christmas season, was cancelled this year in order to avoid gatherings that could cause contagion.
Francis went at 7 a.m. and placed a basket of white roses at the base of the statue in the rain. During the 15-minute visit he prayed for the city and for all people around the world affected by COVID-19, a Vatican statement said.
Television footage showed the pope wearing a white mask and holding his own umbrella as he prayed.
He then went to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he said Mass before returning to the Vatican.
It was the first of a series of Christmas season papal events being curtailed because of the pandemic.
Only a limited number of people will be allowed into St. Peter's Basilica for papal Christmas Eve and Christmas Day Masses, which will be broadcast on television and streamed online.
Access to his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (""To the city and the world"") blessing and message will also be restricted.
In October, the pope's weekly general audiences were moved back indoors without public participation after a period when a limited number of people were allowed to take part.

Italy has seen 60,606 COVID-19 fatalities since its outbreak emerged in February, the second highest toll in Europe after Britain. It has registered 1.74 million cases to date.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Washington's top North Korea envoy arrived in South Korea on Tuesday for what is expected to be his last visit, with little prospect for restarting talks with Pyongyang before incoming U.S. President Joe Biden takes office next month.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, who helped lead unsuccessful efforts to turn U.S. President Donald Trump's personal outreach to North Korea into progress in denuclearisation talks, arrived at a U.S. military air base south of Seoul at the start of a four-day visit.
Biegun is scheduled to meet a number of South Korean officials, including the foreign minister; the minister of unification, who handles relations with North Korea; and the country's nuclear envoy, among other officials.
The Yonhap news agency has said Biegun may also pay a courtesy call on South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
The visit may be the last for Biegun in his current role, after Trump lost his bid for reelection to Democratic challenger Biden, who will take office in January.
A former auto executive who was tapped as the U.S. Special Representative for North Korea in 2018 before later being named as deputy secretary of state, Biegun tried to find common ground between an American president seeking a big foreign policy win and a North Korean leader who has yet to hand him one.
Amid Trump's unpredictable moves, Biegun won admirers in South Korea, where one former senior diplomat said he clearly has experience in handling complex issues and knows how Washington works.
In the end, however, the talks with North Korea championed by Biegun and his counterparts in Seoul have been stalled since late 2019.

While Biegun has said he is ready for discussions at any time, North Korea says it won't return to the negotiating table until the United States drops its hostile policies.

LAGOS (Reuters) - It was after midnight in Lagos on Oct. 21 when Elisha Sunday said he got a call from his brother Victor's phone: a stranger told him Victor had been shot dead by soldiers at Lekki Toll Gate.
After a sleepless night, he said he went out to find the body but roads towards the upscale neighbourhood were blocked and he heard shooting so turned back. 
Elisha, 24, said he later saw pictures of his 27-year-old brother on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), draped in a Nigerian flag and covered in blood. After that, the trail went cold.
Protesters objecting to police brutality and demanding wide-ranging reforms had held demonstrations across Nigeria for nearly two weeks when witnesses in the Lekki district of Lagos said soldiers and police opened fire on them on Oct. 20.
Rights group Amnesty International said 12 protesters were killed in two districts that night, prompting the worst unrest since Nigeria returned to civilian rule in 1999.
Both the military and police have denied the shootings. The government ordered state governments to set up judicial panels to investigate police abuse allegations. Witness testimonies to a Lagos judicial panel said the bodies were trucked away.
Victor's best friend, David Friday, said Victor went to Lekki because it looked fun, with food, drinks and a party atmosphere; a gardener and amateur comedian, he was not politically engaged.
""Right now, I am alone,"" said Elisha, a softly spoken 24-year-old. ""There is nowhere to find him.""
Few families have come forward publicly to demand answers about their loved ones, and activists say some are too afraid to reclaim the bodies of those killed that night, leaving them with painful questions about their fate nearly two months on. 
The Lagos state government has said those who lost family members between Oct. 19 and 27 should go to Lagos State University Teaching Hospital to try to identify their bodies.
Elisha said he was turned away from the hospital three times, first for not having proper documentation, then because a hospital doctor had not accompanied him to the mortuary in nearby Yaba and finally because the chief doctor was not available. 
He said he fears retaliation from the government, but will keep trying for the sake of his mother and three sisters in the southeastern state of Akwa Ibom. 
""My mother wants my brother, just to take him home and bury him as we're supposed to do,"" he said. 
Lagos State Health Commissioner Akin Abayomi said it was standard procedure when anyone died in ""unnatural circumstances"" for the state to keep bodies until relatives proved their relationship.
He said he could not say how many were there, how they were killed or how many families had collected their relatives' remains.
State government spokesman Gbenga Omotoso said the deaths were related to the ""anarchy"" around the Lekki incident, including ""acts of violence which the perpetrators used the genuine protests to cover"".
Whether Victor's body is there was between his family and the doctors, he said.

Sheikh Nawaf has asked Sheikh Sabah to nominate members of a new cabinet for approval, state media said. 
While the emir has the final say in state matters, the prime minister traditionally helps navigate the often tense relationship between government and parliament, where opposition candidates made gains in Saturday's legislative vote.
Analysts said the makeup of the new assembly could hamper government reform efforts to address a severe liquidity crunch in the OPEC member state caused by low oil prices and the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Sheikh Sabah, who had been foreign minister since 2011 before being elevated to the post of premier in late 2019, faces the urgent task of overcoming legislative gridlock on a debt law that would allow Kuwait to tap international debt markets in order to plug a growing budget deficit.
Frequent rows and deadlocks between cabinet and the assembly, the Gulf region's oldest and most outspoken, have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament, hampering investment and economic and fiscal reform in the cradle-to-grave welfare state.

The oil policy of the OPEC producer, which is set by a supreme petroleum council, and foreign policy, which is steered by the emir, are unlikely to change under the new government.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their alleged role in Beijing's disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong, prompting China to say it will retaliate.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news briefing on Tuesday that Beijing would take ""firm counter-measures against the malicious actions by the U.S. to safeguard our sovereignty, security and developmental rights."" 
She also urged the United States to withdraw the decision.
The U.S. move announced on Monday, which was first reported by Reuters, targeted the vice chairpersons of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), the top decision-making body of the Chinese legislature.
The action was widely seen as part of an effort by outgoing President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and also box president-elect Joe Biden, before he takes office on Jan. 20, into hardline positions on Beijing at a time of bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress.
The Trump administration earlier slapped sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the Asian financial hub’s current and former police chiefs and other top officials in August for what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms in a crackdown on the territory’s pro-democracy movement.
""Beijing’s unrelenting assault against Hong Kong’s democratic processes has gutted its Legislative Council, rendering the body a rubber stamp devoid of meaningful opposition,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government last month expelled four opposition members from its legislature after China’s parliament gave city authorities new powers to curb dissent. The move triggered mass resignations by pro-democracy opposition lawmakers in the former British colony.
White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien said in November the expulsion showed the “One Country, Two Systems” formula, under which Hong Kong’s autonomy was to be safeguarded after Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997, was now “merely a fig leaf”, and he promised further U.S. action.
Pompeo said the NPCSC has effectively ""neutered"" the ability of people in Hong Kong to choose their elected representatives. ""These actions demonstrate once again Beijing’s complete disregard for its international commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a U.N.-registered treaty.""
Beijing's action heightened alarm in the West. The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group - comprised of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States - said last month the move appeared to be part of a campaign to silence critics, and called on China to reverse course.
The sanctions announced by Washington prohibit the 14 individuals and their immediate members from traveling to the United States. Any assets the officials might have within the United States will be blocked and U.S. individuals and companies will be banned from dealing with them.

The news kept global markets on edge as investors fretted over fresh Sino-U.S. tensions, which offset bets over more stimulus in Europe and the United States. [MKTS/GLOB]

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand security agencies were ""almost exclusively"" focused on the perceived threat of Islamist terrorism before a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers last year, a report into the country's worst massacre found. 
The Royal Commission of Inquiry also criticised police for failing to enforce proper checks when granting a firearms license to Australian gunman Brenton Tarrant, who released a racist manifesto shortly before the attack and streamed the shootings live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
But despite the shortcomings, the report found no failings within government agencies that would have prevented the attack at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019.
""The commission made no findings that these issues would have stopped the attack. But these were both failings and for that I apologise,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said after the report was released.
Tarrant was sentenced to life in prison without parole in August for the attack, which left dozens injured.
Ardern received global praise for her compassionate response to the attack and for swiftly banning the sale of the high-capacity semi-automatic weapons Tarrant used. She also launched a global movement against online extremism.
However, authorities were criticised for ignoring repeated warnings from the Muslim community that hate crimes against them were escalating.
The 800-page report said there was an ""inappropriate concentration of resources"" on the threat of Islamist extremist terrorism. 
Submissions to the commission by various Muslim organisations described how they felt they were targeted by security agencies while threats against them were not taken seriously.
""We find it concerning that the Commissioners found systemic failures and an inappropriate concentration of resources towards Islamic terrorism, and yet state that these would not have made a difference to the terrorist being detected prior to the event,"" the Islamic Women's Council said in a statement.
The report said there was no plausible way Tarrant’s plans could have been detected “except by chance.”
Gamal Fouda, the Imam of Al Noor mosque targeted by the shooter, said the report showed ""institutional prejudice and unconscious bias"" exists in government agencies.
HATE CRIMES
The government accepted all 44 recommendations in the report, including establishing a new national intelligence and security agency, and appointing a minister to coordinate the government's response.
It said it would create an ethnic community ministry and a graduate programme for ethnic communities to support the country's diverse population. 
The government would also tighten firearm licensing laws, strengthen counter-terrorism laws, and make changes so police can better record and respond to hate crime. 
The report found that despite having no history in New Zealand, Tarrant's application for a firearms license was approved by the police.
It recommended mandatory reporting of firearm injuries by health professionals, after it was revealed Tarrant was treated by doctors in the months leading up to the attack after accidentally shooting himself.
SOCIAL ISOLATION
The report described Tarrant as ""socially isolated"" with few childhood friends but an avid internet user and online gamer.
Before arriving in New Zealand in August 2017, he travelled extensively, visiting dozens of countries between 2014 and 2017, mostly alone. 
""The individual could present well and conducted himself in a way that did not attract suspicion. He was not identified as someone who posed a threat,"" said the report.
Other than an email Tarrant sent eight minutes before he opened fire, there was no other information available that could have alerted authorities to the attack, it said.
Tarrant trained for the attack in New Zealand by developing expertise with guns at a rifle club, working out at a gym and taking steroids to bulk up, the report said.
He frequented extreme right-wing discussion boards such as those on 4chan and 8chan but YouTube was a far more significant source of information and inspiration.

Ardern said she planned to raise this directly with the leadership of YouTube.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 08, 2020 12:50AM ET</span>",Explainer: What hardline Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab's return means for Indonesian politics,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Six supporters of Indonesian Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab were killed in a shootout on Monday, police said, raising worries the clash could reignite tensions between authorities and Islamist groups in the world’s biggest Muslim majority country.
Since his return from self-exile in Saudi Arabia last month, Rizieq has declared plans for a ""moral revolution"" causing unease in President Joko Widodo's administration as Indonesia battles the coronavirus pandemic and an economic recession.
WHO IS RIZIEK SHIHAB? 
Hardline Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab has for years cut a controversial figure in Indonesian politics. 
Rizieq heads the Islamic Defender’s Front (FPI) group. He was jailed in 2008 for inciting violence and left Indonesia in 2017 after facing charges of pornography, and insulting state ideology, which were later dropped.
With a reputation for raiding bars, brothels and violently cracking down on religious minorities, the FPI has since become politically influential.
In 2016, Rizieq was the figurehead of the mass 212 movement against Jakarta’s former Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, or Ahok, who was jailed on charges of blasphemy for insulating Islam. 
The 2016 mass rallies, the biggest since the fall of Suharto in 1998, raised concern about the rise of identity politics and political Islam. The President, known as “Jokowi”, viewed the rallies as one of the biggest threats to his government.
WHAT HAPPENED IN SHOOTOUT?
When Rizieq returned to Indonesia he was met by tens of thousands of supporters and in subsequent days held several events also attended by thousands. 
Hard hit by the pandemic and amid restrictions on mass gatherings, police have twice summoned Rizieq for questioning over alleged violation of health protocols. The cleric has ignored the requests, most recently on Monday – the day of the shootout in which police said six of his supporters were killed.
Police say they were tailing a convoy of Rizieq supporters on a Jakarta highway just after midnight after hearing they were preparing to mobilise, when firearms were pointed at them. Police say they acted in self-defence when they opened fire and killed six people.
The FPI claims Rizieq was traveling to a dawn prayer when they were attacked by unknown assailants who ""abducted"" six of his bodyguards. An FPI spokesperson described the incident as an ""extrajudicial killing"".
Amnesty International Indonesia and Indonesia Police Watch have called for an independent investigation. 
HOW BIG A FORCE IS ISLAM IN INDONESIAN POLITICS? 
As the world’s biggest Muslim-majority nation Islam has always been important in Indonesian politics. Every president has been Muslim. The 2016 rallies against the Jakarta governor saw Islam take on an increasingly prominent political role.
In a move widely seen as an attempt to appeal to Islamic voters, president Jokowi chose a senior Islamic cleric, Ma’ruf Amin, as a his vice presidential running mate in 2019.
To further neutralise the threat posed by Islamists, in 2019 Jokowi appointed fiery former general Prabowo Subianto as defence minister. Prabowo had harnessed support from Islamist groups when running against Jokowi.
While Rizieq was overseas, hardline Islamic groups such as the FPI have been relatively quiet and Jokowi had until the pandemic hit, been able to govern without too much pushback. 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN NOW?
Political analysts say given the opposition vacuum, the coronavirus and the first recession in 22 years, Rizieq may harness frustrations with the government and pose a threat.
The 55-year-old cleric has already met with several key opposition figures and there is a sense that politicking for the 2024 election is already underway.
More immediately, Monday’s fatal clash with police may create six ""martyrs"" and give the FPI a rallying point.
According to sources and analysts that spoke to Reuters the government grossly underestimated Rizieq’s continued appeal and following his reception was aware it would have to carefully calibrate its response, fearing if it cracked down too hard it may backfire.

Despite more vocal backlash from pluralists and moderate Islamic groups such as the MUI toward Rizieq this year, Monday’s incident was unlikely to have met the careful approach the president and his key ministers had been aiming for.

Operations targeting the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen have continued under a four-year-long crackdown since the attempted coup in July 2016. Gulen denies involvement in the putsch attempt, in which about 250 people were killed.
Tuesday's operation was initiated by the prosecutor's office in the western coastal province of Izmir and was spread over 50 provinces, Anadolu said.
The suspects, including five colonels and 10 captains, most of them on active duty, were believed to be in contact with people with links to Gulen's network, Anadolu said.
Since the coup attempt, about 80,000 people have been held pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended. More than 20,000 people had been expelled from the Turkish military alone.

BHUBANESWAR, India (Reuters) - Indian authorities are investigating if organochlorines used as pesticides or in mosquito control caused the death of one person and hospitalisation of more than 400 in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh in the past few days, a health official said on Tuesday.
The unknown illness has infected more than 300 children, with most of them suffering from dizziness, fainting spells, headache and vomiting. They have tested negative for COVID-19.
Federal lawmaker GVL Narasimha Rao, who is from the state, said on Twitter that he had spoken with government medical experts and that the ""most likely cause is poisonous organochlorine substances"".
""It is one of the possibilities,"" said Geeta Prasadini, a public health director in Andhra Pradesh state, adding they were awaiting test reports to ascertain the cause.
She said no new serious cases have come to light in the past 24 hours. A 45-year-old man died over the weekend.
Organochlorines https://www.reuters.com/article/us-more-evidence-links-pesticides-diabet/more-evidence-links-pesticides-diabetes-idUSTRE77G45120110817 are banned or restricted in many countries after research linked them to cancer and other potential health risks.

The police did not identify the people, saying only that they were aged between 24 and 64. Local media said former pro-democracy lawmaker and veteran activist Leung Kwok-hung, known as Long Hair, was among those arrested. 
The move comes a day after eight people aged between 16 and 34 were arrested, including three on suspicion of violating a sweeping national security law, over a brief demonstration at a university campus last month.
Hong Kong police fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse protesters on July 1, the anniversary of the former British colony's handover to Chinese rule, as thousands demonstrated despite a police ban on the annual protest. 
More than 300 were arrested in the rally that came after Beijing imposed security legislation on its freest city, saying it was vital to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government protests that rocked the city over the last year.
The law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. 
Opposition politicians and Western governments fear the law is being used to suppress dissent and erode wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 

On Monday, the United States announced further sanctions to punish Beijing for imposing the law on Hong Kong, escalating tensions between the two sides.

1462,By Bloomberg,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>",Australia Passes Law That Can Scrap China Belt and Road Accords,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Scott Morrison has new powers to veto or scrap agreements that state governments reach with foreign powers under laws that could stymie China’s Belt and Road Initiative in Australia and further inflame tensions between the trading partners.
The laws passed by Parliament on Tuesday will give the foreign minister the ability to stop new and previously signed agreements between overseas governments and Australia’s eight states and territories, and with bodies such as local authorities and universities.
Morrison’s government will be able to block or curtail foreign involvement in a broad range of sectors such as infrastructure, trade cooperation, tourism, cultural collaboration, science, health and education, including university research partnerships. An early target is likely to be an agreement the Victoria state government signed in 2018 to join President Xi Jinping’s signature infrastructure-building BRI.
The laws could further worsen ties between Australia and its largest trading partner, which have been in free fall since April, when the prime minister called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus. Beijing has since inflicted a range of trade reprisals, including imposing crippling tariffs on Australian barley and wine while blocking coal shipments.
Relations hit a fresh low last week when a Chinese diplomat tweeted an image purporting to show an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child. After Morrison called for an apology for the “repugnant” post, a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official dismissed the demand, questioning whether the Australian leader “lacks a sense of right and wrong.”
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters last week that his government wasn’t considering withdrawing from its BRI agreement due to the worsening ties, the Australian Associated Press reported.
China’s cooperation with Victoria on BRI has brought benefits to both sides, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in August. “Australia should have an objective view of such cooperation and BRI, and not set up impediments for China-Australia cooperation.”
Beyond the BRI deal signed by Victoria, which aims to increase Chinese participation in new infrastructure projects, the law may allow the federal government to review and overturn memorandums of understanding between Beijing and the governments of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania in sectors ranging from investment, science cooperation and access to the Antarctic.
The states and territories have at least 130 agreements across 30 nations that could be affected by the new law, according to Morrison. The law will establish a public register to provide transparency to the foreign minister’s decisions and states and territories will be given three months to deliver a stock-take of their existing agreements.
Partnerships between Australian universities and Beijing-sponsored bodies could be scrapped. There is mounting concern in intelligence circles about China’s influence in universities, and a program under which academics sign over intellectual property rights to their work in return for research grants, the Australian newspaper reported in April.
Under the law, Morrison won’t be able to scrap deals between state governments and commercial companies or state-owned enterprises. That means the lease of a strategic port in Darwin, used by the U.S. military, to a Chinese company by the Northern Territory government in 2015 could not be overturned.
It’s the latest move by the government to safeguard national interests. Morrison also plans to toughen foreign investment screening, regardless of the size of the deal, for sectors such as telecommunications, energy and technology.

WASHINGTON/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Washington has agreed to prolong a set of temporary migration protections that allow immigrants from six countries to live in the United States, officials said on Monday.
The so-called Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for some citizens of El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, Honduras and Nepal was extended by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) until at least October of 2021. 
TPS allows some foreigners whose home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event to remain in the United States and apply for work permits. The status must be renewed periodically in six- to 18-month intervals by the secretary of homeland security.
TPS has been in the crosshairs of Republican President Donald Trump's administration in recent months as it seeks to scale back humanitarian protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were due to be expelled from the United States in early March after a wind-down period.
The extension is part of an agreement between the administration and plaintiffs in related lawsuits not to terminate the protections as the lawsuits filter through the U.S. court system. 
Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to protect enrollees from being returned to unsafe countries.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said the extension would cover some 44,000 of the storm-ravaged Central American country's citizens living in the United States. He said he discussed the extension on a visit to Washington last week. 
""In the United States, during the meeting with the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (Chad Wolf), they told us that the TPS that was going to end in January will be extended,"" Hernandez said on national television. 
Hondurans living in the United States have had access to TPS since the accord was brokered after Hurricane Mitch wreaked havoc on the impoverished Central American country in 1998.

Guatemala has also requested extended TPS protection for its citizens.

Turkey is the main foreign backer of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), in the west, which has for years been fighting the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).
LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari added that the commercial cargo ship, Mabrouka, had 17 crew, including nine Turkish nationals, and containers that had not yet been inspected. LNA naval forces stopped it near the eastern port of Derna, he said. 
A spokesperson for Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not immediately available to comment. 
The GNA and LNA signed a ceasefire deal in October and the United Nations has been pushing a political dialogue aimed at elections next year as a solution to Libya's long-running conflict. 
But both sides have stopped short of withdrawing forces from the front line, as demanded by the truce, while an incident in southern Libya on Sunday, when LNA forces seized a military camp, has further tested the agreement. 
Earlier on Monday, Mismari accused Turkey of continuing to supply arms and fighters to the GNA. The LNA is backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. 
A panel of U.N. experts has cited the foreign supporters of both sides as breaching an arms embargo on Libya.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday preserved an Oregon public school district's policy of accommodating transgender students, rejecting an appeal challenging a policy that let students use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to their gender identity. 
The justices left in place a lower court ruling that threw out a lawsuit against Dallas School District No. 2 in rural western Oregon spearheaded by parents of a small group of students. The plaintiffs had argued that the policy violated students' rights to privacy and religious freedom under the U.S. Constitution as well as a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.
The use of gender-specific facilities such as bathrooms by transgender people in schools and beyond continues to be litigated around the United States. The Supreme Court scrapped plans to hear a major case from Virginia involving bathroom access in public schools in 2017. 
The justices in a landmark decision in June ruled that federal law prohibits workplace discrimination against gay and transgender employees. But that ruling, written by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch, made clear it was not addressing ""bathrooms, locker rooms or anything else of the kind.""
The Oregon lawsuit was brought in 2017 following a school district policy put in place at Dallas High School to accommodate transgender students. The school adopted the policy after a transgender student who was assigned as female at birth but now identifies as male asked to use the boys' bathroom and locker room facilities in 2015. The student used these facilities for three years until graduation. 
The plaintiffs argued that allowing students to use facilities that correspond to their gender identity - a policy also adopted by some other school districts around the country - risked violating students' privacy and caused other students embarrassment or fear of sharing intimate spaces with a student of the opposite sex. 
The boys' facilities at the school had private toilet and shower stalls, and the school also gave students the option to use other single-occupancy facilities if they had concerns, according to court papers. The school district said that, despite the concerns, the transgender student and other boys ""never actually did see each other undressing.""
The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out the lawsuit in February. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court, saying its guidance was needed to ""strike the proper balance between the rights of (transgender) students and the rest of the school community.""

President Donald Trump's administration has taken steps to limit the rights of transgender Americans including rescinding guidance previously issued by the administration of President Barack Obama regarding bathroom access for transgender students.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Bureau of Prisons said Ghislaine Maxwell is being treated the same as other inmates at her Brooklyn jail, rejecting her lawyers' claim she was subjected to unduly restrictive conditions.
As Maxwell prepared a new bail application, the bureau's lawyers said in a letter released on Monday that the 58-year-old British socialite ""remains in good health"" despite a COVID-19 outbreak at the Metropolitan Detention Center.
Maxwell has been jailed since July, when she pleaded not guilty to helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein recruit and abuse underage girls in the 1990s and lying under oath about her role.
Lawyers for the prison bureau said Maxwell is served three normal meals a day and keeps her weight around 134 pounds (61 kg).
They said she has access to recreation, computers and TV, can work on her defense for much of the day, and makes her allotted eight hours a month of social calls.
Maxwell's lawyers had complained of unequal treatment, saying she has been ""excessively and invasively searched,"" and woken up every 15 minutes to ensure she was still alive.
In response, the letter said inmates ""are subject to searches, including body scanners,"" and that Brooklyn jail officials check cells overnight with flashlights ""to ensure inmates are still breathing and not in distress.""
Maxwell's lawyers are expected by Tuesday to submit a new bail application to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan.
The judge had denied bail on July 14, agreeing with prosecutors that Maxwell posed a substantial flight risk.
Maxwell has been in custody since her July 2 arrest at a New Hampshire home where prosecutors said she had been hiding. She faces up to 35 years in prison at her scheduled July 2021 trial.
Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

The case is U.S. v. Maxwell, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-cr-00330.

France's health minister earlier told lawmakers that daily new COVID-19 infections were unlikely to fall to a 5,000 target by Dec. 15, BFM TV reported.
President Emmanuel Macron previously said the threshold was one condition for lifting the lockdown and imposing a nightly curfew, allowing cinemas and museums to reopen and ending the need for people to carry sworn affidavits outside their homes.
Another condition was for the number in intensive care to fall below 3,000. While that threshold may be met, the downward trend in new cases has plateaued at between 10,000 and 12,000.
""That the numbers have levelled off is not good news,"" one government source said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers said on Monday that Turkey had failed to help resolve a dispute over natural gas resources in the eastern Mediterranean, but they left any decision on retaliatory sanctions for an EU summit on Thursday.
The 27 ministers, who were tasked to evaluate the grounds for economic sanctions on Ankara, did not go beyond agreeing Turkey had aggravated tensions since October, when EU leaders voiced a threat to impose punitive measures in December.
""Unhappily, we haven't seen much progress or improvement since the last European Council,"" the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell told reporters, referring to the Oct. 1-2 summit, when EU leaders gave Ankara time to find a diplomatic solution.
""We have not seen a fundamental change of direction in Turkey's behaviour. On the contrary, in several aspects the situation has worsened,"" said Borrell, who chaired the meeting.
NATO ally and EU candidate Turkey claims gas resources also contested by Greece and Cyprus, a dispute that has fanned territorial rows over the divided island of Cyprus, maritime boundaries with Greece and Turkey's broader foreign policy. 
EU states cite Turkish exploration in contested waters, a decision to re-open part of a town in disputed territory in Cyprus and a row with Germany over a U.N. arms embargo on Libya as evidence that Turkey is no longer a reliable partner.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said his country would not ""bow down to threats and blackmail"" but repeated his call for negotiations over the conflicting claims to continental shelves and rights to potential energy resources.
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said on Twitter that ""Turkey's stance is a challenge to the Union as a whole,"" appearing to challenge comments earlier on Monday by his Turkish counterpart that Greece and Cyprus were manipulating the EU to act against Turkey.
Tensions flared in August when Turkey sent a survey vessel to map out energy-drilling prospects in waters claimed by Greece.
Germany, current holder of the EU's six-month presidency, holds the key to whether sanctions go ahead. It had hoped to mediate between Athens and Ankara, but was angered when Turkey resumed its gas exploration off Cyprus in October after a pause.
""There will be a decision at the summit,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said after the meeting. ""There have been repeated Turkish provocations. So the EU summit will have to decide how to handle this."" 

The Turkish vessel at the centre of the dispute, Oruc Reis, returned to port again last week, which was welcomed by the EU and NATO. But European Council President Charles Michel warned Turkey not to play ""cat and mouse"" by returning exploration ships to port just before EU summits, only to redeploy them after they had finished.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's health authorities on Monday announced a fresh lockdown in the capital Santiago after coronavirus cases spiked 18% in the past week. 
Health Minister Enrique Paris said the measure, which will involve a full lockdown on weekends and restricted activities during the week, was designed to avoid a full quarantine. 
The coronavirus first hit Chile, population 19 million, in March, and the country reached a peak in June, with more than 5,000 cases daily and ranking only behind Qatar globally for cases per capita.
In August, authorities began lifting the lid on lockdowns covering the capital suburb by suburb, using a step-by-step rule, while the focus of cases bounced from the mine-heavy north of the country to the south, where hospitals continue to be saturated. 
However, a steady uptick in cases that culminated in this week's 18% rise has prompted a change in strategy. 
Paris said the return to partial lockdown was a ""preventative step"" to avoid a return to the previous full and lengthy lockdowns that caused significant economic hardship. 
""Given the number of inhabitants of the Metropolitan Region, that (18%) figure is shocking and worries us a lot,"" he said. 
The announcement is complicated, however - and Paris faced tough questions at his regular news conference - because a picture emerged over the weekend of Chile's President Sebastian Pinera posing for a selfie with a bystander without wearing a mask.
Pinera has apologized, and a government spokesman explained he had been walking alone along the beach in the upmarket central Chilean resort of Cachagua where he has a house, but was surprised by a bystander. 
Chile has strict rules that require the wearing of masks in all public places including outside, and violations are punishable with sanctions that include significant fines and even jail terms.
Spokesman Jaime Bellolio said the president would report himself to the health authorities. 

Gaffe-prone Pinera has previously been pictured eating pizza on the night fierce social protests broke out in Santiago in October last year, and posing for pictures at the square that was the hub of the demonstrations after the pandemic forced its clearance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday imposed financial sanctions and a travel ban on 14 Chinese officials over their alleged role in Beijing's disqualification last month of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong.
The move, which was first reported by Reuters overnight and sent Asian stock markets lower, targeted the vice chairpersons of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC), the top decision-making body of the Chinese legislature.
The action was widely seen as part of an effort by outgoing President Donald Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and also box president-elect Joe Biden, before he takes office on Jan. 20, into hardline positions on Beijing at a time of bipartisan anti-China sentiment in Congress.
The Trump administration earlier slapped sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the Asian financial hub’s current and former police chiefs and other top officials in August for what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms in a crackdown on the territory’s pro-democracy movement.
""Beijing’s unrelenting assault against Hong Kong’s democratic processes has gutted its Legislative Council, rendering the body a rubber stamp devoid of meaningful opposition,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government last month expelled four opposition members from its legislature after China’s parliament gave city authorities new powers to curb dissent. The move triggered mass resignations by pro-democracy opposition lawmakers in the former British colony.
White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien said in November the expulsion showed the “One Country, Two Systems” formula, under which Hong Kong’s autonomy was to be safeguarded after Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997, was now “merely a fig leaf”, and he promised further U.S. action.
Pompeo said the NPCSC has effectively ""neutered"" the ability of people in Hong Kong to choose their elected representatives. ""These actions demonstrate once again Beijing’s complete disregard for its international commitments under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a U.N.-registered treaty.""
Beijing's action heightened alarm in the West. The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group - comprised of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States - said last month the move appeared to be part of a campaign to silence critics, and called on China to reverse course.
The sanctions prohibit the 14 individuals and their immediate members from traveling to the United States. Any assets the officials might have within the United States will be blocked and U.S. individuals and companies will be banned from dealing with them.
The news kept global markets on edge as investors fretted over fresh Sino-U.S. tensions, which offset bets over more stimulus in Europe and the United States. [MKTS/GLOB]

Abdullakh Anzorov, an 18-year-old male born in Muslim-majority Chechnya, was shot dead in October by French police after slaying middle school teacher Samuel Paty in a suburb of Paris. 
Anzorov had wanted to punish Paty for showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad to pupils in a lesson about freedom of expression. The caricatures are considered blasphemous by many Muslims.
Kheda Saratova, an adviser on human rights to Chechen authorities, said Anzorov was buried at a traditional Muslim ceremony in the Chechen village of Shalazhi and that his relatives and acquaintances had attended, Russia's RIA news agency reported. 
Other Russian media, including the Fontanka outlet in St Petersburg, said that Anzorov had been buried on Sunday with honours in Chechnya, part of Russia's turbulent North Caucasus. 
A procession of scores of people walking through snowy streets could be seen chanting prayers and carrying what appeared to be a body wrapped in green cloth in social media footage reposted by Fontanka. 
Those reports and videos could not be immediately verified by Reuters. 
The Caucasus Knot outlet, which focuses on the region, reported that around 200 people had taken part in the ceremony and that officials had sealed off the area for security reasons while it took place. 
Ramzan Kadyrov, Chechnya's leader, has criticised French President Emmanuel Macron's handling of the killing, accusing him of inspiring terrorists by justifying cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad as protected by free speech rights. 
The Kremlin said on Monday it had no information about the burial, but condemned what it said was an act of terrorism that deserved ""nothing but profound condemnation and rejection.""

It was a rare deadly incident involving protests against the political parties that run the autonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq, over delayed payment of public sector salaries.
The officials, including medics at a local hospital, said the protester had been shot by armed men guarding the headquarters of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) in the town of Chamchamal, west of the city of Sulaimaniya.
Demonstrators have taken to the streets in and around Sulaimaniya for several days demanding their salaries and criticising the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which controls the Sulaimaniya area.
The KDP-dominated Kurdish regional government, based in Erbil, has been hit by a nationwide economic crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen Iraq's oil revenues slashed.

Iraq depends on oil exports for virtually all its state revenue, including some 250,000 barrels per day from Kurdish areas.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday he would not condition the sale of weapons to Egypt on human rights because he did not want to weaken Cairo's ability to counter terrorism in the region, a comment likely to draw the ire of critics.
Both states - which share concerns about instability across the Sahel, threats from jihadist groups in Egypt and the political vacuum in Libya - have cultivated closer economic and military ties during President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's rise to power.
But 17 French and international human rights groups issued a statement ahead of a visit by Sisi to France, accusing Macron of turning a blind eye to what they say are increasing violations of freedoms by Sisi's government.
""I will not condition matters of defence and economic cooperation on these disagreements (over human rights),"" Macron said during a joint press conference with Sisi after the two leaders held talks in the Elysee Palace. 
""It is more effective to have a policy of demanding dialogue than a boycott which would only reduce the effectiveness of one our partners in the fight against terrorism,"" he added.
French officials have dismissed criticism, saying the government had a policy of avoiding public declarations about other countries' rights records and instead raises concerns in private.
Drums rolled and trumpets blared as the French Republican Guard cavalry earlier escorted Sisi through the centre of the capital and across the Seine over the Pont des Invalides. A masked Macron welcomed him at the Elysee Palace.
Nevertheless, even within French officialdom there are doubts about the close embrace of Sisi, who has presided while thousands of opponents have been jailed.
""I don't know what we gain from this visit. It's business as usual,"" said one French diplomat, deploring Macron's position. 
Between 2013-2017, France was the main weapons supplier to Egypt. Those contracts have dried up, including deals for more Rafale fighter jets and warships that had been at an advanced stage. Diplomats say that is as much to do with financing issues as with France's response to human rights concerns.
Sisi dismissed the accusations of human rights abuses.
""It is not appropriate for you to present the Egyptian state and everything it does for its people and for the stability of the region, as an oppressive regime,"" Sisi said.
""We do not have anything to be afraid of or embarrassed about it, we are a nation that is striving to build a future for its people in extremely harsh conditions in a region of great turmoil."" 
Macron said the release of members of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) was an opening and that he gave Sisi a list of individuals who should be released.

""Emmanuel Macron is effectively giving a blank check to the ruthless repression carried out by Sisi against civil society and is turning his back on his own commitments,"" said Benedicte Jeannerod, France Director at Human Rights Watch, in response to Macron's comments.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Allies of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro won a majority of votes in a parliamentary election that saw scant participation due to a boycott by the opposition, who called Sunday's event a farce meant to consolidate a dictatorship.
The elections council said that 67.6% of the 5.2 million votes cast in Sunday's election went to an alliance of parties called the Great Patriotic Pole that backs Maduro.
There were few lines at voting centers. Just 31% of eligible voters participated, according to the council.
The results nonetheless return the congress to Maduro's control, despite an economy in tatters, an aggressive U.S. sanctions program, and a mass migration exodus.
""Venezuela already has a new National Assembly,"" Maduro said, in televised remarks that were muted in comparison with his frequent triumphalism. ""A great victory, without a doubt.""
Elections council chief Indira Alfonzo did not specify how many of the 277 seats would go to Maduro allies, based on the 82% of votes counted thus far. That was a departure from typical congressional poll-result announcements that usually break down the distribution of seats.
Alfonzo did name a handful of victorious candidates, however, including Cilia Flores, who is Maduro's wife, and Diosdado Cabello, who is vice president of the Socialist Party.
She added that 17.95% of the votes went to parties who have described themselves as Maduro adversaries, but are widely suspected of being Maduro's shadow allies.
Earlier in the year, the Supreme Court had put several opposition parties in the hands of politicians expelled from those same parties for alleged links to Maduro - one of the major reasons the opposition had called the vote a sham.
The elections council was also named without the opposition's participation, and Maduro refused to allow meaningful electoral observation.
""After the blackmail, the kidnapping of parties, censorship, fabrication of results, sowing terror, they announce what we have been saying - a fraud with 30%,"" opposition leader Juan Guaido, the head of the current congress, wrote on Twitter.
More than a dozen Latin American democracies, including Venezuela's neighbors Brazil and Colombia, questioned the vote's legitimacy. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday called the election a ""sham.""
The opposition in 2015 won control of the National Assembly in a landslide, but the pro-Maduro Supreme Court blocked even the most basic legislation. In 2017, Maduro supplanted parliament with the creation of an all-powerful parallel body known as the National Constituent Assembly.
Opposition legislators nonetheless used the platform to denounce Maduro around the world for human rights abuses, corruption, and economic mismanagement, proving a constant thorn in the side of the Socialist Party.
Retaking control of the congress will give Maduro few meaningful tools to restart an economy where a monthly salary or pension is often less than the cost of a kilo of meat or a carton of eggs.
It may lend his government more legitimacy to offer oil industry deals to companies willing to risk U.S. sanctions to tap the OPEC nation's huge oil reserves. 
But even traditional allies such as Russia and China, typically the most likely to challenge U.S. sanctions, have shown scant interest in an oil industry hollowed out by years of decay and the emigration of its most talented professionals.
The opposition is calling on sympathizers to participate in a Dec. 12 consultation that will ask citizens whether they reject the results and want a change of government.
Guaido has been recognized by more than 50 countries, including the United States, as Venezuela's legitimate interim president, after most Western nations disavowed Maduro's 2018 re-election as fraudulent.

Maduro blames the country's woes on the opposition, which he says has used its control of congress and its alliance with the United States to sabotage the economy.

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>","Ethiopia scorns guerrilla war fears, U.N. team shot at in Tigray","ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia's government denied on Monday that northern forces whom its troops have fought for a month would be able to mount a guerrilla insurgency, while diplomats said a United Nations team was shot at while trying to visit a refugee camp.
Federal troops have seized the regional capital Mekelle from the former local ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and declared an end to their month-long offensive.
But TPLF leaders say they are fighting back on various fronts around Mekelle. Ethiopia experts fear a drawn-out insurgency with a destabilising impact around east Africa.
""The criminal clique pushed a patently false narrative that its fighters and supporters are battle-hardened and well-armed, posing the risk of protracted insurgency in the rugged mountains of Tigray,"" Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said in a statement. 
""It also claimed that it has managed to undertake strategic retreat with all its capability and regional government apparatus intact. The reality is the criminal clique is thoroughly defeated and in disarray, with insignificant capability to mount a protracted insurgency.""
There was no immediate TPLF response.
With communications largely down and access for humanitarian workers and media restricted, Reuters has not been able to verify claims from all sides on the state of fighting.
A United Nations security team seeking to access Shimelba refugee camp, one of four for Eritrean refugees in Tigray, was blocked and fired at on Sunday, two diplomatic sources said.
The sources declined to give more details, saying the full circumstances were unclear. There was no immediate comment from the government, TPLF or United Nations. 
AID NEEDED FAST
The conflict, which came after Abiy had pushed back against the TPLF's past dominance of federal government and accused them of abuses, is thought to have killed thousands of people.
It has also sent nearly 50,000 refugees fleeing to Sudan, seen TPLF rockets fired into Eritrea, stirred ethnic divisions, and led to the disarming of Tigrayans in Ethiopia's peacekeeping contingency combating al Qaeda-linked militants in Somalia.
The United Nations and aid agencies are pressing for safe access to Tigray, which is home to more than 5 million people and where 600,000 relied on food aid even before the war.
The government says that with peace restored, its priorities are the welfare of Tigrayans and return of refugees. But some residents, diplomats and the TPLF say clashes persist, with protests and looting also reported in Mekelle on Friday.
The Ethiopian government issued arrest warrants for 10 senior police officers in Addis Ababa on Monday, saying they had committed treason and rights abuses by accepting unspecified missions for the TPLF, according to state-controlled media. 
The TPLF dominated government for nearly three decades, until Abiy took office in 2018 and began democratic reforms. 
The party accuses him of seeking to centralise power at the expense of Ethiopia's 10 regions and says Tigrayan officials were unfairly targeted in a crackdown on corruption and rights abuses. The government denies that and accuses TPLF leaders of treason for attacking federal forces in early November.

Senior TPLF leaders including its head, Debretsion Gebremichael, are hiding in mountains where troops were closing in on them, the military has said. State-affiliated broadcaster Fana said the army captured more than 40 vehicles after TPLF leaders fled on foot.

Six of the top court's 11 justices ruled late on Sunday in a remote vote that the Constitution clearly prohibited the re-election of Senate President Davi Alcolumbre and lower house Speaker Rodrigo Maia.
The fight to control Congress has distracted lawmakers from a legislative agenda that includes dealing with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, approving next year's budget and advancing reform of Brazil's byzantine tax code.
With the current leaders heading out the door, the struggle to control Congress will intensify between political parties backing far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and centrist ones trying to keep a distance, risk consultancy Arko Advice said. 
Alcolumbre has backed Bolsonaro and the end of his mandate running the Senate in February will be a loss for the president in pushing through his conservative agenda. It could open the way for the largest party in the chamber, the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), to regain the top job.
In the lower chamber, Maia has increasingly become a critic of Bolsonaro's leadership, and his allies are still favorites to retain the speakership. Maia told reporters he expects to get a chosen successor elected.

""I would not call the court decision against Maia running a victory for Bolsonaro, because the picture in the lower house will not change much,"" said Arko partner Lucas de Aragão.

But with infection numbers in Germany remaining stubbornly high, politicians fear gatherings of people drinking alcohol, often without wearing masks and sticking to social distancing rules, could hamper efforts to bring case numbers under control.
""Mulled wine stands are in full swing tonight,"" SPD health policy expert Karl Lauterbach posted on Twitter at the weekend, referring to the situation in Cologne. ""Those infected today will infect others next week. Is it similarly catastrophic in other cities?""
Health Minister Jens Spahn has criticised people for acting carelessly, saying that while some crowd around mulled wine stands, healthcare workers are working around the clock to save lives in intensive care units.
Under Germany's ""lockdown light"", bars and restaurants have been ordered to close until Jan. 10, but they are allowed to sell takeaway food and drinks. For some owners, serving mulled wine to Germans seeking festive spirit in the absence of Christmas markets is a way to help make ends meet.
""You simply don't have any financial means available for daily needs, food, insurance and so on,"" said Tobi Epping from the pub 'Die Wache' in the west German town of Bonn, which has organised a mulled wine walk with seven other establishments on Fridays and Saturdays in December.
""It's not really a great business, but there is a little bit left over,"" he told Reuters TV.
Ragnar Fleischmann from the pub 'NYX' said he thought the initiative was a sensible measure as people might otherwise meet indoors at private homes.
But similar events in other German cities have led to throngs of people. On Saturday, police in Heidelberg, in southwest Germany, broke up a crowd of almost 200 people who were taking part in a mulled wine walk.
Bavaria, which has so far had the highest death toll from the virus, will impose a state-wide ban on selling alcohol in the open air from Wednesday, while the southwestern state of Rhineland-Palatinate has banned mulled wine 'to go'.

Hashem Abedi was found guilty in March of murder, for encouraging and helping his brother Salman to blow himself up at the Manchester Arena as parents arrived to collect their children at the end of a May 2017 show by the U.S. pop singer.
Among the 22 killed were seven children, the youngest aged just eight, while 237 people were injured in what was Britain's deadliest attack since 2005.
Hashem had denied involvement but offered no evidence in his trial. A jury concluded he was as guilty as his brother of murder. 
However on Monday, an independent public inquiry into the bombings was told he had now acknowledged his role during an interview with its lawyers. 
""On the 22nd of October... Hashem Abedi admitted that he had played a full part, and a knowing part, in the planning and preparation for the arena attack,"" lawyer Paul Greaney, who is counsel to the Manchester Arena Inquiry, said. 
Abedi was jailed for life in August and told he must serve at least 55 years behind bars.
The brothers, born to Libyan parents who emigrated to Britain during the rule of late leader Muammar Gaddafi, had plotted the attack at their home in south Manchester, shortly before they returned to Libya in mid-April 2017.
Hashem remained in Libya while his 22-year-old brother carried out the bombing, but police said he persuaded acquaintances to buy chemicals to make the explosives and had sourced metal drums used to build prototype devices.

In 1994 Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki signed a decree revoking citizenship for members of the group for reasons including their conscientous objection to military service. Eritrea has maintained conscription for more than 20 years. 
Since that decree, Jehovah's Witnesses members have been subjected to detentions, torture and harassment in Eritrea, in part to compel them to renounce their faith, according to the group and international human rights organisations.
In its statement, the Jehovah's Witnesses said 28 of its members incarcerated in Eritrea were freed on Dec. 4 after serving sentences of ranging from five to 26 years. Another 24 remain in prison, it said. 
""Eritrea arrests and imprisons Jehovah’s Witnesses and others without trial or formal charges. Several of those jailed are male Witnesses who are conscientious objectors to military service,"" the statement said.
""However, the majority - including women and the elderly - are imprisoned for religious activity or undisclosed reasons.""
Last year Human Rights Watch accused Eritrea of continuing to force thousands of students and teachers into indefinite military service, frustrating hopes that a 2018 peace deal with former arch-enemy Ethiopia might lead to the end or scaling back of Asmara's conscription policy. Asmara's government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment at the time.

""We have always presented 'The Crown' as a drama - and we have every confidence our members understand it's a work of fiction that's broadly based on historical events,"" the company was quoted as saying in the UK media reports.
""As a result we have no plans - and see no need - to add a disclaimer.""
While many British viewers have enjoyed watching ""The Crown"", the most recent season has attracted criticism from some commentators over scenes suggesting that the late Princess Diana was treated coldly, even cruelly, by senior royals.
Columnist Simon Jenkins of the Guardian newspaper accused the fourth season of having ""upped the fabrication and the offence"".

Arguing that modern history was ""too close to what should be sacred ground - bearing witness to passing events"", he wrote that artistic licence could not justify fabrications that showed living or recently dead people in the worst possible light.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>","As Lebanon subsidy crunch looms, U.N. agencies warn of social catastrophe","BEIRUT (Reuters) - The removal of subsidies in Lebanon without guarantees to protect the vulnerable would amount to a social catastrophe, two U.N. agencies said on Monday, warning there is no parachute to soften the blow.
With Lebanon deep in financial crisis, the central bank has been subsidising basic goods by providing hard currency to importers at the old exchange rate of 1,500 Lebanese pounds to the dollar even as the currency fell by 80% from the peg.
Central bank governor Riad Salameh said last week the subsidies could be kept for only two more months, urging the state should come up with a plan.
Though Lebanon faces the gravest crisis since the 1975-90 civil war, policymaking has been crippled by old rivalries between fractious politicians. Saad al-Hariri was nominated to form a new government in October but one has yet to be agreed. 
""The impact of removing price subsidies on the country's most vulnerable households will be tremendous and yet there is almost nothing in place to help soften the fall,"" the UNICEF'S Lebanon country representative and the ILO's regional director wrote in an op-ed.
""It is critical to realise that for Lebanon to fly off another cliff now, without first putting in place an inclusive system of social guarantees, would be to inflict a social catastrophe on the country's most vulnerable people, sacrificing their wellbeing, and that of the country as a whole, for many years to come,"" they wrote.
The universal way in which Lebanon has been subsidising basic goods including fuel, wheat and medicine has been widely criticised, including by senior politicians from ruling parties, because it does not target those most in need.
A rough analysis shows up to 80% of the subsidies may actually be benefiting the wealthiest 50% with only 20% going to the poorer half, UNICEF Representative Yukie Mokuo and ILO Regional Director Ruba Jaradat wrote in their op-ed.
The caretaker government is due to meet Salameh on Monday to discuss the subsidies.

The World Bank has said poverty is likely to continue to worsen and engulf more than half the population by 2021.

Kaliningrad, already heavily militarised, is a Russian region that lies on the Baltic Sea between EU members Lithuania and Poland. Moscow captured the region from Germany towards the end of World War Two.
It is home to the headquarters of Russia's Baltic Fleet, and Russian and NATO military aircraft often intercept each other in a game of cat and mouse over the waters of the Baltic Sea. 
The Baltic Fleet's Admiral Alexander Nosatov told the army's Red Star newspaper that the military reinforcement was a response to NATO, accusing the Western military alliance of deploying an armoured tank unit and several multinational tactical and other strike units nearby. 
""In response to this threat, the leadership of the armed forces was obliged to take reciprocal measures. One of them was the formation of a fully-fledged motorised rifle division, which has joined the army corps of the Baltic Fleet,"" he said. 
""The new unit includes motorised rifle, artillery and separate tank regiments,"" said Nosatov. 
Nosatov spoke of the exclave taking delivery of 30 new T-72B3M tanks, a naval corvette armed with cruise missiles, and an undisclosed number of Sukhoi SU-30SM fighter jets. 
He said the reinforcement would continue apace next year. 
The deployment comes as ties between Russia and the West languish at post-Cold War lows, strained by everything from Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea to allegations of hacking U.S. elections and Syria.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 06:37AM ET</span>",Iran says 'smart satellite-controlled machine gun' killed top nuclear scientist,"DUBAI (Reuters) -The killing of Iran's top nuclear scientist last month was carried out remotely with artificial intelligence and a machine gun equipped with a ""satellite-controlled smart system"", Tasnim news agency quoted a senior commander as saying.
Iran has blamed Israel for the assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who was seen by Western intelligence services as the mastermind of a covert Iranian programme to develop nuclear weapons capability. Tehran has long denied any such ambition.
Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the killing, and one of its officials suggested that the Tasnim report of the tactics used was a face-saving gambit by Iran.
In the past, however, Israel has acknowledged pursuing covert, intelligence-gathering operations against the nuclear programme of its arch-enemy. 
The Islamic Republic has given contradictory details of Fakhrizadeh's death in a daytime Nov. 27 ambush on his car on a highway near Tehran. 
""No terrorists were present on the ground... Martyr Fakhrizadeh was driving when a weapon, using an advanced camera, zoomed in on him,"" Tasnim, a semi-official agency, quoted Ali Fadavi, the deputy commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, as saying in a ceremony on Sunday. 
""The machine gun was placed on a pick-up truck and was controlled by a satellite.""
SECURITY GAPS
Fadavi spoke after Iranian authorities said they had found ""clues about the assassins"", though they have yet to announce any arrests. Shortly after Fakhrizadeh was killed, witnesses told state television that a truck had exploded before a group of gunmen opened fire on his car. 
Last week Ali Shamkhani, Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran, said the killing was carried out with ""electronic devices"" with no people on the ground. 
Experts and officials told Reuters last week Fakhrizadeh's killing exposed security gaps that suggest its security forces may have been infiltrated and that the Islamic Republic was vulnerable to further attacks.
""Some 13 shots were fired at martyr Fakhrizadeh with a machine gun controlled by satellite... During the operation artificial intelligence and face recognition were used,"" Fadavi said. ""His wife, sitting 25 centimetres away from him in the same car, was not injured.""
Yoav Galant, an Israeli security cabinet minister, said he was ""not aware"" of whether the remote-operated targeting technologies described in the Iranian accounts existed. 
""What I see is a great deal of embarassment on the Iranian side,"" Galant, a former naval commando and deputy chief of Israel's military, told Army Radio. ""It would appear that those who were responsible for his (Fakhrizadeh's) security are now coming up with reasons for not having fulfilled that mission."" 
Fakhrizadeh, identified by Israel as a prime player in what it says is a continuing Iranian quest for a nuclear weapon, was the fifth Iranian nuclear scientist killed in targeted attacks since 2010 inside Iran, and the second slaying of a high-ranking Iranian official in 2020. 

The commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January. Tehran retaliated by firing missiles at U.S. military targets in Iraq.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy will stage a health summit in Rome next May during its presidency of the Group of 20 major economies and hopes world leaders, including U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, will attend, diplomatic sources said.
If heads of state accept the invitation, it would be the first such in-person meeting for global chiefs since 2019, after the coronavirus reduced the main G20 and Group of Seven summits this year to virtual gatherings.
Italy took over the annual G20 presidency at the start of the month and all scheduled events until at least mid-April are expected to be held via video-link. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte hopes face-to-face encounters can resume from May.
The global health summit is scheduled for May 21 in Rome and would discuss the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to vaccinations and international cooperation.
""The idea is to have a Rome declaration to confront the health emergency,"" a diplomatic source said.
Biden is due to be sworn into office on Jan. 20. Former U.S. officials last month urged the president-elect to push for a G20 summit in early 2021 to renew U.S. commitment to diplomacy and tackle the health and economic impact of COVID-19.
An Italian political source said Conte's office had had informal contacts with Biden, but added that it was too soon to say whether he would come to Rome in May.
The event is being co-sponsored by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Rome is confident that EU leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, will attend, coronavirus permitting.
Italy has scheduled a meeting for G20 foreign ministers in the southern city of Matera on June 28-30 and a gathering of G20 economy ministers in Venice on July 9-10. The traditional closing summit for world leaders is set for Rome on Oct. 30-31.
The Italian presidency will focus on three broad themes - the planet, people and prosperity.
""Italy wants to give impetus to economic growth but with the firm intention that its benefits are actually better shared, without leaving anyone behind,"" Pietro Benassi, Conte's chief diplomatic advisor, told a conference last month.

Amongst the goals Italy hoped to achieve were securing further debt relief for African states, he said.

""By the grace of God and with the good prayers of devotees, the gentleman (Ayatollah Khamenei) is in good health and is busy vigorously carrying out his plan according to his routine,"" the official, Mehdi Fazaeli, said on Twitter. 
Fazaeli has worked in an office publishing Khamenei's work. His tweet was also reported by Iran's semi-official Fars news agency.
The statement about Khamenei's health appeared to be a response to reports by several news organisations, which referred to a tweet by a journalist in Arabic who said Khamenei had transferred duties to his son because of his health.
Khamenei has served as supreme leader since 1989, with the final say on all state matters. His health has been the subject of speculation for years. 

A security official in Israel, which closely follows events in its enemy Iran, told Reuters: ""We are aware of these rumours, and regard them as rumours only.”

1492,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","Apologising for ""confusion"", S.Korea's Moon vows to press on with prosecutor reform","By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Struggling against plunging approval ratings, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in apologised on Monday for a feud between his justice minister and prosecutor general, while vowing to press ahead with reform of the prosecutor's office.
It is the first time that president has publicly waded into to the controversy since it erupted last month when Justice Minister Choo Mi-ae demanded the resignation of Prosecutor-General Yoon Seok-youl, accusing him of abuse of power.
""I am extremely sorry that the confusion in the political situation is causing anxiety to the people at a time when we have to unite our hearts to tackle the coronavirus and livelihood issues,"" Moon told a meeting with senior aides.
The apology came as surveys by pollster Realmeter showed Moon's approval ratings over the past week had fallen below 40% for the first time since he took office in May 2017, as his government also battled to contain spiralling home prices and a new wave of COVID-19 outbreaks. The prosecutor general has denied allegations that political motives guided his decision to pursue cases, or that he had illegally gathered information on some judges' political leanings.
Last week a court overturned the minister's order to suspend Yoon from duty, but his fate could be decided later this week by a disciplinary committee.
The timing is awkward for Moon, as parliament is due to vote on the legislation to reform the prosecutor's office, which Moon described as being one of his ""biggest remaining tasks."" 
In a country where almost every living president has faced criminal charges after leaving office, the powerful national prosecutor's office has long played a major political role.
Moon, who is limited to a single term and has roughly 1-1/2 years of his presidency to run, has proposed that a new agency should undertake such high level investigations in future. 
Yoon, who will step down as prosecutor general when his two-year term expires in July next year, opposed the proposals and has been investigating some of Moon's top allies, including a former justice minister who was forced to resign in October after only a month amid bribery and fraud allegations.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Police in northern India have arrested 10 men for allegedly compelling women to change their religion after getting married, using a new anti-conversion law popularly called the ""Love Jihad"" law, officials said on Monday.
Last month, Uttar Pradesh state became the first Indian province to pass a law against forced or fraudulent religious conversions, laying out prison terms for anyone compelling others to convert their faith or luring them into these conversions through marriage.
The anti-conversion law does not name any religion but critics call it Islamophobic for being solely imposed with the objective of preventing ""Love Jihad"", which hardline Hindu groups describe as a conspiracy to convert gullible Hindu women to Islam by misleading them with promises of love and marriage.
Officials in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state, said the law will help prevent fraudulent religious conversions and was designed to protect young women.
The federal government and the Uttar Pradesh government are both controlled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
Four senior police officials said 10 men were arrested last week from different parts of Uttar Pradesh based on separate criminal complaints lodged by parents who alleged their daughters were abducted by Muslim men. 
""We are using the new law to only arrest those men where we have proof to show it is a clear case of forced religious conversion,"" said one police official, speaking on conditions of anonymity as he was not authorised to brief the press.
Under the new law, a man and woman belonging to different religions will have to give two months' notice to the district magistrate before they get married and they will be given permission if there are no objections. 
At least four other Indian states - Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Karnataka and Assam have said that they are planning to bring in similar anti-conversion laws.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 07, 2020 05:11AM ET</span>",European powers rebuke Iran after uranium enrichment announcement,"PARIS (Reuters) -France, Germany and Britain said on Monday they were alarmed by an Iranian announcement that it intended to install additional, advanced uranium-enriching centrifuges and by legislation that could expand its nuclear programme. 
""If Iran is serious about preserving a space for diplomacy, it must not implement these steps,"" the three powers, who along with China and Russia are party to a 2015 nuclear containment deal with Tehran, known as the JCPoA, said in a joint statement.
A confidential International Atomic Energy Agency report obtained by Reuters said Iran plans to install three more cascades, or clusters, of advanced IR-2m centrifuges in its enrichment plant at Natanz, which was built underground apparently to withstand any aerial bombardment.
Iran's nuclear deal with major powers says Tehran can only use first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, which refine uranium much more slowly, at Natanz and that those are the only machines with which Iran may accumulate enriched stocks.
""Iran's recent announcement to the IAEA that it intends to install an additional three cascades of advanced centrifuges at the Fuel Enrichment Plant in Natanz is contrary to the JCPoA and deeply worrying,"" the three powers said of the U.N. watchdog report, which has yet to be made public.
The powers further said a new law obliging Iran's government to halt U.N. inspections of its nuclear sites and step up enrichment beyond the deal's limits was also incompatible with the accord and Iran’s wider non-proliferation commitments.
""Such a move would jeopardise our shared efforts to preserve the JCPOA and also risks compromising the important opportunity for a return to diplomacy with the incoming U.S. administration,"" they said, referring to Joe Biden, who defeated President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. 
""A return to the JCPOA would also be beneficial for Iran,"" the three added, referring to Tehran's decisions to reverse some of its nuclear commitments in response to the Trump administration's 2018 pull-out from the deal and reimposition of tough sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.

MADRID (Reuters) - When Elena Lorenzo's 86-year-old sister Rosario fell in the middle of the night in her home in Spain's northern Galicia region and her husband struggled to assist her, they knew it was time to get help. But a nursing home was out of the question.
""There had been talk of a nursing home, but that was before COVID,"" Lorenzo said, recalling her sister's fall a few weeks ago.
""An at-home carer will be wary of putting you at risk, plus you stay in your house: you have your slippers, your bed, your decorations.""
Business is booming for Spanish firms offering at-home elderly care, as families shun nursing homes after they became COVID-19 hotspots in the first wave of the pandemic.
Spanish at-home care provider Cuideo saw its client base jump to 25,000 this year from 9,000 last year, and its 90,000 employees are nearly double 2019's 50,000, CEO Roberto Valdes said.
YoCuido, another Spain-based firm whose search engine filters carers by location, ability, and schedule compatibility, said ads from families seeking at-home carers since March were 35% higher than before the pandemic.
""Many people are still afraid (of nursing homes), and even more so of daycare centres, because of the contagion risk transport poses,"" said Ignacio Fernandez, president of Spain's Federation for Dependence, an advocacy group.
State aid for nursing homes lost 15,522 recipients between December and September, the Institute for Social Services and the Elderly said, a 9% drop reflecting COVID deaths and pervasive anxiety.
'NIGHTMARISH'
More than 20,000 people died of COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19 in nursing homes in Spain during the first coronavirus wave, according to preliminary official data reported by El Pais newspaper and broadcaster RTVE. The Health Ministry declined to comment.
""I had a horrendous, nightmarish experience with nursing homes,"" said English teacher Luisa Lamuno, whose mother was in a nursing home before being taken to intensive care in a hospital where she died, officially from a respiratory disease.
She said she regretted that she could not afford to care for her mother at home before the pandemic struck. Many others also do not have the means.
Average state subsidies only cover a couple of hours a week of at-home care, said Jose Manuel Ramirez, president of the state-backed Association for Social Service Advocacy.
To try to address these problems, the government assigned 600 million euros to dependency coverage in its 2021 budget, breaking from policy which left such funding up to regional governments.
Over 1 million elderly Spaniards require care, with the European Aging Network, which represents both individual carers and businesses, projecting that number to reach 2.1 million by 2030. Only 400,000 are in nursing homes, leaving a wide gap for private companies to fill.
""Where there is need, there is business opportunity,"" Ramirez said.
Executives from home care groups Depencare, Cuideo, and YoCuido told Reuters that in a fragmented market largely populated by family-run companies, they expect a wave of consolidation in coming months as investment funds circle.
Cuideo, which recently expanded to Paris, closed a 1.6 million euro venture capital round in July.

One sector that's growing in Spain is where carers come and live in an elderly person's home, said Depencare CEO David Gonzalez, adding: ""about seven of every 10 requests we get are for live-in services.""

Greenpeace said in a statement on Monday it had access to several thousand pages of detailed plans of the Flamanville site, the location of security cameras and descriptions of electronic surveillance systems.
It said it had been given the documents, without asking for them, from a person who had no professional links with the nuclear industry. 
""The way we have received these documents proves that detailed information about a nuclear site circulates among the public,"" Greenpeace chief Jean-François Julliard said. ""In different circumstances, they could have been sold or given to a violent group ... which raises the possibility of intrusion, sabotage or theft of radioactive materials.""
EDF said in a statement it did not know which documents Greenpeace had been given and could not comment on how confidential they are. It added that the plan of the area and the location of security cameras is not classified information as the cameras are visible to any visitor of the site. 

It said that EDF staff and contractors only have access to classified information to the extent that this is required for their job.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Six suspected supporters of a hardline Indonesian Islamic cleric Rizieq Shihab were killed in a clash with police on Monday, Jakarta police chief Fadil Imran told reporters.
The incident occurred just after midnight on a highway when a police car was attacked while following a car believed to be carrying supporters of the cleric, resulting in a shoot out, Fadil said.
The police have been investigating the cleric for violations of health protocols during the pandemic after large gatherings to celebrate his return last month to the world's biggest Muslim majority country from self exile in Saudi Arabia. 
The 55-year-old, a firebrand cleric who heads the Islamic Defender's Front (FPI), a conservative Islamic group that has become politically influential in recent years, left Indonesia in 2017 after facing charges of pornography and insulting state ideology.
Despite the allegations, which his supporters say were untrue and an attempt to discredit him, Rizieq’s self-imposed exile appears to have done little to diminish his appeal.
When he landed in the capital Jakarta, tens of thousands flocked to the airport in white Islamic grab, ignoring coronavirus protocols and clamouring to kiss his hand.
Before he left Indonesia, Rizieq was the figurehead of the hardline '212’ movement that opposed Jakarta’s former Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, better known as 'Ahok', who was accused and ultimately jailed for insulting Islam. 
The rallies were the biggest since the fall of Indonesia’s former authoritarian ruler Suharto, in 1998.
In the weeks since his return, Rizieq has declared his plans to embark on a ""moral crusade"" and has met some politicians and opposition figures.

Officials at the FPI could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday's fatal clash with police.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's opposition Social Democrats (PSD) have taken the lead in Sunday's national election, seen as pivotal for the country's future in the European mainstream, according to a preliminary independent count, but are unlikely to form the next government.
The PSD, which rode a wave of voter discontent over the coronavirus pandemic and the minority Liberal government's pledges of fiscal restraint, will struggle to form a functioning majority against incumbent Prime Minister Ludovic Orban.
President Klaus Iohannis, an ally of the Liberals who gets to nominate the prime minister, has said repeatedly that he will task Orban with forming a centre-right coalition government to rein in a ballooning budget deficit and restore the European Union member state's credibility among foreign investors.
Orban himself claimed victory on Sunday evening after exit polls showed the outcome was too close to call.
A parallel count by independent platform Code for Romania showed early on Monday that the PSD had won 29.7% of votes and the Liberals 25.57% with roughly 96% of ballots counted.
The count does not include roughly 265,000 votes cast in the Romanian diaspora. 
The centrist alliance USR-Plus, a likely coalition partner for the Liberals, won 15.5% of votes. 
FEWER PARTIES IN PARLIAMENT
The next parliament looks set to only have five parties, including ethnic Hungarian UDMR and the newcomer Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR), an ultranationalist grouping.
Partial official results will be released later on Monday.
Parliamentary seat redistributions will change the final percentages and favour the largest parties, but analysts said the Liberals and USR-Plus would probably need to co-opt another grouping in parliament to gain a majority.
""It is a weak result for the Liberal Party,"" said Sergiu Miscoiu, a professor of political science at Babes-Bolyai University. ""The more parties it needs to form a coalition the more complicated the compromises it will have to make.""
Turnout was the lowest since the 1989 fall of communism, with decades of voter apathy over failed reforms compounded by fears over coronavirus contagion in polling stations.
The EU would welcome a government led by Orban, after years of efforts by a succession of PSD Romanian cabinets to suppress the independence of the courts - a charge they denied - that mirrored overhauls of the judiciary in Poland and Hungary.

Orban also campaigned on a promise to bring Romania closer to the EU mainstream following years of fiscal populism, political instability and neglect of rundown infrastructure and public services.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is preparing to impose sanctions on at least a dozen Chinese officials over their alleged role in Beijing's disqualification of elected opposition legislators in Hong Kong, according to three sources, including a U.S. official familiar with the matter.
The move, which could come as soon as Monday, will target officials from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) as President Donald Trump's administration keeps up pressure on Beijing in his final weeks in office. President-elect Joe Biden takes over on January 20.
The State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Up to 14 people, including officials of China's parliament, or National People's Congress, and members of the CCP, would likely be targeted by measures such as asset freezes and financial sanctions, two sources said. 
The U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said multiple individuals would be sanctioned. A person familiar with the matter said the group would likely include officials from Hong Kong as well as the mainland. The sources did not provide names or positions of those being targeted for sanctions. Two sources cautioned an announcement could still be delayed until later in the week.
""China has always firmly opposed and strongly condemned U.S. interference in China's domestic affairs through the Hong Kong issue,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news briefing in Beijing on Monday, in response to a question on the Reuters report. 
Stock markets in Asia gave up early gains on worries the move may signal a further deterioration in relations between the world's two largest economies. 
""One thing that the market has been concerned about is that on his 'Out of office' Trump would look for some retribution on China. So this news speaks to that fear,"" said Kyle Rodda, market strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne.
Chinese financial stocks traded in Hong Kong fell 2.3% in morning trade, their sharpest drop in six months amid worries sanctions could be extended to banks.
STAND-OFF GROWS
In October, the U.S. State Department warned international financial institutions doing business with individuals deemed responsible for China’s crackdown in the Asian financial hub that they could soon face tough sanctions.
Washington has already put sanctions on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, the territory's current and former police chiefs and other top officials in August for what it said was their role in curtailing freedoms in a crackdown on the territory’s pro-democracy movement.
Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government last month expelled four opposition members from its legislature after China's parliament gave city authorities new powers to curb dissent. The move triggered mass resignations by pro-democracy opposition lawmakers in the former British colony.
It also raised further alarm in the West. The Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group - made up of Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States - said last month the move appeared to be part of a campaign to silence critics and called on Beijing to reverse course.
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said in November the expulsion showed the ""One Country, Two Systems"" formula, under which Hong Kong's autonomy had been promised since Britain handed the territory back to China in 1997, was now ""merely a fig leaf"" and promised further U.S. action.
That month, the State Department and Treasury Department imposed sanctions on four more Chinese officials in Hong Kong's government and security establishment, barring them from traveling to the United States and blocking any U.S.-related assets they might have.
Hong Kong is expected to be one of Biden’s thorniest challenges with China, which will be high on his foreign policy agenda with relations between Washington and Beijing at the lowest point in decades over an array of disputes. 

Biden has promised to take a tougher line than Trump over human rights in China and other countries, so his response to the crackdown in Hong Kong could be an early test of that resolve.

ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghanaians started voting in elections on Monday in which President Nana Akufo-Addo and his main rival, former president John Mahama, are each offering plans to help the economy rebound from its first quarterly contraction in nearly 40 years.
Eyes are on the West African economic powerhouse to see if it can maintain its standing as a bastion of democracy in the unstable region where election disputes this year have fanned fears of a slide back into authoritarianism.
There are 12 presidential candidates, but most voters are likely to choose between Akufo-Addo and his New Patriotic Party, and Mahama's National Democratic Congress, which have alternated in power since 1992. A new parliament will also be elected. 
Last year Ghana emerged from a three-year lending programme with the International Monetary Fund only for the new coronavirus to knock demand for its key exports of oil and cocoa. 
If re-elected for a second four-year term, Akufo-Addo is promising to push ahead with a $17 billion recovery programme to boost jobs, while Mahama's keystone pledge is a $10 billion infrastructure plan.
A long line of voters stretched out of a polling station and down the road in Tema West district of the capital Accra. 
First-time voter Efua Opoku-Ware, 18, said she was voting ""for a better leader who will address the unemployment situation and give hope to the youth for a better future"", declining to say which candidate she had picked. 
The race is expected to be tight, though commentators say Akufo-Addo has a slight lead based on his performance during the pandemic, in which his administration provided free water and subsidised electricity to households. 
""He has brought hope to many Ghanaians through his social interventions. It's been a difficult year,"" said 45-year-old businesswoman Evelyn Amey.
The two sides agreed on Friday to resolve any electoral disputes in court, after fears that unofficial security groups hired by politicians could disrupt the vote.
Polls opened at 7 a.m. (0700 GMT) and close at 5 p.m. Results are expected no later than Dec. 10, but will likely come sooner.

In recent weeks, Hong Kong has dismissed opposition lawmakers, jailed high-profile activists including Joshua Wong, and denied bail to media tycoon Jimmy Lai, 73, an ardent critic of Beijing who owns the anti-government tabloid, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily.
Police said eight males aged between 16 and 34 were arrested for illegal assembly at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and three of them - who were not students at the university - were also arrested on supicion of inciting secession. 
The arrested included social workers and district councillors. 
About 90 graduating students, many wearing black robes, wearing Guy Fawkes masks and carrying black balloons, staged a peaceful protest last month on the university's sprawling campus where they carried anti-government banners and chanted democracy slogans. 
""We only arrested them who were shouting the slogan and displaying the flags (that) involved some national security concerns,"" Steve Li, Senior Superintendent of the police’s National Security Department, said at a press conference, referring to slogans deemed pro-independent. 
Officers from the national security department went to the campus in an apparent search for evidence after the university contacted authorities. 
On Britain's handover of Hong Kong to Beijing in 1997, the city was guaranteed wide-ranging freedoms under a ""one country, two systems"" formula for 50 years. But, democracy activists and critics of the government fear those freedoms are being eroded more swiftly.
The squeeze on opposition forces has been widely condemned by the West and human rights groups, which fear authorities are using the security law to crush much-cherished freedoms not seen on the mainland, including freedom of speech and assembly. 
Beijing and Hong Kong officials deny that claim and say the security legislation is necessary to bring stability to the global financial hub after anti-government protests over the past year that plunged the city into chaos.

Australian white supremacist Brenton Tarrant was sentenced to life in prison without parole in August for killing 51 Muslim worshippers and injuring dozens of others at two mosques in the South Island city on March 15, 2019.
The findings of a royal commission inquiry into the attack will be made public in parliament on Tuesday. The inquiry was formed to look at whether there were any failings by government agencies and if the mass shooting could have been prevented.
""I absolutely appreciate the community will want to see accountability in terms of implementation. They will want to see who is responsible for coordinating some of those efforts...and we will be providing that,"" Ardern told a regular media briefing.
The 792-page report took about 18 months to finish, and contains interviews with hundreds of people including security agencies, Muslim community leaders, international experts and officials in England, Norway and Australia, along with Ardern.
Ardern received global praise for her compassionate response to the attack and for swiftly banning the sale of the high-capacity semi-automatic weapons used in the attack. She also launched a global movement against online extremism.
However, authorities were criticised for ignoring repeated warnings from the Muslim community that hate crimes against them were escalating. Critics also said security agencies failed to record hate crimes, and ignored the growing threat from white supremacists because they were too focused on the risk of Islamist terrorism. 

Ardern met with the family members of victims and some survivors on Sunday and promised immediate action on the royal commission report, but said some recommendations may take time to implement.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Christmas tree farms in Australia are already shutting up shop this year, as pandemic-weary consumers eager for some festive joy spurn plastic versions and seek out fresh pine trees to spruce up their homes.
""People have had a tough year and they wanted to get to Christmas sooner rather than later this year,"" said William Cappello, owner of Willy's Christmas tree farm in Sydney, which will close early after selling out for the first time since 2001.
Because it takes up to four years to grow an eight-foot pine, Christmas tree sellers struggle to manage sudden disruptions to demand and all they can do is warn customers when stocks are running low, added Cappello.
In the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, Top Forty Orchard Christmas Tree Farm owner Lynette Keanelly said her trees had sold out, leaving her with nothing to do but take reservations for Christmas 2021.
""People are keen to tag a tree even if they can't get one for this year. They are keen to tag one for next year,"" she said. ""They are looking to the future.""
Shoppers acknowledged that the challenges of the year had made them keen to end it with something uplifting.
""2020's been just an awful, awful year for everybody,"" said a government employee who only gave her first name Sharon and was one of the last people through the doors of Willy's for the year.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's government is likely to approve the recommendation by the country's National Security Council before the end of the year, although any decision on type of vessel or cost will be left until next year, the paper said, citing unidentified sources.
A defence ministry spokesman declined to comment.
Deploying the new Aegis radars could cost twice as much and take up to three years longer to complete than the ground-based versions, which were expected cost of around $2 billion to build, a source with knowledge of the proposal told Reuters earlier.
In June, then defence minister Taro Kono suspended plans for two Aegis Ashore sites, citing the possibility that interceptor missile booster rockets could fall on nearby residents. 
Fitted with  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) SPY-7 radars that will have at least three times the range of older Aegis systems deployed on Japanese navy destroyers, the upgrade will allow Japan to use new interceptor missiles to target warheads in space fired by North Korea or other potential foes, including China and Russia.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU foreign ministers will evaluate grounds for sanctions against Turkey over a Mediterranean gas dispute on Monday before the bloc's leaders decide whether to make good on their threat to impose punitive measures.
Ministers will not take decisions at their meeting on Monday, leaving that to Thursday's summit of EU leaders, who in October told Turkey to stop exploring in disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean or face consequences. 
Turkey's move in late November to return a seismic exploration vessel to port has calmed tension, but EU officials and diplomats said broader issues - over Libya, Syria, Russia and authoritarianism in Turkey - have hardened EU positions.
""I'm not aware of any EU government challenging the view that the situation is worse than October and that leaders should consider the consequences,"" said a senior EU official. ""We have been requesting a change that has not come.""
The European Union says Turkish drill and survey ships have continued to work in waters contested by Greece and Cyprus, which Greece says makes formal talks with Turkey over maritime claims impossible.
European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs EU summits, called on Turkey last week to stop playing a ""cat-and-mouse"" game by offering concessions only to reverse them.
Germany, current holder of the EU's six-month presidency, holds the key to whether sanctions go ahead. It had hoped to mediate between Athens and Ankara, but was angered when Turkey resumed exploration for gas off Cyprus in October after a pause.
""Putting the (Oruc Reis) exploration ship back to sea straight after the (October) summit was not taken kindly by member states that put a lot of effort in with Turkey and Greece. There are limits even to German patience,"" said a EU diplomat familiar with the preparations for the summit. 
France and the European Parliament say it is time to punish Turkey, a NATO ally and candidate to join the EU that is seen in Brussels as fuelling the gas dispute for domestic politics.
Turkey rejects EU talk of sanctions, saying it is not constructive.
The EU parliament called for sanctions on Nov. 26, but the return of the Oruc Reis to port and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's call for dialogue may give the EU reasons to hold off for now.

""Sanctions are on the table, but they're not automatic,"" the EU diplomat said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's second-largest city welcomed its first international passenger flight in five months on Monday, an arrival that will test the state of Victoria's revamped hotel quarantine system.
Australia has since March closed its borders to non-citizens, but airports serving Melbourne, Victoria's capital, stopped accepting any arrivals in late June after an outbreak of COVID-19 that begun at two hotels where arrivals were quarantining.
More than 20,000 infections were recorded in Victoria when hotel staff contracted the virus from people returning from overseas.
The outbreak has been widely blamed on failures of private contractors to follow protocol. With hundreds of people expected to arrive in Victoria each week, state authorities have said police officers will now enforce stricter standards.
The new system will greet Australians arriving on a flight from Sri Lanka, who will now no longer be allowed to leave their rooms under the new hotel quarantine restrictions.
The system is similar to the model used in Sydney, capital of New South Wales (NSW), Australia's largest state, which has accommodated thousands of people returning without any clusters emerging.
With NSW recording just one local infection in the last month, the state has gradually eased most social distancing restrictions.
Australia has reported about 28,000 cases of COVID-19 and 908 deaths since the pandemic began. Just 44 active cases remain in the country, with most in hotel quarantine.

The blaze has already destroyed half the island off Australia's northeastern coast, which is part of the Great Barrier Reef and famous for its tropical rainforest on sand dunes, and inland lakes.
""A large fire is traveling in a southeasterly direction towards Happy Valley township on Fraser Island. It is expected to impact Happy Valley township around 7 am,"" Queensland state Fire and Emergency Services said in a statement issued Monday early morning.
""Conditions are now very dangerous and firefighters may soon be unable to prevent the fire advancing.""
Power, water, and mobile phone service may be lost and road conditions may become very dangerous over the next several hours, authorities said.
Anyone near the township in the world's largest sand island, also known by its indigenous name K'gari, have been asked to move to the beaches or head south.
An intense heatwave sweltered Australia's southeast and northeast in recent days with temperatures reaching well above 40 degree Celsius (104 degree Fahrenheit) in several places.
This has also raised the risk of bushfires with total fire bans enforced in several regions amid the first major heatwave of the fire season, which usually runs from late southern hemisphere spring through summer.
Last summer's bush fires razed more than 11 million hectares (37 million acres) of bushland, killing 33 people and billions of native animals, a disaster that Prime Minister Scott Morrison called Australia's ""black summer"".

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>","Insecurity holds up aid to Ethiopia's Tigray region, aid workers say","ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia's northern Tigray region is too volatile for aid to reach hundreds of thousands of civilians in need, humanitarian workers said on Sunday, amid reports of persistent fighting, looting and lawlessness.
Aid agencies have warned of a lack of food, medication and body bags in Tigray, where 600,000 people were already receiving food aid before a month of fighting began between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and a rebellious regional force.
Abiy declared victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) after federal troops captured the regional capital Mekelle eight days ago, saying not a single civilian had been killed in the offensive.
However, a doctor reached in the city on Sunday told Reuters that at least 27 people - including a 4-year-old, a 78-year-old and a family of four - had died in the offensive. Two others were killed and four seriously wounded when residents blocked roads to protest looting by government forces in Mekelle, the doctor said. 
Medical services in the city were at breaking point, he said.
“No light, no fuel for back up generator, no gloves, no anti-pain (medication), no antibiotics, no meals for patients and staff, no bank access - even our ambulance was taken by the soldiers,"" the doctor said in a text message, asking that he and his hospital not be named for fear of reprisals. 
Government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Claims by all sides have been difficult to verify because most communications are down, and the government has tightly controlled media and humanitarian access since the conflict began on Nov. 4. 
REPORTS OF CLASHES
Abiy's rapid declaration of victory came as his government sought to soothe concerns at home and abroad that the conflict could destabilise Africa's second most populous country and the wider Horn of Africa region. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed and around 46,000 have fled to Ethiopia's western neighbour, Sudan. 
The TPLF said it had pulled out of Mekelle to avoid destroying the city but has vowed to keep fighting.
Sporadic clashes persist in areas outside the city, according to residents, diplomats and the TPLF. 
On Friday, residents also reported looting and protests within Mekelle.
Government officials have declined to comment on what they describe as unverified accounts of continued conflict. However, an emergency taskforce on Tigray said federal forces ""are not looting their own people.""
""Considering the initial security gap until the provisional administration [was] set up, there were indications of individuals engaged in looting using the transition as a cover,"" the taskforce said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday.
""Some of the criminal group’s foot soldiers are also hiding in Mekelle,"" the statement continued, referring to the TPLF. 
CIVILIANS IN NEED
Ethiopia and the United Nations reached an agreement last week to allow desperately needed relief into government-controlled areas of Tigray. 
However, two senior aid officials told Reuters on Sunday that looting and lawlessness meant the region was still too volatile to dispatch convoys. Some U.N. staff in Mekelle have faced harassment from security forces, they said.
Families turning up at an aid agency office in the central town of Shire had to be turned away because there was nothing to give them, the two officials said.
""The shortage of basic commodities including food, water fuel, cash, is affecting everyone, including humanitarians,"" Saviano Abreu, the regional head for the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told Reuters.
The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's government for nearly three decades, until Abiy took power in 2018 and speeded up democratic reforms. 
The party accuses Abiy of seeking to centralise power at the expense of Ethiopia's 10 regions and says Tigrayan officials were unfairly targeted in a crackdown on corruption and rights abuses. 
Tensions escalated when Tigray held a regional election in September in defiance of the government, which postponed voting nationwide due to COVID-19. 

The government rejects the TPLF's accusations and has accused TPLF leaders of treason for attacking federal forces stationed in Tigray.

A crowd of demonstrators converged on the Indian embassy, located on Aldwych, a major artery in the centre of the British capital, and groups marched around the Trafalgar Square area.
Tens of thousands of farmers have protested in India against three laws the government says are meant to overhaul antiquated procurement procedures and give growers more options to sell their produce.
Farmers fear the legislation, passed in September, will eventually dismantle India's regulated markets and stop the government from buying wheat and rice at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers.
Britain is home to a large Indian diaspora and many Britons who trace their family roots to India are strongly engaged with news from the country.
There was little social distancing in evidence at the London protests and few participants were wearing face masks, a Reuters photographer at the scene said.
The Metropolitan Police said it had arrested 13 people for breaching restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, and that four of those people were later released after being issued with fines.
Police also confiscated fireworks from teenagers who were seen setting them off towards a crowd. There were no reports of injuries, and traffic was flowing freely after the crowds dispersed.

The British author, who died in 1990 aged 74, remains popular with young readers around the world and several of his books such as ""The BFG"", ""Matilda"", ""Fantastic Mr Fox"" and most recently ""The Witches"", have been turned into movies and stage shows.
However, controversy has occasionally flared up over anti-Semitic comments, particularly those made in a 1983 interview with Britain's New Statesman magazine.
""There is a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity, maybe it's a kind of lack of generosity towards non-Jews,"" he said, adding that ""even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason"".
In a statement on the official website of the organisations that manage his legacy, copyrights and trademarks and a museum dedicated to him, the Dahl family apologised for what they said was the lasting and understandable hurt his remarks had caused.
""Those prejudiced remarks are incomprehensible to us and stand in marked contrast to the man we knew and to the values at the heart of Roald Dahl's stories, which have positively impacted young people for generations,"" they said.
""We hope that, just as he did at his best, at his absolute worst, Roald Dahl can help remind us of the lasting impact of words.""
The director Steven Spielberg was asked about Dahl's anti-Semitic comments in 2016, when he was at the Cannes film festival promoting his adaptation of The BFG. 
Spielberg said he had been unaware of the comments when he took on the project, adding the book was about embracing differences and that was the value he had sought to impart in telling the story.
Other high-profile adaptations of Dahl's works have included two big-budget movie versions of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Fantastic Mr Fox, and a stage musical version of Matilda that has been a hit in London and on Broadway.

A new movie version of Dahl's The Witches, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Anne Hathaway as the Grand High Witch, was recently released on HBO Max by studio Warner Brothers.

    Most protesters marched in remote residential areas of the capital, clapping hands, shouting ""long live Belarus"" and waving white flags with a red stripe in the middle, a symbol of the opposition.
    ""This (protest) does work as it is impossible to rule the country when the majority does not accept you. With protests we are showing that we are the majority,"" said one of the protesters Alisa, 21.
    Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years, has shrugged off the scale of protests, saying they are sponsored by the West, and shown little signs of willingness to start a dialogue with the opposition.
    Military vehicles and water cannon were seen on Minsk streets on Sunday, while uniformed men, many in helmets, grabbed people in civilian clothes, a witness aid and videos posted on social media showed.
    In Minsk alone, the police detained more than 300 people accused of ""violating the law on mass events"", Russia's TASS news agency quoted the Belarus interior ministry as saying.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has urged political forces in Belarus to try to resolve differences through dialogue, and also said the ex-Soviet republic, a close Moscow ally, was facing unprecedented meddling by external forces.

Russia's backing is seen as vital for Lukashenko's chances of staying in power and its statements are closely scrutinised for changes in tone or any sign that Moscow could be pushing for some kind of managed power transition.

MONTEVIDEO (Reuters) - Tabaré Vázquez, an oncologist who became the first centre-left politician to be elected president of Uruguay and won popularity for a mix of pro-business policies and strong welfare programs, died on Sunday at the age of 80 after a battle with lung cancer.
Vázquez, who served as the South American country's leader from 2005-2010 and 2015-2020, was diagnosed with cancer last year. The Broad Front coalition he belonged to ran Uruguay for 15 years up until elections last year.
His son, Alvaro Vázquez, said he died at home, in the presence of family and friends. ""On behalf of the family, we want to thank all Uruguayans for the love received by him over so many years,"" he tweeted. 
Uruguay's President Luis Lacalle Pou announced three days of national mourning, describing the former president as someone who ""served his country and worked hard to achieve great things.""
The Broad Front said in a statement after news of the death that ""his example of political integrity and unwavering commitment to our country and the people will drive us to continue his legacy.""
The son of a union leader, Vázquez was born into a working-class neighborhood in the capital Montevideo on Jan. 17, 1940. He worked a set of disparate menial jobs while pursuing his goal to study medicine and later specialized in oncology, only turning to political activism at 43.
""Ever since I was a boy I liked biology and medicine but I never even dreamed of being a mayor or a lawmaker,"" he wrote in his 2003 book ""Conversations with Tabaré Vázquez.""
He formally joined the Socialist Party in 1983, when the tiny cattle-farming nation of 3.4 million people was living under a 12-year military dictatorship, and moved fast through the ranks of the umbrella Frente Amplio coalition, serving as mayor of Montevideo from 1990 to 1994.
""He had the sensitivity that you get from growing up in poverty but coupled with the knowledge that the study provides to those who had the opportunity to go to university,"" Juan Salgado, a businessman who was a childhood friend and advisor of Vázquez, told Reuters.
ANTI-POVERTY PUSH
Vázquez ran twice for the presidency in 1994 and 1999 before eventually winning the top job in 2004, taking office the following year.
He was known for his anti-poverty policies and efforts to strengthen unions and bolster the social safety net, which helped kick-start a decade of robust growth and slashed poverty after a deep crisis in the early 2000s. But the opposition accused him of creating a ""welfare state."" 
He pushed for answers in the cases of hundreds of people who disappeared during the dictatorship and won international notoriety for adopting a fierce anti-smoking campaign that required cigarette sellers to include graphic health warnings on their packaging, generating a legal challenge from tobacco firm Philip Morris (NYSE:PM) which Uruguay ultimately won. 
Since Uruguay's constitution bans presidents from running for consecutive terms, he stepped down in 2010 and was replaced by ex-guerrilla José Mujica, also of the Broad Front, who famously legalized the use and production of cannabis. 
Vázquez returned to office for a second term in 2015 which coincided with a slowdown in economic growth due to global trade woes and the effects of drought and flooding on the country's key farm sector. 
There was also the blow of the 2017 resignation of Raúl Sendic, his vice president, over corruption allegations.

Bigger, more personal blows came in 2019 when his wife María Auxiliadora Delgado died and he announced only days later that a malignant tumor had appeared in one of his lungs.

The symptoms appear “to be consistent with the effects of directed, pulsed radio frequency energy,” said the report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering.
Diplomats in some postings have been plagued with nausea, headache, dizziness and other unexplained symptoms. This ""Havana syndrome"" has long been the subject of intense speculation, given the nature of the symptoms, the location of the postings, and the silence of the US government.
Saturday's report marks the first time Washington has officially offered an explanation, although inconclusive.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in October that ""significant U.S. government resources"" had been dedicated to solving the mystery, in which more than 40 U.S. government employees were affected between 2016 into 2018. 
The State Department said in June 2018 that it had brought home diplomats from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering similar symptoms. 
In addition to directed radio frequency, Saturday's report left open “the possibility of multiple causal factors including psychological and social factors.""
NBC News and the New York Times first reported the findings of the report.

“We are pleased this report is now out and can add to the data and analyses that may help us come to an eventual conclusion as to what transpired,” the New York Times quoted the State Department as saying.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's anti-graft agency named Social Affairs Minister Juliari Batubara on Sunday as a suspect in a million-dollar bribery case, along with four others, while President Joko Widodo warned officials against misuse of public funds.
He becomes the second cabinet minister to be designated a suspect by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) over the last few weeks, following fisheries minister Edhy Prabowo, although in a separate case. 
Juliari and two officials are suspected of taking bribes over the procurement of goods worth 5.9 trillion rupiah ($420 million) to be distributed as COVID-19 social assistance packages, agency chief Firli Bahuri said.
Some suspects were arrested in a sting operation on Saturday in the capital, Jakarta, where the agency found cash of 14.5 billion rupiah, or $1.03 million, Firli told a news briefing.
""The money was stored in seven suitcases, three backpacks, and in envelopes,"" he added. Suitcases of cash were put on display at the briefing.
Two more suspects are private citizens, Firli said.
Juliari was being questioned and will be taken into custody, said agency spokesman Ali Fikri. 
Widodo said he had continually warned ministers and regional leaders to avoid corruption and close loopholes for graft. 
""That social assistance is really needed by the people and I will not protect those involved in corruption,"" he said in a video statement on Sunday. 
""And we all believe that the KPK works in a transparent, open, professional manner and the government will continue to consistently support efforts to prevent and eradicate corruption."" 
The social affairs ministry will give the anti-graft agency full access to information needed for its investigation, said senior ministry official Hartono Laras. 
Widodo was elected in 2014 on a pledge to fight graft and several prominent politicians have been jailed for corruption, but concern has nevertheless grown that the anti-graft agency's clout has weakened during his tenure.

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Opposition candidates made gains in a parliamentary vote in Kuwait in which two thirds of MPs lost their seats and no women were elected, a result which analysts said could hamper government reform efforts to address a severe liquidity crunch.
Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who took the reins in September following the death of his brother, had raised hopes of a detente between the ruling family and their critics in the perpetually deadlocked and fractious parliament. 
The final count carried on state media on Sunday showed that 31 new lawmakers had been elected to the 50-seat assembly, which is unusually outspoken for the highly authoritarian Gulf region. None of the 29 female candidates who stood in the election were successful.
There was no official figure for turnout but local media said it was higher than expected given concerns about COVID-19, which along with low oil prices have battered state finances in the wealthy OPEC member state.
The results have strengthened the hand of tribal and Islamist candidates. Kuwaiti opposition figures have proposed electoral reforms and a pardon for dissidents, many in self-exile, to the new emir.
""The results achieved by opposition were bigger than expected. There was a will to turn the table on those allied with the government,"" said political analyst Mohamad al-Dosayri.
Another Kuwaiti analyst, Nasser al-Abdali, said the new make-up of parliament would likely lead to squabbling over issues such as a debt law that has long-faced legislative gridlock and election laws.
Many may oppose any austerity measures in the cradle-to-grave welfare state, needed to slash heavy deficits, or raising the government's debt ceilings, the two analysts said.
Frequent rows and deadlocks between cabinet and parliament have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament, hampering investment and economic and fiscal reform. 
Kuwait's economy, which is worth nearly $140 billion, is facing a deficit of $46 billion this year. A government priority is to pass a bill that would allow Kuwait to tap international debt markets.
The new assembly is due to meet on Dec. 15, state news agency KUNA reported.
Emir Sheikh Nawaf on Sunday accepted the resignation of the cabinet of Prime Minister Sabah Al Khalid Al Sabah in a routine procedure following the elections. The emir will appoint a premier to select a new cabinet.
Late ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad broke the hold of opposition groups on parliament in 2012 by using executive powers to amend the voting system, sparking large protests.
Under the old electoral system, voters were allowed to cast ballots for up to four candidates, which the opposition says allowed alliances that partly made up for the absence of political parties, which are officially barred.

The system introduced in 2012 allows votes for only a single candidate, which the opposition says makes alliances difficult.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of incoming Moldovan president Maia Sandu rallied in Chisinau on Sunday to demand a snap parliamentary election, accusing parliament of trying to sabotage her ability to fight corruption. 
Sandu, a former World Bank economist who favours closer ties with the European Union, defeated the pro-Moscow incumbent Igor Dodon in a run-off vote last month but will share power with a parliament and government run by lawmakers aligned with Dodon.
The eastern European country of 3.5 million, where the West and Russia vie for influence, has been rocked in recent years by instability and corruption scandals, including the disappearance of $1 billion from the banking system.
Sandu's supporters protested after parliament on Thursday hastily pushed through a law to strip her of control of the intelligence service.
The move was backed by the Socialist party, which Dodon used to lead and is the largest in parliament, and the party of Ilan Shor, a businessman convicted of fraud and money-laundering in connection to the $1 billion bank scandal. 
Shor denies wrongdoing and is fighting an appeal against his conviction. 
""This majority adopts laws that strip the powers of the president so that we cannot fight corruption and thieves. These laws are intended to preserve the criminal schemes of thieves,"" Sandu said at Sunday's rally. 
""We will go to the end until we cleanse the country of corrupt officials.""
Waving Moldovan flags and shouting ""to prison"" and ""resign"", the protesters called for parliament to be dissolved and Sandu to set the date for a snap election. 
Parliament also passed legislation at the first reading that would give special status to the Russian language, which is widely spoken alongside Romanian in the country that borders Ukraine and EU member state Romania. It also lifted restrictions on broadcasting Russian TV channels.

Separately on Sunday, hundreds of farmers parked tractors and combine harvesters on the outskirts of Chisinau to protest a hike in value added tax (VAT) in the government's 2021 budget.

Hui told Reuters via social media WhatsApp that bank accounts belonging to him, his wife and his parents at Bank of China Hong Kong, HSBC and Hang Seng Bank were frozen. He gave no further details.
Democracy activists say conditions have worsened in the former British colony after China imposed security legislation on the financial hub in June, making anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or colluding with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.
China, which promises Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, denies curbing rights and freedoms, but authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing have moved swiftly to quash dissent after anti-government protests erupted last year and engulfed the city. 
Local media reported that at least five accounts worth hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars belonging to Hui and his family had been inaccessible since Saturday. 
Hui contacted the banks and was told there were ""remarks"" placed on his accounts, but the staff refused to provide further information, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported.
""We do not comment on the details of individual accounts,"" a Hang Seng Bank spokesman told Reuters by email. HSBC and Bank of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Hong Kong police said late on Sunday that they were investigating a Hong Kong person, who had absconded overseas with bank accounts being frozen, for suspected money laundering and possible violation of the new national security law. 
It was not immediately clear who police were referring to.
Hui said on Thursday he had fled Hong Kong after facing criminal charges and would seek exile in Britain.
One of the pro-democracy activists arrested last month and charged with disturbing legislature proceedings, Hui arrived in Copenhagen last week on an invitation from Danish lawmakers.
Hong Kong's Security Bureau issued a statement on Friday that, while not naming Hui, said ""running away by jumping bail and using various excuses such as so-called 'exile' to avoid one's responsibility is a shameful, hypocritical and cowardly act of recoil"".
Hui was one of several opposition lawmakers who quit Hong Kong's Legislative Council last month in protest at the dismissal of four colleagues in what they called another push by Beijing to suppress democracy in the city.

YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroon holds its first ever regional election on Sunday, which the government says hands more power to the provinces but opponents fear only maintains President Paul Biya's long hold on power. 
Biya hopes the vote will appease critics who say he has long neglected the Central African country's 10 regions, and end a four-year separatist insurgency in the English-speaking west which has become the greatest threat to his near 40-year rule.
Separatist fighters have vowed to disrupt the vote in the Northwest and Southwest regions.
Local representatives will vote to appoint councils in all 10 regions made up of regional delegates and traditional rulers, putting into action a 1996 law that promised decentralised government but was never enacted. 
The councils will have a say over development, including infrastructure such as roads, but they will not be able to alter laws enacted by the national assembly and the senate in Yaounde. 
Opponents say the vote offers only the semblance of regional autonomy, and comes too late to fix the conflict. Officials voting in the election are overwhelmingly Biya supporters and will help enforce his will on the regions, they say. 
""It is not because we will have regional delegates that gunshots will stop and everything will be all right,"" said Cameroonian political analyst Stephane Akoa. 
Separatist fighters said they will arrest anyone participating. There were no early reports of disruptions, but gunfire was heard around the Northwest city of Kumbo, a local official said. 
The separatist conflict has killed more than 3,000 people and forced 500,000 from their homes. It started in 2016 when the police cracked down on peaceful protests in the west by lawyers and teachers demanding they be allowed to work in English.
The movement became radicalised and militias began fighting for the creation of a breakaway state.

TOKYO/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Japan has retrieved a capsule of asteroid dust from Australia's remote outback after a six-year mission that may help uncover more about the origins of the planets and water, the Asian nation's space agency said on Sunday. 
The mission of the Japanese spacecraft, Hayabusa2, spotlights Asia's growing role in space exploration, with a Chinese robotic vehicle collecting lunar samples last week for the first time since the 1970s.
A helicopter flew the capsule from the unmanned craft, containing the first extensive samples of asteroid dust, from the landing site in Australia's desert to a domestic research facility of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).
""The probe landed on the asteroid twice, and the second time it created an artificial crater and collected some debris,"" agency president Hiroshi Yamakawa told a news conference.
""I hope this will shed light on how the solar system was formed and how water was brought to Earth.""
The capsule may also contain some gas, which will be extracted in Australia, Yamakawa added. 
The spacecraft, launched in 2014 from Japan's Tanegashima space centre, journeyed for four years to the asteroid Ryugu, where it gathered a sample and headed home in November 2019.
Spectators gathered at a theatre near the Japanese capital of Tokyo to view the return clapped and waved banners in NHK footage, with one woman in tears. They wore masks and kept a distance from each other as precautions against the coronavirus.
Asteroids are believed to have formed at the dawn of the solar system, and scientists say the sample may contain organic matter that could have contributed to life on Earth.
""What we are really doing here is trying to sample this pristine rock that has not been irradiated by the sun,"" astrophysicist Lisa Harvey-Smith told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
Gases trapped in the rock samples could reveal more about conditions prevailing about 4.6 billion years ago, she added.
The retrieval of the capsule also highlights close technical cooperation between Japan and Australia. 
""Our job supporting JAXA will not be complete until we see the sample... safely leaves Australia and returns to Japan,"" Megan Clark, head of the Australian Space Agency, told the news conference.
""And then the sample will start to tell its stories and reveal to us some wonderful signs about how water arrived on our Earth and how we even may have been formed, such as our organics, carbon-based animals, humans, and plants.""
Japan's craft, named for the peregrine falcon, a bird of prey, orbited above the asteroid for a few months to map its surface before landing. It used small explosives to blast a crater and collected the resulting debris.
After Hayabusa2 dropped off the capsule, it changed course and headed back into space.

The capsule lit up on re-entry into the atmosphere early on Sunday and landed in the Woomera restricted area, about 460 km (285 miles) north of Adelaide, the space agency said.

Since it was sparked by an illegal campfire seven weeks ago, the blaze has blackened half the island off Australia's north eastern coast, which is part of the Great Barrier Reef and famed for its tropical rainforest on sand dunes, and inland lakes. 
Residents of Happy Valley had a small reprieve after the blaze lessened in intensity on Sunday afternoon, Queensland state emergency services commissioner Greg Leach told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 
""We now don't anticipate that that fire will run into the Happy Valley settlement today but we'll continue to work hard,"" Leach said. 
""We will continue to have aircraft on the fire from first light tomorrow to try and knock that fire down as best we can.""
Officials said that there were more than 90 personnel, 38 vehicles and 17 aircraft working on Fraser Island, including a large air tanker based in the state for the bushfire season and another tanker on the way from New South Wales state. 
Queensland's emergency services urged residents to evacuate late on Sunday afternoon. 
""Leaving immediately is the safest option, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive,"" the state's Fire and Emergency Services said on social media. ""Any persons in the vicinity of Happy Valley township should leave the area."" 
Baking temperatures across Queensland last week caused peak bushfire conditions, with emergency services currently attending to 48 fires, Leach said. 

Australia has been experiencing hotter and longer summers, with last season dubbed ""Black Summer"" by Prime Minister Scott Morrison due to unusually prolonged and intense bushfires that burned nearly 12 million hectares (30 million acres) and killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion animals.

The queen is highly admired in British society, and her public backing for the vaccine would be a powerful message to counter anti-vaccination misinformation circulating online.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz will appear in a Geneva court next month to defend himself against corruption and forgery charges in connection with mining contracts in Guinea, his lawyer told Reuters. 
Steinmetz was indicted in August 2019 by a Geneva prosecutor who accused him and two aides of paying or having $10 million in bribes paid to one of the wives of former Guinean President Lansana Conte for mining licences between 2005 and 2010. 
""There are two charges, corruption and forgery. Both are categorically contested. The charges have no basis in fact or in law,"" Marc Bonnant, a prominent Geneva lawyer representing Steinmetz, told Reuters on Friday.
The lawyer questioned whether the late Conte was married to Mamadie Toure, named as a spouse of the late president in the indictment, during that time. Reuters attempted to contact Toure through social media, but she could not immediately be reached for comment.
""Beny Steinmetz never paid a cent to Mme. Mamadie Toure. Mamadie Toure was not the wife of the president (Lansana Conte) and she is not a public agent and therefore cannot be corrupted,"" Bonnant said.
""Beny Steinmetz never signed forged documents, he was never an instigator of the signature of forged documents,"" he added.
Bonnant, asked whether Steinmetz, a former Geneva resident who moved back to Israel in 2016, would attend the trial, said: ""He came to all the pre-trial hearings where he was asked to appear. And naturally he will attend the trial.""
The trial had been expected early this year, but was delayed by the closure of the Swiss judicial system for several months during the COVID-19 pandemic. A second source close to the case confirmed that the proceedings were set for Jan. 11-22.
Claudio Mascotto, a Geneva prosecutor who began the investigation in the Swiss city where allegedly some of the bribes transited, said last year he was seeking prison terms of between two and 10 years for Steinmetz and his two associates.
Mascotto is no longer handling the case and has been replaced by two other prosecutors, Bonnant said. The second source confirmed the change to Reuters.
Development of Simandou - one of the world's biggest iron ore deposits, containing billions of tonnes of high-grade ore - has been hindered by years of legal wrangling involving several big mining companies.
As part of international efforts to improve transparency, Guinea's government under President Alpha Conde, elected in 2010, launched a review of mining contracts signed before 2011.
The review panel investigated how Beny Steinmetz Group Resources (BSGR) had obtained rights to the Simandou deposit in 2008 and, after levelling corruption allegations, the government stripped the company of its rights to Simandou and a smaller deposit.

BSGR has always maintained it did nothing wrong. It walked away from the Simandou project as part of a settlement announced in February 2019 with the Guinean government, in which both parties agreed to drop outstanding legal action.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 06, 2020 01:11AM ET</span>",Venezuela votes for parliament as opposition denounces fraud,"By Brian Ellsworth
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelans on Sunday choose a new congress in an election that the opposition is boycotting and most Western nations call a fraud by President Nicolas Maduro to retake the last state institution not in the hands of the ruling Socialist Party.
The vote is almost certain to return congress to Maduro's allies despite his government struggling with an economy in ruins, aggressive U.S. sanctions that stifle the OPEC nation's oil exports, and the migration of some 5 million citizens.
Members of the new congress will have few tools to improve the lives of Venezuelans whose monthly salaries rarely cover the cost of a day's groceries, nor will their election improve Maduro's reputation among Western nations for mismanagement and undermining of human rights. 
It could, however, provide legitimacy for Maduro to offer investment deals to the few companies around the world willing to risk running afoul of Washington's sanctions for access to the world's largest oil reserves. 
Many Venezuelans struggling with basic needs such as electricity, security and food express weariness with the country's politicians, who they say have done nothing to stem the slide in living conditions. 
The election closes a cycle that began in 2015 when a euphoric opposition celebrated winning congress by a landslide, only to see their legislative powers swept aside by pro-government courts and the creation in 2017 of an all-powerful body known as the National Constituent Assembly.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido, head of the current congress, is calling on Venezuelans to skip the vote and participate in a Dec. 12 consultation that will ask citizens if they reject Sunday's vote and whether they want a change of government.
Guaido has been recognized by more than 50 countries including the United States as Venezuela's legitimate interim president, after most Western nations disavowed Maduro's 2018 re-election as fraudulent. 
Those countries are expected to continue their recognition of Guaido, though the opposition is discussing proposals that could limit the size of his interim government and reduce the number of ambassadors.
The legislature on Saturday approved a resolution condemning Sunday's ""event"" as fraudulent and unconstitutional, adding it ""violates Venezuelans' right to hold free, transparent and fair elections.""
Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure, Maduro has remained in power, backed by the military and supported by Russia, Cuba, China and Iran. 

The top U.S. envoy on Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that there was strong bipartisan consensus in Washington over the need to keep pressure on Maduro, and that he did not expect major changes to U.S. policy when Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.

The exercises, conducted on one of Japan's uninhabited outlying islands, will focus on providing relief efforts during a natural disaster, but parts could also form the basis for a defence against attack, the paper said, without citing sources.
Japan's defence ministry was not immediately available to respond to Reuters' request for confirmation.
The joint exercises aim to counter China, which claims Japanese-controlled islands in the East China Sea, the paper said.
""We want to demonstrate our presence to the region and send a message about Japan-France cooperation,"" Admiral Pierre Vandier, chief of staff of the French navy, told Sankei in a separate interview.
""This is a message aimed at China. This is a message about multi-lateral partnerships and the freedom of passage.""
China has said its intentions in the region are peaceful. 
But Japan has grown particularly concerned about a rise in Chinese naval activity around the disputed islands in the East China Sea that Tokyo calls the Senkaku, while Beijing refers to them the Diaoyu.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's administration is leaning toward allowing small tour groups from Asian countries where coronavirus infections are well under control, such as China and Taiwan, the Asahi reported without citing sources.
Japanese government officials did not return calls from Reuters seeking comment.
Suga's government has launched a subsidy programme to revive domestic tourism, a key driver of economic growth in recent years, but the scheme has been criticised because Japan is struggling with a third wave of coronavirus infections.
New cases have spiked to record highs in Tokyo and Osaka. The number of serious cases nationwide has also risen to a record. 
Under the new plan, tourists would have to test negative for the coronavirus and submit a detailed travel itinerary before entering, the Asahi said. They would travel only by hired coach and would be separated from other customers at their hotel and sightseeing destinations, it said.
Tourists would also be required to use a tracing app and give daily updates on their health, the report said.
A limited number of people are now allowed to travel to Japan for business but are requested to self-isolate for 14 days.
The Tokyo Summer Olympics was scheduled for this year but was pushed back to 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Progress in rolling out coronavirus vaccines has raised hope that global tourism can start to slowly recover from paralysing travel restrictions put in place to curb the outbreak.

From midnight on Sunday, up to 100 people will be able to attend public gatherings such as weddings, with density rules of one person per two square metres remaining in place, while 50% of office workers will be able to return to workplaces by Jan. 11, up from 25% now, the state's premier said. 
""Today we can take some big steps, not to normal, but to a COVID-safe summer (but) we all need to remain vigilant and we all need to play our part,"" Premier Daniel Andrews told a news conference. 
Masks will remain mandatory at indoor venues and on public and ride-share transport, he said. 
Public health concerns eased after two travellers who returned from Germany, bypassing quarantine in Sydney to travel straight to Melbourne, returned negative COVID-19 tests.
All passengers on the Saturday afternoon domestic flight between the two cities and some airport staff must remain in self-quarantine until the results from a second test arrive on Monday, a health official said. 
Australia recorded 7 new cases overnight, all returned travellers. 
The country has all but stamped out the coronavirus through strict quarantine measures, particularly in Victoria, the second-most populous state, which in early August logged as many as 700 daily infections.

This comes as a Reuters tally of global infections rose above 65.58 million people, while more than 1.5 million people have died, and as the United States continues to set single-day records for new infections.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>","Fiscal reform, corruption in focus in Romania parliamentary election","By Radu-Sorin Marinas
BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanians head to the polls on Sunday in a national ballot key to restoring the country's reputation among investors, with the incumbent, reform-oriented centrists of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban holding a narrow lead over opposition Social Democrats. 
In power for a year in spite of his opponents' hold over parliament, Orban, 57, has said he would undo a 40% pension hike ordered by the leftist PSD, which economists say could bloat the deficit to 11% of GDP and push Romania's credit rating to junk.
He has pledged to halt efforts by leftist-led cabinets to sap court independence amid the judiciary's scrutiny of alleged corruption and misuse of funds - accusations the PSD denies.
Orban has campaigned on a promise to bring the Black Sea state closer to the European mainstream following years of fiscal populism and political instability coupled with neglect of rundown infrastructure and public services.
""There is a decisive choice to make on Dec. 6: We can become a top EU member or remain, again, a laggard,"" Orban told party members during the campaign. ""I'm not happy with an average Romania.""
The Romanian leu has traded near all-time lows against the euro in the last year, following a string of corruption-related scandals that has toppled three governments since the last parliamentary election in 2016.
All three main rating agencies have Romania only one notch above junk and on a negative outlook.
Seeking re-election one year after the government it led stepped down in a no-confidence vote, the PSD has clawed back support in recent months, amid anxiety among its core rural electorate over Orban's fiscal conservatism.
The coronavirus pandemic has also fuelled anger over social distancing restrictions that have hit thousands of small farmers who sell their produce in nearby cities.
More than 18 million Romanians are eligible to cast a vote, but analysts expect turnout of about 40% due to voters' fear of contagion, with polls due to open at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 9 p.m.
Opinion polls give Orban's PNL about 28-30% of the vote and 24-26% for the PSD. A September poll put PNL at 35% against PSD's 20%. 
If it wins on Sunday, the PNL is expected to seek a governing coalition with progressive USR-Plus party, running on 15-17%.
With a year-on-year contraction of 6.0% in the third quarter, Romania's economic performance was among the worst in the European Union during the pandemic, although the PNL says it has sought to keep much of the economy open.
""As all countries have found, it is immensely difficult to strike a balance between keeping people safe and protecting livelihoods,"" Siegfried Mureșan, a PNL member of the European Parliament said.
The PSD blamed the government, however, for going too far, by shutting indoor farmers' markets during the cold winter time.

""You need to vote to rescue yourself,"" PSD leader Marcel Ciolacu said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. ""Romanians want a government to stop this virus and bring back hope, reopen schools, create safe jobs and decent pensions.""

But the Florida city looks far different this year.
After the coronavirus pandemic forced Art Basel Miami Beach to announce in September that it was canceling this year's fair, the galaxy of satellite fairs around the city followed suit.
Art Basel is typically one of the busiest times for Miami, and the jolt could not have come at a worse time for this tourism-and-hospitality driven city hit hard by COVID-19. 
Earlier this year, Florida saw the most new cases of the novel coronavirus of anywhere in the world. In South Florida businesses rely on the influx of tens of thousands of additional visitors, as do the local governments collecting taxes.
Still, in the absence of the global elite of the art world, Miami-based artists and institutions have pressed ahead with their work and found a silver lining.
Lauren Shapiro, a ceramics artist who collaborated with a friend and oceanic researchers, worked with more than 100 socially distanced volunteers to build a massive installation of monolithic blocks veneered with clay imprints of dead coral.
The piece, called Future Pacific, is a meditation on the increasing fragility and disappearance of coral reef ecosystems. The unfired clay will be destroyed after the four-month exhibit, reflecting hundreds of thousands of years of life and growth lost as reefs around the globe die out.
""We knew we were going to do it during art week so we were very excited about the prospect of having international exposure ... and as it got closer to the date and Basel finally canceled it was a bit disappointing,"" Shapiro said.
However, Shapiro was able to make one-on-one appointments to view the installation. 
""I was able to bring a lot of curators, collectors, and just people that were interested in the work to give them personal tours through the exhibit and connect with them on a more personal level.""
Oil painter Thomas Bils echoed a similar sentiment.

""I'm a little disappointed I don't get to see my favorite national, international artists, but what I am seeing instead is watching a lot of my friends and colleagues doing much larger projects and sort of flourishing,"" said Bils.

PARIS (Reuters) - Scores of hooded anarchists launched projectiles at riot police, smashed up shop fronts, torched cars and burned barricades during a demonstration in the French capital on Saturday against police violence and a draft security law. 
The police fired back volleys of tear gas and made repeated charges at groups of troublemakers for close to three hours. One group of anarchists ransacked the branch office of a bank, throwing piles of paperwork onto a fire outside.
It marked the second consecutive of weekend of unrest in Paris, provoked by recent episodes of police brutality and President Emmanuel Macron's security plans, which the demonstrators say would restrict civil liberties.
Rallies also took place in Marseille, Lyon, Lille and other French cities. 
Thousands of people had began marching peacefully in Paris, waving banners that read ""France, land of police rights"" and ""Withdrawal of the security law"", when the clashes erupted between police and 'Black Bloc' anarchists. 
Paris police said that some 500 ""casseurs"" - which translates as hoodlums or rioters - had infiltrated the protest, according to BFM TV. Thirty arrests had been made by 1700 GMT, the force added.
France has been hit by a wave of street protests after the government introduced a security bill in parliament that set out to increase its surveillance tools and restrict rights on circulating images of police officers in the media and online.
The bill was part of Macron's drive to get tougher on law and order ahead of elections in 2022. His government also said the police needed to be better protected from online hate.
BACKLASH
But the draft legislation provoked a public backlash.
The beating of a Black man, music producer Michel Zecler, by several police officers in late November intensified anger. That incident came to light after closed circuit television and mobile phone footage circulated online. 
In a U-turn earlier this week, Macron's ruling party said it would rewrite the article that curbs rights to circulate images of police officers. But many opponents say that is not enough.
""We're heading towards an increasingly significant limitation of freedoms. There is no justification,"" said Paris resident Karine Shebabo.
Another protester, Xavier Molenat, said: ""France has this habit of curbing freedoms while preaching their importance to others.""
Macron acknowledged on Friday that people of colour were more likely to be stopped by police for ID checks than whites. He said an online platform would be created for citizens to log unwarranted searches. 
The president's remarks drew a furious response from police unions on Saturday. Alliance Police called Macron's comments shameful and denied the force was racist. The Alternative Police union threatened to halt random checks.

Most years, several hundred ""Rent-a-Santa"" meet at the beginning of the Christmas season in Germany, but this year just a few dozen got together, keeping their distance outside at the disused Tempelhof airfield in Berlin.
The Santas and Christmas angels can be booked for company events, shopping malls, restaurants, and kindergartens, and they can be hired to visit families on Christmas Eve.
One of the Santas, Andreas Penski, said they ask families to ventilate their homes before a visit and wear masks.
""We won’t be singing carols to avoid the burden of the aerosols and we will be keeping the distance to the families and the children when taking pictures or giving out presents,” he said.
Another Santa, Alex Meissner, said: ""This year is special; this year is different. We have a problem with the coronavirus but that won’t stop us from bringing happiness and joy to the children.""
While Germany managed to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control in March and April, it is now dealing with a more deadly second wave and has closed restaurants and bars, while keeping schools and shops open.

In a draft proposal sent to the Senate on Friday, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's office said foreign agents must share any information they obtain with Mexican authorities, and should be stripped of diplomatic immunity if they commit crimes or break regulations. 
The document did not mention the United States, but Lopez Obrador has been highly critical of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) since the arrest in October of Mexico's former army chief in a move that shocked Mexico's political establishment. 
In a highly unusual development, former defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos was released last month, after the U.S. government intervened and asked the courts to drop the case against him. 
As part of the deal to release Cienfuegos, Mexico agreed with U.S. Attorney General William Barr to commit to arrest a high-level drug cartel leader, a senior Mexican source told Reuters. Lopez Obrador also applied pressure on Washington by threatening to review security cooperation. 
The obligation for foreign agents to share all information with their Mexican counterparts would alarm U.S. officials, who say many Mexican institutions are infiltrated by cartels. 
The presidency's proposal would also make it mandatory for most Mexican officials to submit a written report, within three days, following any interaction with a foreign agent. 
The draft document is due to be discussed by the Senate's Public Security and National Defense committee. 

Asked about the proposal, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said ""we value our security cooperation with Mexico and are committed to continue to work together to resolve our common security challenges.""

A month of fighting between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's federal army and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) is believed to have killed thousands of people and driven some 46,000 refugees into neighbouring Sudan.
Abiy's government has said the conflict is winding down a week after it seized Tigray's regional capital, Mekelle, but TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael told Reuters in a text message on Saturday there was still fighting outside the city.
He said federal forces bombed the town of Abbi Adi on Friday, without giving further details, while a TPLF spokesman accused government troops of looting in Mekelle.
""(They are) looting civilian properties, hotels and damaging factories after looting,"" the spokesman Getachew Reda told a TPLF-owned TV station. 
The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Most communications in Tigray are down and access to the area is severely restricted, making it hard to verify either side's statements.
Abiy used to be a political partner of the TPLF - which dominated Ethiopia's governing coalition for nearly three decades - but he irked his former allies by putting Tigrayan officials on trial for corruption and rights abuses.
They said the arrests were politically motivated, accusing Abiy of trying to tighten his grip over Ethiopia's 10 semi-autonomous federal states. Abiy denies that, and has called the TPLF leaders criminals who mutinied against federal authority.
'HIDING IN CAVES'
Army Colonel Shambel Beyene said late on Friday that government forces were 10 km (six miles) away from a forest in the Gore area where Debretsion, Getachew and other TPLF members were thought to be hiding.
""We will only need a few days to get to them,"" he said on state television.
Relief agencies, meanwhile, are worried about a lack of food, fuel, medicines and even body bags in Tigray. Convoys are on standby to take aid in.
Residents in the central town of Shire told a new government-appointed provisional administration that the cost of groceries was sky-rocketing and fuel shortages were grounding ambulances used to take patients to hospitals.
""Residents are still staying away from their homes. Women are hiding in caves with their children,"" one man said at a meeting aired on EBC late on Friday.
Others complained about looting in the town.
Abiy's government has said it will protect civilians in the northern region and ensure their needs are met.
""Work to rebuild Tigray has commenced with teams ... undertaking repair work (and) restoring services,"" he said in a Tweet on Saturday.
Abiy, who took office in 2018, won a Nobel Peace Prize the following year for making peace with neighbouring Eritrea and democratic reforms.
He began opening up a closed economy, loosening a repressive political system, and taking action against those accused of corruption and rights abuses - some of whom were Tigrayan officials.

His government has also jailed thousands of opponents after violent unrest, angering his rivals.

The appointment boosts the number of military figures in key roles, something that has dismayed some political factions.
After the ouster of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on Aug. 18, hopes of a civilian-led transition were dashed by the appointment of the junta's leader as vice president, while retired colonel Bah Ndaw became president.
At its inaugural meeting, a transitional council of 121 members has now approved as its president Colonel Malick Diaw, one of the coup's organisers. 
His nomination was backed by 111 members, said a spokesman for the group that led the junta - the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP). 
The council will be responsible for voting on reforms and legislative changes during an 18-month transitional period before elections are held.
Diaw's appointment is likely to anger the M5-RFP coalition of opposition groups, which led mass protests before the coup and backed Keita's removal, but has voiced alarm over what it sees as the militarisation of the political sphere.
Thirteen out of Mali's 20 regions are now governed by military officers following new appointments in November.
Mali's international partners and neighbours worry political instability after the coup could derail a joint fight against militant groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State, which have grown stronger in recent years and made vast swathes of the country ungovernable.

Thousands of Indian farmers have demonstrated against the laws, which they say threaten their livelihoods, by camping on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi and blocking highways.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says the new laws are meant to overhaul antiquated procurement procedures and give growers more options to sell their produce.
""Farmers made it clear to the ministers that they want the government to repeal the laws,"" Jagjit Singh Dhalewal, a senior farmers' leader, said after five hours of talks on Saturday.
Agriculture and farmers' welfare minister Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters that talks will resume on Wednesday, adding the government is committed to farmers' welfare and is keen to examine and consider the issues raised.
Led by influential farming groups from the grain-producing states of Haryana and Punjab, the protests are a test of Modi's ability to reform the agricultural sector.
Agriculture makes up nearly 15% of India's $2.9 trillion economy and employs around half of its 1.3 billion people. 
Farmers fear the legislation will eventually dismantle India's regulated markets and stop the government from buying wheat and rice at guaranteed prices, leaving them to negotiate with private buyers.

Sino-U.S. relations have fallen to their lowest point in decades over issues from trade and security to human rights and COVID-19. On Friday, a Chinese state media editorial said ties are being shifted to ""a dangerous path"".
""In order to put the relations on the right track, to have real improvement of the relations, both sides have to proceed with good will and good faith,"" Ambassador Cui Tiankai told the Annual Conference of the Institute for China-America Studies via video link. 
""I don't think that China should just do something to please anybody here,"" he said, according to a transcript posted on his embassy's website. 
Tensions between the two countries dramatically escalated in July when China closed the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu in retaliation for Beijing's ouster from its consulate in Houston, Texas.
Earlier in the year, Washington cut the number of Chinese nationals allowed to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state media. Beijing then expelled U.S. journalists in the China bureaus of New York Times, Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.
POSITIVE GESTURES 
When asked by President of the National Committee on United States-China Relations Steve Orlins if China is prepared to reopen the Chengdu consulate among other positive gestures before President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January, Cui did not rule out the possibility. 
""I have to say we did not initiate the closing of consulates. We were not the first one to ask foreign journalists to leave the country. We did all these things in response to actions taken by the United States. So if the U.S. government is ready to reverse the course, we are ready to look at it,"" Cui said.

CAIRO (Reuters) - The head of a leading Egyptian human rights group who was held for two weeks on terrorism charges said on Saturday he hoped that the campaign to secure his release would help others still jailed on similar allegations.
Activists saw the detention last month of Gasser Abdel Razek, executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), and two of the group's other staff, as the latest escalation of a broad crackdown on political dissent under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Egypt's foreign ministry had said EIPR was operating illegally, an accusation the group denies. There has been no official statement from public prosecutors since Abdel Razek's release, and officials could not be reached for comment. 
The arrests, which came after EIPR hosted a briefing on human rights for 13 senior diplomats in Cairo on Nov. 3, sparked rare public criticism from Western states and an international campaign on social media.
Abdel Razek said he was unclear why he had been held beyond the officially stated charges of belonging to a terrorist group, spreading false news and misusing social media - accusations made in the past against figures from across the political spectrum.
Abdel Razek said it would be ""business as usual"" for EIPR.
""We're hitting the third decade of the 21st Century, human rights work will continue in Egypt and elsewhere,"" he said in an interview at his home in Cairo.
""I'm hoping that our speedy release would have some sort of effect on the hundreds of people that are going through the same situation.""
While the total is unclear, rights groups say tens of thousands have been detained in a clampdown on political opposition since Sisi ousted the Muslim Brotherhood from power in 2013.
Sisi has said Egypt holds no political prisoners, that security is paramount and that the government is promoting human rights by working to provide basic needs such as jobs and housing. The president and his backers say the detentions over recent years are necessary to stabilise Egypt. 
The three EIPR staff were freed on Thursday. Patrick Zaki, an EIPR researcher who was a graduate student in Italy before his arrest in February, remains in jail. 
Abdel Razek said he had been very cold for the first few nights in solitary confinement in Cairo's Tora prison, but had not suffered any physical mistreatment.
""It's a great feeling to be around my kids, my wife and friends, but it's very painful to leave the people behind, so let's hope we can pressure to get them all out.""

King Vajiralongkorn led a candle lighting ceremony in front of the Grand Palace in Bangkok to pay tribute to his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died in 2016 after reigning for seven decades - during which he was seen by many as a symbol of national unity.
The king was joined by thousands of loyalists, wearing the royal colour yellow and waving national flags.
In recent months, the monarchy in Thailand has become a target for a youth-led protest movement that accuses the current king and the government led by a former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha of expanding royal powers to a level not seen since the absolute monarchy ended in 1932.
The protesters broke long-standing taboos by openly criticising King Vajiralongkorn for taking direct control of two military units and the wealth of the Crown Property Bureau, valued in tens of billions of dollars.
Saturday's ceremony was one of the biggest shows of royalist support since protests surged in July.
""The king has always been there to take care of people's happiness, and without the king there would be chaos,"" Wanchote Kunprasert, 65 told Reuters

""Yes, that was raised,"" Sayyed Badr Al Busaidi told a Bahrain summit in response to a question on whether the potential blacklisting had been broached by David Schenker during a recent visit to Muscat.
""I don't think there is a solution based on classifying or blockading one key player in that conflict and not bringing them to the negotiating table,"" the Omani minister added. 
Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that U.S. President Donald Trump's administration had threatened to blacklist the Houthi movement, which has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen since 2015.
The United Nations is trying to revive peace talks stalled since late 2018 to end the war that has been in a military deadlock for years, with the Houthis still holding the capital, Sanaa, and most big urban centres.
""My question to that (a U.S. designation) ... is that decision going to resolve the Yemeni conflict given that this group is a key player? ... Or is it better to really support what the United Nations envoy is trying to do by inviting everyone including that group to the table,"" Al Busaidi said.
Yemen's conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
The Houthis, who ousted Yemen's Saudi-backed government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.
Aid workers have raised fears that if Washington designates the Houthis as a terrorist organisation, it could prevent life-saving aid from reaching Yemen, where more than 80% of the population needs help.

It did not say when the trial would take place or identify the men, but Iran’s judiciary in July suspended the execution of Amirhossein Moradi, Mohammad Rajabi and Saeed Tamjidi.
Those three were arrested during protests in November 2019 over gasoline price hikes that quickly turned political, with protesters demanding that top officials step down.
Human rights activists had said the death sentences initially handed to the three men had been aimed at intimidating future protesters.
The judiciary’s decision to suspend the sentences, which were passed earlier this year, followed public anger that included the social media hashtag #do_not_execute.

""Let's leave Christmas presents for another time,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said, urging people to scale down or forego traditional family gatherings over Christmas and New Year.
Lopez Obrador said people should stay at home unless they had something ""truly important to do"" as he announced hospitals would increase patient capacity, equipment and staff. However, he said there would be no mandatory lockdowns.
Mexico reported 12,127 new coronavirus infections on Friday, a record number for a single day rise, barring one day in October the government has said was due to a statistical blip. It was also the first time Mexico had recorded more than 10,000 new cases three days in a row.
The president said his proposals to control the virus were especially important for residents of the metropolitan area of Mexico City, a vast sprawl with a population of over 20 million where the festive shopping season has already caused alarm.
On Thursday, crowds converged on Best Buy stores to look for bargains ahead of the company's planned departure from the country, forcing stores to temporarily close.
Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum on Friday asked businesses to stop employees working from offices and resume work-from-home schemes. Local government would cut operations to a minimum but restaurants in the city could stay open, she said.
Mexico has recorded just over 1.15 million COVID-19 cases and almost 110,000 deaths, the fourth-highest death toll worldwide. Officials acknowledge the true extent of the pandemic is likely significantly higher due to limited testing, while the World Health Organization warned the country was in ""bad shape"". 

Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell this week said the outbreak would likely get worse until January.

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwaitis vote in legislative polls on Saturday as the Gulf state faces its worst economic crisis in decades, posing a challenge for the government's often stormy relationship with parliament, that has hampered fiscal reform. 
Turnout is expected to be lower than in past elections due to concern over COVID-19, which along with low crude prices, has battered state finances in the wealthy oil-producing nation. Low turnout could strengthen the showing of tribal, Islamist and other candidates who can rally supporters to head to polling centres, analysts said. 
""Kuwaiti opposition who boycotted (previous) polls are moving to run and vote, and this could strengthen their presence,"" said Kuwaiti political analyst Mohamad al-Dosayri. 
More than 300 candidates, including 29 women, are vying for 50 seats in the Gulf's oldest and most outspoken assembly with legislative powers. Critics say parliament has long stalled investment and economic and fiscal reform in the cradle-to-grave welfare state.
Frequent clashes between the cabinet and assembly have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament. The emir, who has final say, picks a prime minister who selects a cabinet. The current government is due to resign after the elections.
Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah took the reins as emir in September following the death of his brother.
Campaigning, which took place mostly on social media and local TV channels due to COVID-19 measures against gatherings, has focused on the economy, corruption and demographics in a country where foreigners make up the bulk of the workforce.
""The issues are the same - health, education, housing - as none of these have been resolved yet,"" government employee Hamad al-Otaibi, 43, told Reuters ahead of the elections.
The nearly $140 billion economy is facing a deficit of $46 billion this year. A priority will be overcoming legislative gridlock on a bill that would allow Kuwait to tap international debt markets. 
OPPOSITION
Sheikh Nawaf has called for unity to face challenges at home and in a region experiencing heightened tension between Kuwait's larger neighbours Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Late ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad in 2012 broke the hold of opposition groups on parliament by using executive powers to amend the voting system, sparking large protests.
Under the old electoral system, voters were allowed to cast ballots for up to four candidates, which the opposition says allowed alliances that partly made up for the absence of political parties, which are officially barred.
The system introduced in 2012 allows votes for only a single candidate, which the opposition says makes alliances difficult.
Kuwaiti opposition figures have proposed electoral reforms and a pardon for dissidents, many in self-exile, to the new emir.

""There have been some reforms in the judiciary and the Emiri Diwan,"" or court, said a Kuwaiti politician who asked not to be named. ""We heard echoes of more reforms after elections.""

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>","Revamped, less political, UNESCO sets sights on tricky U.S. return","By John Irish
PARIS (Reuters) - Four years after the United States quit UNESCO, the United Nations' cultural agency, over accusations of anti-Israel bias, diplomats say the Paris-based body has managed to put its house in order, potentially easing the way for Washington's return.
The agency, founded in the ashes of World War Two to protect the common cultural inheritance of humanity, was thrown into turmoil after the United States, which provided a fifth of its funding, pulled out.
It underscored the skepticism expressed by Republican President Donald Trump about the need for the United States to remain engaged in multilateral bodies and set the tone for a review and exit of several international accords and organizations.
But that could be about to change. While no direct contact has taken place with the incoming administration, diplomats say Democratic President-elect Joe Biden is open to a return, although congressional issues may slow that down.
""The U.S. withdrawal was tough, but it enabled it (UNESCO) to go back to basics,"" said a European diplomat. ""That meant trying to depoliticize it, especially with regard to the Israeli-Palestinian issue, which took precedence over everything."" 
UNESCO - the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization - is best known for designating and protecting archaeological and heritage sites, from the Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Islands to the tombs of Timbuktu.
Most of its activities are uncontroversial, but when it came to, say, resolutions about how religious sites should be run in Jerusalem, every word was studied for accusations of bias.
According to diplomats, those tensions have calmed with resolutions now passing more easily after direct mediation between UNESCO and the two parties, even though Israel also pulled out of the organization.
""UNESCO made very good improvements in terms of appeasing some of the political tensions and polarizations. It's better managed and better managed financially,"" Henok Teferra Shawl, Ethiopia's envoy to the body, told Reuters. 
He added that its director-general, Audrey Azoulay, was last week endorsed by a majority of the 58 Executive Board member states ahead of next year's election, opening the door to her re-election - in stark contrast to a bitter campaign in 2017. 
FINANCIAL HOLE 
The body has had to fill a gaping financial hole. The United States left with $542 million in arrears. By 2017, UNESCO's budget of about $300 million was half of its 2012 budget, meaning it was forced to freeze hiring, cut programs and fill gaps with voluntary contributions.
UNESCO says the budget from member states is now $534.6 million, with a further $189 million coming from extra voluntary budgetary contributions.
A U.S. return, done through a letter informing the body, would also mean that Washington would repay its arrears at some stage.
Biden has a history with the organization. He went to UNESCO when he was vice president and his wife, Jill, has been involved in past teaching programs. 
But things may prove complicated given a U.S. law that forbids the United States from funding U.N. bodies that have admitted Palestine as a full member, although a waiver can be sought.

""Biden has said that he wants to renew with multilateralism, so UNESCO should be one of those which benefits from that, but the Palestinian issue may complicate the speed of that return,"" said a U.S. official who asked not to be identified.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 05, 2020 01:30AM ET</span>",U.S. decision to withdraw troops dismays some Somalis,"By Katharine Houreld
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops out of Somalia in the waning days of his presidency triggered dismay on Saturday from some Somalis, who appealed to the incoming U.S. president to reverse the decision.
""The U.S. decision to pull troops out of Somalia at this critical stage in the successful fight against al-Shabaab and their global terrorist network is extremely regrettable,"" Senator Ayub Ismail Yusuf told Reuters in a statement, referring to the al Qaida-linked al Shabaab insurgency. 
""U.S. troops have made a huge contribution and had great impact on the training and operational effectiveness of Somali soldiers,"" said Yusuf, a member of Somalia's Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.
He tagged U.S. President-elect Joe Biden in a tweet criticising the decision. 
The Somali government could not immediately be reached for comment early on Saturday to Friday's decision to withdraw almost all the roughly 700 U.S. troops by Jan. 15. 
Somalia's fragile internationally backed government is due to hold parliamentary elections this month and national elections in early February, a precursor to the planned drawdown of the 17,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force.
U.S. troops have been in Somalia, mostly supporting Somali special forces known as Danab in operations against al Shabaab, whose attacks in nations like Kenya and Uganda have killed hundreds of civilians, including Americans. 
SUPPORTING SOMALI FORCES
Danab punches above its weight because regular forces are often poorly trained and equipped, frequently desert their posts or become enmeshed in power struggles between the national and regional governments.
If the withdrawal is permanent, ""it will have a huge toll on counterterrorism efforts,"" said Colonel Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, who served for three years until 2019 as the Danab commander. 
He fought alongside U.S. forces, he said, and during his command two Americans and more than a hundred of his own men had died. Both U.S. and Somali forces opposed the withdrawal, he said. 
The U.S. program to expand Danab to 3,000 men was supposed to continue until 2027, Sheikh said, but its future is unclear. 
Airstrikes will likely continue from bases in Kenya and Djibouti, which could also provide a launchpad for cross-border operations. Rights group Amnesty International says the airstrikes have killed at least 16 civilians in the past three years.
The U.S. withdrawal comes at a turbulent time in the region. Ethiopia, which is a major troop contributor to the peacekeeping forces and has thousands more troops in Somalia bilaterally, is distracted by an internal conflict that broke out last month. It has disarmed hundreds of its peacekeepers already.
Somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991, but the entry of the peacekeeping force in 2008 helped incubate fledgling government structures that allowed for gradual reforms of the military, such as a biometric system to pay soldiers and the formation of Danab. 

But many problems with the Somali military remain, including corruption and political interference. Perhaps a withdrawal will force Somalia to confront them, said Sheikh. Or perhaps it will make them worse.

It said that the programs had been set up under the auspices of the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act - a 1961 law signed by President John F. Kennedy and aimed at boosting academic and cultural exchanges with foreign countries.
""While other programs funded under the auspices of the MECEA are mutually beneficial, the five programs in question are fully funded and operated by the (Chinese) government as soft power propaganda tools,"" the statement said.

The dead were among 24 people trapped underground by excessive levels of carbon monoxide gas at the Diaoshuidong coal mine, the agency said, adding that one survivor had been rescued while search efforts continue. 
Friday's incident, which occurred at about 5 p.m. (0900 GMT) in a mine shut for more than two months as the company dismantled underground equipment, is being investigated, it added.
China's mines are among the world's deadliest, with 16 deaths reported in late September after high levels of carbon monoxide trapped miners at the Songzao coal mine in Chongqing.
Diaoshuidong, built in 1975 and run since 1998 as a private enterprise, is a high-gas mine with annual capacity of 120,000 tonnes of coal, Xinhua said.
In 2013, three people were killed and two injured in a hydrogen sulphide poisoning incident at the mine, it added.

1563,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 11:40PM ET</span>",Trump to withdraw most troops from Somalia as part of global pullback,"By Phil Stewart and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has ordered nearly all American troops to withdraw from Somalia, U.S. officials said on Friday, part of a global pullback by the Republican president before he leaves office next month that will also see him drawdown forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.
The United States has about 700 troops in Somalia focused on helping local forces defeat the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency. The mission has received little attention in the United States, but has been considered a cornerstone of the Pentagon's global efforts to combat al Qaeda.
In a statement, the Pentagon sought to play down the implications of a withdrawal that experts have said could undermine security in Somalia.
""While a change in force posture, this action is not a change in U.S. policy,"" the Pentagon said.
""The U.S. will retain the capability to conduct targeted counterterrorism operations in Somalia, and collect early warnings and indicators regarding threats to the homeland.""
The United States already pulled out of Somalia's cities of Bossaso and Galkayo earlier this year. As of last month, U.S. troops were still in the southern port city of Kismayo, Baledogle airbase in the Lower Shabelle region, and in the capital Mogadishu.
A U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said nearly all U.S. forces would leave Somalia, although some would remain in Mogadishu.
The Pentagon statement, which was unsigned, said an unspecified number of forces in Somalia would be moved to neighboring countries, allowing them to carry out cross-border operations. Others would be reassigned outside East Africa.
A congressional aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the withdrawal comes at a difficult time for Somalia, ahead of both parliamentary and presidential elections, and will present an early dilemma for President-elect Joe Biden.
Somalia has been riven by civil war since the early 1990s, but over the past decade an African Union-backed peacekeeping force and U.S. troops have clawed back control of Mogadishu and large swathes of the country from al Shabaab. 
'CONTINUOUS SECURITY PARTNERSHIP'
Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed had appeared to be lobbying in public against the drawdown, writing on Twitter in October https://twitter.com/M_Farmaajo/status/1316847589329952773 that U.S. support ""has enabled us to effectively combat Al-Shabab and secure the Horn of Africa.""
""A victory through this journey and for Somali-US partnership can only be achieved through continuous security partnership and capacity building support,"" he wrote.
Another U.S. official said the U.S. presence in Somalia was a point of contention between Trump and his former defense secretary, Mark Esper, who Trump fired last month. According to the official, Trump pushed for a drawdown citing a wish by Kenya ""to police their own neighborhood,"" but Esper resisted. 
Kenya has backed the Somali government in a number of areas and contributes troops to the African Union-led force. 
Al Shabaab, which has fought for more than a decade to establish rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law, often carries out gun assaults and bombings on both military and civilian targets and has also attacked regional targets, especially in Kenya.
An attack on a U.S. military base in Kenya killed three Americans earlier this year. 
Many of the U.S. forces in Somalia train and support Danab, the Somali special forces at the core of a mission to kill al Shabaab leaders. Danab, which has around 850 soldiers but had planned to grow to around 3,000, has been Somalia's most effective fighting force. 
It is the third major withdrawal since Trump installed acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, a former Green Beret and counterterrorism official, to replace Esper at the Pentagon following Trump's election defeat.

The U.S. defense official said the withdrawal was ordered to be completed by Jan. 15 -- the same deadlines for drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday rejected accusations his government had taken an illiberal turn with a contested bill to protect police officers and a crackdown on Islamist groups.
The bill, which would have curbed the freedom to share images identifying police officers, a key plank in Macron's plans to court right-wing voters by being tougher on law and order, had sparked outrage among journalists.
Asked in an interview by the Brut website about international media branding his police plans ""illiberal"", Macron said: ""Today, the situation is not satisfactory but, forgive me, that doesn't make us an authoritarian state."" 
""We're not Hungary, Turkey or somesuch,"" he said. ""I can't let it be said we're reducing liberties in our country.""
Protests over the plans escalated after the release of video footage of a Black man being beaten up by three police officers inside his own music studio earlier this month.
Macron said what the three police officers did was unacceptable, but that it did not mean the force as a whole was inherently violent and racist. 
Society has become more violent too, Macron said, and police had also been injured in clashes, including in Paris.
""A policewoman was beaten up by protesters there. If you don't look at society in its entirety, you're not being fair,"" Macron said. 
Macron said he had felt let down by Western governments and intellectuals after French teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded by a Muslim 18-year-old because he had shown cartoons of Prophet Muhammad in class.
Following Paty's murder Macron pledged to stand firm against assaults on French values and his government launched investigations into mosques suspected of fomenting Islamist ideology - triggering anti-French protests in some Muslim countries and some criticism in the West. 

""France was attacked because it defended freedom of speech,"" Macron said. ""We were very lonely.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada could see the end of a nasty diplomatic dispute with China if the United States reaches a deal to release a Huawei executive from house arrest in Vancouver, but the affair shows that without the heft of its southern neighbor, Canada has no bargaining power with Beijing.
And even if Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou does return to China, bilateral relations still face major challenges.
Shortly after Meng was picked up on a U.S. arrest warrant in December 2018, China detained two Canadian men - Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor - who now face spying charges.Having failed to secure their immediate release, Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne has talked for months about a formal ""reset"" of relations with China.
The idea was to balance taking a firm line on human rights issues and defending Hong Kong's independence, while working together with China on issues such as climate change.
Four people directly familiar with the matter said the effort stalled amid internal disagreements over what approach to take, and the realization that Ottawa has very little leverage over Beijing.
""The only way to put real pressure on China is for a number of like-minded nations to form a common front. The United States are the key player here and without them, nothing will happen,"" said one person directly familiar with the policy reset talks.
U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with Meng's lawyers to resolve criminal charges against her, a person familiar with the matter said.
""Let's hope that the discussions are serious and that a solution can be found because otherwise I think we would be in a mess for a long time,"" Guy Saint-Jacques, former Canadian ambassador to China, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Canadian officials are silent over whether they are playing any role in the Meng talks, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to comment when asked about it on Friday. His ""top priority"" is the release of the detainees, he said.
Foreign policy experts said Canada would have to insist the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump - which has not always had good relations with Ottawa - secure from China a guarantee it would release the Canadians as part of any deal. 
""Without the two Michaels being part of the package, we have no leverage at all if Meng should return to China,"" said Phil Calvert, a former Canadian diplomat in China and now a research fellow at the University of Victoria.
Even if Meng were released, the remaining challenges include a decision on whether to allow Huawei to supply equipment for next generation 5G telecoms networks. Other major allies have imposed a ban but Ottawa says it is still deciding what to do.
Sources say Canada has effectively blocked Huawei but does not want to say so publicly for fear of harming the fortunes of the two detainees.
Trudeau's minority Liberal government, which relies on other parties to govern, is under pressure from the official opposition Conservatives to take a much firmer line with China. 
""There has been no reset. I can't point to one thing that has changed with respect to China,"" Conservative leader Erin O'Toole said in an interview on Nov. 19.
Champagne's office referred to comments the foreign minister made last week in which he said Canada would take a flexible approach to China. He also said ""tough and irresponsible rhetoric"" would not help the detainees.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden this week said one of his priorities would be to gather with allies ""so we can develop a coherent strategy"" on China. What role Ottawa would play in such talks is unclear.

Like-minded democracies in the region such as Japan or South Korea, are important allies for any coordinated China policy, said a person familiar with the matter, adding: ""Without the United States, Canada doesn't have a China policy.""

The teenager was hit by a live bullet in his abdomen and was taken for treatment at a hospital in the Palestinian city of Ramallah where he later died, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. 
An Israeli military spokeswoman said soldiers had used what she described as ""riot dispersal means,"" including the firing of rubber bullets, to confront dozens of Palestinians who were hurling stones at them and trying to roll rocks and burning tires at Israeli vehicles.
""The reports of live-fire use during the riot are not true, and claims about a number of rioters injured and one killed are known,"" she said. 
The Palestinian teenager was involved in a weekly protest against Israeli settlements at al-Mughayyir village near Ramallah, said Marzouq Abu Naeem, a village councilman. He said protesters were throwing stones at soldiers. 
""This ugly crime is a war crime and a crime against humanity,"" the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The United Nations' Middle East envoy, Nickolay Mladenov, said he was appalled by the killing. ""Israel must swiftly and independently investigate this shocking and unacceptable incident,"" he tweeted.
Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. 
The Palestinians, who have limited self-rule in the West Bank, say Israel's settlements there will deny them a viable state and like many countries see the enclaves as an obstacle to peace and as illegal under international law. 

Israel disputes this, citing security needs as well as biblical and historical ties to the land. Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. intelligence official stepped up the Trump administration's harsh attacks on Beijing on Thursday, labeling China the biggest threat to democracy and freedom worldwide since World War Two and saying it was bent on global domination.
""The intelligence is clear: Beijing intends to dominate the U.S. and the rest of the planet economically, militarily and technologically,"" Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said in an opinion article on the Wall Street Journal website.
Ratcliffe, a former Republican congressman appointed by Trump to the top U.S. spy job last spring, said China posed ""the greatest threat to America today, and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War Two.""
He said he had shifted resources within the $85 billion annual federal budget allocated to intelligence to increase the focus on China.
Ratcliffe said China's economic espionage approach was threefold: ""Rob, Replicate and Replace."" 
He said the strategy was for Chinese entities to steal American companies' intellectual property, copy it and then supplant U.S. companies in the global market place.
A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy rejected Ratcliffe's comments as ""fact-distorting"" and hypocritical and said they showed ""the entrenched Cold-War mindset and ideological prejudices of some people on the U.S. side"".
Beijing has frequently called on U.S. leaders to dial back their rhetoric on China, which it blames on fear of China's growing role in the world.
Ratcliffe's essay was the latest broadside against China from President Donald Trump's administration as it seeks to cement the outgoing president's tough-on-China legacy following his Nov. 3 election defeat. 
Trump's approach has taken relations between the world's two largest economies to their lowest point in decades and analysts say it could limit the incoming Biden administration's room for maneuver in dealing with Beijing.
Ratcliffe alluded to reports collected by U.S. intelligence agencies that Chinese representatives have sought to interfere in U.S. domestic politics. 
He also charged that China had stolen U.S. defense technology to fuel President Xi Jinping's aggressive military modernization plans. 
""The election is over. Now let’s all be honest about China,"" Ratcliffe told Reuters after the article was published.
Among other issues, Washington and Beijing have clashed over China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its tightening grip on Hong Kong, its disputed claims in the South China Sea, trade and accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang.
Ratcliffe, who served only briefly on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee before Trump appointed him to his role, has been accused by Democrats and current and former intelligence officials of politicizing intelligence.
In his essay, Ratcliffe said Chinese authorities had ""conducted human testing"" on members of the Chinese army ""in hopes of developing soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities."" He did not elaborate. 
U.S.-based think tanks have reported that China is giving increasing importance to biotechnology in its military strategy but they have not released detailed reports about the kind of testing alleged by Ratcliffe.
On Thursday, the Trump administration restricted travel to the United States by members of China's ruling Communist Party and their families.
On Wednesday, it banned cotton imports from a quasi-military organization in Xinjiang it says uses forced labor of detained Muslims, while the House passed a law to kick Chinese firms off U.S. stock exchanges if they do not comply with auditing rules.
China accused U.S. politicians of fabricating news of detained Muslims being forced into labor in Xinjiang.
In an emailed statement, the embassy spokesperson said ""no one deserves the title of Empire of Hacking and Spying better than the U.S."" and charged that both the U.S. government and U.S. firms had long carried out ""large-scale, organized and indiscriminate cyber theft, surveillance and attack.""
Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said Ratcliffe's comments appeared aimed at locking in a tough approach before President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
""It does appear to part of a broader effort to tie Biden's hands and limit his room to maneuver on China policy,"" she said.

""In prior administrations, the norm has been to avoid taking such actions during a presidential transition, but the Trump administration has long set a pattern of bucking the norm.""

The New York Times first reported Lowell and Broidy's roles in the case on Thursday evening. 
A federal judge on Tuesday released a heavily redacted document which revealed that the Justice Department had obtained possible evidence of a bribery scheme in which someone “would offer a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence.”
The court documents did not disclose details of the alleged crime or the identities of those involved.
The Justice Department had to ask the judge's permission to view certain emails between a lawyer and clients. The judge granted the request in August, finding attorney-client privilege did not apply.
At the time, U.S. President Donald Trump described the investigation as ""Fake News!"" on Twitter.
The New York Times reported that the efforts to secure clemency were focused on a Berkeley, California-based psychologist, Hugh Baras, who was convicted in 2014 of tax evasion and improperly claiming Social Security benefits.
As part of the plan, a San Francisco real estate developer, Sanford Diller, would make an unspecified political contribution, it added. Diller died in 2018.
In October - several months after the Justice Department won the request to review the emails in the pardon bribery inquiry, Broidy pleaded guilty in a separate case to illegally lobbying Trump to drop an investigation into a Malaysian embezzlement scandal.
Nothing in those court documents in Broidy's case made reference to conduct concerning the pardon bribery probe.
Broidy's attorney Burck said his client's only role in the matter was putting Diller in contact with Lowell.
Baras, who was jailed for more than two years, did not receive clemency from the White House. He was released from prison in August 2019, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
Lowell's attorney Weingarten confirmed to Reuters that Lowell, a well-respected white-collar lawyer who has represented high-profile clients including Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, Senator Bob Menendez and Jack Abramoff, did represent Baras.
""Abbe's lawyering was utterly normal,"" Weingarten told Reuters in an interview on Thursday. ""Not exciting, not interesting and not successful. But by the book. There was no bribe, there was no promise of a bribe, and there was no clemency. There was not relief. The guy went to jail.""
Weingarten added that when he last spoke with Justice Department officials about the inquiry, ""they left me with the impression they didn’t have the slightest quarrel with anything Abbe did.""
A Justice Department official on Tuesday told reporters that no government officials are the subject or target of the probe disclosed in the court filing.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British and EU negotiators paused trade talks on Friday to call in their leaders to try to narrow gaps and get an agreement over the line, less than four weeks before Britain completes its Brexit journey out of the bloc.
After failing to agree the basis for a deal, Britain's David Frost and the EU's Michel Barnier said they would brief leaders to seek new impetus for the talks, which stumbled on Thursday when London accused Brussels of making new demands.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will speak to try to break the impasse, which sources said was centred on French demands over fishing rights in British waters.
It is the latest twist in what has been months of negotiations which have barely moved on the three thorniest issues - fisheries, ensuring fair competition guarantees and ways to solve future disputes.
But so far neither side has walked away from the talks, suggesting that both still hold out some hope of securing a deal governing almost $1 trillion of annual trade to avoid a disorderly end to more than 40 years of British membership of the European club.
""After one week of intense negotiations in London, the two chief negotiators agreed today that the conditions for an agreement are not met, due to significant divergences on level playing field, governance and fisheries,"" they said in a statement.
""On this basis, they agreed to pause in order to brief their principals on the state of play of the negotiations. (European Commission) President (Ursula) von der Leyen and Prime Minister (Boris) Johnson will discuss the state of play tomorrow afternoon.""
Sterling sank by as much as half a cent against the U.S. dollar, weakening to $1.3425 from $1.3475 before the negotiators' statement. The pound was also lower against the euro.
DOWN TO POLITICIANS
Earlier on Friday, there were contradictory reports of how far the talks had progressed, with some EU officials saying they were on the brink of agreement while British officials said the negotiations had reached a ""very difficult"" point.
Ultimately it will be for the politicians to decide whether they want to shift the negotiating positions and compromise to find grounds for a deal, or instead, to walk away.
The EU has challenged Britain to decide what future it wants for itself outside the bloc's single market and customs union.
Britain formally left the EU on Jan. 31 but has been in a transition period since then under which rules on trade, travel and business remain unchanged.
If the two sides fail to reach a deal, the five-year Brexit divorce will end messily just as Europe grapples with the vast economic cost of the COVID-19 outbreak.
A no-deal exit is the nightmare scenario for businesses and investors, who say it would snarl borders, spook financial markets and sow chaos through supply chains that stretch across Europe and beyond.
The talks soured on Thursday when a British government source said the EU had disrupted talks by trying to force further concessions and France, which fears losing many of its rights to fish in British waters, warned it might rebel. The EU denied making new demands.
French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune told Europe 1 Radio there was still a risk that talks would fail but added: ""I want to tell our fishermen, our producers, the citizens who are listening that we will not accept a deal with bad terms.

""If a good agreement cannot be reached, we will oppose it. Each country has a veto right, so it is possible... We will do our own evaluation of this draft deal, if there is one.""

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 04:16PM ET</span>",Saudi Arabia says resolution of Gulf dispute seems within reach,"By Ghaida Ghantous and Crispian Balmer
DUBAI/ROME (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said on Friday a resolution to a bitter dispute with Qatar seemed ""within reach"" after Kuwait announced progress towards ending a row that Washington says hampers a united Gulf front against Iran.
The United States and Kuwait have worked to end the dispute, during which Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt have imposed a diplomatic, trade and travel embargo on Qatar since mid-2017.
U.S. President Donald Trump's senior adviser Jared Kushner had held talks in Doha on Wednesday following a visit to Saudi Arabia. 
""We have made significant progress in the last few days thanks to the continuing efforts of Kuwait but also thanks to strong support from President Trump,"" Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told a Rome conference via videolink.
""We hope this progress can lead to a final agreement which looks within reach and I can say I am somewhat optimistic that we are close to finalising an agreement between all the nations in the dispute.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking remotely at a Bahrain summit on Friday, said the United States was ""very hopeful"" that the dispute would be resolved.
All countries involved are U.S. allies. Qatar hosts the region's largest U.S. military base, Bahrain is home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet and Saudi Arabia and the UAE host U.S. troops.
Washington has been pushing for reopening Gulf airspace for Qatari aircraft as a first step, diplomats and sources have said.
The boycotting nations accuse Doha of supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the embargo aims to undermine its sovereignty.
'AN IMPERATIVE STEP'
Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheikh Ahmad Nasser al-Sabah, said earlier on Friday that fruitful discussion had taken place recently ""in which all sides expressed their keenness for Gulf and Arab unity and stability, and to reach a final agreement that realises lasting solidarity"".
In a Twitter post, Qatar's foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, welcomed the Kuwaiti statement as ""an imperative step"" towards resolving the rift.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is encouraged by the Kuwait statement and hopes all countries involved work together to formally resolve their differences, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a Twitter post said he hoped Gulf reconciliation ""contributes to stability and political and economic development for all peoples of our region.""
The Qatari minister earlier told the Rome conference that Doha hoped ""things will move in the right direction"" but that any resolution should be based on mutual respect for sovereignty, including in foreign policy.

Doha had been set 13 demands, ranging from closing Al Jazeera television and shuttering a Turkish base to cutting links to the Muslim Brotherhood and downgrading ties with Iran, which shares a significant gas field with Qatar.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>","Ethiopia sees war ending, EU complains of partisan aid access","ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia said it had captured or killed most commanders of a rebellious northern force, while Tigray's fugitive local leader countered on Friday that civilians were protesting against looting by occupying soldiers. 
Neither side gave proof for their assertions about the month-long war in the mountainous region bordering Eritrea, where phone communications have been down and access severely restricted both for media and aid workers.
A senior European official chided the Ethiopian government over an agreement to allow access for humanitarian aid to Tigray, saying it only covered federal-controlled areas and had onerous bureaucratic requirements.
""There may be malnourished children on the other side also,"" EU crisis commissioner Janez Lenarcic told reporters in Ethiopia. The government did not immediately respond to his comments.
Fighting between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's federal army and forces loyal to the region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), erupted on Nov. 4. 
Thousands of people are believed to have died while more than 46,000 refugees have crossed to neighbouring Sudan. 
TPLF leaders, who enjoy strong popular support in Tigray, appear to have fled to surrounding mountains and say they have begun a guerrilla-style resistance. 
TPLF No. 1 Debretsion Gebremichael, one of the most wanted men in Ethiopia, told Reuters in a text message that there were protests in the regional capital Mekelle, which is home to 500,000 people, due to looting by Eritrean soldiers. 
""Eritrean soldiers are everywhere,"" he said, repeating an accusation that President Isaias Afwerki has sent soldiers over the border to back Abiy against their mutual foe. 
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied that. 
Ethiopia says the TPLF wants to internationalize the conflict as a way to force the government, which appears to hold all the major towns, into international mediation. 
Debretsion, a 57-year-old former guerrilla radio operator, gave no evidence of looting or the presence of Eritreans. A diplomatic source shared a picture of a road covered in stones, which he said was sent from a resident of Mekelle, but it was unclear where or when the picture was shot. 
On Wednesday, state TV showed images of people shopping and sitting on stools in Mekelle. But there have been no images of security forces interacting with residents. 
Abiy's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum said she would not comment on unverifiable text messages from the TPLF. 
A senior military commander, General Tesfaye Ayalew, said ""almost all of the enemy"", including former federal colonels and generals who fought on the Tigrayan side, were defeated or dead. ""But the ones who made the plans and the criminals are still on the run and hiding,"" he told state-affiliated Fana TV.
Debretsion called those comments a ""dream"".
'WE HEARD BOOM'
Relief agencies are extremely worried about lack of food, fuel, medicines and even bodybags in Tigray.
Convoys are on standby to take aid in.
The United Arab Emirates flew a cargo of supplies including medicines into the capital Addis Ababa, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. 
The United Nations sounded the alarm about fighting and deaths - including of aid workers, sources told Reuters - around camps for Eritrean refugees.
Ethiopia's government has said it will protect civilians and ensure their needs are met. Mulu Nega, appointed by Abiy as chief executive of a new Provisional Administration of Tigray, said supplies were reaching parts of west Tigray under its control.
""Our priority in the region now is to restore peace,"" the 52-year-old former academic told state-run EBC.
In Sudan, refugees recounted horror stories of fleeing from Tigray along roads strewn with bodies and also spoke of Eritrean involvement. Tewodros Tesera, a surgeon from the border town of Humera, said shells had come from the Eritrean side over the Tekeze River in the early days of battles.
""The shells were falling in front of the hospital where I work,"" he recalled by phone from the Hamdayet refugee camp. 
""We heard 'boom', then 20 seconds, then whistle, then a second heavy bombing, which struck the ground and buildings. Houses, a mosque and a church were damaged.""
Abiy took office in 2018 after nearly three decades of TPLF-led government. 
He began opening up a closed economy and repressive political system, won a Nobel Peace Prize for a pact with Eritrea, and took action over corruption and rights abuses. 
But the trials of senior Tigrayan officials for torture, murder and corruption irked the TPLF, who said the arrests were politically motivated. Abiy's government has also jailed thousands of citizens following bouts of violent unrest. 
At least six journalists have been arrested since the Tigray conflict begun. 

The TPLF accuses Abiy, their former political partner, of trying to increase personal power over Ethiopia's 10 regions. Abiy denies that, calling them criminals who mutinied against federal authority, attacked a military base, and were wildly over-represented in government for a group that only accounts for 6% of the population.

Pompeo did not name those sanctioned in a written statement in which he accused the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) United Front Work Department of coercing and bullying ""those who would oppose Beijing’s policies.""
""The United Front frequently intimidates members of academia, businesses, civil society groups, and Chinese diaspora communities, including members of ethnic and religious minority communities who speak out against horrific human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang, Tibet, and elsewhere in China,"" he said, saying that its coercive tactics include the release of personal details of their targets, a practice known as ""doxing.""
Pompeo said the visa restrictions would apply to those ""who have engaged in the use or threat of physical violence, theft and release of private information, espionage, sabotage, or malicious interference in domestic political affairs, academic freedom, personal privacy, or business activity.""

He accused China of seeking to ""co-opt and coerce"" people in the United States and elsewhere to support its ""authoritarian narratives and policy preferences"" and called on Beijing ""to end its use of coercion and intimidation tactics to suppress freedom of expression.""

The 49-year-old Israeli suspect poured flammable liquid inside the Church of All Nations, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. The man then set it alight, a separate police statement said, before the church guard detained him.
""Preliminary investigation and the suspect's details strengthen the assessment that the background to the incident was criminal,"" police said, suggesting investigators believed it was not a hate crime.
Reuters pictures showed a charred bench and a small blackened portion of the mosaic floor of the Catholic church, which overlooks Jerusalem's walled Old City.
""This is a crime, a crime that shouldn't happen in a church in the Holy Land,"" said Father Ibrahim Faltas, as he inspected the damage. The Custody of the Holy Land for the Roman Catholic Church in a statement urged police to conduct a thorough investigation.

The coalition, which has the support of only 41 deputies in the 81-seat parliament, was put together with conservative pro-Serb, centre-right and green parties after the Aug. 30 election.
Prime Minister Zdravko Krivokapic has pledged his cabinet will tackle the downturn, fight the coronavirus, and root-out corruption and organised crime, a key condition for Montenegro's long-term goal of joining the European Union. 
Milos Konatar, a deputy from the ruling coalition said that the vote on the new government ""represents the first step of democracy."" 
""We are setting the standard that the change of government will become normal,"" he said during the debate. 
The new government will also seek to dismantle a state apparatus built by the Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) led by long-serving President Milo Djukanovic.
Krivokapic, his allies, and democracy and human rights watchdogs have long accused Djukanovic and the DPS of running Montenegro, a small Adriatic republic of 620,000 people, as their own fiefdom with links to organised crime. 
The DPS and Djukanovic, who faces re-election as president in 2023, have denied that. 
The new government enjoys the support of the conservative Serbian Orthodox Church, the biggest in the country, and wants closer ties with Serbia, a former partner in the now-defunct Yugoslav federation. 

This year and last, the Serbian Orthodox Church held daily protests against a law adopted last December that allows the state to seize religious assets whose historical ownership cannot be proven. Krivokapic pledged to amend the law.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Next year is shaping up to be a humanitarian catastrophe and rich countries must not trample poor countries in a ""stampede for vaccines"" to combat the coronavirus pandemic, top U.N. officials told the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Friday.
World Food Programme (WFP) chief David Beasley and World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke during a special meeting on COVID-19, which emerged in China late last year and has so far infected 65 million globally.
The pandemic, measures taken by countries to try to stop its spread and the economic impact have fueled a 40% increase in the number of people needing humanitarian help, the United Nations said earlier this week. It has appealed for $35 billion in aid funding. 
""2021 is literally going to be catastrophic based on what we're seeing at this stage of the game,"" said Beasley, adding that for a dozen countries, famine is ""knocking on the door.""
He said 2021 was likely to be ""the worst humanitarian crisis year since the beginning of the United Nations"" 75 years ago and ""we're not going to be able to fund everything ... so we have to prioritize, as I say, the icebergs in front of the Titanic."" 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and his top officials have also called for COVID-19 vaccines to be made available to all and for rich countries to help developing countries combat and recover from the pandemic. 
Tedros appealed for an immediate injection of $4.3 billion into a world vaccine-sharing program.
""We simply cannot accept a world in which the poor and marginalized are trampled by the rich and powerful in the stampede for vaccines,"" Tedros told the General Assembly. ""This is a global crisis and the solutions must be shared equitably as global public goods.""

UM RAKUBA, Sudan (Reuters) - Ethiopian farmer Gebrahid Welderfael said he last saw his wife and 18-year-old daughter in the sewer in his village in the Tigray region where the family had taken shelter from explosions and gunfire.
When he returned with his younger children from a quick trip to their house to collect supplies, they were gone, lost in the chaos of a conflict in the northern region where government and rebellious Tigray forces have been fighting since Nov 4.
Unable to find them, the 45-year-old walked with his younger daughter and two young sons to the Um Rakuba camp across the border to Sudan, where more than 45,000 have fled the conflict.
Similar tales are told by other refugees. Mothers and wives say they lost their husbands, while old men, women and children have crossed the border not knowing the fate of relatives.
""When we escaped, there were people shouting 'mom', 'dad', children screaming,"" Welderfael said, sitting in a small hut which he built himself where he and his children sleep on rugs.
""People were shouting for help, my children were crying but I calmed them down and told them to run.""
The fighting between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s federal army and forces loyal to the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) is believed to have killed thousands of people.
TPLF leaders, who enjoy strong popular support in Tigray, appear to have fled to surrounding mountains and say they have begun a guerrilla-style resistance.
Welderfael could not provide details of the fighting and said a communication blackout in Tigray meant he had been unable to reach his wife since. The blackout also means Reuters is unable to verify accounts from either side.
The farmer said his children sometimes have nightmares and frequently ask him where their mother has gone. ""I keep giving them hope,"" he said, ""that they're probably safe.""

AL-QAYYARAH, IRAQ (Reuters) - Tuqqa Abdullah and her Iraqi family have wandered from one displaced people's camp to the next in the past three years, buying time and hoping they will one day be able to go home.
Just 14 when her father took the family to the then Islamic State (IS) stronghold of Mosul, she has inherited a legacy that might take generations to overcome. In the meantime, her options are running out.
When Iraqi forces captured Mosul in the dying days of the three-year-old IS caliphate in 2017, Abdullah's father and older sons were killed.
The surviving family members were among many thousands of relatives of suspected IS members moved into temporary camps.
Last month, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi launched the closure of the remaining camps, arguing that the families belong at home.
But many of their occupants remain barred from returning by their local communities, who associate them with the group that imposed its brutal rule over large swathes of northern Iraq.
When the al-Jadaa 1 camp where Abdullah and her family were living shut down, they did not head back to their village near the northern town of Al-Qayyarah but went instead to al-Jadaa 5.
""We have nowhere to go if this camp closes,"" said Abdullah, who shares a tent with her mother, grandmother and younger siblings.
SUICIDAL THOUGHTS
The Baghdad government says it has closed all but three of the 47 camps outside the Kurdistan region and hopes to shut those three by early next year, rejecting allegations by humanitarian aid groups that the process is too hasty.
It is not clear when the 26 camps in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region will close.
In the recent spate of camp closures, Ahmed Khleif and his family also sought shelter at the al-Jadaa 5 camp, even though it is only about 15 km (9.32 miles) from their home.
""If Jadaa closes, we have nowhere to go. Only suicide is left,"" Khleif said.
The governor of Nineveh province where the al-Jadaa camps are located, Najm al-Jabouri, told Reuters some families of alleged IS members were able to go home but that a compromise with some tribal leaders over returns had yet to be reached.
""We still have about 1,000 families or more for whom it is difficult for them to return to their places of origin,"" al-Jabouri said.
Near the town of Gayyara where al-Jadaa camp is situated, Abdulkareem al-Wagaa, head of al-Jabouri tribe, was among tribal leaders who decided the fate of relatives of IS members in a meeting in 2016. He says only those who pledged allegiance to, took pride in or benefited from the group are barred from home.
Khleif continued his work driving a taxi during IS rule, putting him under suspicion of using family connections. Three of his sons are in prison for alleged IS links, he said.
Hussein Ali, the son of the mayor in Khleif's hometown and in charge of his file, says that he wishes all families could return, but local authorities cannot guarantee Khleif's safety.
Even when not under suspicion, families associated with IS often have to go through a more bureaucratic and costly process to renew identify cards or other documents.
Tuqqa said her family has been saving and selling the food parcels they get from the camp in recent months in the hope of having enough money to renew her documents and be able to work.
Al-Jabouri, Nineveh's governor, said he was concerned the families had been isolated together for a long time, adding that the government was still looking for a safe way to reintegrate them.
""We have revenge in our society,"" he said. ""Not all families can return to their places of origin, this is a real problem that we are trying to find solutions for.""

1581,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 11:31AM ET</span>",Former Malta PM says he had no indication of journalist murder plot,"By Chris Scicluna
VALLETTA (Reuters) - Former Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat told a board of inquiry on Friday that he had no prior indication of any plans for the 2017 murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
He confirmed, however, that he had been in a chat group with his chief of staff, Keith Schembri, and the suspected mastermind of the 2017 car bomb murder, top businessman Yorgen Fenech.
He also confirmed that he had invited Fenech to his own exclusive birthday party in 2019 and received expensive wine from him even when he was already a suspect. Other businessmen were present, but not ministers.
""I had asked authorities, investigators, what to do. They told me to act normally,"" he said. 
Muscat was testifying before the public inquiry that he had appointed to look into whether the state could have prevented the murder, which shocked Europe and raised questions about the rule of law on the small Mediterranean island.
He resigned as prime minister in January 2020, saying he would ""shoulder political responsibility"" weeks after Fenech was arrested and accused of complicity in the murder of the journalist. 
Schembri resigned a few days earlier, when his close friendship with Fenech was revealed. Fenech denies any wrongdoing. Schembri, who has not been charged in connection with the murder, denies any knowledge of it or its perpetrators.
Muscat said police had told him he was not under investigation. 
He said the chat group with Fenech and Schembri was mostly about food and wine. ""There was a friendship, I don’t deny it, but I'm friends with everyone,"" he said. 
""I had no information that Daphne Caruana Galizia's life was in danger and nobody made any statement to that effect. Moreover I have not been told that any state entity was aware of such (a plan), or could have prevented it,"" he said.
Muscat told the inquiry that Caruana Galizia acted as a one-woman show who was attacking both the government and opposition at the time of her death, but was not making much impact.
""Caruana Galizia was killed at a time when she became irrelevant to everyone ... And I know her family won't like this, but it is mind-boggling. Whoever did this crime is stupid as well as a criminal,"" he said.
Police have said Caruana Galizia was likely killed not for what she had written so far, but for what she was still investigating.
Muscat said that although she regularly criticised him, he never tried to incite hatred against her and only sued her when she claimed in 2016 that his wife was the beneficial owner of a secret company registered in Panama.
He said that story ""did not have an ounce of truth"".

He also insisted that he never interfered in police investigations into the murder, other than to bring in Europol and the U.S. FBI to help.

More than two decades after the conflict in Kosovo ended, the search for the victims remains a major obstacle to the improvement of relations between Belgrade and Pristina. 
The investigators used satellite imagery to find the mass grave in a remote open-cast mine at Kizevak in Serbia's south.
Their findings suggested that there could be up to 17 bodies, Veljko Odalovic, the head of Serbia's Commission for Missing Persons, told reporters.
Forensics expert Suzana Matejic said further investigation would be hampered in the short term by fast-approaching winter and coronavirus restrictions.
More than 13,000 people are believed to have died during the war in Kosovo, Serbia's former southern province. The fighting ended in 1999 after NATO air strikes against the now-defunct Yugoslavia. Most of the victims were ethnic Albanians and hundreds are still missing.
Ibrahim Makolli, Kosovo's representative for the missing persons, said it should be a priority to find those responsible for the deaths, adding: ""They should receive the punishment they deserve."" 
The investigation that led to the discovery was an effort by Serbia, Kosovo, the International Committee of the Red Cross and EULEX, the EU's justice and police mission in Kosovo.
The largest mass grave from the war found so far, containing the bodies of more than 800 Kosovo Albanians, was found in 2001 in a police compound near Belgrade.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela will hold parliamentary elections this Sunday in a vote that the United States, European Union and many citizens view as a fraudulent effort by the ruling socialist party to seize control of the last institution in opposition hands. 
The opposition, led by National Assembly speaker Juan Guaido, is boycotting the vote on the grounds that it will be rigged in favor of President Nicolas Maduro's allies. Court rulings have left the body largely toothless since the opposition won control in a December 2015 election.
Sunday's vote will likely see Maduro's allies win a majority, strengthening his grip on power, despite a nearly two-year U.S.-led campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure and an economic collapse that has prompted a humanitarian crisis. 
A recent opinion poll of Venezuelans by consultancy Datanalisis found that 60% of 500 respondents were not willing to vote, while 34% wanted to do so. More than 90% said the country's situation was negative, citing hyperinflation and poor public services as the main problems. 
""Look at the conditions we're in,"" said Keili Muller, 27, a mother of four, in reference to the wood and zinc shack she calls home in the poor neighborhood of Marapa Piache in the coastal state of La Guaira.
She complained that she had spent months trying to get officials to help with the constant flooding of her home but that none had come to her community - including Maduro's son, who is running to represent the state in congress.
""That's why we say we're not going to vote, we're not going to do anything,"" Muller said in an interview.
Guaido has insisted that the current National Assembly's mandate will continue past its set Jan. 5 deadline because the upcoming vote lacks legitimacy. His allies are organizing a parallel ""Popular Consultation"" scheduled for Dec. 12, designed as a referendum on Maduro.
The United States and European Union will likely continue recognizing opposition control of the parliament given the perceived problems with the Dec. 6 vote, two opposition sources said. Dozens of countries also recognize Guaido as Venezuela's interim president, based on his role as speaker.
But the sources said the loss of control of the parliament would still harm the opposition's ability to mobilize protests and ensure their critiques of the government reach a wide audience, leaving them closer to the status of their counterparts in Maduro allies Cuba and Nicaragua, who have less visibility. 
Among the alleged irregularities denounced by the opposition were decisions by the Maduro-aligned Supreme Court to remove Guaido allies from leadership positions in opposition parties and install shadow allies willing to compete in the election.

Maduro allies have argued that the electoral conditions are the same as in 2015, when the opposition won control of the National Assembly, and that the sectors of the opposition that have decided to boycott did so because they are not committed to democracy and are afraid they would lose.

""Ski resorts should be able to remain open for domestic tourism,"" the government said in a statement, while stressing permits could be revoked if resorts do not adhere to strict safety measures.
The Swiss approach contrasts with neighbours France, Italy and Germany which are keeping winter sports under wraps over the holidays. Austria will let resorts reopen for Christmas while making ski holidays nearly impossible.
Switzerland, which is battling persistently high number of coronavirus cases, announced a raft of other measures, including a ban on singing outside of family circles and in schools.
It recommended gatherings in private and at restaurants be restricted to two households, while it also reduced capacity limits on the number of shoppers allowed into stores at one time and urged employers to let staff work from home.

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",India considers changing new farm laws after mass protests,"By Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government is considering rolling back some parts of its agricultural reforms after they triggered the biggest protests by farmers in years, officials said on Friday.
Tens of thousands of farmers were out on the streets around Delhi again on Friday, rallying against three laws that the government says are meant to overhaul antiquated procurement procedures and give growers more options to sell their produce.
Farmers fear the legislation, passed in September, will eventually dismantle India's regulated markets and stop the government from buying wheat and rice at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers. 
""The government is open to look into various amendments,"" a government official told Reuters, declining to be named ahead of a meeting between farmers and ministers scheduled for Saturday.
""The government is open to the idea of imposing taxes on the new wholesale markets to keep a level playing field,"" he said.
In case of a dispute between sellers and buyers, the government could also let farmers appeal to a higher court than is currently allowed under the new legislation, he added.
Two other officials said the government was considering making the same concessions, but the government spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
There was no immediate response from protesters to the official's proposals but Kavitha Kuruganti, a farmers' leader, told Reuters so far the government had not agreed to farmers' demands. 
Farmer leaders have demanded the government repeal the laws and retain mandatory government purchases, and said that buyers at private markets should pay the same tax as at state-run markets.
Under the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, one of the new laws, private players are allowed to set up wholesale markets where transactions will not attract any kind of tax.

The protests, led by influential farming groups from the grain-producing states of Haryana and Punjab, pose a crucial test for Modi's ability to reform India's vast agriculture sector, which makes up nearly 15% of the country's $2.9 trillion economy and employs around half of its 1.3 billion people.

The trip has not been announced by the State Department, and a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Seoul said he had no announcement to make.
Besides meeting with South Korean officials, Biegun was also due to give a speech, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the trip had yet to be publicised.
The U.S. delegation is scheduled to arrive on Tuesday and spend several days in the South Korean capital, three sources said.
Biegun has spearheaded working-level talks with North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes in the past, but those efforts have made no visible progress despite President Donald Trump's unprecedented summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Biegun has said he is open to resuming talks at any time, but North Korea insists that it has no intention of returning to denuclearisation negotiations as long as the United States clings to ""hostile policies"".
Talks over reducing international sanctions on North Korea in return for concessions from Pyongyang broke down in the wake of a summit between Trump and Kim in Vietnam in February 2019, which ended with no deal. 
Biegun's visit comes as incoming U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to reset relations with Seoul, which have been strained by Trump's demand that South Korea pay billions of dollars more for maintaining the U.S. troop presence on the peninsula.

Relations between the allies were also complicated by South Korean frustrations with U.S. objections to some of its efforts to engage with North Korea.

The confidential International Atomic Energy Agency report obtained by Reuters said Iran plans to install several more cascades, or clusters, of advanced IR-2m centrifuges in the underground plant at Natanz, which was apparently built to withstand aerial bombardment.
Iran's nuclear deal with major powers says Tehran can only use first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, which are less efficient, at the underground plant and that those are the only machines with which Iran may accumulate enriched uranium. Iran recently moved one cascade of IR-2m machines underground at Natanz.
""In a letter dated 2 December 2020, Iran informed the Agency that the operator of the Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP) at Natanz 'intends to start installation of three cascades of IR-2m centrifuge machines' at FEP,"" the IAEA's report to its member states said.
Iran has breached many of the deal's core restrictions on its nuclear activities in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the agreement and his reimposition of crippling U.S. economic sanctions. Tehran says its breaches can quickly be reversed if Washington's moves are undone.

Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he will bring the United States back into the deal if Iran resumes full compliance with its nuclear restrictions. That raises the prospect of a standoff over who should move first.

Gbagbo welcomed the move as a conciliatory gesture from President Alassane Ouattara, whose bitter standoff with opponents over his election for a third term has called into question the West African nation's hard-won stability.
Gbago has not said what he plans to do on his return, but his presence in Ivory Coast could energise opposition factions after their failure to derail October's vote through a boycott.
Gbagbo, who served as president from 2000 until his arrest in 2011 at the end of a brief civil war caused by his refusal to concede electoral defeat to Ouattara, had hoped to challenge Ouattara again at the ballot box.
But he was not granted a passport to return from Europe and his candidacy was barred by the authorities, who cited a criminal conviction in Ivorian court for misappropriating funds from the central bank during the war. 
On Friday, he received a diplomatic and a regular passport in Brussels and will return to Ivory Coast before the end of the year, his lawyer, Habiba Toure, said in a statement.
Gbagbo ""welcomes the move by the Ivorian authorities, which he sees as being in the spirit of appeasement"", she said. 
Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Ouattara to extend an olive branch to opponents including Gbagbo to ease tensions.
Gbagbo faced trial in The Hague for crimes against humanity and war crimes related to the civil war, which killed 3,000 people. He was acquitted in January 2019, but the prosecution is appealing against the verdict. 

He and other opposition leaders contested Ouattara's right to run for a third term this year. The dispute led to clashes that killed 85 people before and after the election and the arrest of opposition figures.

The center-right government of president Sebastian Pinera, a proponent of the measure, had urged lawmakers to fast-track the legislation, which creates a new, beefed up Immigration Service, establishes new qualifications for entry and ratchets up sanctions against illegal immigrants.
The bill was approved by 38-2 in Chile's Senate and now awaits Pinera's signature. It offers special protection to refugees from countries where they may be persecuted, as well as to pregnant women and victims of trafficking or domestic abuse. 
The legislation also allows any migrant who entered Chile prior to March 18, 2020 - shortly after the pandemic struck - a period of 180 days to formalize their immigration status within the country. 
Chile, the world's top copper producer, has in recent years become a magnet for migrants from poorer Latin American countries, notably Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and Peru.
That has sparking concerns among some Chileans about illegal immigration and the loss of local jobs to foreigners.
Some lawmakers say the bill approved on Thursday does not go far enough to protect the rights of children and migrant workers, and have threatened to take those arguments to the country's Constitutional Tribunal.
As Latin America's richest country in terms of GDP per head, according to IMF figures, Chile is among the continent's most attractive destinations for migrants. More than one million people have migrated there since 2014, bringing the foreign-born population to 1.5 million, according to government figures.

A Department of Migration report this year predicted that migrant numbers could increase further to 250,000 a year once the COVID-19 crisis subsides, pointing to an International Monetary Fund report that suggested Chile's economy would rebound quicker than most.

1591,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 09:01AM ET</span>",Explainer: India's multi-billion dollar food programme is at the heart of farmers' protests,"By Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of Indian farmers angered by farm laws that they say threaten their livelihoods have intensified their protests by blocking highways and camping out on the outskirts of the capital Delhi.
The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of protesting farmers' unions have held several rounds of talks but have not made any progress in breaking the deadlock over the set of laws passed by parliament in September. 
Although various farmer unions have supported the protest, the agitation is largely led by the growers of relatively well-off states of Punjab and Haryana in India's north.
Every year the Indian government spends billions of dollars on buying millions of tonnes of rice and wheat from Punjab and Haryana, and the world's most expensive food procurement programme has now become the centrepiece of India's biggest farmers' protest in years.
HOW DOES INDIA RUN ITS MAMMOTH FOOD PROCUREMENT PROGRAMME?
After calculating the cost of cultivation, the state-run Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) announces Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for more than 22 commodities yearly to set a benchmark.
Although every year the CACP announces MSPs for most crops, the Food Corporation of India (FCI), the main state-run grain procurement agency, buys only rice and wheat at those prices due to a lack of storage and funds. 
After buying rice and wheat from farmers at MSPs, the FCI sells the staples at highly subsidised prices to the poor. The government compensates the FCI for its losses. 
HAS STATE PROCUREMENT PROGRAMME LED TO OVERPRODUCTION OF RICE AND WHEAT?
Guaranteed prices offered by the FCI encourage farmers to produce large quantities of rice and wheat. Higher production puts pressure on the FCI to buy extra supplies from farmers, resulting in overflowing state warehouses and a ballooning subsidy bill that often pushes up the budget deficit. 
Despite sitting on massive mounds of rice and wheat, the FCI finds it challenging to export as the annual rise in MSPs and its own storage costs make FCI's rice and wheat more expensive than world prices, making overseas sales uneconomic.
Once in a while, the Indian government gives small quantities of rice and wheat to other countries through diplomatic deals. Still, FCI's warehouses are chock-a-block.
WHO LARGELY BENEFITS FROM FCI'S SAFETY NET?
The safety net ironically covers relatively well-off farmers from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, forcing their poorer counterparts from Bihar and other underdeveloped states to sell at a discount.
Every year, farmers from Punjab and Haryana sell almost their entire produce to the FCI at MSPs thanks to well-developed market yards and efficient procurement centres, a far cry from Bihar's underdeveloped grain procurement infrastructure.
Also, unlike poor farmers from Bihar, the rich and politically influential farming community of Punjab and Haryana ensures that the FCI continues to buy large volumes of rice and wheat from their states, where agriculture is a mainstay.
While Punjab and Haryana sell almost their entire rice and wheat output to FCI, the government agency's procurement in Bihar has remained at less than 2% of the state's total production.
Left out of the safety net, most farmers from Bihar are forced to sell at a discount of 25% to 35%.

Already deprived of assured returns, farmers from Bihar have not explicitly opposed the new laws which growers from Punjab and Haryana fear will eventually pave the way for the FCI to stop buying their grain at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers.

1592,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","Trying to limit sanctions pain, Venezuela pushes private firms into Asia, Middle East trade: sources","By Corina Pons and Mayela Armas
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's government is encouraging private firms to sign import and export deals with companies in Asia and the Middle East as part of an effort to limit the impact of U.S. sanctions, according to four sources with knowledge of the matter.
    The plan expands on President Nicolas Maduro's existing commercial relationships with allies such as Turkey and Iran, which have already been providing the cash-strapped government with food and fuel in exchange for gold.
    Vice President and Finance Minister Delcy Rodriguez has been developing the strategy for over a year, according to the sources, paving the way for private firms to export pineapples and mangos to Iran and import pasta from Turkey.
Rodriguez has created a new vice ministry of foreign commerce and sent allies to these new markets to promote private trade deals, according to public statements, seeking ways around a broad sanctions package meant to force Maduro from office.
    Because operations of private Venezuelan companies are not explicitly targeted by U.S. sanctions, shifting trade away from state-run firms and toward private enterprise makes foreign partners more interested in Venezuela deals, said the sources, who asked not to be identified. 
Venezuelan companies also benefit from trading with firms in Turkey or Iran because Western hemisphere businesses are so scared of sanctions that they at times avoid operations even when the U.S. Treasury has explicitly authorized them, the sources said. 
Though the total volume of trade remains low, it signals a new effort on the part of the ruling Socialist Party to skirt sanctions that the incoming Biden administration is expected to maintain even though they show few signs of toppling Maduro.
""They're creating a new institutionality to confront sanctions,"" said one finance sector source with direct knowledge of the strategy. 
""There's a transition from the West to Asia and the Middle East. With the difference that they're going to allow private players to participate in the business without the government's involvement."" 
Rodriguez, along with advisers skilled in diplomacy, have attended virtual forums and meetings with local and foreign companies to discuss foreign trade, according to the sources and public documents.
The information ministry, the finance ministry and the vice president's office did not reply to requests for comment.
ECONOMIC LIBERALIZATION
The new exports are reflected in data provided by Import Genius, a firm that collects customs records for the import-export industry. The figures provided by the company show volumes, but not the associated monetary values.
The Venezuelan shift aligns with a broad economic liberalization of last year in the wake of more than a decade of nationalizations and price controls under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez. Maduro's government began allowing the widespread use of hard currency, which had previously been illegal, and allowed the export of food, for years discouraged.
""I have legally authorized the export of up to 30 percent of products,"" Maduro said in a televised broadcast in September. ""We're going to convert Venezuela into an exporting nation.""
Thirty-five private Venezuelan firms imported food from Turkey in the first six months of 2020, up from seven during all of 2019, according to Import Genius data. 
The companies brought in 140,000 tonnes of products including pasta, oil, and canned meat in the first six months of the year, according to the data. 
State-run food company Cuspal, which in 2018 and 2019 had imported those goods from Turkey, halted them this year, the data shows - further evidence of imports moved out of the government's hands.
The port data provided by Import Genius did not include the monetary value of the exports and imports.
The Food Ministry, which oversees Cuspal, did not respond to a request for comment. 
A company called Casa Fresca in July shipped 122 tonnes of mangos and 200 tonnes of pineapples to Iran, the firm's CEO Luz Rodriguez told state television in August, adding that the company's focus is exporting fruit to the Middle East.
The CEO and Casa Fresca did not respond to requests for comment.
Grupo Freemed, which describes itself as an importer and distributor of food, medicine and cosmetics, this year imported 4.6 tonnes of sildenafil, used to treat erectile dysfunction, from Iran, according to port data.
Via an Instagram account, it sells hypertension and heart medication made by Iranian laboratories. 
Venezuela, which began importing gasoline from Iran this year as part of efforts to skirt U.S. sanctions, has not imported consumer goods from Iran since 2006, according to port records.
Grupo Freemed did not respond to a request for comment.
Venezuelan ranchers this year exported meat for the first time to Iraq. Agricultural producers shipped 10,700 tonnes of mung beans to Malaysia, India, the Philippines, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

The government was active in helping negotiate those exports, according to one industry source who asked not to be identified.

Colonel Munir Abu Rjeili was found dead in his home on Wednesday in Qartaba, some 40 km (25 miles) northeast of Beirut, with a blow to the head, a security source said.
Leading Druze politician Walid Jumblatt asked on Twitter on Thursday what was behind the killing. He questioned whether there was a link with the Aug. 4 explosion at Beirut port that killed about 200 people and devastated swathes of the capital.
""Is this terrible incident to obstruct any serious investigation into the case of the explosion at Beirut port?"" Jumblatt wrote. 
But a senior interior ministry source said: ""So far, no link has been found between the port and the murder"". 
Abu Rjeili's career in Lebanese customs included leading a Beirut division that counters overland smuggling, serving at the airport and heading a division of the Higher Customs Council, according to CV sent by a relative and lawyer, Joseph Khalil.
Abu Rjeili had not been summoned for questioning in the investigation in to the Beirut blast probe and had not served at the port, the source said.
Khalil, the lawyer, said the family was waiting for the results of the investigation.
Four months since the explosion, Lebanese are still awaiting the final results of the investigation, after authorities promised a full and swift probe.
President Michel Aoun last month called for the acceleration of the investigation.

The first warning about the cargo that blew up in Beirut port came in 2014 from another late Lebanese customs officer, Colonel Joseph Skaf. Skaf's family believe his death in 2017 was murder, possibly connected to his long career as a customs officer fighting criminality and drug smuggling.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Chinese official's tweet of an image of an Australian soldier that sparked a furious reaction from Canberra was amplified across social media by unusual accounts, of which half were likely fake, an Israeli cybersecurity firm and Australian experts said.
The digitally altered image of an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child was tweeted by China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian on Monday.
Twitter declined Australia's request to remove the tweet.
The Chinese embassy in Canberra told ABC television on Friday that Prime Minister Scott Morrison's demand for an apology drew more attention to an investigation into war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan.
Cyabra, an Israeli cybersecurity firm, said it found evidence of an orchestrated campaign to promote Zhao's tweet. 
Cyabra said it had found 57.5% of accounts that engaged with Zhao's tweet were fake, and ""evidence of a largely orchestrated disinformation campaign"" to amplify its message.
The firm did not give any details about who was behind the campaign.
Cyabra said it analysed 1,344 profiles and found a large number were created in November and used once, to retweet Zhao's tweet.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Queensland University of Technology's Tim Graham (NYSE:GHM) analysed 10,000 replies to Zhao's tweet. 
Accounts originating in China were the most active, he said, and 8% of replies were from accounts created on the day, or in the 24 hours prior. Many contained duplicated text. 
""When not tweeting about Afghan children, they were tweeting about Hong Kong,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
""If there's enough of them, those irregularities suggest they were set up for a particular campaign.""
Some of the accounts had already been identified by Graham in a data-set of 37,000 Chinese accounts targeting Australia since June, he said.
Ariel Bogle, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said she had also noticed ""unusual behaviour"" by Twitter accounts retweeting or liking Zhao's tweet.
""There was a spike in accounts created on November 30 and December 1,"" she told Reuters, adding it was too early to determine if it was coordinated inauthentic behaviour or patriotic individuals.
Many of the new accounts only followed Zhao, plus one or two other accounts, she said. A third of accounts liking Zhao's tweet had zero followers, ASPI noted.
Earlier this year, Twitter said it had removed 23,750 accounts spreading geopolitical narratives favourable to the Chinese Communist Party, and another 150,000 accounts designed to amplify these messages.
A Twitter spokeswoman said the company remains vigilant, but the Cyabra findings ""don't hold up to scrutiny"" because it relied only on publicly available data.

A Cyabra spokeswoman said its founders are information warfare experts with Israeli military backgrounds, and the U.S. State Department was among its clients.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India summoned Canada's ambassador on Friday and said comments made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over protests by farmers near Delhi were an interference in its domestic affairs and would seriously hurt bilateral ties. 
Trudeau, speaking to the Indian community in Canada, said this week that he was concerned about the farmers, most of them from the Sikh-dominated Indian state of Punjab, camped out on the outskirts of Delhi in a protest against farm reforms.
The Indian foreign ministry said in a statement that comments on ""issues relating to Indian farmers constitute an unacceptable interference in our internal affairs.""
India and Canada have warm ties, but in recent years there has been concern in India that some Sikh leaders in Canada have ties to separatist groups hostile to India.
Canada is home to an influential Sikh community and Indian leaders say there are some fringe groups there that are still sympathetic to the cause of an independent Sikh state called Khalistan, carved out of India.
The Indian foreign ministry said comments made by Trudeau and other leaders had emboldened radical groups and they were a risk to its diplomatic staff based in Canada. 
""We expect the Canadian Government to ensure the fullest security of Indian diplomatic personnel and its political leaders to refrain from pronouncements that legitimize extremist activism,"" it said.
There was no comment from the Canadian embassy.

The Indian government has held talks with the farmers to end the impasse and persuade them that farm reforms were in their interest in the long-term.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has not yet won over countries seeking more cash and conditions in exchange for committing to sharper emissions cuts, as it tries to strike a deal on on its new climate target by the end of the year.
The EU has promised to make a tougher emissions-cutting target this year under the Paris climate accord, a move U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said is ""essential"" to global efforts to avoid catastrophic climate change.
The aim is for leaders of the 27-nation EU, which is the world's third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, to endorse the new goal at a summit on Dec. 10-11. 
But that ambition looks increasingly shaky. Poland and Hungary are threatening to veto the bloc's next budget, which could freeze the cash they and other countries say they need to curb their emissions.
The latest draft of the climate deal, seen by Reuters, would commit the EU to cut emissions by ""at least 55%"" by 2030, from 1990 levels. The EU's current target is a 40% cut.
The deal also includes a so-called ""enabling framework"", sketching out a plan to deliver the goal, with assurances on EU funding and countries' right to choose their own energy mix. This is where the problems lie.
EASTERN DISCOMFORT
EU officials said several countries, including Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Malta and Bulgaria, were not ready to endorse the latest text.
""The enabling framework is not sufficient at this point,"" a Czech official said, calling for clearer guarantees of funding for the ""costly"" economic transition ahead. ""We are definitely going to need more assurance from the EU.""
A Slovak official said the latest draft ""goes in the right direction"", but that eastern countries' requests had not been fully met. Those include doubling an EU fund, made up of revenues from carbon trading, to help poorer countries invest in clean power.
An official from another country not yet backing the deal said it was ""vague"" and called for an acknowledgement that countries' contributions to the EU target would vary based on their size and economic heft. 
Denmark, Spain and the Netherlands are among the states pushing for a climate deal next week. 
Britain, now outside the EU, upgraded its own 2030 emissions-cutting goal on Thursday, and with major emitters like China also mulling tougher targets, campaigners warned the EU not to get left behind.

""The EU's credibility is in the balance,"" Greenpeace policy advisor Sebastian Mang said.

The Philippines celebrates one of the world's longest Christmas seasons, starting as early as September, and crowds have started to flock to sprawling malls and shopping centres despite the pandemic.
Police general Cesar Binag, commander of the coronavirus task force, told a news conference that police and soldiers would patrol in public areas in the capital Manila, the hotspot of COVID-19 cases, carrying 1 meter rattan sticks to measure distancing.
""It can be used to cane the hardheaded,"" Binag said, adding that the ""social distancing patrols"" would focus on high-traffic areas such as transport hubs and public markets.
The plan will likely raise eyebrows with human rights advocates who have criticised the government's militaristic approach to the pandemic.
Authorities have apprehended, warned and penalised around 700,000 people since March for violating measures such as ignoring physical distancing and not wearing masks, police data shows.
President Rodrigo Duterte imposed one of the world's strictest and longest coronavirus lockdowns in mid-March, grinding the economy to a halt. Restrictions were partially removed in June to allow more businesses to reopen.
For the holidays, the government banned Christmas parties, family reunions and carol singing outside homes, while an earlier plan to allow minors to visit to shopping malls was scrapped.

With more than 436,000 infections and around 8,500 deaths, the Philippines has the second highest COVID-19 cases and casualties in Southeast Asia, next to Indonesia. The Philippines has a population of 108 million.

MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - It took Luis Salgado years of manual labor to save enough money to open a small fresh produce store, so when torrential floods swept away $1,500 worth of apples, bananas and other fruits, he decided there was no longer a future for him in Honduras.
Salgado had already been struggling to eke out a profit after measures to curb the novel coronavirus such as additional cleaning cut into his meager revenues. But the destruction of Hurricane Eta in early November left him in debt and unable to feed his three children.
So he set out with three neighbors to try to cross Guatemala, then Mexico and eventually find work in the United States.
""First the pandemic, and then the hurricane ... we have no money for our children,"" he said on the journey north.
Back-to-back hurricanes Eta and Iota internally displaced more than half a million people in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua, according to International Organization for Migration data. The U.N. agency said at least a third could be displaced for more than three months, hampering their ability to earn a living and rebuild their lives. 
""Every day, about 20 new people arrive because they lost their land, their homes, and their crops in Honduras and Guatemala,"" said Gabriel Romero, the director of a migrant shelter in the southern Mexican city of Tenosique.
Thousands more Central Americans say they're planning to join northbound caravans with names like ""Caravan for Flood victims"" scheduled to begin departing from Honduras in the coming weeks, according to conversations in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp groups dedicated to coordinating the efforts.
Such a mass movement could become a major test for the incoming administration of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden as it tries to undo some of President Donald Trump's most severe anti-immigration measures without turning pent up pressure into a border crisis.
On the election campaign trail, Biden promised a $4 billion plan to address underlying factors driving migration from Central America. Advocacy group Refugees International says such relief, while welcome, will take years to have an impact.
MASS UNEMPLOYMENT
Even before the storms, Central American nations were reeling from economic crises brought on by the pandemic and mass unemployment led to a steady increase in migration north. 
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not yet released November data on migrants caught crossing from Mexico, though experts say factors including immediate disruption to mobility during the storms may have temporarily slowed the overall rise in numbers. 
Honduran farmer David Tronches said he had no choice but to migrate after Eta's deluge flooded the corn and bean fields he'd sown to feed his family, including an infant daughter.
""We plant and harvest to sell and to have enough to eat,"" said Tronches, 20, speaking from a makeshift migrant shelter in the northern Mexican city of Saltillo. ""Without the harvest, what are we going to sell? How are we going to eat?""
Outside another shelter in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, which serves as a transit hub for migrants heading toward the Texas border, people swapped stories and videos about the storm's catastrophic damage.
""This is where my house was,"" said Marlen Almendarez, 30, showing fellow travelers a video of a mud field strewn with soggy piles of clothes, part of a refrigerator, and other remnants of the one-time neighborhood in the municipality of La Lima, southeast of San Pedro Sula, Honduras.
""My bed where I slept with my son was thrown all the way over there, to the Oxxo!"" she said, gesturing at a convenience store over 50 meters away.
Riccy Martinez, 25, who said she also lost her home in the floods, shook her head.
""You'll see how many people are going to start coming because they lost their homes,"" she said.
'NO CHOICE EXCEPT TO FLEE'
Julio Almendarez, a resident of San Pedro Sula suburb Chamelecon in Honduras, said he was forced to flee to a storm shelter after a river burst its banks during Iota. While inside the shelter, he said, he and hundreds of other displaced residents held a meeting and decided to form a caravan to leave Honduras on Dec. 10 with the aim of reaching the United States.
""I decided to leave because we lost everything,"" he said, adding that he's trying to collect enough money to pay the buses fares required for parts of the journey.
Other migrants bypassed the storm shelters, where aid workers fear the overcrowded conditions could lead to a new spike in coronavirus cases, and hit the road immediately.
Kevin Ventura, 25, from the central Honduran city of Intibuca, said he'd already begun considering migrating after receiving death threats from a gang that sought to recruit him to sell drugs. When Eta's winds brought a tree crashing into his family's house, forcing his mother and grandmother into a storm shelter, he worried it would be too easy for gang members to find him there. Instead, he quickly hopped a bus headed towards the Guatemalan border.
Giovanni Bassau, the regional representative of the U.N. Refugee Agency (UNHCR), said there has been gang activity, including violence and extortion, inside the storm shelters in cities where such semi-organized crime has long held sway, and that he expects the hurricanes to worsen the instability that allows such groups to flourish.
""If you have a community that is run, to some degree, by the gangs, all you're doing when you add shelters and flooding is making things worse,"" Bassau said. 

""It leaves people with really no choice except to flee,"" he said.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Russia protested on Friday after Latvia charged several journalists from the Rossiya Segodnya news agency with violating European Union sanctions.
The journalists were charged because of their association with Dmitry Kiselyov, who heads Rossiya Segodnya, said Sputnik Latvia, a subsidiary of Rossiya Segodnya.
The Kremlin media mogul was sanctioned by the EU for his role in Russia's seizure of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.
""We consider such actions of intimidation against journalists unacceptable"", Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's press secretary, was quoted as saying by Baltnews, another Rossiya Segodnya outlet.
""We count on a prompt and tough response from the relevant international organisations"".
Latvia's counter-intelligence State Security Service said on Friday it had initiated ""court-sanctioned proceedings"" against seven unnamed people for alleged violation of EU sanctions.
Rossiya Segodnya said it intended to ask international and European organisations to react ""to actions by the Latvian government against journalists"" which it said violated freedom of speech.
The Baltic States of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, which were dominated by Moscow in the Soviet era but are now members of NATO and the EU, worry that their Russian-speaking minorities can be influenced by state-owned Russian media.

In June, Latvia and Lithuania took Russian broadcaster RT off the air, calling its channels ""propaganda"" and citing its ties to Kiselyov.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 04, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",Russian state employees describe pressure to join vaccine trials,"By Polina Ivanova, Rinat Sagdiev, Gleb Stolyarov and Kate Kelland
MOSCOW (Reuters) - In late September, Moscow municipal official Sergei Martyanov sent a series of text messages to his subordinates: ""Colleagues!!!... What is this sabotage???""
Martyanov was expressing dismay at his staff's apparent reluctance to volunteer for the human trials of Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, named after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race. The official in the Moscow department of city property said many quota spots for his staff to join the trial remained unfilled.
He said he had heard some workers were signing up to receive flu vaccines, making them ineligible for the coronavirus trial.
""Who are you trying to trick???"" Martyanov said in the texts. ""The coronavirus vaccine is the absolute priority!!!""
Anyone who had received the flu jab, he said, must still sign up for the COVID trial, allowing a month's delay. He urged his colleagues to recruit friends and family into the trials. ""At least two people per employee!"" 
Martyanov, the head of his department and Moscow's city administration did not respond to requests for comment. The Moscow health department said the vaccine has already successfully passed two stages of clinical trials and has shown its safety, and the decision to participate in the trial is made by residents only voluntarily and only after a medical examination.
But the messages, seen by Reuters, reveal how some Russian state employees are coming under heavy pressure to sign up for the trials, an effort that medical ethicists say may run afoul of ethical norms for voluntary participation in such tests. 
A source close to Martyanov's department told Reuters that all departments in Moscow's city administration, which employs around 20,000 people, were set quotas for participation in the trials. 
Russia's vaccine testing began in early September and is in its final phase in 29 clinics across Moscow. About 20,000 people have already taken part. The government says interim results show the vaccine is 92% effective. The country aims to produce more than a billion doses of the shots at home and abroad next year.
Even before the trials have been completed, Russians are already receiving the vaccine. The medicine received formal regulatory approval from Russian authorities in August; Russia, which has the world's fourth-highest number of recorded COVID-19 cases, says it has so far inoculated more than 100,000 people considered at high risk such as military personnel, doctors and teachers.
President Vladimir Putin has said the vaccine ""passed all checks."" Putin himself has yet to be vaccinated, however: His position means he cannot take something that is still being tested, the Kremlin says. In August, Putin said one of his daughters had been inoculated and was fine afterwards. 
In conducting the trials, Moscow is helped by legions of Russian public sector workers who rely on the government for their pay. Over three days in November and six days in October, Reuters reporters visited 13 of the trial clinics and spoke to 32 trial participants. Thirty of the 32 said they had been told about the trial at work. 
Of the 32, 23 people said they were genuine volunteers. Most expressed enthusiasm for participating in the trial. 
Nine said they were not true volunteers. All nine were public sector workers who spoke on condition of anonymity. A few said they felt they could not refuse their employers' entreaties to seek the vaccinations, but that after they arrived, medical tests had shown them to be ineligible, or staff gave them reasons they could use to opt out. 
Some said they got as far as the clinic and then simply refused to take part. None said they had been injected against their will.
Medical ethicists said the pressure being put on state employees may nonetheless be stretching the norms of ethical testing guidelines.
Generally speaking, if people feel there's a cost to them if they refuse to take part in a trial, that is coercion, which wouldn't be justified in the United States, the UK or other Western countries, Oxford University ethics professor Julian Savulescu told Reuters.
Jonathan Ives, a reader in empirical bioethics at Bristol University's Centre for Ethics in Medicine in Britain, said that what counts as coercive can depend on the relationship between those involved.
""Even if very light pressure is being put on an employee by an employer to take part in a trial, and that employee feels their job or wellbeing may be at risk if they do not accede to that pressure, I think this would be coercive, and I would be very concerned about that,"" he said.
The Russian Direct Investment Fund, which is backing the vaccine's development and responsible for its marketing abroad, declined to comment.
Alexei Kuznetsov, an aide at the health ministry, which oversees the Gamaleya Institute where the vaccine is being developed, said the participation of volunteers in clinical trials ""is possible only on a voluntary basis.""
""COMPULSORY""
With the vaccine already approved, some officials have outright ordered staff to receive the shots.
""Our clinic has been issued with a compulsory anti COVID-19 vaccination order for all employees. This is being supervised by the Moscow health department,"" Olga Tsvetkova, deputy chief medical officer at Moscow's Clinic Number 3, announced in a message to staff in October.
""If you refuse to get vaccinated, you could be suspended from work. There is a legislative basis for this,"" she wrote in the WhatsApp message seen by Reuters, without elaborating.
Asked to comment, Clinic Number 3 said Moscow is one of the few regions where healthcare workers are given the opportunity to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, and the order to vaccinate employees of the clinic shows the degree of care it takes. 
""The decision on vaccination is made by employees voluntarily and only after passing a medical examination,"" it said in a statement.
Moscow's health department did not comment on that order.
Savulescu, the Oxford professor, said a vaccine can be ethically rolled out while clinical trials are still underway if there is enough evidence it is safe. ""If you have reached that point, then, it is possible to justify a mandatory policy,"" he said. 
He added that without knowing the safety data on Sputnik V, it was not possible to comment on Russia's decision. The trial organisers have said there were no unexpected adverse events so far and monitoring of the participants is ongoing, but detailed safety data has not been published. 
Mandatory vaccination is common in the U.S. healthcare industry; the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has said in the past that employers have the right to mandate vaccines. In Europe, there is a patchwork of national vaccine regulation. Some countries mandate childhood vaccinations, but experts say employers overall are unlikely to be able to do so for staff.
BUDZHETNIKI
The world community has established norms for ensuring ethical participation in clinical trials. According to guidelines in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, used by most countries globally, individuals taking part in clinical trials must be capable of giving consent, informed of all aspects of the trial that are relevant to them, and taking part voluntarily. 
Russia has adopted a different set of internationally agreed guidelines - from the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH). These also say participation must be voluntary.
The process includes signing an informed consent form. In Moscow, participants sign a similar 16-page document which says participation is voluntary, unpaid, and that ""it is impossible to exclude the possibility of the development of an unexpected undesired effect.""
Staff in Martyanov's department, like others who work for institutions that are financed from the Russian state budget, are known as 'budzhetniki,' or 'budgetniks.' Their ranks are often described in Russia as a reliable tool for the Kremlin when it needs large numbers of people to participate in projects such as voting in elections or referendums.
Sociologist Denis Volkov, deputy director of the Levada-Center, an independent opinion and sociological research organization, said many Russians with government-funded jobs feel duty-bound to deliver what the government wants as part of a social contract between them and the state.
""You are asked by the state, and in exchange it takes care of you and provides you with financial prosperity,"" he said. ""It is a delicate game. They won't force you but will persuade you, convince and give recommendations."" 
According to recent estimates from the Federal State Statistics Service, there are almost 19 million budzhetniki working in jobs in areas such as schools, hospitals, or municipal hygiene in Russia. That's 26% of Russia's working-age population of just under 72 million. 
""HERDED IN""
At a clinic in Solntsevo, a neighbourhood of high-rise apartment blocks on Moscow's outer edge, five people turned up to join the trial over the course of an hour. All five, approached by Reuters, said they didn't actually want to take part but had felt they had to - they were among the nine public sector workers who said their bosses had pressured them to take part. 
""They herded us in here,"" one middle-aged emergency services worker said. His whole team was told they had to sign up, he said. ""It's impossible to say no, you just can't.""
Moscow emergency services said participation in vaccination trials was ""absolutely voluntary, there was no coercion against the personnel,"" and so far 101 volunteers have been vaccinated.
A teacher said that the school where he worked had been allocated a quota of trial spots, but it was more than simply an invitation to take part.
""If they say you have to come, you have to come,"" the teacher said, adding that 17 staff members signed up.
Two hospital workers said they had been sent by their employer. And a worker with a street-cleaning company said he and his colleagues had been told participation was compulsory because they come face-to-face with city residents in the street. 
Asked if he could decline, he laughed: ""No, we work for the public sector.""
All five people at the clinic were ultimately deemed ineligible, so they wound up not receiving the shots.
But one woman aged around 50 at Polyclinic Number 68 in central Moscow took a different view. She said her employer had compelled her to attend, but she had only turned up to exercise her right to formally refuse a jab. 
""I don't want to be a guinea pig,"" she said.
""NO DOWNSIDES""
Most Muscovites Reuters spoke to were keen to join the trials. Asked about side effects, some volunteers who had already had one of the two-jab doses variously described feeling drowsy and said their temperatures briefly rose at the start. None reported any serious impact. 
At Clinic Number 68, a worker with state bank PJSC Sberbank, the largest lender in Russia, said he was offered the vaccine at work and that the first stage of the process - the medical exam - could be done in the company's office. Sberbank said it had actively supported the vaccine development and employees could volunteer for trials but no medical exams took place in its offices.
""You don't need to go around the different clinics. If you want (to be vaccinated) - go ahead. If you don't want to - so be it,"" he said. ""I didn't see any downsides.""

Anton Shirkin, a park worker, said he decided to participate because he frequently visits his elderly parents and because ""ultimately, someone has to do it.""

DURBAN (Reuters) - An explosion rocked South Africa's second-largest crude oil refinery in Durban on Friday injuring seven people, local emergency services said.
Engen, which operates the plant and is majority owned by Malaysia's Petronas, said a fire broke out at around 0510 GMT and was extinguished by 0645 GMT.
""I saw a massive fireball at the centre of the refinery with thick black smoke billowing from it. A few minutes later many vehicles passed by my home,"" Durban resident Shane Lloyd Pretorius told Reuters.
The extent of damage or the impact on production at the 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery was not clear.
Those injured are in a stable condition, KwaZulu-Natal emergency medical services spokesman Robert McKenzie said.
Engen said in a statement that the cause of the fire was under investigation. It made no mention of injuries or output and said it would provide another update later.
A Reuters witness at the scene saw several fire engines spraying foam onto the affected part of the refinery, as well as ambulances, metropolitan police and national police standing by.
Africa's most industrialised economy has six refineries, four using crude oil and two synthetic fuel as feedstock. It is a net importer of petroleum products.
The country's third-biggest crude oil refinery, a 100,000 bpd facility operated by Astron Energy in Cape Town, also suffered an explosion earlier this year.
Top refinery SAPREF, which is also located in Durban and is a joint venture between BP (NYSE:BP) and Shell (LON:RDSa), said the incident at Engen's facility had no impact on its operations.
The Engen Refinery and SAPREF form part of a major petrochemical hub on the east coast close to Durban's port.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in reshuffled his cabinet on Friday as his approval rating sank to a record low amid a backlash over housing policies, rising coronavirus cases, and a scandal involving the justice ministry and top prosecutors.
Moon nominated new ministers of interior, health, land and housing, and gender as he sought to refresh his administration, with roughly two years of his presidency to run.
Limited to a single term, and holding a small parliamentary majority, there is no obvious risk to Moon's presidency, but the drop in ratings, a resurgence of coronavirus cases and nagging domestic controversies could make it harder for him to fulfil his agenda.
Key goals include reforming the prosecutor's office, and launching an ambitious green new deal initiative to go net zero carbon by 2050. While the ruling Democratic Party's majority is uncomfortably slim, the opposition, luckily for Moon, has struggled to recover from the disarray caused by the scandals that brought down his conservative predecessor.
Moon had earned higher approval ratings earlier in the year for the government's success in handling the first wave of the coronavirus epidemic, but it is now facing difficulties containing a third wave.
On Friday South Korea reported more than 600 daily new cases, a level unseen since a peak in the spring. The outgoing health minister had faced questions over some decisions, including a relatively slow process to procure vaccines.
A survey by pollster Realmeter showed Moon’s approval ratings fell to 37.5%, down from 43.8% the previous week.
A Gallup Korea poll put his approval rating at 39%, revisiting lows recorded by that survey since he came into office in 2017. Respondents cited Moon's failure to rein in sky-rocketing housing prices, despite multiple mortgage curbs and other measures, as the main reason for marking him down.
Having come to office promising to reform politics after his predecessor was removed over corruption charges, Moon has been dogged by scandals as well.
One of his key goals has been to rein in what he sees as an overly politicized national prosecutors' office.
But critics say Moon's efforts have been driven by his own political interest in ousting a prosecutor general who has been investigating some of the president's top allies, including a former justice minister who was forced to resign in October after only a month amid corruption allegations.
Moon's new justice minister, Choo Mi-ae, suspended the prosecutor general, Yoon Seok-youl, last week, accusing him of corruption, which he denies. His suspension is being reviewed by a disciplinary committee, which will announce its findings next week.
Though he has not publicly expressed interest in politics, Yoon has now risen to the top of several polls as a popular pick to run for president in 2022.
Political analysts said it will be difficult for Moon to regather support without real policy reforms.

""A reshuffle is good when it comes to a quick response, but unless the policy is altered, a change in minister won’t bring any changes to the current housing market situation or the political row involving the prosecutor general,"" said Shin Yul, a political science professor at Myongji University in Seoul.

CHITTAGONG, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladesh naval vessels carried some 1,600 Rohingya refugees towards a remote island in the Bay of Bengal on Friday despite complaints by refugees and humanitarian groups that some were being coerced.
Bangladesh says it is only moving refugees who are willing to go to Bhasan Char and it will ease chronic overcrowding in camps that are home to more than 1 million Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority who have fled neighbouring Myanmar.
But refugees and humanitarian workers say some of the Rohingya had been coerced into going to Bhashan Char a flood-prone island that emerged from the sea 20 years ago.
A naval official said the Rohingya were aboard seven boats, with two more carrying supplies, that set out from the southern port of Chittagong. 
Refugees were packed across the decks of the naval vessels on plastic chairs. Some brought umbrellas to shelter from the sun on a journey that takes several hours.
""The government is not taking anyone to Bhashan Char forcibly. We maintain this position,"" Foreign Minister Abdul Momen told reporters late on Thursday.
But two Rohingya being relocated told Reuters their names appeared on lists compiled by government-appointed local leaders without their consent, while aid workers said officials used threats and enticements to pressure people into going.
""They have taken us here forcefully,"" a 31-year-old man told Reuters tearfully by phone as he boarded a bus from the camps near Cox's Bazar. ""Three days ago, when I heard that my family is on the list, I ran away from the block, but yesterday I was caught and taken here,"" he said.
An 18-year-old woman said her husband had put their names on the list thinking it was for food rations. He fled when they were told to go to Bhasan Char, she said, adding that she is also hiding in the camp.
They were among more than 730,000 Rohingya who fled Myanmar in 2017 following a military-led crackdown that the United Nations said was executed with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies genocide and says its forces were targeting Rohingya militants who attacked police posts.
""Not one refugee should be moved until all human rights and humanitarian concerns have been resolved and genuine informed consent is assured,"" said Ismail Wolff, director of the Fortify Rights group.
Human Rights Watch said it had interviewed 12 families whose names were on the lists, but had not volunteered to go.
Two aid workers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said refugees had come under pressure from government officials who used threats and offers of cash and other enticements to persuade them to go to the island.
The United Nations said in a statement it had been given ""limited information"" about the relocations and was not involved in preparations.
Bangladesh has built more than a thousand cinderblock housing units on Bhasan for the Rohingya refugees.

More than 300 refugees were brought to the island earlier this year after several months at sea in an attempt to flee Bangladesh. Rights groups say they are being held against their will and have complained of human rights violations.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The sister of a Thai pro-democracy activist who rights groups say was abducted by unknown gunmen in Cambodia called on Friday for authorities to solve the case after holding a Buddhist prayer ceremony to mark six months since his disappearance.
Wanchalearm Satsaksit, 37, was bundled into a vehicle in front of his Phnom Penh apartment in June, New York-based Human Rights Watch said. Cambodian police have previously said they were unaware a kidnapping had taken place. 
During the brief ceremony outside Wanchalearm's apartment, Buddhist monks chanted and scattered sacred water.
""We do not know the perpetrator; however it is the duty and responsibility of authorities both in Cambodia and Thailand to find the truth,"" Wanchalearm's sister, Sitanun Satsaksit, told reporters after the ceremony.
Wanchalearm was speaking on his mobile phone to Sitanun when he was abducted, the elder sister has said previously.
Sitanun said the family still hoped to be reunited with their brother but said the response of authorities in both countries had not been sufficient.
Sitanun is due to appear at a hearing about the case in a Phnom Penh court on December 8, where she plans to submit photographs and videos to show that her brother was in the city at the time of his alleged abduction.
Cambodian national police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun, who had previously said police were unaware of the incident, declined to comment on Friday.
In a statement, Thailand's embassy in Phnom Penh said it was following the case, but could not provide specific comment at this time since ""the case is currently under legal process.""
The embassy said it was closely cooperating with Cambodian authorities and would continue to provide assistance to Wanchalearm's family. 
At least eight other Thai activists who fled the country after a 2014 military coup have disappeared from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, with some later found dead.

Thai authorities have said they had nothing to do with the disappearances.

(Reuters) - Some damage to Sino-U.S. ties is ""beyond repair"" amid a new wave of Trump administration measures to counter China, Chinese state media warned, amid growing rancour underlined by an ugly Twitter spat between a U.S. senator and Chinese journalists.
Relations between the world's two largest economies have sunk to their lowest point in decades over issues such as trade, technology, security, human rights and COVID-19.
In an editorial, the government-backed China Daily said it viewed as ""worrisome signs"" Washington's decision to limit visitor visas for members of the Chinese Communist Party and their families and a ban on Xinjiang cotton imports. 
""Even if the incoming administration has any intention of easing the tensions that have been sown, and continue being sown, some damage is simply beyond repair, as the sitting U.S. president intends,"" the paper added. 
Relations between the two countries are being shifted to ""a dangerous path"", the editorial said.
The U.S. government also added Chinese chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) to a blacklist of alleged military companies, prohibiting U.S. investors from buying securities issued by the firms starting late next year. 
China's ambassador to the United States became the latest of the Asian nation's senior officials to signal a desire to reset the increasingly confrontational relationship as President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office in January. 
""There are always differences between the two countries. None of them justifies confrontation and war, cold or hot,"" Cui Tiankai said on Twitter.
""With sufficient mutual respect and mutual understanding, we are capable of managing these differences so that they would not derail the entire relationship,"" he said on Thursday.
A person familiar with the matter also told Reuters U.S. prosecutors are discussing a deal with lawyers for Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou to resolve criminal charges against her and end her detention in Canada, which would bring an end to a major source of tension. 
It is unclear whether a Biden administration would bring a dramatic shift, however. 
The Democrat told the New York Times this week that he would not remove existing tariffs set by the Trump administration against China for now. 
Legislation targeting China or Chinese officials over charges of human rights abuses in the western region of Xinjiang and crackdown against pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong have won broad bipartisan support in Congress, as well, further suggesting current policies towards China will stay. 
An exchange of insults on Thursday between U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn and China Daily journalist Chen Weihua underscored persistent animosity. 
Blackburn, a Republican and one of the more outspoken China critics, claimed without evidence on Twitter that China ""has a 5,000 year history of cheating and stealing."" 
In response, Chen accused Blackburn of being the most ""racist and ignorant"" U.S. senator he has seen and calling her a ""lifetime bitch.""
Blackburn responded by calling Chen a ""puppet"" in Chinese President Xi Jinping's ""dream for global domination"" and vowed that the U.S. would not bow to ""sexist communist thugs.""

Hu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of China's Global Times newspaper, also criticised Blackburn on Twitter on Friday, saying it was a pity her ""cognitive level is still as low as a monkey's.""

Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has long angled for a trade deal with its most important diplomatic and military backer, and in August Tsai announced a relaxation on imports of U.S. pork and beef, removing a stumbling block.
In a recorded message to the American Legislative Exchange Council, having received its International Pioneer Award for Leadership, Tsai said that with Taiwan's reliance on trade, the island had to strengthen economic ties with trading partners.
""Therefore, I look forward to making progress on a bilateral trade agreement with the United States, our second-largest trading partner and most important security ally,"" she said. 
Tsai said she was thankful for bipartisan support from U.S. politicians for such a deal.
""Such an agreement would further enhance our close economic and trade partnership, and also reinforce America's support for Taiwan in the face of unrelenting intimidation from across the Strait,"" she added.
China has ramped up its military activities near the island, including on occasion flying fighter jets over the sensitive mid line of the Taiwan Strait, which serves as an unofficial buffer between the two sides.
Tsai said she would ""never stop seeking a peaceful and stable cross-strait relationship"", but that she would also not compromise when making decisions needed to keep Taiwan secure, noting rises in Taiwan's defence budget.
While outgoing U.S. President Donald Trump remains a popular figure in Taiwan for his administration's championing of the island, including new arms sales and visits to Taipei by senior U.S. officials, Taiwan has expressed confidence President-elect Joe Biden's government will continue that support.

Tsai alluded to the incoming administration, saying: ""As we move towards 2021, the Taiwan-U.S. partnership holds enormous opportunities for growth"".

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An Australian court on Friday dismissed eight out of 87 contempt of court charges against media on their reporting of ex-Vatican treasurer George Pell's 2018 conviction for child sex assault.
The trial on the remaining 79 charges that media breached a suppression order on reporting of the cardinal's conviction will continue in January, Supreme Court of Victoria Justice John Dixon said.
Pell was convicted in December 2018 of sexually abusing two choirboys, but reporting on the trial and its outcome was gagged by the County Court of Victoria to ensure the cardinal received a fair trial on further charges he was due to face.
The second case was later dropped and Pell's conviction was quashed by the High Court of Australia in April this year.
Local media did not report the December 2018 verdict, but after overseas media reported the news, naming Pell and the charges, Australian media ran stories saying they were unable to report major news regarding an unnamed high profile figure, and flagged the news was accessible online.
Australian media were charged after that for contempt of court.
Following the prosecutor's opening at trial in November, lawyers for the media had asked the court to throw out the whole case, or dismiss charges against six journalists as they were not responsible for publishing their articles, or dismiss charges against media outside the state of Victoria.
The submissions to dismiss the charges against the six journalists were withdrawn by the media's lawyers, Dixon said.
Dixon threw out the ""sub judice"" contempt charges against News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)'s Courier Mail and Daily Telegraph, and Nine Entertainment's Sydney Morning Herald and 2GB Radio and the four editors associated with those.
He said those newspapers and radio station did not have wide enough circulation in Victoria to taint potential jurors in Melbourne for Pell's second trial. 
However, charges they face for breaching the suppression order remain.
He rejected the submission to throw out the whole case, saying that the prosecution had established that there is a case to answer, even though none of the publications named Pell.
""For these reasons, I am satisfied that the applicant's case is capable of establishing that a real risk of prejudice to the due administration of justice...would be evident to the hypothetical ordinary reasonable reader from the content of the impugned publications,"" Dixon said in his ruling.

LIMA (Reuters) - Protests by farm workers demanding better wages in Peru raged on for a fourth day Thursday, spreading north into key agricultural areas of the Andean nation, derailing harvests of some crops, snarling transport of produce and leaving at least one dead.
Peruvian interim President Francisco Sagasti called the death of a protester a ""tragedy"" and told reporters the government would immediately investigate the first casualty in demonstrations over farm worker rights and wages that began on Monday. 
""We do not want anyone to die in protests to defend their labor rights,"" Sagasti said.
The death of two young people in Lima last month led to the resignation of Sagasti's predecessor, Manuel Merino, prompting renewed scrutiny of the actions of security forces in the Andean nation.
Farm workers alleged police had attacked protesters to clear roadways and tame the demonstrations, which spread northwards from the country's south into regions known for vast fields of table grapes, tangerines and blueberries.
""The workers ... have been attacked by the police who have arrived in great numbers to prevent them from continuing to block the road,"" said Juan Herrera, a national leader of agrarian workers.
Workers from Camposol, a major fruit exporter, joined the fray on Thursday. Farm laborers from agro-exporter Talsa announced they too would join the rallies on Friday.
""All activities have been paralyzed, there are no harvests, there is nothing. Grapes and asparagus are going bad, we are in the middle of the season for these two crops,"" Fernando Cilloniz, a grape exporter, told Reuters.
Peru is a major global exporter of blueberries as well as producing grapes, avocados and asparagus.
Hundreds of buses and tractor trailer trucks carrying fresh fruit were stranded for the fourth day along the Panamericana Sur highway 300 km (190 miles) south of Lima, prompting clashes with protesters blocking the roadways. 

Negotiations between the government and protest leaders have failed to reach agreement, though lawmakers have committed to reviewing a decades-old agriculture promotion law that farm workers view as unjust.

Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday that Romo, a longtime ally and millionaire entrepreneur known for his outreach to business groups, would step down after two years in the job.
The leftist president said Romo would continue to act as a go-between for the government and the private sector, a role that has often been strained over Lopez Obrador's skepticism about private sector involvement in areas such as energy.
""We won't have that office any more because (Romo) will still be helping me without being a government official, and we'll take advantage to make savings too,"" Lopez Obrador said.
Romo's office employed about 40 staffers within the presidential office, which has about 1,000 employees, according to a government source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Most of the 40 workers will be reassigned to other government agencies, the source said.
The head of a major brokerage, Romo was a rare tycoon enthusiastically backing Lopez Obrador, who has often butted heads with business, notably in the oil and electricity sectors where the president has championed a state-centric policy and sharply limited opportunities for private investors.

In a note, consultancy Teneo described the loss of the chief-of-staff and his office as ""a blow to pragmatism"", predicting ties with the business community could worsen, but also cautioning against overstating Romo's past effectiveness.

Prosecutors believe the officials failed to report income and expenditures totalling some 30 million yen ($289,000) related to cherry blossom viewing parties held for Abe supporters when he was in office, the Asahi report said.
Under Japanese law, a summary indictment would mean the officials avoid a full court trial process. But the widely publicised case - which cast a shadow over Abe's final term - may also prove a headline for his successor as Prime Minister, Yoshihide Suga, who defended Abe in parliament over the issue as his right-hand man at the time.
The Asahi said the two officials had admitted the illegality of the omission, which they told prosecutors was their own decision. Prosecutors decided to opt for a summary indictment given the admission of guilt and the amount of money not reported, the paper said.
Abe's office didn't immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Local media reported earlier this week that Abe himself has been asked by Tokyo prosecutors to attend an interview for voluntary questioning. Abe said he ""hadn't heard"" about the request when asked for comment by reporters on Thursday, the daily Yomiuri reported.
The Asahi said on Friday that prosecutors were likely to question the former prime minister after the extraordinary session of parliament ends on Dec. 5. 
Local media has reported, without identifying sources, that Abe's office covered a shortfall of about 8 million yen in party costs, included in the 30 million yen of unreported income and expenditure. Abe repeatedly denied that claim during parliamentary hearings during his tenure.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two firefighters were injured and residents of a rustic Southern California canyon were driven from their homes after a blaze broke out overnight at a single-family home and tore across some 4,000 acres of dry brush and wooded hillsides.
Some 500 firefighters, aided by water-dropping aircraft, were still battling the flames, which sent smoke drifting across Orange and Los Angeles counties. The crews had not achieved any containment as of Thursday afternoon. 
The Bond Fire, named for the street where it started, ignited around 10 p.m. on Wednesday night and was quickly whipped through Silverado Canyon in Orange County by gusty Santa Ana winds. 
""I got a text message from my neighbor saying 'Are you okay? Your street is on fire,'"" said Giovanna Gibson, 60, who lives on Bond Street. She was at her small business office near John Wayne Airport at the time. 
Gibson said she wouldn't have received that warning had she been home in Silverado Canyon, which has little cell phone reception. 
Neighbors told Gibson the blaze ignited when the owners of a home without power tried to start their generator and it exploded. Fire officials have not yet said what they believe to be the cause of the fire.
Two firefighters were injured while battling the blaze and have been transported to a local hospital for further treatement, the Orange County Fire Authority said on Twitter. 
Fire managers said they believed homes and other structures had been damaged by the blaze but could not yet provide details. Southern California Edison had cut power to parts of the canyon at the outset of the hot, dry Santa Ana winds. 
An Edison spokesman confirmed that the utility had cut power to some of the homes in the canyon. 
""We're in December and we now have active wildfires still in our state,"" California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a press briefing. ""These Santa Ana winds have been quite intense."" 
The woodsy Silverado Canyon, miles from Southern California's suburban sprawl and only reachable by a single winding road, is home to an eclectic mix of residents including artists, horse owners and ranchers. 
Since the start of the year, wildfires have scorched more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square km) of California land according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
The yearly land area burned in the western United States has grown eight times larger in less than four decades, the U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station said in research published last month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran is unlikely to retaliate over the assassination of a prominent nuclear scientist before the inauguration of Joe Biden in case it jeopardizes any future sanctions relief, the top U.S. envoy on Iran told Reuters on Thursday.
Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who had little public profile in Iran but had been named by Israel as a prime player in what it says is Iran’s nuclear weapons quest, was killed on Friday when he was ambushed on a highway near Tehran and his car sprayed with bullets.
Elliott Abrams, Washington's special representative on Iran and Venezuela, said in an interview that Tehran was ""desperately"" in need of sanctions relief from the United States and that would be a key calculation in their decision-making as President-elect Biden takes over from President Donald Trump on Jan. 20.
""If they want sanctions relief, they know that they're going to need to enter some kind of negotiation after January 20, and it's got to be in their minds that they don't want to... undertake any activities between now and Jan 20 that make sanctions relief harder to get,"" he said.
Iran’s clerical and military rulers have blamed Israel for Fakhrizadeh's killing, which has raised the prospect of a new standoff between Tehran and its longtime enemy. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office has declined to comment on the killing.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen since 2018, when Trump abandoned Obama's 2015 nuclear deal, and restored harsh economic sanctions to pressure Tehran to negotiate stricter curbs on its nuclear program, ballistic missile development and support for regional proxy forces.
In retaliation, Tehran gradually breached the deal’s restrictions on its nuclear program. Biden has said he will return the United States to the deal if Iran resumes compliance.
Tehran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons. 
Last week, Abrams said the Trump administration was planning to tighten sanctions on Tehran during its final weeks in power but also urged Biden to press for a deal that reduces the regional and nuclear threats posed by the Islamic Republic.
He added that he expected a negotiation to take place with Iran next year and that he believes a deal will be struck under the Biden administration.

Iran's clerical rulers have ruled out negotiations over its missile program or changing its regional policy. Instead it wants a change in U.S. policy, including the lifting of sanctions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. envoy on Venezuela called on the incoming Biden administration on Thursday to use the leverage he believes has been gained from years of tough sanctions aimed at ousting socialist President Nicolas Maduro and urged against offering him any ""giveaways.""
In an interview with Reuters, Elliott Abrams, President Donald Trump's special representative on Venezuela and Iran, said there was a strong bipartisan consensus in Washington over the need to keep pressure on Maduro and he did not expect major changes on U.S. Venezuela policy when Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.
But he added that ""I always have a concern"" the new administration might ease off on Maduro - though he has seen no sign of that from Biden and his aides - and urged instead that it maintain strict sanctions enforcement.
Abrams also threatened further U.S. sanctions against anyone responsible for ""electoral fraud"" in Venezuelan congressional elections scheduled for Sunday. Most of the opposition is boycotting the vote, saying it is rigged in favor of Maduro's Socialist Party, and Abrams reiterated the U.S. view that the election will be a sham.
""They are really up against the wall,"" Abrams said, referring to the economic impact of U.S. sanctions on Maduro and his allies. ""And we've got a lot of leverage; we should use it ... My policy advice (to the Biden administration) would be no giveaways to Maduro."" 
A spokesman for Biden's transition team declined comment.
Despite Trump's campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure, Maduro has remained in power, backed by the OPEC nation's military and supported by Russia, Cuba, China and Iran. U.S. officials have said privately that Maduro's continued rule has been a source of frustration for Trump, who lost the Nov. 3 U.S. election to Biden but has yet to concede.
Biden and his aides have signaled no dramatic shift in Washington's approach to Maduro, which has been based on a broad sanctions program that limits Venezuela's oil exports and blocks U.S. citizens from doing business with his government.
But Biden, who said on Twitter in July that it was time to ""turn the page on the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime,"" is expected to coordinate more with international partners. He will likely faces pressure to ease some measures including restrictions on Venezuela's gasoline imports for humanitarian reasons amid the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. TO STICK WITH GUAIDO
Abrams reaffirmed that the Trump administration will continue recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate interim president and expects dozens of other countries to do the same following Sunday's election. 
The ballot could pave the way toward Venezuela's opposition losing control of the National Assembly, which would complicate Guaido's standing based on his position as the speaker of the congress. But Abrams made clear that the Trump administration would not accept the election outcome.
""There goes Donald Trump's dying government saying they won't recognize the election results,"" Maduro told a campaign rally. ""We don't care what the North American empire says.""
Since early 2019, the United States and more than 50 other countries have backed Guaido, regarding Maduro's 2018 re-election as rigged. Maduro and his allies call Guaido a U.S. puppet.
Some of Guaido's popular support has eroded and fresh cracks have formed in the opposition's unity as Maduro has held onto power.
Abrams said he does not expect the opposition to choose a new leader after Sunday's election, though he said lawmakers ""have a legal right to do that"" if they choose.
""I don't want that to be taken as any reduction in support for Guaido, who we support completely and who we think has done a really amazing job ... under the most difficult circumstances.""
Guaido, who is the head of congress until early January, is organizing a popular consultation to be held between Dec. 5 and Dec. 12 that will ask citizens if they want Maduro to resign, if they believe Sunday's congressional vote was fair, and if they support international efforts to restore democracy. 

Opposition officials have said the consultation will be both physical and digital to ensure social distancing and to allow for the participation of some 5 million Venezuelans who have emigrated to escape the crisis.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 04:41PM ET</span>",Opposition candidates suspected of ties to Venezuela's ruling party defy call for vote boycott,"By Brian Ellsworth and Vivian Sequera
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan politician Henry Gomez is running for parliament as part of an alliance that has promised to confront President Nicolas Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party, but he has an unusual profile for an opposition candidate. 
Gomez in 2017 sought to be a member of the National Constituent Assembly, an all-powerful pro-government body that the opposition and most Western nations said was helping Maduro consolidate a dictatorship. 
His Twitter handle includes the letters PSUV - the acronym of the Socialist Party - and his last tweet is a picture of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez and a message promising to ""follow your legacy.""
Gomez is one of thousands of candidates confronting the Socialist Party on the ballot this weekend who opposition leaders accuse of being shadow allies of Maduro, helping to legitimize an election facing a broad boycott. 
In a telephone interview, Gomez denied being in cahoots with the government, which he thinks has run the country badly. But he also disagrees with the mainstream opposition, which has failed after years of U.S.-backed efforts to oust Maduro. 
""There are two radical positions, and in the middle there are a lot of people who aren't on the left or on the right, they're in the center,"" said Gomez. 
""I'm not an opposition radical.""
Asked about his promise to follow Chavez's legacy, Gomez responded ""I can't deny that there was a moment in which Chavez's discourse was historical.""
First Venezuela and Venezuela United, the two parties backing Gomez's bid, did not respond to requests for comment. But Sunday's election is expected to flip control of parliament, which the opposition won in a landslide election in 2015.
It is also expected to mark a moment when opposition leaders, who have for years represented seething outrage against the Socialist Party, are replaced by a cadre of politicians who offer far more cautious criticism of a government widely accused of undermining democracy. 
Congressional actions have almost all been blocked by pro-government courts and by the National Constituent Assembly. But Sunday's vote, if it hands parliament back to the Socialist Party, will strip the mainstream opposition of its leading platform for challenging Maduro's legitimacy at home and abroad.
On the streets of Fila de Mariches, a winding stretch of poor neighborhoods in the mountains east of Caracas, many are so angry with deteriorating living conditions that they plan to vote for anyone who says they oppose Maduro.
""We're going to vote, obviously against these scoundrels who have done nothing but condition us to misery,"" said unemployed construction worker Eduard Romero, complaining of blackouts, water shortages and rising prices.
Like many Venezuelans, he acknowledged not knowing the names of the candidates on the ballot. He had not heard of Gomez and was unaware of the candidate's historic links to the Socialist Party. 
Candidates running for some of Venezuela's newly-minted opposition parties tend to rely on a split-the-difference discourse that cautiously criticizes Maduro, while also blaming the country's problems on opposition leader and current parliament chief Juan Guaido.
These parties have in some case adopted names and symbols that are easily confused for mainstream opposition parties. 
First Venezuela uses the same black-and-yellow color scheme as First Justice - a mainstream opposition party that over a decade ago flipped places like Fila de Mariches away from the Socialist Party. 
""This was a disgusting maneuver by the dictatorship that today continues to cause confusion,"" said opposition legislator Maria Gabriela Hernandez.The opposition is urging a boycott of Sunday's vote and promoting an independent consultation in which participants, including some 5 million Venezuelans who have emigrated, will be asked if they reject it as fraudulent.
Street level opposition activists have embraced the consultation as a way to maintain political momentum, but many on the streets of Filas de Mariche say they plan to cast ballots.
Retiree Eugenio Morales, 68, who has to walk over a mile (2 km) to a lagoon to collect potable water, railed about how his monthly pension doesn't even buy a carton of eggs. 
He was not convinced by the boycott. 

""I have faith in God that we'll win this,"" said Morales, waiting in a line to buy a tank of propane cooking gas. ""Here we suffer from everything.""

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 04:40PM ET</span>",Trump running out of time to solidify immigration agenda after U.S. election loss,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration is pushing to finalize new immigration restrictions before his term ends in January, according to three senior homeland security officials, a last-gasp effort in a policy area that was a central focus during his four years in office.
The moves come even as Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rescind many of Trump's immigration policies. By finalizing rules that have just been proposed, or issuing last-minute orders, the administration could slow down Biden's efforts to undo many of Trump's signature measures that have made it harder for immigrants to enter and settle in the United States. 
One measure announced this week limits travel to the United States for Chinese Communist Party members and their immediate families. The State Department said on Thursday it was reducing the maximum validity of tourist visas for that group to one month from 10 years.
Another goal for Trump's last few weeks in office is replacing a lottery system used to award H-1B visas to skilled foreign workers, according to officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss government operations. Instead, a new selection process would favor visa applicants with higher-paying jobs.
White House senior adviser Stephen Miller - considered the architect of Trump's hard-line immigration agenda - told Reuters over the summer that the regulations meant to drive up wages in the H-1B program would be politically unpopular to reverse, since the changes are aimed at protecting U.S. workers.
On Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit against  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), accusing the social media giant of discriminating against potential U.S. hires by favoring temporary workers, including H-1B visas holders. A Facebook spokesman said it disputed the allegations in the complaint.
Other measures that could be hurried to the finish line include new rules to restrict access to asylum and a regulation that would allow federal immigration officials to collect DNA from family-based visa applicants and the U.S. citizens or permanent residents who sponsor them. 
Another measure would tighten visa rules for international students, cultural exchange visitors and foreign journalists.
The changes would take the form of regulatory actions that are crafted by agencies and do not require congressional approval but need to follow legal processes outlined in federal law.
News reports have also surfaced about a possible Trump executive order to weaken the constitutional right to citizenship for all people born in the United States. A senior homeland security official told Reuters, however, the effort did not appear to be a priority for the White House.
Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli is spearheading the last-ditch immigration effort, one official told Reuters, as the president continues to promote unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and has not conceded his Nov. 3 election defeat. 
The White House and DHS declined to comment. 
'BEFORE THE CLOCK RUNS OUT'
Trump is not the first president to engage in a last-minute policy push, according to Republican strategist Alex Conant.
""Every outgoing administration tries to do as much as they can before the clock runs out,"" he said. ""There are a lot of true believers in this White House who think immigration is bad for the country and are spending their last hours in power trying to cement their policies.""
Most of Trump's immigration plans are unlikely to be finished, however, before he leaves office and the ones that are hastily pushed through will be vulnerable to court challenges.
A federal judge on Tuesday blocked two different fast-tracked Trump rules targeting the H-1B program. The judge said the administration failed to show ""good cause"" to skip regulatory steps that typically take months or longer.
Rules that have not taken effect by the time Biden takes office on Jan. 20 could be delayed and eventually rescinded, according to three experts in government regulations.
Any work in Trump's final month in office will also likely be slowed down by the Christmas and New Year's holidays and possible departures of Trump appointees, which is typical for outgoing administrations. 
One closely watched policy area will be any final Trump actions related to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was instituted by President Barack Obama, whom Biden served as vice president. 
The Supreme Court in June thwarted Trump's attempt to end DACA, which offers deportation relief and work permits to some 646,000 ""Dreamer"" immigrants brought to the United States as children but who lack legal status.
After the ruling, the Trump administration said it would still consider ending the program and then issued an order that narrowed its scope.
Even though a federal judge ruled against that move in November, the administration could try other last-minute avenues to hamper the program. 
""Nothing would surprise us,"" said Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigrant America's Voice.

Biden has promised to send legislation to Congress that would provide a path to citizenship to the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, including those enrolled in the DACA program.

The tentative agreement does not involve the three other Arab countries that also severed diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017 -- the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt. A fourth person said a broader realignment remained a long way off as the underlying issues, such as Doha’s relations with Tehran, remained unresolved.
The potential breakthrough follows months of intense diplomacy mediated by Kuwait, which reached fruition with a final push from President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and Middle East envoy Jared Kushner, who visited the Gulf this week. Kushner met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the city of Neom, according to two people familiar.
The rapprochement is likely to include reopening air space and land borders, an end to the information war Qatar and Saudi Arabia have waged and other confidence-building steps as part of a detailed plan to gradually rebuild relations, two of the people said.
Asked about a potential breakthrough, a Qatari government representative declined to comment. There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia.
Why the Breach Between Saudis, Qataris Goes On and On: QuickTake
Saudi Arabia and the UAE were the driving force behind the boycott, which divided the world’s top oil-producing region, rerouting air traffic and disrupting trade and business. The UAE has been more reluctant to patch up its ties with Qatar, however, preferring to focus on building its nascent ties with Israel while carefully avoiding any escalation with Iran, diplomats and analysts said.
In contrast, Saudi Arabia is concerned the incoming Biden administration will exert less pressure on the Islamic Republic than Trump, leaving its oil facilities more exposed, they said, and is increasingly at odds with its ally over OPEC policy.
Driving that re-evaluation were the economic hardships dealt by the coronavirus pandemic and Trump’s failure to provide military cover after an attack last year on a major crude processing complex deep inside Saudi territory.
“The shock of the attacks, and the lack of an overt U.S. response to them, led to an overdue reassessment that the real threat to Saudi security came not from Doha but from other actors in the region,” said Kristian Ulrichsen, Middle East fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.”

Diplomacy
The boycotting countries had accused Qatar of bankrolling militant groups and undermining regional attempts to isolate Iran, whose regional and nuclear ambitions they fear. The tiny, gas-rich country has, for decades, given shelter to Islamist dissidents and funded governments and people who were governed by the Muslim Brotherhood, including Egypt in 2012 and 2013. However, it denies it supports Islamist movements directly or funds terrorism.
Though painful, the embargo didn’t inflict enough damage to bring Doha to heel. Instead, it dug into its deep pockets to cushion the economic blow, while reaching out to Iran, Turkey and others to broaden its trade options or reroute its flights.
One area U.S. officials are concerned about is Saudi Arabia’s refusal since the start of the rift to allow Qatari passenger jets into its airspace. Instead, Qatar had been sending its planes over Iran, giving the regime in Tehran tens of millions of dollars in overflight fees.
Officials including Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien also dislike the Iran overflights because they’re worried the government could force Qatar Airways planes to land on its territory, potentially creating a hostage situation if there were any Americans on board, two people familiar with the matter said.
Aramco (SE:2222) Attacks
Trump indirectly set reconciliation in motion with a campaign of bruising sanctions that were meant to force Iran back to the negotiating table but instead set off a cascade of attacks that raised fears the region was sliding into a conflict that could shake oil markets and devastate economies.
Rapprochement efforts, which had made little progress previously, kicked into a higher gear after a September 2019 missile and drone attack briefly knocked out half of Saudi Arabia’s crude production and hit crude oil prices. Washington’s failure to retaliate militarily against Iran, the suspected perpetrator, sent Gulf states the message that they couldn’t depend on the U.S. for protection.
Trump has long wanted to end the rift and has been racing to cement his maximum pressure policy against Iran before he leaves the White House, making it as tricky as possible for Biden to undo.
Only weeks before the presidential election, the U.S. brokered normalization deals between Israel and the UAE as well as Bahrain.
Splits Emerge
Where it begins to heal a rift with Qatar, however, the emerging agreement exposes Saudi Arabia’s growing strains with its closest regional ally, the UAE. Foreign policy differences have bubbled to the surface in recent months over the Saudi-led war in Yemen as well as Emirati involvement in conflicts from Libya to the Horn of Africa.
Nevertheless, while Saudi Arabia and Qatar may have ended open diplomatic hostilities, the fears and foreign policy shifts forged in crisis will not disappear overnight, said Shafeeq Ghabra, a political science professor at Kuwait University.
“When states normalize relations, it doesn’t mean they will build trust, that takes longer, and it’s going to be very difficult for Qatar to let its guard down,” Ghabra said. “All the lines of communication and all the relationships established during the siege era are of a strategic nature, and it’s only natural that Qatar will pursue its relationships established since the siege.”

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>",Could Trump preemptively pardon his family — or even himself?,"By Jan Wolfe
(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's pardoning of his former adviser Michael Flynn has fueled speculation over whether the president could pardon other associates, and even members of his family, during his final weeks in office.
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump talked with his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about pardoning him as recently as last week, citing two people briefed on the matter.
The Times also said Trump has asked advisers about the possibility of ""preemptively"" pardoning his three eldest children.
In 2018, Trump even said he had the ""absolute right"" to pardon himself - a claim many constitutional law scholars dispute.
Here is an overview of Trump's pardon power, which is sweeping but not absolute.
CAN A PARDON BE PREEMPTIVE?
While pardons are typically given to people who have been prosecuted, they can cover conduct that has not resulted in legal proceedings. 
A pardon cannot apply to conduct that has not yet occurred.
The U.S. Supreme Court clarified this in a 1866 case, saying the pardon power “extends to every offense known to the law, and may be exercised at any time after its commission, either before legal proceedings are taken or during their pendency, or after conviction and judgment.”
Most pardons are issued to people who have been prosecuted and sentenced. But in 1977, President Jimmy Carter pardoned hundreds of thousands of ""draft dodgers"" who avoided a government-imposed obligation to serve in the Vietnam War.
ARE THERE LIMITS ON A PRESIDENT'S PARDON POWER?
The pardon power, which comes from the U.S. Constitution, is one of the broadest available to a president. The nation's founders saw the pardon power as a way to show mercy and serve the public good.
A pardon is not reviewable by other branches of government and the president does not have to give a reason for issuing one.
But the pardon power is not absolute. Crucially, a pardon only applies to federal crimes. 
COULD TRUMP PARDON HIS CHILDREN AND INNER CIRCLE?
Yes. It is legal for Trump to pardon his inner circle, including members of his family. 
In 2001, former President Bill Clinton pardoned his brother, Roger, who was convicted for cocaine possession in Arkansas.
Clinton pardoned about 450 people, including a Democratic Party donor, Marc Rich, who fled the country because of tax evasion charges.
HOW BROADLY WORDED CAN A PARDON BE?
This is unclear. 
The pardon former president Richard Nixon received from his successor Gerald Ford was very broad, absolving Nixon for all criminal offenses he committed or may have taken part in during his presidency. 
But the U.S. Supreme Court has never ruled on whether such a broad pardon is lawful. Some scholars have argued the nation's founders intended for pardons to be specific, and that there is an implied limit on their scope.
WHAT WOULD TRUMP PARDON HIS CHILDREN OR GIULIANI FOR?
Trump's children have not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing, and it is unclear what Trump would pardon them for.
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who enforces New York state laws, has been conducting a criminal investigation into Trump and his family company, the Trump Organization.
Vance, a Democrat, has suggested in court filings that his probe could focus on bank, tax and insurance fraud, as well as falsification of business records.
It is unclear what stage the investigation is at. No one has been charged with wrongdoing. 
Meanwhile, New York's Attorney General, Letitia James, has an active tax fraud investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization.
The inquiry by James, a Democrat, began after Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen told Congress the president inflated asset values to save money on loans and insurance and deflated them to reduce real estate taxes.
Trump's son, Eric Trump, an executive vice president for the firm, was deposed in October because of what the attorney general described as his close involvement in one or more transactions being reviewed.
Republican Trump has called the Vance and James' probes politically motivated harassment.
A presidential pardon, which can only be granted for federal crimes, would not apply to either of these state probes.
Giuliani’s potential criminal exposure is unclear. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have been investigating his business dealings in Ukraine. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing.
Giuliani also denied that he spoke to Trump about a pardon.
""Never had the discussion they falsely attribute to an anonymous source,"" Giuliani said on Twitter on Dec. 1.
CAN TRUMP PARDON HIMSELF?
There is not a definitive answer to this question. No president has tried it before, so the courts have not weighed in.
""When people ask me if a president can pardon himself, my answer is always, 'Well, he can try,'"" said Brian Kalt, a constitutional law professor at Michigan State University. ""The Constitution does not provide a clear answer on this."" 
Many legal experts have said a self-pardon would be unconstitutional because it violates the basic principle that nobody should be the judge in his or her own case.
Trump could try to pardon himself preemptively to cover the possibility of prosecution after he leaves office.
For a court to rule on the pardon's validity, a federal prosecutor would have to charge Trump with a crime and Trump would have to raise the pardon as a defense, Kalt said.

(This story corrects paragraph 17 to indicate Ford was Nixon's successor.)

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",Judge orders mass trial as Italy takes on 'Ndrangheta mobsters,"By Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - A judge on Thursday indicted 444 suspected members of the 'Ndrangheta mafia on an array of charges, including murder, attempted murder, extortion, money laundering and drug trafficking, a judicial source said.
The trial of 355 of the defendants will start on Jan. 13 and will be one of the largest cases to target organised crime in Italy since the so-called maxiprocesso that severely weakened Sicily's more storied Cosa Nostra mafia group in the 1980s.
A further 89 suspects agreed to a quickfire trial in the same case, which will start on Jan. 27, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, who had a copy of the court indictments. Those who accept such shorter hearings get reduced sentences if found guilty. 
The ‘Ndrangheta is based in the southern region of Calabria, the toe of Italy's boot, and has surpassed Cosa Nostra to become the most powerful mafia group in the country - and one of the largest crime gangs in the world.
Anticipating Thursday's ruling, a fortified courthouse has been built in the Calabrian city of Lamezia Terme, large enough to house the defendants, lawyers, prosecutors and judges.
The case hit the headlines a year ago when police arrested 334 people, including lawyers, accountants, public officials and court clerks, in one of the largest anti-mob operations ever seen in Italy.
""Obviously mafias change and evolve along with the society around them and they get to look increasingly like the rest of us. Mafiosi are not Martians, they live among us,"" Nicola Gratteri, the lead prosecutor on the case, said this week.
""Mafiosi prefer corrupting people rather than killing them, because shootings draw unwelcome attention,"" he added.
The last time Italy tried hundreds of alleged mafiosi simultaneously was in 1986 in Palermo in a case which represented a turning point in the fight against Cosa Nostra, marking the beginning of the group's sharp decline.
The Calabrian trial involves a high number of white-collared workers and does not target the top hierarchies of the 'Ndrangheta clans in the way the Palermo case did.
Gratteri told reporters that the group had spread far from its remote southern bastion and was present in every region of the country as well as in parts of Europe and north America.
He said it had grown easier for mobsters to infiltrate local administrations and win lucrative contracts or siphon off funds.

""There has been a sharp fall in ethics and morals (in society) in recent years ... which has made it easier to corrupt public officials. This doesn't just involve Italy. It involves the Western world,"" he said.

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 01:50PM ET</span>","Storms that slammed Central America in 2020 just a preview, climate change experts say","By Sarah Marsh and Sofia Menchu
HAVANA/GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Villagers in Guatemala's Mayan hillside hamlet Sanimtaca had been about to harvest their cardamom crops that take three years to grow when waves of floodwater triggered by two tropical storms last month washed them away.
Now they have no way to support themselves or to build back the 25 homes - a third of the village - also destroyed in the flash floods that have yet to subside, said Raul Quib, a volunteer from a neighboring community.
""No one had ever seen flooding like it around here,"" the 35-year-old who has been collecting food and clothing donations told Reuters. ""The school is flooded, the cemetery is flooded.""
This week brought an official close to the most active Atlantic hurricane season ever recorded, with 30 named storms including 13 hurricanes.
And thanks to climate change, experts warn, Central America will have to brace for stronger storm impacts in the future – as well as higher economic damages, unless they prepare. 
The region, which already has some of the highest poverty rates in Latin America, was particularly hard hit by hurricanes this year. 
Two of the year’s strongest storms, Eta and Iota, ravaged swathes of Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala and Belize in unusually quick succession in November.
Altogether, more than 200 people were killed and more than half a million displaced. Hundreds of thousands are now unsure where their next meals will come from.
In Sanimtaca, villagers were able to flee to higher ground in time to escape the flooding. But elsewhere in the mountainous central Guatemalan region of Alta Verapaz, storm-triggered landslides buried dozens of houses with people inside.
Hurricane Eta alone caused up to $5.5 billion in damage in Central America, the Inter-American Development Bank said, while the impact of Iota has not yet been determined.
So far, only Nicaragua has provided official estimates of damage of both storms, putting it at more than $740 million, around 6.2% of gross domestic product.
""If we don't manage to contain global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, we can expect an intensification of such natural disasters in the region with increasing costs,"" said Luis Miguel Galindo, climate change expert and economics professor at Mexico's UNAM university.
Currently, the world is on track to surpass 2°C of warming above pre-industrial temperatures.
If temperatures rise 2.5 °C by mid-century, the main costs of climate change could tally 1.5% to 5% of the annual GDP of Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a 2017 United Nations report that Galindo co-authored. It put the cost of adapting below 0.5% of GDP.
SLOWER STORMS, LONGER SEASON
Climate change overall is changing how hurricanes behave, scientists say, by warming up the ocean water through which they draw their power. Winds are blowing stronger. Storms are dropping heavier rains.
""We have more energy embedded in the oceans, and 90% from climate change,"" said Belizean meteorologist Carlos Fuller, the lead climate change negotiator for the Alliance of Small Island States.
And hurricanes are sometimes moving more slowly, stalling for longer on land or traveling farther before breaking up, recent research has shown. 
That can mean even more rainfall, wind and destruction for communities in a storm’s path. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey turned Houston's highways into tidal rivers after stalling for four days near or over the Texas coast. Scientists say Eta and Sally behaved this way, too, hence the unusual flooding in Sanimtaca.
""The evidence is building that there is a human fingerprint on this behavior,” said Jim Kossin, climate scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In a study published in June 2018 in the journal Nature, Kossin found that hurricane speeds had decreased worldwide by about 10% between 1949 and 2016.
This year’s storm count included six major hurricanes, twice the long-term average, said meteorologist Philip Klotzbach, who researches hurricanes at Colorado State University. 
The year also saw nine storms that rapidly intensified, he said. Iota for example spun from a 70 mile-per-hour (113 km-per-hour) tropical storm to a 160-mph (257-kph) Category 5 hurricane in 36 hours. The only other years that saw so many such storms were 1995 and 2010.
That can be ""a problem from the warning, preparation perspective,"" Klotzbach said. ""It is hard to prepare if it's a tropical storm, and then a day later a Category 4 hurricane.""
More storms could also hit outside of the traditional hurricane season going forwards as ocean waters get warmer sooner, said Susan Lozier, an oceanographer and dean at the Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Sciences. This year, a record-tying two tropical storms were swirling over the Atlantic in May, before the season’s June 1 start.
But it is still unclear if climate change is influencing the number of storms per year and played a role in the record 30 named storms in the Atlantic Ocean this season given natural variability. The number of hurricanes and major hurricanes for the Northern Hemisphere was near average due to a quieter Pacific.
BOLSTERING RESILIENCE
Communities devastated by a hurricane need to find ways to reduce the risk of damages should another hurricane hit, said World Bank regional sustainable development expert Anna Wellenstein.
Natural hazards “become disasters when we build in wrong place or in the wrong way,"" she said. ""Countries need more than a few years to really increase their resilience. This is an effort of decades.""
Moving populations away from coastlines vulnerable to floods and storm surges or hillsides that see landslides could help prevent deaths, some experts suggest. Storm predictions and warning systems could be improved. And vulnerable crops can be swapped out for hardier species.
""Rice can survive (rain) water because it grows in water,"" said Fuller, the meteorologist in Belize. ""So maybe we need to shift to that sort of grain instead of maize for example which will fall.""
A dollar invested in more resilient infrastructure brings four dollars in economic benefits, said Wellenstein. 
But many Central American and Caribbean countries, already confronted with poverty and debt, have struggled to prioritize this among so many other pressing needs. 
""They don't have the resources,"" said Galindo. ""And the pandemic is further reducing revenue and increasing expenses.""
Guatemala's President Alejandro Giammattei said last month Central America had been the worst affected region in the world by climate change and it would need help from them to stave off mass migration.
Quib, who volunteered to help Sanimtaca, said he expected most of the youth of the village to emigrate to Canada where they could lead a better life. 

""If they were already doing it before this happened, they will do so even more now,"" he said.

In the early hours of December 3, 1984, methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a pesticide factory owned by American Union Carbide Corporation. More than half a million people were poisoned that night and the official death toll exceeded 5,000.
Thousands of survivors have said they, their children and grandchildren are struggling with chronic health problems as a result of the leak and toxic waste left behind and face hefty medical bills at a time when the pandemic is making their health even more fragile.
Dow Chemical, which now owns Union Carbide, has denied liability, saying it bought the company a decade after Union Carbide settled its liabilities to the Indian government in 1989 by paying $470 million.
Protesters say the government still underestimates the number of victims and compensation did not go to many who needed it.
""Stop giving us false promises... have some shame,"" protesters shouted as they demanded financial help.
Local rights group say victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy are more vulnerable to the coronavirus than other people.
""Today, we have official documents to show that the death rate of gas victims due to COVID-19 is 6.5 times higher than those who were not exposed,"" said Rachna Dhingra, an activist who has worked with survivors of the tragedy. 
Local media quoted a government official as saying that out of the 518 coronavirus deaths in the Bhopal district since the beginning of the outbreak, 102 were survivors of the gas leak.
Urmila Patel told Reuters partner ANI this week that her family, survivors of the leak, had scraped together funds for two months' COVID treatment for her husband, who eventually died. ""Now we have problems aplenty,"" she said.

Pashinyan has rejected the calls to resign over what his opponents say was his disastrous handling of a six-week conflict between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces over the Nagorno-Karabkh enclave and surrounding areas.
Protesters chanted ""Nikol is a traitor"" and police officers detained several people, witnesses told Reuters. 
Earlier on Thursday, a coalition of 17 opposition parties named former premier Vazgen Manukyan as a potential caretaker prime minister to replace Pashinyan until snap parliamentary elections are held.
The move has no legal force, but illustrates public anger against Pashinyan who has accepted full responsibility for the outcome of the conflict, but said he is now responsible for ensuring national security and stabilising Armenia. 
Former National Security Service Chairman Artur Vanetsyan said Manukyan could serve as a prime minister without a party affiliation and then call snap elections that he himself would not take part in. 
The ceasefire signed by leaders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia on Nov. 10 halted military action in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians. 
Some 2,000 Russian peacekeeping troops are now being deployed to the region.

Large areas in Nagorno-Karabakh previously controlled by ethnic Armenians were handed over to Azerbaijan, whose forces had captured territory including areas that Baku lost in an earlier war in the 1990s.

The policy reduces the maximum validity length of B1/B2 visitor visas for party members and their immediate family members from 10 years to 1 month, the statement said. 
The measure was aimed at protecting the nation from the party's ""malign influence,"" the statement said, adding the party works to ""influence Americans through propaganda, economic coercion, and other nefarious activities."" 
The Trump administration has sought to cement the outgoing president's tough-on-China legacy, and relations between the world's two largest economies have sunk to their lowest point in decades.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying responded at a news briefing on Thursday, saying: ""This clearly is an escalated form of political oppression towards China by some extreme anti-China forces in the U.S. who act out of intense ideological bias and a deep-rooted Cold War mentality."" 
Washington and Beijing have clashed over China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its tightening grip on Hong Kong, its disputed claims in the South China Sea, trade and accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang.
Last week, Reuters reported the United States was poised to add China's top chipmaker SMIC and national offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC (NYSE:CEO) to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, curbing their access to U.S. investors.

News of the restrictions was first reported by The New York Times. The new visa guidelines allow American officials to determine someone's party status based on their application and interview, the paper reported.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Famine-like conditions have re-appeared in parts of Yemen and almost half the population is experiencing high levels of food insecurity, new United Nations data showed on Thursday, with aid agencies warning time is running out to prevent mass starvation. 
Around 45% of Yemen's population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity, according to the U.N.'s Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis. 
Within this number, 33% of the population are in crisis, 12% are in emergency and 16,500 people are in a catastrophic, famine-like, situation, the worst level of the IPC classifications.
The outlook for next year is worse, the IPC analysis said. Between January and June 2021 54% of Yemenis - 16.2 million people - are likely to experience high levels of acute food insecurity.
Those in a catastrophic state will likely increase to 47,000 people.
""These alarming numbers must be a wake-up call to the world,"" said David Beasley, executive director of the U.N's World Food Programme (WFP).
IPC data analyses for south Yemen, which is under the control of the internationally recognised Yemeni government, were released in July and October. Thursday's analysis now includes IPC data for north Yemen, where the majority of Yemenis live and which is controlled by Iran-aligned Houthi authorities, to give a nationwide picture of hunger. 
Pockets of famine-like conditions have returned for the first time in two years and the window to prevent famine is narrowing, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), WFP and U.N. children's agency UNICEF warned, based on the data. 
Famine has never been officially declared in Yemen, where the more than five-year-old war has left 80% of the population reliant on aid in what the U.N. says is the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
U.N. warnings in late 2018 of impending famine prompted an aid ramp-up. The WFP, which has also coordinated medical logistics during the coronavirus pandemic, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020.
However, this year coronavirus restrictions, reduced remittances, locusts, floods and significant underfunding of the 2020 aid response are exacerbating hunger. 
FAO Director-General Qu Dongyu said the primary driver of food insecurity is the conflict, which must cease. 
""We need to act immediately,"" said Norwegian Refugee Council's country director Mohamed Abdi. ""Waiting for a famine declaration to act will condemn hundreds of thousands of people to death.""

Under a decree approved late on Wednesday, Italians will not be able to move between the country's 20 regions from Dec. 21 to Jan. 6 except for work, medical reasons or emergencies. On Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year's Day they cannot even leave their towns. 
In a joint statement the regional governments said they had not been consulted and ""the lack of discussion has made it impossible to balance the curbs with the needs of families.""
Since the start of Italy's pandemic there has been constant friction between the central government led by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and the regional authorities, most of which are in the hands of the centre-right opposition.
""Reading an unexpected decree that bans movements between towns in the same region on Dec. 25, 26 and Jan. 1... is crazy,"" said Attilio Fontana, governor of the northern Lombardy region which has reported the most cases and deaths.
While the increase in new infections and hospital admissions has slowed in recent weeks, Italy is still reporting more daily COVID-19 fatalities than any other European nation and the government is worried about gatherings over Christmas.
Millions of Italians live in small towns and villages and the new rules will ban movement between them at Christmas and on New Year's Day, even if they are within walking distance.
""These families must remain divided even at Christmas. This is yet more proof that the government does not know Italy,"" said Matteo Salvini, leader of the rightist League opposition party. 
The government is expected to introduce more measures late on Thursday aimed at preventing gatherings during Christmas, with Conte due to hold a news conference to illustrate them at 1915 GMT.

All ski resorts will be closed until January, a draft document seen by Reuters shows, while the Christmas Eve mass, traditionally held at midnight, must be brought forward to allow worshippers to return home before a 10 p.m. curfew.

1635,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 11:12AM ET</span>","Aid coming to north Ethiopia, refugees recount war suffering","ADDIS ABABA/HAMDAYET, Sudan (Reuters) - Relief agencies in Ethiopia prepared convoys on Thursday to truck aid into Tigray region, where a month of war is feared to have killed thousands of people and has forced refugees to flee along corpse-strewn roads. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) after federal forces captured the northern region's capital Mekelle at the weekend. 
However, TPLF leaders have dug into surrounding mountains in an emerging guerrilla strategy. ""The war is a people's war and will not end easily,"" its spokesman Gebre Gebretsadkan said on Tigray TV, adding that fighting had continued round Mekelle. 
One aid worker in touch with Tigray said clashes had been taking place to the north, south and west of the city. The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Diplomats in touch with sources on all sides say thousands of combatants and civilians appear to have died since Abiy's offensive began on Nov. 4, after a TPLF attack on a military base was the last straw in their feud. 
More than 45,000 refugees have crossed into neighbouring Sudan, while many more have been displaced within Tigray.
One refugee, who gave his name only as Abraham, saw corpses in civilian clothes as he fled the Tigrayan town of Humera towards the border with Sudan. 
""Nobody can bury them, they were outside on the road,"" he recounted from Hamdayet, a Sudanese border transit point.
WAR CHILD
Ethiopia's government and the TPLF have both accused each other of - and both denied - targeting civilians. 
The TPLF said it had destroyed government tanks and accused Eritrea of deploying troops to back Abiy. Eritrea's government could not be reached for comment but has previously denied that.
Claims from all sides have been hard to verify while access to Tigray region was blocked and communications largely down, though internet and phone services were returning this week.
In Qadarif, also in Sudan, the mother of a newborn baby recounted how she had fled Tigray at eight months pregnant.
""While I was frightened and running away, that's when the pain started,"" said Atikilti Salem, breastfeeding her 22-day-old baby Abeyam.
""I found a small village and gave birth in the hospital ... I wanted to call her Africa, but I instead named her after the doctor who delivered her ... When the war is over ... I'm going to tell her the story of how she was born.""
Ethiopian authorities and the United Nations agreed to move humanitarian aid into federal government-controlled areas of Tigray. Some 600,000 people relied on food handouts even before the fighting.
Food stocks are nearly empty for 96,000 Eritrean refugees in Tigray, aid agencies say, while medics in Mekelle are short of painkillers, gloves and bodybags.
""There's an acute shortage of food, medicine and other relief,"" tweeted Norwegian Refugee Council head Jan Egeland, saying relief convoys were ready to go. 
Tigray's new government-appointed leader Mulu Nega said help was on its way to areas of west Tigray including Humera.
REFORM SETBACK?
The first video from Mekelle since its capture on Saturday, from state-run ETV, showed people shopping and sitting on stools. 
""Life is getting back to normal ... Everything is, as you can see, very peaceful,"" one man said in the footage which Reuters could not independently verify.
Tigrayans have strongly supported the TPLF and seen them as war heroes from the 1991 overthrow of a Marxist dictatorship.
Analysts fear that Abiy's political reforms, after he took office in 2018, could be set back by the conflict, and his tougher line against foes including jailing opposition figures this year. 
He became prime minister after nearly three decades of TPLF-led government that had become increasingly repressive.
Abiy, who comes from the larger Oromo and Amharic ethnic groups, reduced Tigrayans from government and security posts, saying they were over-represented for a group making up 6% of the population. 

The TPLF accuses their ex-military comrade and government coalition partner of trying to increase his personal power over Ethiopia's 10 regions. Abiy denies that, calling them criminals who mutinied against federal authority.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czechs raised glasses in pubs, grabbed lunch again at restaurants and hit the shops for the first time since October on Thursday as coronavirus measures were eased before the Christmas season.
After curbing one of Europe's fastest spreads of the new coronavirus, and despite fears the re-opening could lead to a surge of infections, Czechs cooped up for weeks headed eagerly out to shops, hairdressers, restaurants and pubs allowed to open with capacity requirements.
""It is certainly a huge benefit and I think it adds to the Christmas atmosphere that people can enjoy the shops again,"" said Marcela Judlova after shopping on Prague's central Wenceslas Square.
Daily infections still hover in the thousands.
The death rate in recent weeks is also among the highest in Europe and has jumped 12-fold to 8,515 in the last two months.
Neighbouring countries are keeping tighter measures for now. Germany said on Wednesday it would extend measures, including keeping restaurants shut, until Jan. 10.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Farmers angered by pandemic rules to play key role in Romanian election,"By Radu-Sorin Marinas
BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanians vote in a parliamentary election on Sunday with rural voters' anger over coronavirus restrictions set to complicate efforts by its centrist prime minister to restore judicial independence and the country's reputation among investors.
Limits put in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus have angered many farmers, a key constituency in the largely-agricultural eastern European state, swelling support for the leftist PSD party that now controls parliament.
In power for a year despite his opponents' parliamentary strength, Prime Minister Ludovic Orban has pledged to overturn years of efforts by leftist-led cabinets to take control of courts amid allegations of corruption and misuse of funds.
His promise had galvanised many in the Black Sea state, rocked by a jail sentence handed to Liviu Dragnea, a long-time PSD party senior. Opinion polls show Orban's National Liberal Party (PNL) running at 30-32%, compared with 24-28% for the PSD.
Orban, a fiscal conservative, has also said he would undo a 40% pension hike ordered by the PSD, which economists say could bloat the deficit to 11% of GDP if left in place, which might prompt rating agencies to bring Romania's credit rating to junk.
But support for PNL is down from highs of 35%, putting in question its ability to form a functioning coalition with his likely partner, the progressive USR-Plus running on 15-17%.
Some 40% of Romanians live in the countryside, many eking out a living by selling produce in nearby cities.
In the fresh produce markets that dot Bucharest, often the main meeting place in each neighbourhood, sellers say Orban's decision to force them to move outdoors as a coronavirus precaution last month has cost them much of their livelihoods.
""All farmers say this government is guilty,"" said 46-year-old farmer Daniela Catana from a small Teleorman village some 50 km (30 miles) southwest of Bucharest. She supports her family of seven by selling the cabbage, onions and spinach she grows on her one-acre plot.
Since Orban shut indoor produce stalls, she has been bringing blankets to keep produce from spoiling in the early morning frost that engulfed Piata Crangasi market in recent weeks. Catana says a third of her crop was damaged anyway.
""They began to do stupid things that affected us, all those decisions related to the pandemic,"" said the mother of two.
Orban says his government's decision was meant to protect the elderly, who tend to do most of their grocery shopping and often socialise in the neighbourhood market.
Romania is a major grains producer and its farms' vegetable and fruit output totals a hefty 5 million tonnes a year.
""Millions from rural areas were torpedoed by this temporary closure,"" said Costel Stanciu of the ProConsumatori association defending consumers and producers rights.
Some 80% of Romania's fruit and vegetable output is sold by individual farmers in such markets, built in neighbourhoods of rundown communist-era apartment blocs in large cities. 
With a year-on-year contraction of 6.0% in the third quarter, Romania's economic performance was among the worst in the European Union.

1639,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Divers discover Nazi WW2 enigma machine in Baltic Sea,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German divers searching the Baltic Sea for discarded fishing nets have stumbled upon a rare Enigma cipher machine used by the Nazi military during World War Two which they believe was thrown overboard from a scuttled submarine.
Thinking they had discovered a typewriter entangled in a net on the seabed of Gelting Bay, underwater archaeologist Florian Huber quickly realised the historical significance of the find.
""I've made many exciting and strange discoveries in the past 20 years. But I never dreamt that we would one day find one of the legendary Enigma machines,"" said Huber. 
The Nazi military used the machines to send and receive secret messages during World War Two but British cryptographers cracked the code, helping the Allies gain an advantage in the naval struggle to control the Atlantic.
At Bletchley Park codebreaking centre, a British team led by Alan Turing is credited with unravelling the code, shortening the war and saving many thousands of lives. 
Shortly before Germany's surrender in May 1945, the crews of about 50 submarines, or U-Boots, followed an order to scuttle their ships in Gelting Bay, near the Danish border, to avoid handing them to the Allies. Destroying encryption devices was part of the order.
""We suspect our Enigma went overboard in the course of this event,"" said Huber, of the Kiel-based company Submaris which leads underwater research missions. 
Overall, Germans sank more than 200 of their submarines in the North and Baltic Seas at the end of the war.
The Enigma device, which looks like a typewriter, consisted of a keyboard and wheels which scrambled messages. Although several hundred thousand machines were produced, only a few hundred are known to exist. They sell at auction for tens of thousands of euros. 

The find, made by divers working on behalf of WWF aiming to find abandoned fishing nets that endanger marine life, will be given to the archaeology museum in Schleswig.

ROME (Reuters) - Iran will fully comply with a 2015 deal aimed at preventing it from developing nuclear weapons if both the United States and Europe honour their original commitments, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday.
U.S. President Donald Trump quit the pact in 2018, saying it did not do enough to curb Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs or its militant influence in the Middle East. 
However, president-elect Joe Biden has said he will rejoin it if Tehran first resumes strict compliance. He has also said he would work with allies ""to strengthen and extend it"".
Addressing a Rome conference via video-link, Zarif said the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) could not be renegotiated but it could be resurrected.
""The United States has commitments. It is not in a position to set conditions,"" he said.
Iran's Guardian Council watchdog body approved a law on Wednesday that obliges the government to halt U.N. inspections of its nuclear sites and step up uranium enrichment beyond the limit set under the 2015 deal if sanctions are not eased within two months.
Zarif said that although the government did not like the law, it would nonetheless implement it. 
""But it is not irreversible,"" he said. ""The Europeans and USA can come back into compliance with the JCPOA and not only this law will not be implemented, but in fact the actions we have taken ... will be rescinded. We will go back to full compliance.""
Zarif said economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration had cost Iranians $250 billion and made it impossible to buy medicines and vaccines needed to combat the coronavirus, which has taken a particularly heavy toll on his country.
""It is a crime against humanity,"" he said, adding that the U.S. measures were preventing European companies from doing business in Iran, dashing hopes of a massive upswing in trade after the 2015 deal was signed.
""Europeans say they are in full compliance (with the deal) but they simply are not. ... We don't see any European companies in Iran, we do not see any European country buying oil from Iran, we do not see any European banks send us our money,"" Zarif said. 
The foreign minister said he hoped that neighbouring Arab states, some of which have recently forged ties with Iran's arch-enemy Israel, would seek dialogue with Tehran once Trump left office. 

""We are their neighbours. We will be in this region together. I do not believe that they want to allow Israel to bring the fight to Iran,"" Zarif said.

James Cleverly, the Foreign Office minister for the Middle East, called it ""a man-made problem which could have been prevented"", joining a chorus of voices who have blamed Lebanon's ruling elite for failing to chart a path out of the crisis.
Since last year, the unprecedented meltdown has crashed the currency and wiped out jobs. Photos of people rummaging through dumpsters or selling their belongings online for food have circulated widely in recent months.
A COVID-19 spike and a massive port blast that killed around 200 people in August have compounded their woes.
""The most pressing danger is the risk to food security: Lebanon is on the verge of not being able to feed itself,"" Cleverly, who met Lebanese officials in Beirut on Thursday, said in a statement.
""Four months on from the blast, Lebanon is threatened by a silent tsunami. Lebanon's leaders must act.""
Comments about a looming end to subsidies, which have depleted already critical foreign currency reserves, have raised fears of shortages. Lebanon imports lots - including much of its domestic wheat consumption - and produces little.
Lebanon's central bank and government have traded blame over the crisis. The bank can only maintain basic subsidies for two more months and the state should come up with a plan, Governor Riad Salameh said on Tuesday.
Caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab has said lifting subsidies on vital goods without helping the poor could cause ""a social explosion"".

Cleverly said any end to subsidies would make things worse. ""I reiterate my call to the leaders of Lebanon to do what is needed and deliver reforms,"" he said. ""The alternative will be horrific.""

The beating of Michel Zecler by police officers inside his music studio was captured on closed circuit television and mobile phone footage. It was circulated widely online and sparked new criticism over police violence in France.
The French police union asked for Zecler to be charged with resisting his arrest on Nov. 21. 
""The lack of criminal charge for the acts of rebellion that Mr Zecler perpetrated leads to a serious threat to public order"", France Police-Policiers en colere (Angry French Police Officers) trade union said.
Prosecutors last week launched a probe into the police action against Zecler and the police watchdog is also investigating. 
Two police officers have been held in custody and two others are still being investigated, French media reported on Monday. 
The Paris prosecutors' head Remy Heitz said on Sunday charges against the officers would include the use of racist language and intentional violence with weapons. 
Zecler has said police jumped on him at his music studio in Paris' 17th arrondissement. 
He added he had been walking nearby without a mask, a violation of French health protocols to curb the coronavirus, and upon seeing a police car, went into his music studio to avoid being fined.

However, the police followed him inside and started to physically attack him and racially abuse him, he added.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Life in Lebanon has become so difficult for Syrian refugee Ahmad, he says he recently contemplated suicide.
The 54-year-old father of three cleans shops at a mall in exchange for rent-free accommodation in a cramped room in the town of Daraya, southeast of Beirut. His daughters sometimes go into the street to sell tissues to help keep the family fed.
An amputee who lost a leg while working at a stone factory in 2014, Ahmad clings to the hope of being resettled in the West, saying he can never return to the home he fled in Syria eight years ago as fighting raged around it.
""I have become a burden on my daughters,"" said Ahmad, sitting on a mattress on the floor at his home, paint peeling from the walls and the smell of sewage hanging in the air. 
""I weep every day, I am crushed. It's a life of misery.""
Nearly a decade since Syria's war began, neighbouring Lebanon still hosts some 1 million registered Syrian refugees for whom life has only become more difficult since an economic crisis erupted last year.
Poverty among Syrian refugees in Lebanon is soaring, reflecting deepening hardship among the entire population.
The proportion of refugees below the extreme poverty line of less than $3 a day climbed to 88% this year from 55% last year, UNHCR said.
The situation was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Daily labour upon which many refugees depended has dried up. 
Ahmad's nephew, who once helped out with financial support, went back to Syria this year as he could no longer find work.
Ahmad says he cannot follow him, citing security fears. He wants to go to Canada or Germany. He says assistance he once received from aid agencies dried up around three years ago.
The situation facing refugees in Lebanon has been deteriorating steadily since 2013-14 as Lebanon's troubles began to hit them and any savings they brought with them were used up, UNHCR representative in Lebanon Mireille Girard said. 
But now, almost all refugees are below the survival line, she said. ""This is dramatic, this is very serious."" 
""People have the impression that the future is closing down on them and don't see light at end of tunnel,"" Girard said.
""The situation is very serious and at this moment we really need everyone to mobilise ... toward supporting the most vulnerable as much as possible.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Bahrain's imports from Israel will not be subject to distinctions between products made within Israel and those from settlements in occupied territory, the Bahraini trade minister said on Thursday, drawing a rebuke from the Palestinians. 
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates formalised ties with Israel on Sept. 15, in a U.S.-sponsored deal billed by the Gulf countries as being made possible by Israel's shelving of a plan to annex West Bank settlements. Most world powers deem them illegal.
But Bahrain's Industry, Commerce and Tourism Minister Zayed bin Rashid al-Zayani voiced openness to settlement imports. 
""We will treat Israeli products as Israeli products. So we have no issue with labelling or origin,"" he told Reuters during a visit to Israel.
Under European Union guidelines, settlement products should be clearly labelled as such when exported to EU member countries. The Trump administration last month removed U.S. customs distinctions between goods made within Israel and in settlements.
Al-Zayani's remarks were condemned by Wasel Abu Youssef of the Palestine Liberation Organization as ""contradicting international and U.N. resolutions"".
He urged Arab countries not to import products from within Israel, either, in order to prevent it ""stretching into Arab markets to strengthen its economy"".
The stateless Palestinians hope to create their own independent country in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, but the issue of Jewish settlements on land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War has long been a stumbling block in the now-stalemated peace process.
They now fear that the warming ties between Gulf states and Israel, along with Trump's strong support for Israel, have badly damaged their aspirations.
It was not clear what other Gulf states' positions on imports from the settlements were. But an Israeli winery that uses grapes grown on the occupied Golan Heights said in September that its labels would be sold in the UAE.
Israel expects trade with Bahrain worth around $220 million in 2021, not including possible defence and tourism deals.
Al-Zayani said Bahraini carrier Gulf Air was tentatively scheduled to begin flights to Tel Aviv on Jan. 7, with shipping to follow.
""We are fascinated by how integrated IT and innovation sector in Israel has been embedded in every facet of life,"" he said.
He played down speculation in Israel that its citizens visiting Bahrain could be at risk of reprisals for the assassination last Friday of a top Iranian nuclear scientist, which Tehran blamed on Israeli agents. 

""We don't see any threats, and therefore we don't see any requirement for additional security or special treatment for Israelis,"" he said.

(Reuters) - On Jan. 1, 2020, as the world welcomed a new decade, Chinese authorities in Wuhan shut down a seafood market in the central city of 11 million, suspecting that an outbreak of a new ""viral pneumonia"" affecting 27 people might be linked to the site.
Early lab tests in China pointed to a new coronavirus. By Jan. 20 it had spread to three countries.
For most people, it was a minor health scare unfolding half a world away.
Nearly a year later it has changed lives fundamentally. Almost everyone has been affected, be it through illness, losing loved ones or jobs, being confined at home and having to get used to a whole new way of working, relaxing and interacting.
Almost 1.5 million people have died globally from the COVID-19 disease related to the coronavirus, and some 63 million people have been infected.
After the initial ""wave"" of the pandemic was brought under some semblance of control in many countries, nations are now fighting second and third waves even greater than the first, forcing new restrictions on everyday life.
Among the most haunting images to emerge from the pandemic in 2020 are those of medics on the frontlines of the battle against the virus.
In Milan's San Raffaele hospital, seven intensive care unit staff attended to an 18-year-old patient suffering from COVID-19, pushing the bed into the ward and holding medical equipment and monitors.
Doctors and nurses like them swathed in protective gear - gowns, gloves, masks, and visors, some with their names or initials written on their uniforms - have become a familiar sight.
So, too, have images of medics collapsing from exhaustion or grief at losing one of their own to the disease.
By March and April many countries began to impose lockdowns and social distancing to slow the spread of the highly contagious virus. 
Structures to separate and protect people sprang up - from transparent screens at supermarket checkouts to the plastic sheet which allowed 83-year-old Lily Hendrickx, a resident at a Belgian nursing home, to hug Marie-Christine Desoer, the home's director.
The effects on the natural world of the shutdown were sometimes astonishing. Birdsong could be heard like never before in towns and wild animals ventured into newly empty cities.
At the usually crowded Golden Gate Bridge View Vista Point across from San Francisco, a coyote stood by the roadside.
Even the streets of Manhattan were eerily empty.
Ballet dancer Ashlee Montague donned a gas mask and danced in the middle of Times Square, New York.
In Brazil's capital, Brasilia, Catholic priest Jonathan Costa prayed alone at the Santuario Dom Bosco church, among photographs of the faithful, attached to the pews.
Wearing masks to combat the spread of the virus became commonplace the world over.
At Tokyo's Shinagawa train station, crowds of commuters wore face masks, as did prisoners crowded into a cell in El Salvador's Quezaltepeque jail.
In private homes, families learned to live together 24 hours a day and how to entertain and teach their children.
In San Fiorano in northern Italy, school teacher Marzio Toniolo, 35, took a picture of his two-year-old daughter Bianca painting his toenails bright red.
The pandemic hit some of the world's poorest people the hardest - exposing the inequalities in access to medical treatment and in government funds to compensate people who lost their livelihoods.
In South Africa in May, at the Itireleng informal settlement near Laudium suburb in Pretoria, people waited in a queue that stretched as far as the eye could see to receive food aid.

As 2020 heads to its close, vaccines are on the horizon. There is hope that some aspects of life as we knew it will return.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 07:11AM ET</span>",Special Report: Burner phones and banking apps: Meet the Chinese 'brokers' laundering Mexican drug money,"By Drazen Jorgic
GUADALAJARA (Reuters) - Early next year, a Chinese businessman named Gan Xianbing will be sentenced in a Chicago courtroom for laundering just over $530,000 in Mexican cartel drug money.
Gan, 50, was convicted in February of money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transfer business that whisked cartel cash from U.S. drug sales offshore. Gan has maintained his innocence; his lawyers say he was entrapped by U.S. authorities. The trial garnered few headlines and little of the public fascination reserved for kingpins of powerful narcotics syndicates that U.S. federal prosecutors said Gan served.
Still, U.S. law enforcement officials told Reuters that Chinese ""money brokers"" such as Gan represent one of the most worrisome new threats in their war on drugs. They say small cells of Chinese criminals have upended the way narcotics cash is laundered and are displacing the Mexican and Colombian money men that have long dominated the trade.
Virtually unheard of a decade ago, these Chinese players are moving vast sums quickly and quietly, authorities said. Their expertise: routing cartel drug profits from the United States to China then on to Mexico with a few clicks of a burner phone and Chinese banking apps – and without the bulky cash ever crossing borders. The launderers pay small Chinese-owned businesses in the United States and Mexico to help them move the funds. Most contact with the banking system happens in China, a veritable black hole for U.S. and Mexican authorities.
Chinese money brokers based in Mexico ""have come to dominate international money laundering markets,"" U.S. prosecutors said in a Sept. 24 sentencing memorandum for Gan's case.
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen law enforcement officials, diplomats, lawyers and sources familiar with the Gan case or Chinese money laundering techniques. The news organization also examined more than 1,500 pages of documents from the trial. The material included previously unreported details about how the ring operated compiled by prosecutors and agents of Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that led the probe. 
What emerged was a blueprint showing how some groups of Chinese money brokers have become key cogs in the multi-billion-dollar drug empires run by Latin American cartels. The Chinese role presents a formidable challenge for U.S. anti-narcotics efforts at a time of rising tensions between Beijing and Washington.
Gan, who U.S. prosecutors said operated a tight ring with another Chinese money broker, was apprehended in November 2018 by Homeland Security Investigations agents at Los Angeles International Airport on his way to Mexico from Hong Kong. The U.S. government said that Gan had moved anywhere from $25 million to $65 million in illicit drug proceeds from 2016 to the time of his arrest, according to a September court filing by Gan's attorneys.
Based in Guadalajara, the ring is believed to have worked with multiple syndicates, including the famed Sinaloa Cartel that was previously led by jailed Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, according to two U.S.-based sources familiar with the investigation.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury and Europol, the European Union's law enforcement arm, have warned about the expanding web of Chinese crime groups laundering drug money. Europol in November 2019 said these groups present a ""growing threat to Europe,"" while the U.S. Treasury in February placed Chinese professional money laundering networks on its list of ""key threats"" and vulnerabilities within the U.S. financial system.
U.S. law enforcement has stepped up operations against these groups. In addition to the Gan case in Illinois, federal prosecutors have brought charges in Virginia and Oregon against alleged members of at least two other Chinese money laundering rings since October of last year. Those cases are pending.
Still, a senior U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent said U.S. efforts to nail Latin American drug capos by following the money have gotten much more difficult.
""I can't emphasize this enough, the involvement of the Chinese has really complicated all of these schemes,"" the DEA official said.
Gan, who declined to testify in court, pleaded not guilty to three counts of money laundering, one count of conspiracy to launder money and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. He was acquitted on the conspiracy charge. Reuters did not receive a reply to requests for comment from Gan sent to his legal team.
His lawyers, in a September sentencing plea document, said Gan was not the mastermind of the operation, rather a seafood exporter who was duped into letting his bank account in China be used to launder money by another Mexico-based Chinese national named Pan Haiping. Glenn Seiden, Gan's lawyer, declined to speak with Reuters or answer questions about Gan's case.
Attorney Aaron Schwartz, who was part of the defense team, said he wanted to make it clear that Gan did not cooperate with the U.S. government because his client feared for the safety of his family in Guadalajara, where the powerful Jalisco New Generation cartel holds sway. Gan's lawyers also allege Gan was entrapped in a sting operation by Homeland Security Investigations agents working with an informant who helped arrange the transactions that resulted in their client's conviction. The agency said it does not comment on ongoing investigations.
Pan Haiping, Gan's alleged associate, was detained earlier this year in Mexico on accusations of money laundering and is awaiting extradition to the United States, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and a senior Mexican federal police source. Pan Haiping could not be reached for comment. The Mexican prosecutor's office declined to comment on Pan Haiping's case or provide the name of his legal counsel in Mexico, saying it cannot comment on ongoing cases.
In a March 2019 U.S. indictment unsealed a few weeks ago, Pan Haiping was charged with laundering almost $500,000 for Mexican cartels; running an illegal money transmitting business in Illinois; and conspiring to launder money using bank accounts in China, including an account belonging to Gan.
Another alleged conspirator, Long Huanxin, was arrested in February at Vancouver International Airport by Canadian law enforcement acting on a warrant from U.S. authorities, according to Canadian court transcripts from Long's detention hearing. Long was extradited to the United States, and last month he pleaded not guilty in Chicago to charges of money laundering for Mexican cartels, U.S. court documents show. Long's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. 
U.S.-CHINA TENSIONS
U.S officials informally sought assistance from China in the Gan case but received no support in their investigation, according to the two U.S. sources familiar with the probe. 
China's Foreign Ministry disputed their account. The ministry told Reuters in late October that it did not receive a request from U.S. authorities for help on that case. China stands ready to cooperate with the United States to ""destroy drug cartels and drug-related money-laundering networks,"" the ministry said in a statement. But it stressed the need for the two countries to work on the ""principle of respecting each other's laws, equality and mutual benefit,"" the statement said.
The ministry said most Chinese bank-account holders about whom Washington has inquired as part of its money laundering investigations in recent years were ""legitimate enterprises and individuals"" in China. ""After we asked the U.S. side to provide drug-related clues or evidence of enterprises and individuals, the U.S. side has not responded,"" China's Foreign Ministry said in the statement.
Without help from Beijing to track money flows in China and to infiltrate the laundering networks, U.S. agents say they face an uphill struggle to catch culprits.
""It's the most sophisticated form of money laundering that's ever existed,"" one of the U.S. sources familiar with the investigation said.
BURNER PHONES AND DOLLAR BILLS
Key to cracking the case was Lim Seok Pheng, a New York-based member of the ring who became a cooperating witness for the U.S. government following her May 2018 arrest on suspicion of money laundering.
A Singapore national, Lim said at Gan's trial that she once peddled footwear and had first met Gan in China where he ran a shoe factory before he relocated to Guadalajara in 2011. Lim testified that Gan recruited her to join the illicit operation in 2016 and that she became lovers with the other alleged ringleader, Pan Haiping.
Following her arrest at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Lim agreed to wear a recording device to help authorities gather evidence against Gan and the other alleged conspirators. She also brought undercover Homeland Security Investigations agents into the operation as money couriers on three separate cash pick-ups in Chicago that led to Gan's conviction, according to the trial testimony of Lim and the agents.
Lim pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in November 2019 and is out on bail, awaiting sentencing.
She and her attorney declined to comment.
The only thing tougher than moving illegal drugs across borders is getting the profits back to Mexico's cartels, U.S. officials said. Cash is heavy, and transporting it exposes traffickers to lots of risk. Putting it into the banking system is perilous, too. The U.S. and Mexican financial systems have been geared to detect dirty money. 
Prosecutors told the court that Gan and his accomplices sidestepped these obstacles by first moving the U.S. cash offshore to China, then on to Mexico. Lim was a linchpin connecting both sides of the Pacific. In her November 2019 plea agreement, Lim admitted to laundering, with Gan and Pan Haiping, about $48 million in drug cash between 2016 and September 2017. She took a 0.5% commission, the agreement said.
Lim testified at Gan's trial that she had two jobs. The first was collecting drug money in U.S. cities such as Chicago and New York from cartel contacts, typically anywhere from $150,000 to $1 million at a time. She would wait in a public place, armed with a burner phone, a code name and the serial number of an authentic $1 bill. Mexican cartels would pass on her details to their dealer contacts, who would call Lim's burner phone and use the code name to identify themselves. At the rendezvous point, Lim would give them the $1 bill with the corresponding serial number as a ""receipt"" to verify the handoff had taken place, Lim said at trial.
Lim's other job was recruiting businesses in the Chinese diaspora to help them make that cash disappear, Lim and prosecutors said.
Some U.S.-based Chinese merchants have long engaged in off-the-books currency ""swaps"" to avoid hefty bank fees. Such transactions are illegal in the United States, American authorities said, if they are used by companies routinely to skirt the formal banking system or to operate an unauthorized money transfer business. In some cases these informal, hawala-style transactions are used to help wealthy Chinese move money clandestinely out of China, in violation of that nation's currency controls.
The operation run by Gan and Pan Haiping grew to include at least three Chinese merchants in New York, who were paid commissions to participate, Lim told the court. The names of the Chinese merchants were not revealed at Gan's trial, and it's unclear if they knew of Lim's links to drug trafficking.
Prosecutors at trial presented testimony, evidence and graphics showing how the transactions worked. At their simplest, authorities said, that process worked as follows: Lim would arrive at one of the merchants with, say, $150,000 in cartel cash. With the businessperson observing, she would open a currency converter app on her smartphone to obtain the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan. She would also hand over the details of a bank account in China given to her by Gan. In what's known as a ""mirror transaction,"" the Chinese businessperson would take possession of the $150,000 in U.S. currency while simultaneously transferring the equivalent in Chinese yuan from their own account in China to the bank account number provided by Gan.
The result was that a foreign transfer of funds had been made without involving a U.S financial institution - or the accompanying digital fingerprints. The Chinese business had effectively used yuan from its China-based bank account to purchase cash dollars now on hand in the United States; it earned a commission for its trouble while avoiding bank fees and U.S. government scrutiny. 
Meanwhile, Gan had converted U.S. drug dollars into Chinese currency now sitting in a Chinese bank. The only contact with the financial system – a domestic transfer between two accounts in China – would be unlikely to raise red flags with Chinese banking authorities unaware of the money's provenance.
The crime ring used various Chinese banks for the operations, including the Bank of China, according to WhatsApp messages exchanged between Gan and Pan Haiping. The messages were extracted from Gan's iPhone by Homeland Security Investigations agents after his arrest, and key excerpts were read out aloud by prosecutors at trial, according to court transcripts.
Bank of China did not respond to requests for comment.
To get the money from China to Mexico, Gan performed the same sort of mirror transactions, only this time with the help of Chinese businesses who had access to pesos in Mexico. This leg of the journey was described by the two U.S. sources familiar with the investigation and is outlined in court documents, including the U.S. government's September 2020 sentencing memorandum for Gan and the June 2019 superseding indictment detailing charges against him. 
U.S. prosecutors said the laundered money was delivered to Pan Haiping's Mexican drug cartel clients, according to the superseding indictment. No Mexican banks were named in any of the court documents reviewed by Reuters.
OPPORTUNITY IN MEXICO
In October, Reuters traveled to Guadalajara and found Gan's wife, Pan Emi (no relation to Pan Haiping), working in a busy store she owns in the city's Chinese quarter selling wigs, plastic jewelry, sunglasses and other low-cost merchandise imported from China.
Manning the cash register, Pan Emi said her husband was innocent of wrongdoing and being unfairly portrayed by authorities as a criminal when he was nothing more than a plucky businessman. She said no Mexican or U.S. law enforcement agents had contacted her about the case.
She said Gan, fed up with high Chinese taxes, had left his shoe factory in the Chinese city of Wenzhou nearly a decade ago seeking a better life in Mexico. In Guadalajara, she said, Gan co-founded a business exporting jellyfish, which are considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac in China. Pan Emi said her ""super friendly"" husband built a large network of friends and contacts in Mexico and was always on the phone.
Pan Emi confirmed some details of the case. She said her husband knew Pan Haiping and Lim and had participated in currency swaps with other Chinese merchants. But she denied Gan was involved with traffickers or knew anything about drug money. 
She said currency swaps were common in the expatriate Chinese business community to avoid pricey fees and lousy exchange rates offered by banks.
""These swaps that we do with each other are easy. It's no big problem,"" Pan Emi said. ""I don't think it's illegal."" 
Money brokers like Gan and Pan Haiping are growing in number among the large Chinese diasporas in the United States, Europe and Latin America, according to three DEA officials.
Demand for their services is being driven by affluent Chinese looking to evade China's currency controls and move wealth abroad, the DEA officials told Reuters. Beijing limits the amount of money its citizens can transfer out of China to the equivalent of $50,000 U.S. dollars annually.
Latin American cartels, flush with dollars and euros from drug sales, are uniquely placed to satisfy the Chinese appetite for hard currencies. Some Chinese expatriates located in drug-producing countries such as Mexico, Colombia and Peru are the intermediaries bridging these disparate sets of people, said Donald Im, a senior DEA agent and anti-money laundering specialist.
""When there is need by the cartels for cash to be laundered, and there is demand for cash from the Chinese, you have a perfect marriage made in heaven,"" Im told Reuters. ""The Chinese brokers are very important to the Mexican and Colombian cartels.""
In the case of Gan, it was a lucrative business, according to conversations between his alleged associates taped by Homeland Security Investigations agents. ""He has made $1 million already because of us, for real,"" Pan Haiping told Lim in August 2017, according to transcripts of intercepted phone communications presented at Gan's trial.
Chinese money launderers are squeezing out Mexican and Colombian rivals by undercutting them on price by as much as half, U.S. officials said. The Chinese operators have been able to do that because they levy fees on both sides of each transaction. They impose fat commissions as high as 10% on Chinese citizens eager to get money out of China. That allows the Chinese money brokers, in turn, to charge traffickers nominal fees of just a few percentage points. The money launderers still turn a handsome profit while locking in a steady supply of coveted dollars and euros from cartel customers.
DEA agent Im said the Chinese expats had the ""systems and the infrastructure"" in place not only to launder the drug proceeds but to do it so cheaply that drug cartels receive back ""almost 100%"" of their dirty money.
Chinese money brokers have also managed to avoid choosing sides in Mexico's cartel wars, even coordinating money contracts with both the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels on the same day, according to a second senior DEA agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Traffickers use other so-called trade-based money laundering schemes to move drug money from China to Mexico, according to the DEA and Mexican government officials who spoke with Reuters. In July, Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, an investigative agency, said publicly that Chinese nationals laundering money for the Jalisco New Generation cartel were using drug proceeds to buy shoes in bulk from China, then reselling them in Mexico to get the gang their cash.
Chinese exports to Mexico, including electronics, clothing and other consumer goods, have nearly doubled over the past decade to $83 billion in 2019. The surge has allowed drug cartels and their money launderers to piggyback on this burgeoning trade relationship, authorities said.
In Guadalajara, Pan Emi said e-mail exchanges with her husband's U.S. lawyers left her optimistic ahead of Gan's looming sentencing. Prosecutors have asked for a 20-year jail term; Gan's defense attorneys have argued for no more than two years.

Pan Emi said business was going well in Mexico and she had no desire to return to China. ""I hope my husband comes back,"" she said.

JUBA (Reuters) - Implementation of South Sudan's 2018 peace accord has stalled and authorities have blocked humanitarian access to areas where conflict has restarted, the U.N. panel of experts said in a report seen by Reuters on Thursday.
They also said there was a lack of transparency in how the government collected and spent oil and other revenues.
The government disputed the findings, saying agencies had access to all areas and it was working to fix the economy.
Oil-rich South Sudan erupted into civil war soon after securing independence from Sudan in 2011, leading to an estimated 400,000 deaths and one of the worst refugee crises on the continent since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.
A fragile peace accord between President Salva Kiir and former rebel leader Riek Machar was agreed in 2018 and they formed a government of national unity in February, setting the stage for potential peace.
But since then implementation has ""mostly stalled, as the signatories have failed to adhere to the deadlines set in the peace agreement and have backtracked on aspects of its political, security and economic provisions,"" the panel said. 
As fighting has erupted in areas across the country, the panel found that South Sudan People's Defence Forces and National Security Service ""routinely blocked the United Nations Mission in South Sudan and peace monitors from accessing conflict areas"".
The panel also noted that the government, which relies heavily on oil for its revenue, has turned to resource backed loans and contracts as it struggles to plug a budget deficit projected to hit $700 million.
Deng Dau Deng, the deputy minister of foreign affairs, said the panel of experts themselves had been allowed entry into South Sudan, which shows ""that the government of South Sudan is committed to meet the U.N. resolutions on South Sudan"".
""South Sudan is cooperative,"" he told Reuters on Thursday. ""The U.N. mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and other agencies have full access to all the areas.""
He also said, without providing details, that his government was working to improve the deficit situation in the country.

CHISINAU (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of Moldova's incoming president Maia Sandu protested on Thursday against a move by parliament to strip her of control of the intelligence service weeks before she takes office. 
Sandu, a former World Bank economist who favours closer ties with the European Union, defeated the pro-Moscow incumbent Igor Dodon in last month's presidential election, but parliament is still dominated by Socialist party lawmakers aligned with Dodon.
The eastern European country of 3.5 million, where the West and Russia vie for influence, has been rocked in recent years by instability and corruption scandals, including the disappearance of $1 billion from the banking system. 
Sandu has described the move to strip her office of control of the Information and Security Service as ""an attempt to usurp power"" and hobble her presidency. 
""We got the vote of the people in the elections to punish the thieves, to return the stolen money to people,"" she said at the protest rally.
""But the thieves got scared, they want to keep the old corruption schemes, they want to throw the voice of the people into a landfill.""
The Socialists argued that, since Moldova was a parliamentary republic, control over the intelligence service should be handed to parliament.
The Socialists have also drafted legislation that would give special status to the Russian language, which is widely spoken alongside Romanian in the country that borders Ukraine and EU member state Romania. 
Sandu's supporters shouted ""down with the mafia"" and ""down with Dodon"". Many wore masks due to the coronavirus pandemic. Inside parliament, proceedings were suspended after lawmakers from Sandu's party, supported by others, blocked the central rostrum. 

Sandu struck a conciliatory tone following her election victory and addressed supporters in Russian at the rally. But her call for Russian peacekeepers to withdraw from the breakaway region of Transdniestria prompted the Kremlin to warn it could lead to ""serious destabilisation"" this week.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Wednesday urged countries to reinforce their healthcare systems and coordinate restrictions on social gatherings ahead of the Christmas holiday season, to avoid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. 
After a surge of cases in October and November, many European countries have reined in infections by imposing stricter lockdowns and social restrictions.
The European Commission on Wednesday urged governments to keep up measures on physical distancing and mask wearing over the Christmas holidays, and require people to self-isolate before and after social gatherings if rules on meetings are temporarily loosened during the festive season.
This self-quarantine should be for ""at least seven"" days, the Commission said. Countries should consider banning mass gatherings, while there should be ""clear criteria"" for small events.
""We know that the sacrifices for keeping each other safe are high. But we cannot allow the risk of seeing Christmas or New Year's celebrations becoming super-spreading events,"" EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said.
Brussels encouraged countries to use ""household bubbles"" to limit social contacts if they loosen restrictions during the holidays, and said countries could extend school holidays or impose a period of online learning after the festive season, to act as a buffer against infections.
Hospitals should prepare ""surge capacities"" in staffing and tap EU programmes to secure protective equipment when needed, the Commission said.
It called on countries to expand testing capacities to track local virus outbreaks, and expand public transport capacity, where possible, to avoid overcrowding. Masks should be mandatory on public transport, the Commission said.
Health policy is a national prerogative in the 27-country bloc and the EU Commission can only make recommendations for common measures.
But by attempting to coordinate countries' efforts, the EU hopes to avoid a return to the patchwork of different national rules that characterized the first months on the pandemic on the continent.

With the first COVID-19 vaccines potentially available this month, the Commission said it will make recommendations for countries to coordinate the lifting of restrictions once the jab rollout occurs.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy activist Jimmy Lai was denied bail on Thursday on a charge of fraud related to the lease of a building that houses his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily, an anti-government tabloid. 
Hong Kong authorities have intensified a crackdown on key opposition figures in the Chinese-ruled city since Beijing circumvented the local legislature and imposed sweeping national security legislation on the global financial centre on June 30. 
While Lai's fraud charge did not fall under the national security law, it marks the latest crackdown on pro-democracy figures in the former British colony, which was handed back to Beijing in 1997 with a promise of keeping its free-wheeling way of life for 50 years. 
Critics say the law crushes freedoms enshrined under the ""one country, two systems"" formula, while supporters say it will bring stability after prolonged anti-China, pro-democracy protests last year.
Lai, an ardent critic of Beijing, was detained on Wednesday and the case has been adjourned until April, according to media.
On Wednesday, one of Hong Kong's most prominent democracy activists, Joshua Wong, was jailed for more than 13 months for his role in an anti-government rally in 2019, the toughest and most high-profile sentencing of an opposition figure this year.
Lai, 73, and two senior executives of his company Next Digital, were charged on Wednesday on suspicion of concealing from and falsely representing the use of their office to their landlord, a public corporation set up by the Hong Kong government.
The charge stated they were not using the office space as permitted under the lease between 2016 to 2020, and had sub-let part of the premises, resulting in benefits to Apple Daily.
Reuters was not able to reach Lai or his lawyers for comment. 
Next Digital, which suspended trading on Thursday morning, said in a statement it did not expect the charges to have an immediate impact on daily operations, as the company is operated by a team of management personnel. Its shares will resume trading on Friday. 
""This is about dirtying Jimmy up. It's Beijing's policing brought to Hong Kong,"" Mark Simon, an associate of Lai, told Reuters.
Lai was arrested in August when about 200 police officers swooped on his offices. Hong Kong police later said they had arrested nine men and one woman for suspected offences including ""collusion with a foreign country/external elements to endanger national security, conspiracy to defraud"" and others. 
Suspicion of colluding with foreign forces carries a maximum sentence of life in jail under the new security law. 
Lai has been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor"".

The security law was introduced on June 30 and punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

The woman, who has denied all allegations, was released from custody on Wednesday after three days of detention following the discovery of the man in the apartment by a relative. 
The woman had also been suspected of causing her son grievous bodily harm after he was found with injuries, such as bruises and sores, which required hospital treatment.
But Olsson said the injuries were due to the man's ill-health and not violence. He remains in hospital, she added.

Turkey's military and its Syrian rebel allies seized control of Afrin, a mainly Kurdish region, from the Kurdish YPG militia in March 2018 in one of a series of Turkish incursions into northern Syria.
Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group tied to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought an insurgency in southeast Turkey since 1984. 
The ministry said the YPG had infiltrated the area and Turkish forces had opened fire in the direction of the attack, ""neutralising"" six of the militants as they retreated. This term usually means killed but could also mean wounded.
Operations were continuing in the area, with Turkish forces supported by drones, the statement said.
The governor's office in Turkey's Hatay province, bordering Afrin, said the killed soldier was a sergeant and that the attack was staged overnight in the Gazaviye base area in Afrin.

The government has launched what it calls an unprecedented action against ""separatism"" following several Islamist attacks in France this autumn, including the beheading of a teacher who had shown his class caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad.
Darmanin said 76 mosques out of the more than 2,600 Muslim places of worship had been flagged as possible threats to France's Republican values and its security. Where suspicions are confirmed, the mosque will be closed down, he said.
""There are in some concentrated areas places of worship which are clearly anti-Republican,"" Darmanin told RTL radio, ""(where) imams are followed by the intelligence services and where the discourse runs counter to our values.""
Investigators will dig into the mosques' financing and the background of imams deemed suspicious and search for evidence, among other things, of Koranic schools for young children.
President Emmanuel Macron has warned of the growing menace of 'Islamist separatism' and its challenge to the unity of the secular French republic. Core French values such as the freedom of belief, gender equality and the right to blaspheme are threatened in localised areas, he has said. 
""Faced with this ill that is eating into our country, France has rallied with resilience, with determination,"" the president wrote in a letter to the Financial Times newspaper in November.
The government's crackdown has left some Muslims feeling increasingly alienated in their own country. Some Muslim leaders while backing the government's fight against Islamism have warned it against inadvertently lumping an overwhelming majority of their faith with the ""fomenters of hate"".

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 05:41AM ET</span>",Former French President Giscard d'Estaing dies of COVID-19 complications at 94,"By Michel Rose and Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - Former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who championed European integration and helped modernise French society in the 1970s, has died at the age of 94 after contracting COVID-19. 
Giscard's foundation said he passed away in his family home in the Loir-et-Cher region of central France. He had been admitted to hospital in September with respiratory complications, and was hospitalised again in mid-November.
His funeral will be an intimate family affair, the Valery Giscard d'Estaing Foundation said on Twitter. 
Giscard was elected president in 1974 at the age of 48 to become France's youngest postwar leader.
At home, Giscard presided over a modernisation of French society, legalising abortion, allowing divorce by mutual consent and lowering the voting age to 18 from 21. 
He sought to liberalise France's economy, was the father of France's high-speed TGV network, and projected the image of a young, modern president who was closer to the people than his predecessors.
Lawmakers held a minute's silence in the National Assembly as tributes flowed in. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy said Giscard had ""worked his whole life to reinforce relations between European nations.""
Giscard forged a close relationship with former West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt and together they laid the foundations for the euro single currency, setting up the European Monetary System.
He was also an ardent Anglophile, and took office a year after Britain joined the European Economic Community.
""Complete love-hate relationship with our country,"" Britain's former Europe minister in the early 2000s, Denis McShane, said on a statement on Twitter, calling him a ""big politician"" who changed Europe. 
Month's before the Brexit referendum in 2016, he urged Britons to stay in the European Union. 
Michel Barnier, a Frenchman and lead EU negotiator in talks over Europe's future relationship with Britain, said: ""For Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Europe needed to be a French ambition and France a modern nation. Respect.""

Giscard served one term as president, losing his re-election bid to Socialist Francois Mitterrand in the aftermath of the global economic downturn of the 1970s.

Instead, the hotel has opened its doors to the homeless.
The hotel's management have, for a year, handed over their rooms to homeless charity Emmaus Solidarite, which is now using them to accommodate people who would otherwise be on the streets.
If it were not for his room at the hotel, Ibrahim, an asylum seeker from the West African country of Mali, would be bedding down in the restaurant kitchens where he picks up occasional work, or failing that, outdoors.
""When I had just arrived (in Paris), I didn't know anyone. I was moving around temporary housing, sometimes I slept in the kitchen, or beside the garbage can,"" he said.
""Some days I find a small job, and I earn about 40 euros, 30 euros, 50 euros and I go out. When I find these jobs, I pay for a hotel, which costs 30 euros, to spend the night. But I can't do this all my life.""
At the Hotel Avenir Montmartre, the cost of his room is covered by the charity. Residents receive three meals a day in the hotel's breakfast room, and each room has a television and an en suite shower room.
For the charity, the hotel provides a safe base from which they can try to help rebuild residents' lives. The charity is covering the cost with government aid.
Many residents have physical or mental illnesses from living on the street and the trauma they have experienced, said Emmaus general director Bruno Morel. The charity aims to help them break the cycle of homelessness, he said.

Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party made battling what it calls ""LGBT ideology"" a key plank of election campaigns in 2019 and 2020 in a bid to rally core religious conservative voters.
""The Commissioner is deeply concerned about the propagation of negative and inflammatory homophobic narratives by many public officials in Poland, including people in the highest ranks of government,"" the memorandum by Dunja Mijatovic said.
""...Stigmatisation and hate directed at certain individuals or groups of people carry a real risk of legitimising violence, sometimes with fatal consequences.""
The memorandum outlines instances of stigmatisation of LGBTI people in Poland, including the declaration of ""LGBT-free zones"" by some local authorities, and instances of inflammatory language used about the LGBTI community by politicians and senior figures in the Catholic church.
""Stigmatising rhetoric has often been accompanied by harassment and intimidation of LGBTI activists by law enforcement agencies and the public prosecution services,"" the memorandum said, citing the example of an activist detained for hanging up posters of the Virgin Mary with a rainbow halo.
In written comments in response to the memorandum, the Polish government rejected the criticism.
""...It needs to be emphasised that the activities of the police could have never been considered as harassing or intimidating and they resulted only from respecting the law in force,"" the government said.
It said that the commissioner's comments on ""LGBT-free zones"" were ""misleading"", adding that the institution of marriage as a union between a man and a woman was enshrined in the Polish constitution.

Poland and Hungary are under formal EU investigation for undermining the independence of courts, media and non-governmental organisations.

Other images showed people wading or pushing motorcycles through thigh-deep water while some residents, including a Buddhist monk, rowed boats through commercial areas where children played.
The floods started a week ago but had receded by Thursday, according to the interior ministry, having affected more than 255,000 households in seven of the southern provinces.
The impacted region is home to Thailand's major rubber plantations, accounting for the majority of the world's natural rubber supply.

BELLINZONA, Switzerland (Reuters) - A former rebel commander accused of being involved in the killing of 18 civilians and other crimes that included rape and eating pieces of a school teacher's heart during Liberia's civil war appeared in a Swiss court room on Thursday.
The trial is just one of a handful of cases brought to international courts in connection with the West African country's 1989-2003 civil war, which became a byword for savagery and killed hundreds of thousands of people.
The defendant, 45-year-old Alieu Kosiah, denies the charges. His lawyer said Kosiah was not present in the area in question when the alleged crimes were committed.
Kosiah's crimes are listed by the Swiss court as ""recruitment and use of a child soldier, forced transportation, looting, cruel treatment of civilians, attempted murder, murder (directly or by order), desecration of a corpse and rape"".
Kosiah was one of the so-called 'big men' in the rebel faction ULIMO whose battalion fought against the troops of warlord Charles Taylor in the remote Lofa County in the 1990s.
The indictment says that he killed or participated in the killing of 18 civilians, forced a displaced woman to be his ""wife"", raping her repeatedly, and that he recruited a 12-year-old boy as his personal bodyguard.
In one incident described in the indictment, Kosiah joined fighters in eating slices of an assassinated man's heart off a metal plate. Acts of cannibalism were not uncommon in the conflict.
Kosiah, who has given testimony to Swiss prosecutors, has not yet pleaded in court and is due to be heard next week.
""According to Mr. Alieu Kosiah, one of the big problems with this case is he had not yet arrived in Lofa (county) at the time of the crimes he supposedly committed there,"" his lawyer Dimitri Gianoli told Reuters before the trial.
""(He) has always been very clear on his whereabouts in Liberia and the court filings include testimonies collected in Switzerland that confirm it.""
The case is a first for Switzerland under a 2011 law allowing prosecution for war crimes committed anywhere.
Lawyers for Liberian victims are opposed to a court decision to postpone their hearings until next year due to COVID-19, effectively preventing them from hearing Kosiah in person.
The court is also mulling video link testimonies.
""After the unspeakable things they went through during the war they deserve to be present,"" said Alain Werner, a lawyer representing four plaintiffs, in a pre-trial interview. 
Liberia has never prosecuted its war criminals despite a recommendation to do so by its Truth and Reconciliation Commission more than 10 years ago.

Then, his image in one of Reuters pictures of the year helped draw world attention to his country's plight. Today, after treatment, he plays with a toy car, sits on a donkey and - mute since birth - uses hand signals and a smile to communicate. 
But malnutrition hangs like a spectre over him and 2 million other Yemeni children as war, economic decline and COVID-19 push Yemen closer to what the United Nations warns could be the worst famine for decades.
""Hassan eats what we eat: rice, bread. We don't have fat-rich foods nowadays, we cannot find meat for him,"" his uncle Tayeb Muhammed said. 
Hassan has lost some of the weight gained during treatment since returning to his family's hut. Displaced five times by war, they now live in rural Hajjah, one of the poorest regions. His father has no work to provide for his seven children.
When Reuters first met Hassan in July he weighed just 9 kilos. A struggling local health clinic sent him to the capital Sanaa for treatment, paid for by a charity. He now weighs just over 13 kilos.
""His body is weak again,"" his uncle told Reuters, and he needs more treatment. 
Famine has never been officially declared in Yemen, where the more than five-year-old war has left 80% of the population reliant on aid in what the U.N. says is the world's largest humanitarian crisis. 
U.N. warnings in late 2018 of impending famine prompted an aid ramp-up. But this year coronavirus restrictions, reduced remittances, locusts, floods and significant underfunding of the 2020 aid response are exacerbating hunger.
Doctor Ali Yahya Hajer, at Hassan's local clinic, said the family needs nutritional baskets delivered to their home until the child's and the family's situation stabilises.

The war in Yemen, in which a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement since 2015, has killed more than 100,000 people and left the country divided with the Houthis holding Sanaa and most major urban centres.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian government ministers began talks with farmers' leaders on Thursday to try and break a deadlock over laws passed earlier this year seeking to deregulate the agriculture sector that has ignited the country's biggest farm protests in years.
Tens of thousands of growers have camped out at the entrance to capital Delhi in protest against the laws seeking to rid the sector of antiquated procurement procedures and to allow farmers to sell to institutional buyers and big international retailers.
The farmers, who form a powerful political constituency, fear the laws passed in September could pave the way for the government to stop buying grains at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers.
The protests pose a crucial test for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ability to reform India's vast agriculture sector.
Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar and Trade Minister Piyush Goyal have started discussion with nearly three-dozen farmers' representatives, a government official said.
""We expect the government to pay heed to our demands to repeal the laws detrimental to India's farming community,"" said Joginder Singh Ugrahan, a prominent farmers' leader.
Modi's government has defended the bill and several hours of talks between farmers' leaders and the government on Tuesday failed to break the impasse.
India's vast farm sector makes up nearly 15% of the country's $2.9 trillion economy and employs around half of its 1.3 billion people.
""We humbly request you to pay heed to the voice of farmers and withdraw completely the implementation of these Acts,"" Avik Saha, another farmers' leader said in a letter written to the agriculture minister on Thursday.
""The issue is not about one particular clause, but about the direction in which the government of India is pushing farming in India,"" Saha wrote.
Farm groups say the government is trying to end a decades-old policy of providing them with an assured minimum price for producing staples, such as wheat and rice.

ACCRA (Reuters) - With two old rivals facing off in Ghana's presidential election on Dec. 7 amid familiar economic woes, many voters are paying more attention to a new element in the political mix - the first ever female vice-presidential candidate for a major party.
West Africa's second-largest economy has one of the highest levels of women-owned businesses in the world, yet just 13% of parliamentary seats are held by women. 
Former education minister Jane Naana Opoku-Agyeman hopes that the decision of Ghana's main opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) to nominate her as its candidate for vice-president will inspire other women to enter politics.
""Many are those who are now more energised to vote, thanks to the momentous decision,"" Opoku-Agyeman, 69, said on the campaign trail in July after her nomination, promising to hold the door open for other women.
She and the NDC's presidential candidate John Mahama, a former president of Ghana, are running against the incumbent, President Nana Akufo-Addo, and Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia, a former banker, of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP).
Some commentators saw her nomination as a politically astute move by the NDC to gain an edge in the race, a view boosted by a poll conducted in October by Ghanaian market research firm MSI-ACI showing over 70% of people canvassed approved of her candidacy.
""It's a win, regardless of whether she wins,"" said 35-year-old tech entrepreneur Kafui Anson-Yevu. She and her friends in Accra hope the nomination is just a starting point for women entering national politics.
Three women are also among the 12 presidential candidates, although voters generally choose between the NPP and NDC, who have alternated in power since 1992.
IN SHADOW OF PANDEMIC
Ghana will also hold a parliamentary election on Dec. 7, but the main parties are fielding fewer female candidates this year than in 2016, so the number of women deputies is likely to fall, according to a report https://www.ndi.org/publications/ghana-2020-pre-election-press-release by U.S. pro-democracy groups.
Like other countries, Ghana, a major producer of oil, gold and cocoa, has seen its economy badly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.
A strict lockdown in the spring was especially painful for the informal sector, which accounts for a third of national output and where women hold nine out of 10 jobs. 
In the second quarter of this year, the economy contracted for the first time in nearly 40 years, though it is expected to grow 5.9% next year.
Both presidential candidates have promised more spending to help smooth the economic recovery.
The ruling NPP's promises include a proposed rent support scheme, while Mahama has vowed to create 1 million jobs.
This is Akufo-Addo's third head-to-head with Mahama, who narrowly won their first encounter in 2012 before losing to Akufo-Addo in 2016 by more than 9 percentage points.
Around 70% of Ghanaians approve of Akufo-Addo, according to a September-October poll of 2,400 citizens by the Ghana Centre for Democratic Development, a non-profit research group. 
Voting intentions were not polled, but ""there’s really some confidence that it is theirs to lose,"" said Kojo Asante, a director at the centre, referring to Akufo-Addo's NPP party. 

Policy and campaign promises matter in elections in Ghana, where - unlike elsewhere in the region - ethnic alliances do not play a decisive political role.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>",Rights groups urge Bangladesh not to ship Rohingya to island,"By Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - Human rights groups urged Bangladesh on Thursday to stop its plan to ship thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote island as officials said the first group of 400 could leave later in the day.
Police escorted the refugees in 10 buses from Ukhiya in Cox's Bazar for the journey to Chittagong port and then on to Bhasan Char – a flood-prone Bay of Bengal island that emerged from the sea 20 years ago.
Bangladesh says moving refugees who agree to go to the island will ease chronic overcrowding in its camps which are home to more than 1 million Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority who have fled neighbouring Myanmar.
""The authorities should immediately halt relocation of more refugees to Bhashan Char,"" Amnesty International’s South Asia Campaigner Saad Hammadi said in a statement.
U.S.-based advocacy group Refugees International said the plan was ""short-sighted and inhumane"" while the Fortify Rights Group said the relocations may be ""coerced and involuntary"" and should cease immediately.
Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said the relocation was voluntary.
""They are going there happily. No one is forced. The government has taken all measures to deal with disasters, including their comfortable living and livelihood.""
A senior foreign ministry official said the refugees were being moved because there was little prospect of repatriating them to Myanmar. 
Bangladeshi officials said the first 400 of 2,500 refugees would leave on Thursday evening, depending on the tide. The journey takes several hours.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar in 2017 following a military-led crackdown that the United Nations has said was executed with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies genocide and says its forces were targeting Rohingya militants who attacked police posts.
A senior Bangladeshi official has said housing was built for 100,000 people on the island and authorities want to relocate them during the November to April dry season when the sea is calm. 
The United Nations said in a statement it had been given ""limited information"" about the relocations and was not involved in preparations. 
Omar Faruq, one Rohingya leader who had been on a government trip, said the island was ""truly beautiful"", with better facilities than in the refugee camps and that he would be ready to go, but that most people did not want to go there.
""We don’t want to end up living an isolated prison-like life,"" said Nurul Amin, one Rohingya refugee who was not on the list.

More than 300 refugees were brought to the island earlier this year after several months at sea in an attempt to flee Bangladesh. Rights groups say they are being held against their will and have complained of human rights violations.

1674,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 03, 2020 01:51AM ET</span>",Japan prosecutors seek to query former PM Abe in political funding case: media,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Prosecutors have asked Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to report for voluntary questioning in a case they are building against his secretary over unreported political funds involving as much as 40 million yen ($382,848), media said on Thursday.
Ex-premier Abe, who stepped down due to ill-health in September, is under fire after sources told media his office helped cover the costs of dinner parties for supporters, a possible violation of funding laws that conflicts with Abe's vehement denials in parliament last year.
The scandal also threatens to embroil Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who was widely seen as Abe's right-hand man during his tenure and has defended him in parliament.
Abe's secretary is quoted as telling investigators that the income and expenditures ""should have been included in the political funding report"" though ""it was common practice not to,"" according to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.
Abe himself has been asked by Tokyo prosecutors to appear for voluntary questioning about the issue, media reported later on Thursday.
Abe's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on both reports, while a spokeswoman at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office said she was unaware of the development and the office would not make announcements on any case while investigations were ongoing.
Prosecutors are building their case on what they see as the failure to report 14 million yen in five years' worth of party attendee contributions - via ticket sales - as both income and expenditure, as well as an additional eight million yen that Abe's office paid to cover shortfalls in party costs that the contributions didn't cover, the Yomiuri said. The newspaper did not identify how the remaining 18 million yen was spent.
Politicians in Japan are forbidden to provide anything to constituents that could be construed as a gift. The rule is so strict that two ministers in Abe's cabinet last year had to quit in quick succession for giving things such as melons, crabs and even potatoes to voters in their constituencies. 
Abe had repeatedly said in parliament that ""there was no income or expenditure that needed to be included in the political funding report,"" and denied his office had covered the gap between ticket sales and the costs of the party.
Abe said last week he was aware of the accusations and promised his office would ""fully cooperate"" with prosecutors.
Last week, Suga deflected questions on how he would take responsibility for making inaccurate statements in parliament, but said ""if it comes to be that what I said was different from the facts, then I will likely take action given that I too am responsible for my responses.""
A ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker close to both Abe and Suga told Reuters the investigation could take a long-term toll.
""If Abe's secretary is arrested and Abe is questioned, it will damage the overall image of the LDP,"" he said.

COLOMBO (Reuters) - The Burevi tropical cyclone is headed towards southern India, authorities said on Thursday, after it slammed Sri Lanka's east coast earlier this week but caused little damage.
The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a ""red"" warning to parts of the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala and said the cyclone is expected to hit on Thursday or early on Friday. Another tropical cyclone killed at least 23 people in Tamil Nadu last week.
""Very to heavy rainfall is expected in southern Kerala and southern Tamil Nadu,"" the IMD said.
India's weather office said it expects damage to thatched huts, and that power and communication lines could be affected due to breaking tree branches. It also expects the storm to hit paddy crops, banana, papaya trees and orchards. 
The warning comes after Burevi's packing winds of up to 90 kph (56 mph) hit Sri Lanka late on Wednesday but with little fallout.
""District disaster management units are reporting that no major damage has been caused by the cyclone,"" said Pradeeep Kodippili, assistant director at the country's disaster management centre.
Authorities in Sri Lanka had evacuated more than 75,000 people, most of them from the Trincomalee area, before the Burevi cyclone hit.

But Kodippili said cyclonic conditions were still prevalent in the north with heavy rains and strong gusts of wind and that naval and fishing communities had been asked not to go out to sea.

1676,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 10:56PM ET</span>",Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing was architect of EU integration,"By Ingrid Melander
PARIS (Reuters) - Former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, a key architect of European integration who sought to liberalise the economy and social attitudes after years of conservative Gaullist rule, died on Wednesday. He was 94.
France's leader from 1974 to 1981, Giscard presided over a modernisation of French society, allowing divorce by mutual consent, legalising abortion and lowering the voting age to 18 years from 21. 
In Europe, he forged a close relationship with former West German chancellor Helmut Schmidt and together they laid the foundations for the euro single currency, setting up the European Monetary System.
Giscard sought to project the image of a young, modern president who was closer to the people than his predecessors, inviting himself to dinner at ordinary folks' homes and playing the accordion. 
But the global economic downturn of the 1970s and his perceived arrogance that rubbed many French voters the wrong way contributed to his losing his re-election bid to Socialist Francois Mitterrand. 
An ardent anglophile, the dome-headed Giscard took office a year after Britain joined the European Economic Community and met every British leader from Edward Heath - the only one he described as a ""true European"" - to David Cameron.
He once said it was geography that dictated Britain's often prickly relations with Europe, and in 2016 chipped in to efforts to persuade Britons to stay in the European Union.
Months before the referendum in 2016, he told Reuters his message to Britain was: ""We love you. Don't leave us now.""
But he perhaps made more headlines in Britain when in 2009 he penned his novel ""The Princess and the President"" about a secret love affair between a French leader and an unhappy British princess, whose character bore a striking resemblance to Lady Diana.
Giscard had said that although Diana was the inspiration behind the book, the story itself was pure fiction. 
""We were talking about love stories between the leaders of major countries and she said to me 'why don't you write a book about it?'"" Giscard told Le Point magazine of a conversation he had with Diana. 
Known for his razor-sharp intellect, Giscard, who was 55 when he lost his re-election bid, complained that many in France saw little use for former presidents.
""They only have the right to publish memoirs that no one reads. I have never accepted this and as time passes I feel increasingly free,"" he said.
One role he took on was as head of the convention that drafted a European constitution that was voted down in France and the Netherlands in 2005.
For over three decades, Giscard held on to the title of France's youngest president, until Emmanuel Macron blew apart the country's political arena aged 39, nine years younger than Giscard was when elected.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's parliament on Thursday passed legislation giving the federal government power to veto any agreement struck with foreign states, a move likely to anger China and intensify a bitter diplomatic spat between the two countries.
The law allows the Commonwealth to block any agreement between Australian states, councils or institutions and a foreign government, such as a controversial 2018 deal between the state of Victoria and China.
""Australia's policies and plans, the rules that we make for our country are made here in Australia according to our needs and our interests,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
Morrison has stressed the law is not aimed at any country but it is widely seen by analysts as directed at China.
""It creates another trigger for the relationship to deteriorate,"" said Melissa Conley Tyler, research fellow at the Asia Institute of the University of Melbourne.
Under the terms of the new law, the foreign minister can veto any agreements with foreign governments if they ""adversely affect Australia’s foreign relations"" or are ""inconsistent with Australian foreign policy"".
One deal expected to come under the spotlight is Victoria's participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which Morrison said weakens the federal government's ability to control foreign policy. 
Morrison declined to comment on whether that arrangement would be vetoed.
Relations between Australia and China, its largest trading partner, have soured since Morrison called for an independent international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year.
Beijing has also take umbrage at Canberra's blocking of a recent agricultural deal, its barring of Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network and legislation outlawing foreign interference in Australia's domestic politics.
China has blocked billions of dollars worth of Australian exports from lobsters to wine in recent months, all the while refusing to accept phone calls from Australian ministers. 
Ties soured further this week when a senior Chinese official posted a fake image of an Australian soldier holding a knife with blood on it to the throat of an Afghan child, prompting Morrison to demand an apology from Beijing.
Australian universities earn billions of dollars in tuition fees from Chinese students but some of their agreements with state-backed Chinese institutions may now come under closer scrutiny. 
Last year Australia’s New South Wales state scrapped a Chinese-funded language programme in schools amid fears over foreign influence.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Guardian Council watchdog body approved a law on Wednesday that obliges the government to halt U.N. inspections of its nuclear sites and step up uranium enrichment beyond the limit set under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal if sanctions are not eased in two months. 
In retaliation for the killing last week of Iran's top nuclear scientist, which Tehran has blamed on Israel, Iran's hardline-dominated parliament on Tuesday approved the bill with a strong majority that will harden Iran's nuclear stance.
The Guardian Council is charged with ensuring draft laws do not contradict Shi'ite Islamic laws or Iran’s constitution. However, the stance of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the last word on all matters of state, is not known.
""Today in a letter, the parliament speaker officially asked the president to implement the new law,"" Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported. 
Under the new law, Tehran would give two months to the deal's European parties to ease sanctions on Iran's oil and financial sectors, imposed after Washington quit the pact between Tehran and six powers in 2018. 
In reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy on Tehran, Iran has gradually reduced its compliance with the deal. 
The law pushed by hardline lawmakers would make it harder for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office on Jan. 20, to rejoin the agreement.
Biden has said he would return to the pact and would lift sanctions if Tehran returned to ""strict compliance with the nuclear deal"".
""There's now more pressure on (President Hassan) Rouhani's government to secure a U.S. return to the JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) quickly,"" tweeted Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East researcher at the German Marshall Fund and Columbia University. 
Rouhani, the Iranian architect of the 2015 deal, criticised parliament's move as ""harmful to diplomatic efforts"" aimed at easing U.S. sanctions. 
Under the new law, the government should resume uranium enrichment to 20% and install advanced centrifuges at its Natanz and Fordow nuclear facilities. 
The deal caps the fissile purity to which Iran can refine uranium at 3.67%, far below the 20% achieved before the deal and below the weapons-grade level of 90%. Iran breached the 3.67% cap in July 2019 and the enrichment level has remained steady at up to 4.5% since then.

Britain, France and Germany, all parties to the 2015 deal, have urged Iran to fully respect it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon has approved drawdown plans in Afghanistan that will still keep two larger bases in the country as officials carry out President Donald Trump's orders to slash troop levels to 2,500 by Jan. 15, the top U.S. general said on Wednesday.
Trump's post-election decision last month to cut nearly half of the roughly 4,500 troops currently in Afghanistan came before military leaders could devise plans to execute a drawdown, leaving many questions unanswered about the future U.S. military mission after Trump leaves office on Jan. 20.
Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, offered the first details about the drawdown at an event hosted by the Brookings Institution think tank. He said that in addition to the two larger bases, the United States would also keep ""several satellite bases."" 
He said the U.S. military will also continue its two core missions: aiding Afghan security forces who are locked in a grinding conflict with Taliban insurgents and carrying out counterterrorism operations against Islamic State and al Qaeda militants.
However, Milley did not disclose which bases in Afghanistan would be shuttered or say what capabilities would be lost as the United States removes 2,000 troops from the country. He declined to speculate about what President-elect Joe Biden may decide.
""What comes after that, that will be up to a new administration,"" Milley said. 
As the United States prepares to withdraw more troops, the U.S.-backed Afghan government and Taliban representatives reached a preliminary deal on Wednesday to press on with peace talks.
It was their first written agreement in 19 years of war that Milley said has long been stalemated, with neither side able to defeat the other on the battlefield.
Looking back, Milley said the United States had ""achieved a modicum of success"" in Afghanistan. He stressed the importance of peace talks, even as he acknowledged that the idea of sitting down with Taliban representatives was ""odious"" to some people.
""But that is in fact the most common way that insurgencies end, is through a power-sharing negotiated settlement,"" he said.

The Taliban were ousted from power in 2001 by U.S.-led forces for refusing to hand over al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden, the architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. A U.S.-backed government has held power in Afghanistan since then, although the Taliban have control over wide areas of the country.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel edged closer on Wednesday towards a fourth national election in two years after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's main governing partner, Benny Gantz, backed an opposition move to dissolve parliament.
Parliament gave preliminary approval to a dissolution bill, but the legislation needs to pass three as yet unscheduled votes to become law, giving Netanyahu and Gantz, the defence minister, more time to work out differences over a national budget.
The coalition crisis could plunge Israel into more political uncertainty as it prepares for a new U.S. administration led by Joe Biden, deals with the coronavirus pandemic and awaits Iran's next moves after the assassination of its top nuclear scientist last week, a killing that Tehran blamed on Israel.
With final passage of the dissolution bill still uncertain, the budget dispute could in itself trigger a new election. Under law, failure to pass a budget by a Dec. 23 deadline means Israel would go to the polls in March.
""Benny Gantz has to pull the emergency brake,"" Netanyahu, who voted against the bill, said in special televised address after the parliamentary session.
But Israeli political commentators voiced scepticism that Netanyahu was seeking to save the so-called ""unity"" government, citing a looming ""rotation"" arrangement in which Gantz, head of the centrist Blue and White party, is due to take over from Israel's longest-serving leader in November 2021.
Even as that pact was being inked in May, few analysts in Israel believed that Netanyahu, on trial for alleged corruption which he denies, would relinquish his powerful post.
Asked if the handover was still in the cards, Netanyahu, taking questions after his speech, alleged that Gantz had pursued partisan policies violating the spirit of their unity agreement.
Gantz, who has said an election could be averted if Netanyahu carried out the coalition accord's call for a budget covering 2020 and 2021, accused him of ""trickery"".
If a 2021 budget needs to be passed separately, Netanyahu would gain another tool to block ""rotation"" because failure to approve that fiscal package by March would also trigger an election.
Political commentators on Israel's three main TV channels described Netanyahu's address, in which he hailed what he said were a series of health and diplomatic achievements under his leadership, as an election speech kicking off a campaign.
TIMING
Strategic timing for an early ballot could be crucial as Netanyahu weighs another fight for political survival after failing to win outright elections in April and September 2019 and in March this year in which Gantz was his main rival.
Netanyahu, who has led Israel since 2009 after serving a first term as premier from 1996 to 1999, has been facing a wave of street protests against his alleged corruption, which he denies, and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But recent opinion polls have predicted a strong showing for right-wing and religious parties that could rally around Netanyahu or another conservative challenger, former Defence Minister Naftali Bennett.
Gantz faces his own political risks: he has seen his popularity drop after alienating supporters by reneging on election promises not to join up with Netanyahu.
""Netanyahu prefers a May-June (election date) with a coronavirus vaccine and breathing space for businesses,"" YNet News political reporter Moran Azulay wrote. ""Gantz wants quick elections to stop Netanyahu organising.""

PARIS (Reuters) - France's president said on Wednesday a fund will be set up to ensure aid is channelled directly to the Lebanese people, but warned that without a credible new government there would be no international bailout to save the beleaguered country.
Emmanuel Macron is trying to revive a French initiative on Lebanon, but with the country's fractious political class bickering, hopes of a breakthrough anytime soon appear slim. 
Four months after a massive explosion that killed more than 200 people and destroyed swathes of the capital city, Lebanon is no closer to forming a credible government to overhaul the bankrupt state despite French efforts to convince politicians to introduce partial reforms to confront the emergency.
France, the United States and other donors who repeatedly came to Lebanon's aid after the 1975-90 civil war are losing patience with its politicians, many of them familiar faces in charge during the country's descent into economic crisis.
""The immediate (humanitarian) needs are still not taken care of with the country falling further into crisis,"" Macron said at the opening of a video conference hosting heads of state and non-governmental organisations to take stock of the humanitarian situation in the country.
He said a fund handled by the World Bank, United Nations and European Union would be set up to work with non-governmental organisations to provide support ranging from food, healthcare, education and reconstruction of the port. 
""This support does not replace the commitment of the Lebanese authorities and institutions to form a government and put into action the reform roadmap without which the international economic help will not come,"" Macron said. 
Macron, a natural ally given Lebanon is a former French colony, has invested a lot of political capital in trying to break the deadlock, vowing not to give up on the Lebanese.
He is due to visit French troops operating as part of a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon around Dec. 20, diplomats said.
""We will not give up on the promises we made or the demands on the reforms or the investigation on the origins of the explosion. I will head to Lebanon in December to carry those demands,"" he said.
Officials have made it clear that Lebanon will not be bailed out without structural reforms, a full audit of the central bank and that any immediate aid will only be to help urgent recovery.
""Lebanon will not escape this type of audit if it wants serious negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. It is indispensable, otherwise it's bankruptcy,"" a French official said. 

A similar conference in August raised nearly 253 million euros ($298 million) in pledges. The official said Wednesday's conference should raise a bit more.

1683,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 02:13PM ET</span>",Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong defiant as he is jailed over 13 months for protest,"By Jessie Pang and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Joshua Wong, 24, one of Hong Kong's most prominent democracy activists, was jailed on Wednesday for more than 13 months over an unlawful anti-government rally in 2019, the toughest and most high-profile sentence for an opposition figure this year. 
Wong's sentence comes as critics say the Beijing-backed government is intensifying a crackdown on Hong Kong's opposition and chipping away at wide-ranging freedoms guaranteed after the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, a charge authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong reject.
Reacting to the court ruling, Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab urged Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to stop their campaigns to stifle the opposition.
Wong had pleaded guilty to organising and inciting an unlawful assembly near the city's police headquarters during the height of the sometimes violent demonstrations in June last year. He faced a maximum of three years in jail.
About 100 supporters gathered quietly inside the court ahead of the sentence, while a small group of pro-Beijing people rallied outside, calling for a hefty prison sentence. 
""I know the coming days will be tougher. We will hang in there,"" Wong, wearing a black sweater and surgical face mask, shouted after the sentence was read out. 
""It’s not the end of the fight,"" Wong said later through his lawyers.
""Ahead of us is another challenging battleground. We're now joining the battle in prison along with many brave protesters, less visible yet essential in the fight for democracy and freedom for Hong Kong.""
Wong's long-time colleagues Agnes Chow, 23, and Ivan Lam, 26, were jailed for a total of 10 and seven months, respectively, on charges linked to the same siege when thousands of protesters surrounded the police headquarters on June 21 to demand the government withdraw a now-shelved extradition bill. 
Chow, who cried inside the court room on hearing her sentence, had pleaded guilty to incitement and participation in an unlawful protest, while Lam pleaded guilty to incitement.
A familiar face at democracy protests since he was a teenager, Wong was less than a year old when Hong Kong returned to Beijing 23 years ago with a guarantee of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including freedom of speech and assembly.
China's imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong on June 30 was seen as the latest blow to the city's liberties, which are crucial for its status as a global financial hub. 
""KEEP THE FAITH""
Ahead of sentencing, the district court judge read a letter from Wong's mother to the court in which she said her son was ""a young person who cares about society and is persistent in his ideals"". 
Under the handover agreement in 1997, Beijing promised to maintain the free-wheeling city's way of life for 50 years under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, although some fear 2047 is arriving early as authorities tighten their grip. 
U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn accused China of cracking down on human rights and destroying ""any semblance of autonomy in Hong Kong.""
""Keep the faith, Joshua, you are truly an inspiration to freedom fighters everywhere,"" Blackburn said in a statement.
Rights groups were swift to condemn the court ruling. 
""By targeting well-known activists from Hong Kong’s largely leaderless protest movement, authorities are sending a warning to anyone who dares openly criticize the government that they could be next,"" said Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director Yamini Mishra.
Wong, Chow and Lam are all former members of political group Demosisto, which was disbanded hours before Beijing imposed the security law amid fears it could be targeted.
Hong Kong activist Sunny Cheung said Wong's sentencing would leave a hole in the democracy movement's fight to be heard. 
""This is a big loss to the civil society. It also denotes a fact that Hong Kong is now entering a new stage if not a dark time which requires strategic adjustment in order to continue the fight for democracy,"" Cheung said. 
In recent months, the Hong Kong government has expelled opposition lawmakers from the legislature, disqualified pro-democracy candidates from running in a now-postponed election and arrested more than 30 people under the security legislation.
The expulsion of opposition lawmakers prompted democrats to resign en masse, leaving the legislature devoid of any opposition democrats for the first time since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule. 
Hundreds of Hong Kong activists have fled through legal or illegal channels to the democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a renegade province that should be brought back under its sovereignty, by force if necessary. 
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) expressed grave concerns over the sentencing.
""The DPP emphasises that what the Chinese Communists 

and the Hong Kong government have done today is equivalent of declaring that Hong Kong’s freedom is dead,"" it said in a statement.

1684,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 02:11PM ET</span>",United Nations and Ethiopia reach aid pact for war-hit Tigray,"ADDIS ABABA/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia and the United Nations agreed on Wednesday to channel desperately-needed humanitarian aid to the northern region of Tigray, where a month of war is believed to have killed thousands of combatants and civilians. 
Federal troops have been battling the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and have captured the regional capital Mekelle, and the pact announced by U.N. officials will allow relief into government-controlled areas of Tigray.
The Ethiopian conflict has forced more than 45,000 refugees to flee into Sudan, displaced many more within Tigray and worsened suffering in a region where 600,000 people already depended on food aid even before hostilities broke out on Nov.4.
As hundreds of foreign workers fled, aid agencies had appealed for urgent safe access.
Highlighting the dangers they face, four Ethiopian employees of two foreign aid agencies were killed in a camp for Eritrean refugees in Tigray last month, a humanitarian and a diplomatic source said on Wednesday.
It was unclear who killed them, and there was no immediate comment from Ethiopia's government nor the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The agencies asked not to be named as they had not yet informed their relatives.
Food is running out for 96,000 Eritrean refugees in Tigray who have fled repression in their own country..
And medics in Mekelle were short of painkillers, gloves and bodybags, the International Committee of the Red Cross said.
U.N. humanitarian coordination agency OCHA said the deal would ""ensure that humanitarians will have unimpeded, sustained and secure access...to areas under the control of the Federal Government in the Tigray Region.""
Ethiopian government spokesman Redwan Hussein confirmed the agreement but gave no further details.
TELECOMS PARTLY RESTORED
After phone and internet connections were largely shut down when the war began, telecoms in half a dozen towns in Tigray were partly restored, Ethio Telecom said on Wednesday, including Dansha, Humera and Mai Kadra, all controlled by the military.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared victory after the fall of Mekelle on Saturday, but there has has been little verifiable information from the highland city of 500,000 people since.
TPLF leaders fled for the hills, from where they say they continue to fight. State-run Ethiopian Press Agency published photographs on Wednesday of soldiers posing by a monument to the victory in Mekelle. 
Abiy on Wednesday shifted focus to next year's parliamentary election, meeting with political parties and election officials about the mid-2021 vote, his office said.
His government postponed it this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Tigray went ahead anyway and re-elected the TPLF, a guerrilla movement-turned-political party. 
That was one reason for the federal government's offensive against TPLF leaders, a conflict that may jeopardise political reforms enacted since Abiy took office in 2018.
Abiy, Africa's youngest leader at 44 and who won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for a pact with Eritrea, was pictured in battle fatigues meeting military officers in official photos on Wednesday.
He took leadership after nearly three decades of a TPLF-led national government which had gradually become repressive since its 1991 overthrow of a Marxist regime.
ADDIS ABABA BLAST
Abiy removed Tigrayans from government and security posts, saying they were over-represented for an ethnic group making up 6% of Ethiopia's population. The military moved into action when a federal army base was attacked in Tigray. 
The TPLF accuses their former military comrade and partner in government of dominating them in order to increase his personal grip over the nation of 115 million people, which is split into 10 regions run by different ethnic groups. 
Abiy, who hails from the larger Oromo and Amharic ethic groups, calls the Tigrayan leaders criminals opposing national unity and plotting attacks in Addis Ababa and elsewhere. 
Federal police blamed the TPLF, without proof, for a small blast in the capital on Wednesday that injured an officer lightly. There was no immediate response from the TPLF.

""Wars are not like taps that you turn on and then turn off. This is going to be a very long, drawn-out process,"" Horn of Africa expert Rashid Abdi told an online forum.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan government and Taliban representatives reached a preliminary deal on Wednesday to press on with peace talks, their first written agreement in 19 years of war and welcomed by the United States as a chance to halt the violence.
The agreement lays out the way forward for discussion but is considered a breakthrough because it will allow negotiators to move on to more substantive issues, including talks on a ceasefire, even as Taliban attacks on Afghan government forces have continued unabated.
""The procedure including its preamble of the negotiation has been finalised and from now on, the negotiation will begin on the agenda,"" Nader Nadery, a member of the Afghan government's negotiating team, told Reuters.
The Taliban spokesman confirmed the agreement on Twitter.
""A joint working committee was tasked to prepare the draft topics for the agenda (of peace talks),"" a joint statement from both sides said. 
The agreement comes after months of talks in Doha, the capital of Qatar, encouraged by the United States, despite the ongoing violence. 
A ceasefire remains the most urgent demand of international capitals and Kabul, even after the Taliban refused one during the preliminary stages of talks.
""(The agreement) is a step forward towards beginning the negotiations on the main issues, including a comprehensive ceasefire as the key demand of the Afghan people,"" Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's spokesman, Sediq Sediqqi, said on Twitter, quoting the Afghan leader.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated the two sides on ""perseverance and willingness to find common ground"", and added that the United States would ""work hard with all sides in pursuit of a serious reduction of violence and ceasefire"".
U.S. Special Representative for Afghan Reconciliation Zalmay Khalilzad said on Twitter that the two sides had agreed on a ""three-page agreement codifing rules and procedures for their negotiations on a political roadmap and a comprehensive ceasefire"". 
""This agreement demonstrates that the negotiating parties can agree on tough issues,"" Khalilzad said.
Key players including Qatar, who is hosting the talks, and neighbouring Pakistan, whose government and military have helped put pressure on the Taliban to bring them to the negotiating table, also welcomed the agreement which Doha called a ""milestone"".
The Taliban were ousted from power in 2001 by U.S.-led forces for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden, the architect of the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. A U.S.-backed government has held power in Afghanistan since then, although the Taliban have control over wide areas of the country.
TRUMP WANTS OUT
Under a February deal, foreign forces are to leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counter-terrorism guarantees from the Taliban.
U.S. President Donald Trump has looked to hasten the withdrawal, despite criticism, saying he wanted to see all American soldiers home by Christmas to end America's longest war.
The Trump administration has since announced that there would be a sharp drawdown by January, but at least 2,500 troops would remain beyond then.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday warned NATO against withdrawing troops prematurely and said it should ""ensure that we tie further troop reductions in Afghanistan to clear conditions"". 
""The biggest obstacle remaining is the current unacceptable level of violence: this must stop,"" the UK's mission in Kabul said on Twitter after the agreement.
The agreement was held up last month after the insurgents balked at the document because it mentioned the Afghan government by name. 
A European Union diplomat familiar with the process said both sides had kept some contentious issues aside to deal with separately. 
""Both sides also know that Western powers are losing patience and aid has been conditional... so both sides know they have to move forward to show some progress,” said the diplomat, requesting anonymity.

Last week, roughly $12 billion in aid was pledged by international capitals and institutions over four years for Afghanistan, but linked to annual reviews on progress in key areas such as the peace talks.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 02, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Venezuela opposition discussing scaling back interim government, sources say","By Brian Ellsworth and Mayela Armas
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition is discussing scaling back the interim government of opposition leader Juan Guaido that has won diplomatic recognition by dozens of countries that disavowed President Nicolas Maduro, nine legislators told Reuters.
Guaido, the leader of Venezuela's opposition-controlled parliament, in 2019 called Maduro a usurper following his disputed re-election and assumed a parallel presidency based on articles of the constitution that make the head of the National Assembly next in line to rule the country.
But the effort was unable to dislodge Maduro and Venezuela on Sunday will choose a new parliament in an election that most of the opposition is boycotting - meaning the terms of legislators currently in office will expire on Jan. 5.
Guaido's lawmaker allies have said they will continue to insist that they are legitimate parliamentarians after Jan. 5, arguing that their constitutional mandate remains intact because Sunday's vote is rigged.
Lawmakers agree that Guaido, who is not participating in the election, will by the same rationale remain interim president and head of parliament, lawmaker Freddy Guevara told Reuters.
But he added that parliament is discussing a reduction in the number of ambassadors who represent Guaido abroad, and said that some lawmakers want to trim down the legislature to a small group and cut back its day-to-day functions.
""We're in discussions about the interim government, the use of resources abroad, and there are different visions,"" said Guevara, head of the opposition Popular Will party. 
""Some believe we have to minimize it... there is a proposal to maintain strategic areas, and others say we need to create new things."" 
No firm decisions have been made and talks are ongoing, Guevara said.
Privately, some lawmakers have expressed concern that they could be arrested or have their homes raided by police if they try to claim a mandate after January. 
Similar government-backed moves have already forced dozens of legislators to leave the country over charges such as treason in judicial proceedings that diplomats and human rights group say lack due process.
""If you say you're a legislator you put yourself in the line of fire so that they can go after you,"" said one parliamentarian from a major opposition party, who asked not to be identified.
Maduro frequently accuses the legislators of stealing funds from offshore government accounts and seeking to destabilize his government.
Though Guaido does not control any state institutions in Venezuela, his interim government has named its allies to oversee the foreign assets of state oil company PDVSA, which include U.S.-based refining company Citgo.
The interim government was also given nominal control of $342 million in funds in U.S. accounts that were seized from Maduro's government by the U.S. government under its sanctions that are intended to put pressure on Maduro to leave. However, U.S. Treasury restrictions over the use of those funds has become a source of frustration in opposition circles.

Guaido since last year has named nearly 50 ambassadors to nations that have recognized his leadership. He also named an offshore attorney general, an ad hoc board of directors for PDVSA, and an ad hoc central bank board.

GENEVA (Reuters) - This year is on track to be the second hottest on record, behind 2016, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday.
Five data sets currently place 2020, a year characterised by heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and raging hurricanes, as the second warmest since records began in 1850. 
""2020 is very likely to be one of the three warmest years on record globally,"" the Geneva-based U.N. agency said in its State of the Global Climate in 2020 report. (Report: https:// Stoked by extreme heat, wildfires flared across Australia, Siberia and the United States this year, sending smoke plumes around the globe. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a speech at Columbia University in New York that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are to blame and policies have yet to rise to the challenge. ""To put it simply the state of the planet is broken,"" Guterres said. ""Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal,"" he said. A less visible sign of change was a surge in marine heat to record levels, with more than 80% of the global ocean experiencing a marine heatwave, the WMO said. ""2020 has, unfortunately, been yet another extraordinary year for our climate,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, urging more efforts to curb the emissions.  Greenhouse gas concentrations climbed to a new record in 2019 and have risen so far this year despite an expected drop in emissions due to COVID-19 lockdowns, the WMO said last month. The latest WMO report said the global mean temperature was around 1.2 degrees Celsius above the 1850-1900 baseline between January and October this year, placing it second behind 2016 and marginally ahead of 2019. Hot years have typically been associated with El Niño, a natural event that releases heat from the Pacific Ocean. However, this year coincides with La Niña which has the opposite effect and cools temperatures. The WMO will confirm the data in March 2021. A climate pact agreed in Paris five years ago compels countries to make efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, above which scientists warn of catastrophic climate change. While it is not the same as crossing that long-term warming threshold, the WMO says there is at least a one in five chance of temperatures temporarily, on an annual basis, exceeding that level by 2024. Guterres said that last year natural disasters related to climate change cost the world $150 billion, and that air and water pollution are killing 9 million people annually. He urged world leaders to align global finance behind the Paris pact, to commit to reaching net zero emissions, and to fund efforts to adapt to climate change.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel received its most advanced warship on Wednesday, describing the German-made vessel dubbed ""Shield"" as a bulwark for vulnerable Mediterranean gas rigs as tensions with Tehran soar over the assassination of a top Iranian nuclear scientist.
The Saar-6 corvette that docked in Haifa port, and three of the same model to follow next year, will bring to 15 the number of missile boats deployed by an Israeli navy which, while small, carries out missions as far away as the Red Sea and the Gulf. 
Israel also wants to protect off-shore natural gas fields close to Lebanon, an old foe with which it has held so far fruitless U.S.-mediated maritime border talks. 
""The welcome discovery of the gas fields off Israel's shore made it necessary to create a plan that will provide a protective envelope,"" Israeli President Reuven Rivlin said at ceremony at the port.
The navy sees a threat to the gas rigs from Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas, especially after Tehran vowed to retaliate for Friday's killing of nuclear mastermind Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, which it blamed on Israel.
""The Iranians are looking for 'prestige' targets like these, that can be hit with low casualties, meaning - they may hope - less chance of escalation,"" an Israeli security official told Reuters. ""The question is whether Hezbollah would strike now.""
Though Hezbollah has previously threatened the gas rigs, it said responding to Fakhrizadeh's death was in Iran's hands. Beirut has urged ""all parties"" to show restraint.
Israel has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the assassination, which came as the region weighs Iran's changing fortunes with next month's U.S. presidential handover from Donald Trump to the more diplomacy-minded Joe Biden.
The Fakhrizadeh hit may have been ""timed to narrow the risk of a significant Iranian offensive response in the near term, given the fears in Tehran of a severe offensive overreaction on the part of the Trump administration, and an Iranian desire to facilitate the resumption of contact with the Biden administration,"" wrote Amos Yadlin and Assaf Orion of Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies.
Unlike earlier models of Israeli missile boats, the Saar-6 will be fitted with both electronic countermeasures for cruise missiles, which have a flat trajectory, and a maritime version of the Iron Dome system for shooting down high-angle rockets.

These, a senior naval officer said, are precautions against Soviet-designed Yakhont cruise missiles and Iranian-made Khalij Fars rockets that Israel believes are in Hezbollah's arsenal.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh has begun preparations to move thousands of Rohingya refugees to a remote island off its coast, officials said on Wednesday, despite opposition from many refugees and human rights groups who have termed it an ""island detention center"".
Bangladesh says transporting refugees to Bhasan Char – a Bay of Bengal island hours from the mainland by boat – will ease chronic overcrowding in its camps at Cox’s Bazar, which are home to more than 1 million Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority who have fled neighboring Myanmar.
Humanitarian and human rights groups have urged a halt to the move, saying the island, which emerged from the sea 20 years ago and has never been inhabited, is flood prone and vulnerable to frequent cyclones, while the government has not allowed the United Nations to carry out a safety assessment.
A senior local official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters in a message ""many families"" had been moved out of the camps as of Wednesday night, but declined to state a number.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar in 2017 following a military-led crackdown that the U.N has said was executed with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies genocide and says its forces were targeting Rohingya militants who attacked police posts.
A briefing note by an international humanitarian organization seen by Reuters said hundreds of refugees identified by officials as willing to go to the island were taken to a transit center on Wednesday, with some offered incentives including cash payments.
Mohammed Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said housing had been built for 100,000 people and authorities want to relocate them during the November to April dry season when the sea is calm. 
""We will not force anyone to go there,"" he said by phone, but did not comment on whether incentives had been offered.
The U.N said in a statement it had been given ""limited information"" about the relocations and was not involved in preparations. 
Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman, told Reuters the government had not given the U.N permission to carry out technical assessments or to visit refugees already held there.
More than 300 refugees were brought to the island earlier this year after an attempt to flee Bangladesh for Malaysia by boat failed and they were stranded at sea for months. They have said they were being held against their will and complained of human rights violations, some resorting to hunger strikes, according to rights groups.
""Rohingya in the camps in Cox’s Bazar face many issues and problems, and the camps are overcrowded and imperfect, but moving people to an isolated island where they have no protection or support from international humanitarian agencies or freedom of movement is not the answer,"" said Ismail Wolff, regional director of the nonprofit rights organization Fortify Rights. 
""At present, it’s an island detention center.""

The government said on its website it was cancelling restrictions on holding protests and strikes, as well as relaxing a special regulatory regime governing entry to and exit from the country. 
It also lifted restrictions on local media publications that had been only been allowed to publish official government information when reporting on the army and military activity. 
The Karabakh conflict, which erupted on Sept. 27 came to a halt on Nov. 10 when a Russian-brokered peace deal ushered in a ceasefire. Swaths of territory in Nagorno-Karabakh previously controlled by ethnic Armenians were handed over to Azerbaijan, whose forces had recaptured some areas which Baku lost in an earlier war in the 1990s.

At least 15 of those executed had been sentenced to death in cases related to political violence following what Amnesty called unfair trials, the London-based human rights group said in a report.
""The Egyptian authorities have embarked on a horrifying execution spree in recent months, putting scores of people to death, in some cases following grossly unfair mass trials,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Research and Advocacy Director.
The state press centre and the Interior Ministry could not be reached for comment on the Amnesty report.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said there are no political prisoners in Egypt and that stability and security are paramount.
Egyptian courts have sentenced some 3,000 people to death since 2014, when Sisi took power, according to the Arab Network for Human Rights Information, an independent organization that documents human rights violations in the Middle East and North Africa. 
That compares with fewer than 800 death sentences in the previous six years, according to Amnesty International.

GAZA (Reuters) - The United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees paid the salaries of 30,000 Palestinian staff across the Middle East for last month, but a funding shortfall may still hinder payment in December, officials said on Wednesday.
UNRWA finds itself in limbo after the U.S. election - President Donald Trump ended all U.S. payments, but while Palestinians hope President-elect Joe Biden's administration will at least partially resume payments, that could take months.
The agency said last month it had run out of money to pay salaries after two years of funding cuts by the United States and other donors, including Arab Gulf states.
Adnan Abu Hasna, an UNRWA spokesman in Gaza, said the November salary payments were made possible only by a $20 million loan from the United Nations, $12 million in new pledges and an advance from Sweden on its 2021 contribution.
""The payment of December remains uncertain and we are in need of $38 million to pay the salaries of our 30,000 staff,"" Abu Hasna told Reuters.
UNRWA provides education, health and relief services to around 5.7 million registered Palestinian refugees, including those in Gaza and the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Also on Wednesday, Israel handed over a backlog of billions of shekels in tax money to the Palestinian Authority. The taxes, managed by Israel under interim peace accords from the 1990s and usually handed over monthly, make up more than half of the PA's budget.
The 3.77 billion shekels ($1.14 billion) transfer is the first since June, when the Palestinians snubbed the handover due to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans, currently suspended, to annex parts of the West Bank. 
The PA has been unable to pay full wages of its 130,000 employees in the past months. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said this week it would pay full salaries once it received the tax money.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's constitutional court unanimously ruled in favour of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Wednesday in a conflict-of-interest case brought by opposition politicians.
Prayuth was accused of a conflict of interest because he remained in military housing despite his retirement from the army in 2014, months after overthrowing an elected government. Prayuth has said he needed to stay there for security reasons.
The court said the former army chief's stay in the residence was in line with the army's rules, and the safety of the prime minister and his family was the government's priority. 
The not guilty verdict for Prayuth means that he can stay in power. 
""The plaintiff did not commit acts that constituted conflicts of interest. He did not seek personal gains, whether directly or indirectly, nor breach ethics,"" a judge said. ""His ministerial post therefore does not end according to the constitution."" 
The court's decision comes with tension high after months of protests to demand Prayuth's removal - a call he has rejected. 
Prayuth had said he would respect the court's decision even if it ruled against him. He could not be reached for comment afterwards.
Hours before the verdict, he told a supporter while on a trip outside Bangkok: ""It's about destiny. Everything has been pre-destined. I'm not too worried. I believe in my own goodness."" 
Protesters and other critics accuse Prayuth of engineering an election last year to keep hold of power. He says the vote was fair. 
A protest movement that began in July to seek Prayuth's removal and to call for a new constitution has also broken taboos by also demanding reforms to the monarchy to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn. 
""The fight is not over. When he can do no wrong, this country is headed to a breaking point,"" said protest group Free Youth in a tweet following the verdict. 
Later on Wednesday, thousands of protesters gathered at one of Bangkok's busiest intersections to criticise the court ruling. 
They sang the national anthem while showing the three-finger salute they have adopted from the movie ""The Hunger Games"". 

Many clapped and cheered as one protester impersonated Prayuth on a stage set up to look like a court room. ""The court verdict shows that this country no longer has rule of law. If there is no justice, don't ask for peace,"" the protester said.

Prosecutors have said the suspect, a 51-year-old local, had drunk a significant amount of alcohol before racing through the city centre for about 1 kilometre and driving into pedestrians in what authorities said was a deliberate act. 
Locals, many crying and holding hands, gathered at the city's landmark Roman gate, Porta Nigra, to place floral tributes, candles and hand-written messages. 
""The pain of the mother who lost her child and her husband takes my voice away,"" said Malu Dreyer, premier of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, her voice breaking.
""There will never again be the laughter of the father and the child. Others who have to mourn dead feel the same way... they will have to carry this burden for the rest of their lives,"" she said.
The suspect was on Wednesday due to see a judge who would decide whether he was mentally fit to be criminally liable or whether he would need psychiatric treatment. The authorities have said there is no indication the man, overpowered by police, had a political or religious motive. 

""Trier is mourning, Trier is suffering,"" said mayor Wolfram Leibe, wiping a tear from his eye.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - More than 20 armed robbers stormed a bank in a small Brazilian town on Wednesday, taking hostages, exchanging gunfire with police in the streets and killing one person before fleeing in a convoy of vehicles.
The attack, in the early hours of the morning in the northern river port of Cametá, was the second such heist in as many days in Brazil, marking an escalation in the scale, organization and aggression of bank robberies. 
The attack on Wednesday saw the group of men, armed with high-caliber weapons, storm a Banco do Brasil bank, the Para state security ministry said.
Images on social media showed a firefight in the streets of the town. The robbers killed one hostage during the heist, the ministry added, while another local resident was shot in the leg and is in a stable condition in hospital.
""We pray to God to comfort the family of the young man who lost his life,"" Cametá Mayor Waldoli Valente wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The security ministry said it had found one abandoned getaway vehicle outside the town with explosives inside. The town was now calm, it added, with police reinforcements arriving by plane and boat.
It was not immediately clear how many hostages had been taken or if they were all freed. Authorities also did not say how much money was stolen from the bank.
Brazil has a long history of bank heists, and major lenders have struggled with a wave of violent robberies in recent years.
The Cametá attack came a day after a similar heist in the southern city of Criciúma.
Bank robbers there blasted explosives and fired high-caliber weapons at police, in a heist that injured two people and left reams of cash in the streets to be pocketed by locals.
Murders in Brazil have fallen sharply since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in 2019, but have started to rise again. There were 32,298 murders in the first nine months of this year, up 4% from the same period last year, according to a tally by news website G1.

GAZA (Reuters) - It's not going to be a very merry Christmas this year for a handicraft workshop in Islamist-run Gaza that has been an unlikely source of gifts for the holiday.
Coronavirus lockdowns have made it difficult for the Zeina Cooperative Association to export its hand-crafted Christmas gifts from Gaza to Europe and to the Palestinian town of Bethlehem in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
About 24 Palestinian Muslim women, many of them veiled, work at the facility, making miniature Christmas trees, red-and-white puppets and Santa Claus marionettes.
But sales are down by half after a holiday boom a year ago, scuppering expansion plans and changing business strategy.
""We have turned from an international market to a local market,"" said Haneen Alsammak, executive manager of the cooperative, which aims to empower women in the Gaza Strip.
In addition to Christmas-themed toys and puppets, it also offers gifts to match Muslim holidays. Some of its puppets are used for educating children about the pandemic and to promote non-violence in the community.
""We have tried to make changes to some of our products to adjust to the current situation we are living amid the coronavirus (outbreak),"" she added.
But with sales down, ""the girls come in once every two days"", said Laila Tayeh, a product designer.
Gaza has logged nearly 22,000 coronavirus cases and 118 deaths, mostly since August, amid concern of a wider outbreak in the densely populated enclave of 2 million people, many of them poor.
Some 1,000 Christians, mostly Greek Orthodox who celebrate Christmas in January, live in Gaza, which is run by the Islamist Hamas movement.

He said the centre, being built following the worst fighting in decades between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces, would be operating ""very shortly"".
Azerbaijan and Armenia last month signed a Russia-brokered ceasefire for the enclave, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but mainly populated by ethnic Armenians.
Russian peacekeepers were deployed to the region under the deal, which froze Azeri gains in six weeks of fighting.
Turkey has no peacekeepers in the region but said it had finalised an agreement with Russia on setting up the joint centre to monitor the ceasefire.
""An agreement was reached. There is no written obstacle to the formation of our joint observation centre there. Now, its construction is under way. Our colleagues will begin working there very shortly,"" Akar said.
Turkey backs Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, and has criticised the co-chairs of the OSCE's so-called Minsk Group for not resolving the long-running conflict in decades of mediation. The Minsk Group is led by the United States, France and Russia.

France, whose population includes from 400,000 to 600,000 people of Armenian origin, has said it wants international supervision of the ceasefire.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Chinese social media platform WeChat blocked a message by Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison amid a dispute between Canberra and Beijing over the doctored tweeted image of an Australian soldier.
China rebuffed Morrison's calls for an apology after its foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian posted the picture of an Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to the throat of an Afghan child on Monday.
The United States called China's use of the digitally manipulated image a ""new low"" in disinformation.
Morrison took to WeChat on Tuesday to criticise the ""false image"", while offering praise to Australia's Chinese community.
In his message, Morrison defended Australia's handling of a war crimes investigation into the actions of special forces in Afghanistan, and said Australia would deal with ""thorny issues"" in a transparent manner.
But that message appeared to be blocked by Wednesday evening, with a note appearing from the ""Weixin Official Accounts Platform Operation Center"" saying the content was unable to be viewed because it violated regulations, including distorting historical events and confusing the public.
Tencent, the parent company of WeChat, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Australian special forces allegedly killed 39 unarmed prisoners and civilians in Afghanistan, with senior commandos reportedly forcing junior soldiers to kill defenceless captives in order to ""blood"" them for combat, a four-year investigation found.
Australia said last week that 19 current and former soldiers would be referred for potential criminal prosecution.
China's embassy has said the ""rage and roar"" from Australian politicians and media over the soldier image was an overreaction.
'HYPOCRISY IS OBVIOUS TO ALL'
Australia was seeking to ""deflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers"", it said.
Other nations, including the United States, New Zealand and France - and the self-ruled island of Taiwan which China claims as its own - have expressed concern at the Chinese foreign ministry's use of the manipulated image on an official Twitter account.
""The CCP's latest attack on Australia is another example of its unchecked use of disinformation and coercive diplomacy. Its hypocrisy is obvious to all,"" the U.S. State Department said on Wednesday, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. 
State Department deputy spokesman Cale Brown said the fabricated image of the soldier was ""a new low, even for the Chinese Communist Party"".
""As the CCP spreads disinformation, it covers up its horrendous human rights abuses, including the detention of more than a million Muslims in Xinjiang,"" Brown wrote in a tweet.
France's foreign affairs spokesman said on Tuesday the tweeted image was ""especially shocking"" and the comments by Zhao ""insulting for all countries whose armed forces are currently engaged in Afghanistan"".
China's embassy in Paris hit back on Wednesday, saying the soldier image was a caricature by a painter, adding that France has previously loudly defended the right to caricature.
WeChat has 690,000 active daily users in Australia, and in September told an Australian government inquiry it would prevent foreign interference in Australian public debate through its platform.
Morrison's message had been read by 57,000 WeChat users by Wednesday.
Zhao's tweet, pinned to the top of his Twitter account, had been ""liked"" by 60,000 followers, after Twitter labelled it as sensitive content but declined Canberra's request to remove the image.
Twitter is blocked in China, but has been used by Chinese diplomats.
China on Friday imposed dumping tariffs of up to 200% on Australian wine imports, effectively shutting off the largest export market for the Australian wine industry.

A group of parliamentarians from 19 countries that has lobbied against China's actions in Hong Kong, where it has cracked down on dissent, and in the farwestern region of Xinjiang campaigned on social media for the public to drink Australian wine.
