The Southeast Asian country has suffered some of the biggest tropical forest fires outside the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Congo in recent years, putting at risk endangered animals like orangutans and tigers and sending choking haze across the region.
""Ninety-nine percent of forest fires are perpetrated by humans, whether intentional or out of negligence,"" Jokowi, as the president is widely know, said in a virtual meeting with officials. 
Farmers often used fire as a cheap land clearing method, the president said, calling on local governments to get forest fire containment infrastructure ready.
Jokowi said Sumatra is facing a rising risk of forest fires this month and warned that the Kalimantan region on Borneo island, as well as Sulawesi island, could also start seeing forest fires in May to July, with the peak expected in the August to September period.
The president said the fires could cause considerable financial losses and ""not to mention the damage to our ecology and ecosystem."" 
Fires, sometimes set to clear land for palm oil plantations in the world’s top producer of the commodity, were the most damaging in years in 2015, with the World Bank estimating they caused $16.1 billion of damage.
Meanwhile, fires in 2019 caused total damage and economic loss amounting to at least $5.2 billion, equal to 0.5% of gross domestic product, the World Bank said. (https://reut.rs/3qJCnwH)
State news agency Antara, citing a meteorology official, reported that number of hot spots in Riau province on Sumatra island has jumped to 63 as of Monday, from nine a day earlier.

1,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 22, 2021 04:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Indonesian plan calls for Southeast Asia to hold Myanmar junta to election pledge,"By Tom Allard
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia is pushing Southeast Asian neighbours to agree on an action plan over Myanmar's coup that would keep the junta to its promise of holding elections, with monitors to ensure they are fair and inclusive, three sources familiar with the move said.
The proposal from the biggest regional nation falls short of the public demands of protesters and some Western countries for the immediate release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the recognition of the Nov. 8 ballot her party won in a landslide.
Two senior officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters a diplomatically-led solution had to focus on preventing bloodshed and helping the military to honour its commitment to hold a new election and hand power to the winner.
Protesters have scorned the junta's promise of a new election, saying it should recognise the one held last year. The army staged the coup after the electoral commission rejected its accusations of fraud in the November poll.
But the junta has not given a timetable for a fresh vote.
The U.N Security Council, China, the European Union and the United States, among others, have urged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) regional grouping to help mediate in the crisis. 
The Indonesian plan also calls for ASEAN to facilitate dialogue between the junta and protesters, according to the two officials, and a third source familiar with it.
An Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman declined to comment on the proposal, saying Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi ""will make an announcement after she has completed her consultations with other ASEAN foreign ministers"".
Retno has been travelling across Southeast Asia to rally support among ASEAN's disparate membership for a special summit of foreign ministers on the Myanmar crisis.
Indonesia's proposal has strong support from several ASEAN countries, but the diplomatic effort underway is challenging, the three sources said. 
ASEAN is governed by consensus decision-making.
Its members range in diversity from Indonesia, the world's third biggest democracy, to communist one-party states Vietnam and Laos and one of the world's last absolute monarchies, Brunei. Myanmar is also a member, as are Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. 
One of the senior officials said denouncing the coup was easy but concrete progress depended on engaging with the secretive military, a task ASEAN was best placed to execute, given its regional standing and relationships.
""This is our family so our approach will be different,"" the official added.
The two senior officials, and a regional diplomat, told Reuters that some ASEAN countries and Indo-Pacific nations were involved in ""back channel"" talks with some of the junta, urging compromise and no repeat of past bloody crackdowns on dissent.
""The message we want to send to Myanmar is you are facing a different situation to the past,"" the senior official said.
But persuading Myanmar to participate in the proposed ASEAN special summit was proving difficult, the two senior officials said. Initially, it rejected an invitation from ASEAN chair Brunei, saying the coup could be discussed at a scheduled meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers in August.
Myanmar's government spokesman and foreign minister did not respond to requests from Reuters for comment.
One possible compromise was to hold the summit at the ASEAN secretariat in Jakarta and not explicitly say it was about Myanmar, the two officials said.
It was crucial for ASEAN to act strongly on Myanmar, said
Dewi Fortuna Anwar, a foreign policy analyst based in Jakarta.

""If ASEAN does nothing, it will lose credibility,"" she said. ""Its claims to centrality in the Indo-Pacific will be shot down.""

The cargo plane scattered mostly small metal parts over the southern Dutch town of Meerssen on Saturday afternoon, causing damage to cars and lightly injuring one woman, local media said.
""Our investigation is still in a preliminary phase, it is too early to draw conclusions,"" a spokeswoman for the Dutch Safety Board said on Monday.
Witnesses said they saw fire in one of the engines of the plane, which landed safely at Liege airport in Belgium, some 30 kilometres (19 miles) south of Maastricht.
Boeing said on Sunday that it was recommending airlines halt flights of 777 airplanes, after a United Airlines plane of that type scattered debris over Denver in the United States at the weekend after its right engine failed.

    Addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, Guterres said the danger of hate-driven groups was growing daily. 
    ""White supremacy and neo-Nazi movements are more than domestic terror threats. They are becoming a transnational threat,"" he told the Geneva forum. Without naming states, Guterres added: ""Today, these extremist movements represent the number one internal security threat in several countries.""  
    In the United States, racial tensions simmered during the turbulent four-year presidency of Donald Trump. His successor Joe Biden has said the Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters was carried out by ""thugs, insurrectionists, political extremists and white supremacists"".
    ""Far too often, these hate groups are cheered on by people in positions of responsibility in ways that were considered unimaginable not long ago,"" Guterres said. ""We need global coordinated action to defeat this grave and growing danger.""
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet is to report to the council on March 18 on systemic racism against people of African descent. The global inquiry was launched after George Floyd died in Minneapolis last May when a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
    Guterres also accused authorities in some countries of using the COVID-19 pandemic to deploy ""heavy-handed security responses and emergency measures to crush dissent"".
    ""At times, access to life-saving COVID-19 information has been concealed - while deadly misinformation has been amplified - including by those in power,"" he said.
    Guterres warned about the power of digital platforms and the use and abuse of data. 

    ""I urge all Member States to place human rights at the centre of regulatory frameworks and legislation on the development and use of digital technologies,"" he said. ""We need a safe, equitable and open digital future that does not infringe on privacy or dignity.""

Sinovac is the first COVID-19 vaccine to be introduced in Hong Kong, ahead of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine set to arrive in the Chinese special administrative region before the end of February.
The city's vaccine rollout has lagged other developed cities and is far behind mainland China which started last July.
Lam, dressed in a white t-shirt, was filmed receiving the first vaccine in a centre set up at Hong Kong's central library. Her cabinet ministers including Health Secretary Sophia Chan and Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung lined up to get vaccinated after her.
Lam appealed to all residents to take the vaccine during a press briefing following her vaccination.
""This requires the full collaboration of the people of Hong Kong to help Hong Kong's society to recover as soon as possible.""
Health Secretary Chan told Reuters the government was trying to reassure residents worried about taking Sinovac, stating that standards had not been lowered to accept the vaccine and that there was no pressure from Beijing to get it approved.
One million doses of the Sinovac vaccine arrived from Beijing in the former British colony on Friday. Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents can get vaccinated from Feb 26 after applying online.
Residents will be allowed to choose the type of vaccine, the government said.
Anti-mainland sentiment has increased in Hong Kong since 2019 when protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against what they see as Beijing's strengthening hold over the territory.
A January survey by the University of Hong Kong found that fewer than 30% of people questioned said they would accept the Sinovac vaccine. 

Hong Kong has secured a total of 22.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE), Sinovac and AstraZenca. The city has recorded around 10,800 cases since last January and 197 deaths.

The agency said it understood some passengers had died, with fatalities rising over the weekend on a boat it said had left the coastal district of Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh about 10 days ago and had experienced engine failure. 
""In the absence of precise information as to the refugees' location, we have alerted the authorities of the relevant maritime states of these reports and appealed for their swift assistance,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a statement. 
""Immediate action is needed to save lives and prevent further tragedy,"" it said, offering to support governments by providing humanitarian help and quarantine measures to those rescued. 
A senior Indian Coast Guard official told Reuters the boat has been tracked and was reported to be safe but did not yet know the condition of those aboard. 
The Rohingyas are a Muslim minority that has suffered persecution in Buddhist-majority Myanmar and many have fled in rickety boats, encountering often perilous journeys in the hope of reaching Malaysia and Indonesia. 
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled a deadly crackdown by Myanmar's security forces in 2017 and poured into neighbouring Bangladesh, where about a million live in poor conditions in sprawling refugee camps, unable to work or leave without government permission.

Late-stage trial data of Sinovac's vaccine showed it had a lower efficacy when used for healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 compared with healthy individuals age 18-59, said FDA chief Rolando Enrique Domingo.
The Philippines has about 1.4 million health workers. 
""According to our experts, (Sinovac's) vaccine is not the best vaccine for them,"" Domingo said in a briefing, referring to health workers. 
He cited results of clinical trials of Sinovac's CoronaVac in Brazil, Turkey and Indonesia. 
CoronaVac is the third candidate to get emergency approval for use in the Southeast Asian nation of over 108 million.
That clears the way for the delivery of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccines that China has agreed to donate, which were due to arrive on Tuesday but had been delayed because of the absence of the authorisation.
The Philippines, which has the second highest of coronavirus infections and deaths in Southeast Asia, has yet to begin its immunisation campaign.
It was banking on 117,000 Pfizer-BioNTech shots secured through the international vaccine sharing facility COVAX to kick off its vaccine programme. 
However, the unresolved question of who would pay for claims for damages in the event of adverse effects from the inoculations has delayed the delivery. 
A bill is pending in Congress that seeks to grant indemnity to coronavirus vaccine makers.

""We ask for your patience because the vaccines were delayed by a few days, but we can finally begin the vaccination,"" Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said in a separate briefing.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2021 11:45PM ET</span>",Strike threat by South Korean doctors fans fears of vaccine rollout disruption,"By Sangmi Cha and Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - Doctors in South Korea have threatened a protest strike against legislation to strip them of licences following criminal convictions, sparking fears about possible disruption of a coronavirus vaccination effort set to begin this week. 
Healthcare workers are scheduled to receive the first batch of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine from Friday, as South Korea looks to protect 10 million high-risk people by July, on its way to reaching herd immunity by November. 
But over the weekend, the Korean Medical Association (KMA), the largest grouping of doctors, said it would go on strike if parliament passed the bill to revoke the licences of doctors getting jail terms.
""The bill might result in ordinary, innocent doctors being stripped of their licences and falling into hell because of an accident that has nothing to do with their job, or lack of legal knowledge,"" spokesman Kim Dae-ha said in a statement on Monday.
Association president Choi Dae-zip has called the bill ""cruel"", saying its passage into law would ""destroy"" current cooperation with the government to treat the virus and carry out the vaccine campaign.
No date has been set yet for the strike, the KMA told Reuters, however.
The standoff stoked concern that any strike of doctors could slow the rollout at a time when authorities are scrambling to allocate medical personnel to about 250 inoculation centres and 10,000 clinics nationwide.
Discord over the bill was undesirable ahead of the vaccine rollout, the health ministry said, adding that the doctors' association was in the grip of a ""misunderstanding"" about it.
Parliament has been seeking to revise the Medical Service Act to ban physicians guilty of violent crimes, such as sexual abuse and murder, from practicing their skills. 
Ruling party lawmakers pushing for the bill denounced the association, saying it was trying to ""take public health hostage to maintain impunity from heinous crimes"". 
The group of nearly 140,000 has a long history of medical policy disputes with the government.
Many hospitals were depleted of staff during the pandemic last year when it steered weeks-long walkouts over plans to boost the number of medical students, build medical schools, ease insurance coverage and increase telemedicine options.
That action spurred hundreds of thousands of Koreans to file presidential petitions urging punishment for the doctors, as polls showed 58% of respondents opposed the strike. There are no surveys yet on the latest stalemate. 
Last week, a government poll showed almost 94% of 367,000 healthcare workers aged 64 or younger in priority groups said they were ready to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, despite concerns over its efficacy in older people. About 95% said they would accept  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) products. 
South Korea reported 332 new virus infections by Sunday, taking its tally to 87,324, and a death toll of 1,562.

10,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2021 10:28PM ET</span>",China calls for reset in Sino-U.S. relations,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said on Monday the United States and China could work together on issues like climate change and the coronavirus pandemic if they repaired their damaged bilateral relationship. 
Wang, a Chinese state councillor and foreign minister, said Beijing stood ready to reopen constructive dialogue with Washington after relations between the two countries sank to their lowest in decades under former president Donald Trump.
Wang called on Washington to remove tariffs on Chinese goods and abandon what he said was an irrational suppression of the Chinese tech sector, steps he said would create the ""necessary conditions"" for cooperation.
Before Wang spoke at a forum sponsored by the foreign ministry, officials played footage of the ""ping-pong diplomacy"" of 1972 when an exchange of table tennis players cleared the way for then U.S. President Richard Nixon to visit China.
Wang urged Washington to respect China's core interests, stop ""smearing"" the ruling Communist Party, stop interfering in Beijing's internal affairs and stop ""conniving"" with separatist forces for Taiwan's independence. 
""Over the past few years, the United States basically cut off bilateral dialogue at all levels,"" Wang said in prepared remarks translated into English. 
""We stand ready to have candid communication with the U.S. side, and engage in dialogues aimed at solving problems."" 
Wang pointed to a recent call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden as a positive step.
Washington and Beijing have clashed on multiple fronts including trade, accusations of human rights crimes against the Uighur Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang region and Beijing's territorial claims in the resources-rich South China Sea. 
The Biden administration has, however, signalled it will maintain pressure on Beijing. Biden has voiced concern about Beijing's ""coercive and unfair"" trade practices and endorsed of a Trump administration determination that China has committed genocide in Xinjiang.

However, Biden has also pledged to take a more multilateral approach and is keen to cooperate with Beijing on issues like climate change and persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia will quickly deliver the result of a planned independent inquiry into parliament's workplace culture, the government said on Monday, as pressure grows after a newspaper published a third accusation of rape.
Two female employees of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's Liberal party said last week they had been raped by the same man in 2019 and 2020.
Both have yet to make a formal police complaint, but Brittany Higgins, who has spoken publicly about her alleged rape, said last week that she would do so, though it is unclear if she has lodged one with police.
Finance Minister Simon Birmingham, who is leading an internal inquiry into workplace culture, said he wanted an investigation that is to be set up next week to be impartial.
""I want complete independence,"" he told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio. ""I want people to have full confidence that this enquiry is genuinely an independent (one).""
The complaint process is expected to be a central element of the investigation, he said, adding, ""This is not something that I expect to drag on for weeks.""
Fuelling pressure on Morrison, the Australian newspaper published on Monday the account of a third woman, who said she had also been raped by the unnamed former Liberal party worker on the night of June 29 and the morning of June 30 in 2016.
""I believe his actions constitute sexual assault, because he performed or tried to perform sexual acts on me while I was severely intoxicated and unable to provide valid and informed consent,"" the unidentified woman told the paper.
The incident happened outside parliament, she added.
Already dogged by accusations of improper behaviour towards women, Morrison's Liberals face a barrage of criticism about the way it handled Higgins' internal complaint to Linda Reynolds, who is now defence minister. 
Higgins has said she felt pressure not to proceed with a formal complaint for fear of losing her job.
Reynolds last week apologised to Higgins but denied that she or her staff pressured her not to pursue a police complaint.

Morrison said he only learnt of the alleged complaints last week, and has sought to placate public anger with an inquiry.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States faces a dark milestone this week despite a recent decline in COVID-19 cases as it prepares to mark a staggering half-million deaths, with President Joe Biden planning to memorialize the lives lost.
While the number of COVID-19 cases fell for the fifth straight week and officials scrambled to inoculate the population, the nation was poised to reach 500,000 deaths from the highly infectious respiratory disease. 
(Graphic: Where coronavirus cases are rising and falling in the United States - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/USA-TRENDS/dgkvlgkrkpb/index.html)
It has been nearly a year since the pandemic upended the country with dueling public health and economic crises.
""It's nothing like we've ever been through in the last 102 years since the 1918 influenza pandemic. ... It really is a terrible situation that we've been through - and that we're still going through,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, White House COVID-19 medical adviser and the nation's top infectious disease official, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" program on Sunday. 
The White House said on Sunday it planned a memorial event in which Biden would deliver remarks.
A White House spokesman said the president along with first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff would hold a moment of silence on Monday and there would be a candle-lighting ceremony at sundown. 
Biden last month observed America's COVID-19 deaths on the eve of his inauguration with a sundown ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial's Reflecting Pool (NASDAQ:POOL). 
Biden will use ""his own voice and platform to take a moment to remember the people whose lives have been lost, the families who are still suffering ... at what is still a very difficult moment in this country,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday. 
STILL AT 'VERY HIGH' LEVEL
More than 28 million COVID-19 cases have rocked the United States and 497,862 have died, even as daily average deaths and hospitalizations have fallen to the lowest levels since before the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. The virus took a full year off the average life expectancy in the United States, the biggest decline since World War Two. 
While the decline ""is really terrific ... we are still at a level that's very high,"" Fauci said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" program. ""We want to get that baseline really, really, really low before we start thinking that we're out of the woods."" 
Fauci told CNN that Americans may still need masks in 2022 even as other measures to stop the virus' spread become increasingly relaxed and more vaccines are administered, and they may also need a booster shot depending on how variants emerge. 
Less than 15% of the U.S. population has received at least one vaccine dose, with nearly 43 million getting at least one shot and nearly 18 million getting a second shot, U.S. statistics show.
More localities are easing some restrictions, such as on indoor dining, and moving to reopen schools even as millions await their shots, sparking debate over the safety of teachers, students and others.

Financial pressures also continue to weigh even as economists express optimism for the year ahead. Congress is weighing Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, with the House of Representatives expected to vote on it this week and the Senate seeking to pass it before March 14.

At 12:51 p.m. on Feb. 22, 2011, the 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck close to Christchurch city at a depth of 5 km. Although not as strong as a magnitude 7.1 quake which hit the area less than six months earlier, its shallow depth and proximity to the city centre resulted in widespread damage. 
Hundreds of people gathered at a memorial wall in Christchurch observed a minute's silence and flags flew at half-mast.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was time to look ahead with hope for the future of New Zealand's second-largest city.
""It’s been a hugely difficult decade for this city - at times I’m sure it’s felt impossible,"" Ardern said in a speech at the memorial.
""But as we look ahead to the coming decade, I see hope and energy and optimism, and I see Christchurch taking its rightful place amongst New Zealand’s best and brightest cities.""
About 87 people who died in the quake were foreign nationals from countries including Australia, China, Japan and the United States. 
The earthquake damaged thousands of buildings and homes in Christchurch, forcing the government to embark on reconstruction projects that continue a decade later. 
Several buildings in the city centre remain empty, and some residents are still embroiled in legal disputes over insurance payouts. 

The city was also the target of a terrorist attack in March 2019, in which a white supremacist killed 51 Muslim worshippers and injured dozens of others in a mass shooting in two mosques.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Sunday it had struck a deal with Iran to cushion the blow of steps Tehran plans to take this week that include ending snap inspections, with both sides agreeing to keep ""necessary"" monitoring for up to three months.
The announcement by International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi, made at Vienna airport after a weekend trip to Iran, confirmed that Tehran would go ahead with its plan to slash cooperation with the agency on Tuesday.
Iran has been gradually breaching terms of a 2015 nuclear pact with world powers since the United States, under former President Donald Trump, withdrew in 2018 and reimposed sanctions. The pact aims to keep Iran at arm's length from being able to make nuclear arms, which Tehran says it has never wanted to build.
U.S. President Joe Biden has said he is ready to talk about both nations returning to the accord, although the two sides have been at odds about who makes the first step.
A key part of the Iran's plan for reducing cooperation this week is ending implementation of the Additional Protocol, under which the IAEA has the right to carry out snap inspections in member states at sites not declared to the agency. Iran had agreed to implement the protocol under the 2015 nuclear deal.
""This law exists. This law is going to be applied, which means that the Additional Protocol, much to my regret, is going to be suspended,"" Grossi told the airport news conference.
Before he spoke, the IAEA and Iran issued a joint statement saying Tehran would continue implementing the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, its core obligations to the agency that allow for monitoring of its declared nuclear facilities.
The IAEA will also continue ""necessary verification and monitoring activities for up to three months"", the statement said, without specifying what those activities are.
Grossi said the steps that Iran would take this week would be ""to a certain extent mitigated"" by the terms of this new, temporary agreement.

""What we agreed is something that is viable, it's useful to bridge this gap that we are having, salvages the situation now. But of course for a stable, sustainable situation there will have to be a political negotiation that is not up to me,"" Grossi said, suggesting this created a window for talks on salvaging the nuclear deal.

On Sunday, a lone man outside the concert hall shouted at protesters: ""You don't touch the Palau.""
Five nights of trashed shops and burned containers has caused 900,000 euros ($1.09 million) in damages in Barcelona, the city council said.
""Apart from the economic damage, we have suffered damage to the image of Barcelona as a welcoming and peaceful city,” Luis Sans, president of the Association of Friends of Passeig de Gracia, told El Pais newspaper. 
More than 95 people have been arrested across Catalonia and in other Spanish cities since Hasel was arrested and jailed on Tuesday. One woman lost an eye during clashes in Barcelona, triggering calls from politicians to investigate police tactics.
Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem was among artists, celebrities and politicians who called for a change in the law covering freedom of expression.
The Spanish government said last week it would scrap prison sentences for offences involving cases of freedom of speech.

19,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2021 02:32PM ET</span>",Analysis: Road to renewed Iran nuclear deal likely to be long and bumpy,"By Arshad Mohammed and Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It took seven years from the summer's day in 2008 when a top U.S. diplomat first sat down with his Iranian counterpart until the two sides sealed the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that aimed to keep Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
No one expects it to take as long to establish whether they can resuscitate the pact abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump, but U.S. and European officials say the journey will be lengthy and arduous, if, indeed, they even begin the trek. 
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration said on Thursday that it was ready send to its special envoy, Rob Malley, to meet Iranian officials and seek a path back to the deal, agreed by Tehran and six major powers and named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
While Tehran sent mixed signals at first, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif took a hard line on Sunday, saying: ""The U.S. will not be able to rejoin the nuclear pact before it lifts sanctions.""
The crux of the deal was that Iran would limit its uranium enrichment program to make it harder to amass the fissile material for a nuclear weapon - an ambition it has long denied - in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions.
In theory, it should not be hard to decide how to revive an agreement whose terms are detailed in 110 pages of text and annexes. 
In reality, it will be a challenge for two reasons: the scores of sanctions that Trump imposed on Iran after walking away from the deal in May 2018 and the steps Iran took, after waiting more than a year, to violate the pact in retaliation.
While both sides have so far focused in public on the question of who moves first to revive the deal - each insists that the other must do so - a U.S. official told Reuters the ""sequencing"" could be finessed.
""The issue of who goes first ... I don't think it's the one that's going to be the most difficult,"" he said. 
""It's defining how each side views compliance,"" the official added, citing instead which U.S. sanctions might be lifted and ""the question of ... the steps that Iran has taken, are they all reversible?""
POLITICS, PRISONERS AND PROXY FORCES 
The JCPOA, hammered out by Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, required the United States to remove only ""nuclear-related"" sanctions on Iran.
After abrogating the agreement, Trump imposed scores of new sanctions on other grounds, including Iran's alleged support for terrorism.
Experts say Biden would find it politically fraught, and maybe impossible, to meet Tehran's demands that these be lifted given the likely criticism from Republicans, and perhaps some of his fellow Democrats.
""This is an issue that is very politically sensitive in the U.S. because a number of these ... were very intentionally done under terrorism authorities,"" said Henry Rome of Eurasia Group.
""The two negotiating teams will need to go through quite an extensive process of deciding what stays and what goes."" 
Another challenge is Iran's support for regional proxies, including those suspected of attacks on U.S. forces. In the deadliest such incident for almost a year, a rocket attack on U.S.-led forces in northern Iraq on Monday killed a civilian contractor and injured a U.S. soldier, making it harder for Washington to appear to offer concessions to Iran.
A further complication is the American desire to free U.S. citizens detained in Iran, an issue on which Washington has begun talks with Iranian officials, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday.
And while some of the steps Tehran has taken to violate the JCPOA may be reversible -- such as its enriching uranium above 3.67% and boosting its stock of low enriched uranium -- others may not. These include expertise gleaned from research and development on advanced centrifuges that would help Iran enrich uranium to the 90% weapons grade level should it seek to.
""How do you reverse the knowledge that they have gained?"" asked Robert Einhorn of the Brookings Institution think tank.
The authorities in Tehran also face a delicate choice on how to respond to any overture from the Biden administration as Iran prepares for a presidential election in June, when the turnout is likely to be seen as a referendum on the clerical establishment amid growing discontent at over economic hardship.
Iran's fragile economy, weakened by U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic, has left the ruling elite with few options other than to negotiate, but the decision ultimately lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
It remains unclear, however, whether the two sides can even return to the negotiating table.
Iran has threatened to scale back its compliance with the deal further starting on Tuesday, notably by halting some snap inspections by the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog. 
Experts said that would not necessarily doom the chances for negotiations, but it adds to the challenges.

""Despite everything we remain in a precarious situation, which will become all the more so in the coming days,"" said a French diplomatic source. ""It's important to revive diplomacy quickly.""

In its vaccination strategy, Germany has defined three groups of the population to make sure those in need, including people aged 80 or more, get their shots first. So far, teachers and childcare workers are part of the last group.
""We want to add that group swiftly to the second cluster now and offer vaccines earlier,"" Spahn said at a public panel.

The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) are to join other pro-British figures to challenge the Northern Ireland Protocol, which has created trade barriers between the British region and the rest of the United Kingdom. 
The protocol, which is designed to protect the European Union's single market without creating a land border on the island of Ireland, has caused significant disruption to trade since it came into force at the start of the year. 
Some British companies have halted deliveries to Northern Ireland and some supermarkets have been left with empty shelves. 
The DUP said several senior members would join ""other likeminded unionists"" as named parties in judicial review proceedings challenging the Northern Ireland Protocol’s compatibility with Act of Union 1800, the Northern Ireland Act of 1998 and the Belfast Agreement, it said in a statement. 
""Neither the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Northern Ireland Executive nor the people of Northern Ireland consented to the Protocol being put in place or the flow of goods from GB to NI being impeded by checks,"" said DUP leader and Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster. 
The protocol was part of an international agreement signed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson last year.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 21, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Somali president challenged in his bid to secure new term,"GAROWE, Somalia (Reuters) - Somalia's president, whose four-year term expired this month, should not take part in talks aimed at resolving a dispute that has caused a delay in choosing a new head of state, one of Somalia's five regional governments said on Sunday.
Parliament had been due to make a choice on Feb. 8, but this was delayed because new lawmakers have yet to be picked while opponents of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who is seeking a second term, accuse him of packing his supporters into the regional and national boards who choose the legislators.
The delay has stoked tensions in the Horn of Africa nation that was ripped apart by civil war and which is still battling an insurgency by al Shabaab, an Islamist group that frequently launches attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere.
The government of Jubbaland, one of Somalia's five regions, said the president's term had expired and he should be excluded from any talks on the dispute.
""He should not have a role in the process of election in order for all political stakeholders to have confidence in it,"" Jubbaland's state house said in a statement.
The constitution allows the head of state to continue in post until a new president is picked, if parliament approves. But experts say the president, by staying on, risks upsetting the delicate power balance between rival clans and regions that is at the heart of the nation's political reconstruction effort.
The central government spokesman did not immediately respond to calls or emails seeking comment.
The president held a meeting on Sunday with the prime minister and presidents of the Hirshabele, Galmudug and South West states, as well U.N. representatives and Mogadishu's mayor.
The meeting was reported by the state-run Somalia News Agency. The Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of the president's office said it was a preliminary meeting without saying when more talks would be held.
An alliance of opposition parties said in early February they would reject any attempt to extend Mohamed's term, calling a national council of lawmakers, opposition leaders and civil society to rule until a successor was chosen.
Government troops and opposition supporters exchanged gunfire in Mogadishu on Friday during a protest over the delayed vote. Rival presidential candidates have called for more protests until a new head of state is chosen.#

Somalia had planned to hold elections to pick a president and lawmakers, its first direct vote since the civil war erupted in 1991. But delays in preparations and al Shabaab attacks meant this was replaced by an indirect vote in which lawmakers are picked by selected elders and others.

The national electoral council (CNE) said Lasso, a proponent of pro-market economic policies, obtained 19.74% of the vote and will advance to a runoff against leftist economist Andres Arauz on April 11. Arauz, an ally of former President Rafael Correa, won the most votes in the first round with 32.72%, shy of the margin required to win outright. 
Indigenous environmentalist candidate Yaku Perez came in third with 19.39% of the vote, 32,600 votes fewer than Lasso, the CNE said. Perez had requested a recount in 17 of Ecuador's 24 provinces on grounds of alleged fraud and manipulation of vote count data. 
The CNE denied the request before the results were declared, arguing he had not presented enough proof, but Perez was defiant.
""We will continue taking action because an electoral fraud cannot go unpunished,"" he said in the Andean city of Riobamba.
Perez has since last week been marching with hundreds of indigenous Ecuadoreans through the country's central highlands toward the capital Quito to demand a recount. Other civil society groups have announced plans to demonstrate in favor of Perez next week. 
The chief prosecutor's and comptroller's offices both called on the CNE to review their computer systems before the second round in response to Perez's allegations. Both Lasso and Arauz said they would be opposed to the intervention of other entities in the electoral process, warning against any vote delay. 

""It is time to defend and strengthen democracy,"" Lasso said on Twitter.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brussels' cavernous basilica is one of the largest churches in the world but COVID-19 rules allow only 15 people at a time to attend mass there, the same limit applied to much smaller religious venues in Belgium.
Dozens of worshippers of different religions and clergy demonstrated in the centre of the Belgian capital on Sunday calling for a change to the rules.
""Here, more than in any other building in Belgium, this law is an incredible absurdity,"" said the Catholic basilica's priest Marc Leroy who joined the protests on Sunday.
Together with members of other faith groups he has launched an online petition for the restrictions to be made proportional to the size of buildings.
The national basilica, an 8,000 square metre (86,111 square feet) art deco masterpiece which tourist literature describes as the fifth biggest church in the world, towers over the western suburbs of Brussels and can host a congregation of hundreds for mass.
The 15-person limit for places of worship was set by the government in December as the country faced a second wave of COVID-19 infections. Religious ceremonies had been completely forbidden during the worst phases of the pandemic.
A spokeswoman for the interior ministry told Reuters the rules were meant to stop the spread of the virus in enclosed places which are often difficult to ventilate. 
She added that a government meeting set for Friday would discuss restrictions.
""This house is so big in comparison to a bus, or an airport or a plane with 300, 400 passengers. I find it absurd to only allow in 15 people in a basilica,"" worshipper Jacques Jazz said.
Leroy said they had multiplied the number of services in an attempt to accommodate as many people as possible, but added he still had to turn parishioners away - a problem that could get worse as Easter approaches.

""It's completely ridiculous, they haven't thought about it. It's unjust. And if some people think we don't need to pray right now then they're wrong,"" worshipper Michel Beke said.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - A colourful mural showing arrows through the heads of former Spanish king Juan Carlos and the late dictator General Francisco Franco was among images that graffiti artists painted on walls in Barcelona to protest on Sunday the jailing of a rapper for glorifying terrorism and insulting the monarchy in his songs. 
The nine-month sentence imposed on Pablo Hasel, who is known for his fiercely anti-establishment raps, has sparked a debate over freedom of expression in Spain and demonstrations which descended, at times, into violence.
The artists' peaceful demonstration contrasted with five nights of clashes in Spanish cities between protesters and police in which containers were burned, banks smashed up and projectiles thrown at residents.
They called for a change in anti-terrorism and gagging laws which they say unfairly limit people's right to demonstrate their disapproval in the streets.
""We have been protesting for years and asking for these changes to gagging laws and now everyone is tearing their clothes or burning containers,"" said Roc Blackclock, an artist. 
Thirty-eight people were arrested in cities across Catalonia on Saturday after demonstrators smashed windows in Barcelona's emblematic Palau de la Musica concert hall and looted shops on the city's most prestigious shopping street, Passeig de Gracia. 
""These graffiti transmit what society thinks, in favour of freedom of expression and against the freedom of destruction,"" said Toni Marin, 52, a bank worker. 
The Spanish government announced last week it would scrap prison sentences for offences involving cases of freedom of speech. 
Senior members of the hard left Unidas Podemos party, the junior partners in Spain's coalition government, voiced support for the protesters which critics took to mean tolerating the violence. 

José Luis Martínez-Almeida, the conservative mayor of Madrid, blamed Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez for tolerating Podemos' attitude to the violence. Sanchez condemned the violent protests on Friday.

Tehran said on Sunday the United States must first lift sanctions on Iran if it wants to talk about salvaging the 2015 nuclear deal, reiterating it will not make the first move to restore the pact with major powers.
Washington said last week it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the accord, aimed at preventing Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, while lifting most international sanctions.
""President Erdogan, who stated that he wished the new U.S. administration would abandon unilateral sanctions on Iran and lift restrictions on the prosperity of Iranian people, said the statements on the issue in recent days had led to a new window of opportunity,"" the presidency said in a statement.
""Erdogan said it was the most reasonable course of action for all parties to meet at the point of making the Comprehensive Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action operational again, and that it is important to keep the door for dialogue open despite all difficulties.""
Ankara, sanctioned by Washington last year for its purchase of Russian defence systems, has repeatedly called for a lifting of U.S. sanctions on Iran and a return to the JCPOA. 
Iran began gradually breaching the terms of the agreement in 2019, a year after former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned it and reimposed sanctions on Tehran. 

Washington and Tehran have been at odds over who should take the first step to revive the agreement. Iran insists the United States must first rescind U.S. sanctions, while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Erik Prince, the private security executive and supporter of former U.S. President Donald Trump, ""at the very least"" helped evade an arms embargo on Libya, according to excerpts from a United Nations report seen by Reuters.
Independent U.N. sanctions monitors accused Prince of proposing a private military operation - known as 'Project Opus' - to Libya's eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar in April 2019 and helping procure three aircraft for it. 
A spokesperson for Prince denied the accusations in the annual U.N. report, which was submitted on Thursday to the Security Council Libya sanctions committee and is due to be made public next month. 
""Erik Prince had absolutely nothing to do with any operation in Libya in 2019, or at any other time,"" the spokesperson said in a statement to Reuters.
The U.N. monitors wrote in the report that they had ""identified that Erik Prince made a proposal for the operation to Khalifa Haftar in Cairo, Egypt on, or about, 14 April 2019."" Haftar was in Cairo at the time to meet Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
The report described Prince's proposal as ""a well-funded private military company operation"" designed to provide Haftar with armed assault helicopters, intelligence surveillance aircraft, maritime interdiction, drones and cyber, intelligence and targeting capabilities. 
""The Project Opus plan also included a component to kidnap or terminate individuals regarded as high value targets in Libya,"" the monitors wrote.
Libya initially descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 when the U.N. Security Council imposed an arms embargo. The country has been divided since 2014 between the internationally recognized government in its west and Haftar's eastern-based forces. 
PROJECT FAILURES 
The U.N. monitors reported that the air and maritime component of 'Project Opus' had to be aborted in June 2019 after Haftar was unimpressed with the aircraft procured for the operations and ""made threats against the team management.""
A South African team leader evacuated 20 private military operatives to Malta on inflatable boats, the monitors said. 
""Project Opus private military operatives were deployed to Libya for a second time in April and May 2020 in order to locate and destroy high value targets,"" said the U.N. monitors, but the operation again had to be aborted due to security concerns. 
The rival Libyan administrations agreed a ceasefire in October, but have not pulled back their forces. Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey. Egypt had backed Haftar, but Sisi last week offered his country's support to Libya's interim government.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has demanded an end to foreign interference in Libya.
Prince - the brother of Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos - founded the private security firm Blackwater and was a pioneer in private military contracting after U.S.-led forces invaded Iraq in 2003. 

Blackwater sparked international outrage in 2007 when its employees shot and killed more than a dozen Iraqi civilians in Baghdad. One of the employees was convicted of murder in December 2018 and three others were convicted of manslaughter. Trump pardoned the four men in December last year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Members of Malcolm X's family have made public what they described as a letter written by a deceased police officer stating that the New York Police Department and FBI were behind the 1965 killing of the famed Black activist and civil rights advocate.
Malcolm X was a powerful orator who rose to prominence as the national spokesman of the Nation of Islam, an African-American Muslim group that espoused Black separatism. He spent more than a decade with the group before becoming disillusioned and publicly breaking with it in 1964. He moderated some of his earlier views on the benefits of racial separation.
He was killed at New York's Audubon Ballroom while preparing to deliver a speech. Three members of the Nation of Islam were convicted in the shooting.
The letter released at a news conference on Saturday was attributed to a former undercover NYPD officer named Raymond Wood. His cousin Reggie Wood joined some of Malcolm X's daughters at the news conference at the site where the Audubon Ballroom once stood to make the letter public.
Raymond Wood's letter stated that he had been pressured by his NYPD supervisors to lure two members of Malcolm X's security detail into committing crimes that resulted in their arrest just days before the fatal shooting. Those arrests kept the two men from managing door security at the ballroom and was part of conspiracy between the NYPD and FBI to have Malcolm killed, according to the letter.
""Under the direction of my handlers, I was told to encourage leaders and members of the civil rights groups to commit felonious acts,"" Wood's letter stated. 
Some historians and scholars have contended that the wrong men were convicted. The office of Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance last year said it would review the convictions in the case.
Following Saturday's news conference, Vance's office released a statement saying its ""review of this matter is active and ongoing."" The NYPD said in a separate statement it has ""provided all available records relevant to that case to the District Attorney"" and ""remains committed to assist with that review in any way.""
The FBI declined to comment on the matter.
Malcolm X's daughter Ilyasah Shabazz said she had always lived with uncertainty around the circumstances of her father's death.

""Any evidence that provides greater insight into the truth behind that terrible tragedy should be thoroughly investigated,"" she told the news conference.

The assailants fired heavily on Bashagha's convoy as he drove through western Tripoli after visiting the National Oil Corporation and the headquarters of the ministry's law enforcement force, the source said.
Bashagha's guards exchanged fire with the attackers before pursuing them, killing one, injuring another and arresting two, according to the source. 
The attack comes as the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), in which Bashagha serves, prepares to make way for a new interim government selected in a U.N.-led process aimed at unifying Libya's warring factions.
Bashagha, a prominent figure from the eastern city of Misrata, was a losing candidate to become prime minister of the unity government, but has made public statements of support for the new administration.
Initial investigations seemed to show those who carried out Sunday's attack were from Zawiya, another powerful city 45 kilometres (28 miles) west of Tripoli, the source said.
As interior minister, Bashagha had pledged to rein in armed groups that have held power on the ground in western Libya since a 2011 uprising and often enjoy official status under the ministries of defence and interior.
The groups were largely united in defending Tripoli from forces led by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar between April 2019 and June 2020. 

Recent weeks have been relatively calm, but heavy gunfire could be heard from central Tripoli overnight between Saturday and Sunday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese troops have completed a pullout from a lake area on their disputed border in the western Himalayas, setting the scene for disengagement at other friction points, the two countries said on Sunday.
Thousands of soldiers have been facing off since April on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), or the de facto border, including at the glacial Pangong Tso lake. 
Earlier this month, military commanders agreed to begin pulling out troops, tanks and artillery in a first step towards full withdrawal. 
On Saturday, the two commanders met to review the pullout. 
""The two sides positively appraised the smooth completion of disengagement of frontline troops in the Pangong Lake area noting that it was a significant step forward that provided a good basis for resolution of other remaining issues along the LAC in Western Sector,"" a joint press release said.
The deployment in the remote area that falls in India's Ladakh region and adjoins the Chinese-administered Aksai Chin plateau had raised fears of a broader conflict between the two countries. 
A clash erupted in the Galwan Valley in June, when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in the first combat losses on the disputed border in more than four decades. China said this week it lost four soldiers in the fighting.
Troops remain in close proximity on other parts of the undefined border including at Hot Springs, Gogra Post and the Depsang plains, officials said. The commanders had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on the situation on the border, the two countries said in the press release.
""The two sides agreed to follow the important consensus of their state leaders, continue their communication and dialogue, stabilize and control the situation on the ground, push for a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues in a steady and orderly manner, so as to jointly maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas,"" they said.
India and China fought a war in 1962 and the border remains undefined. India said Chinese troops had intruded deep into its side of the LAC last April, triggering the most serious stand-offs in decades. 

China denied its troops had transgressed the LAC and accused Indian border guards of provocative behaviour.

BARNALA, India (Reuters) - More than 100,000 farmers and farm workers gathered in India's northern Punjab state on Sunday in a show of strength against new farm laws, where union leaders called on supporters to amass outside the capital New Delhi on Feb. 27.
Tens of thousands of Indian growers have already been camped outside Delhi for nearly three months, demanding the repeal of the three reform laws that they say will hurt them and benefit large corporations.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which introduced the laws last September, has offered to defer the laws but refused to abandon them, arguing that legislation will help farmers get better prices.
Both sides have met for several rounds of negotiations but failed to make any headway, and farmers' unions have vowed to carry on the protests until the laws are rolled back.
At Sunday's rally at a grain market in Barnala, a town in Punjab, union leaders outlined plans to mobilise farmers and farm workers from across the northern state and move to a protest site outside Delhi later this month.
""We came here to make Punjab's farmers aware of the movement in Delhi. We came to tell them what's happening there and what will happen next,"" prominent farmer leader Joginder Ugrahan told Reuters.
A sea of supporters, including tens of thousands of women, began gathering in Barnala early in the day, riding in on buses, tractors, trailers and cars. Local police estimated a crowd of between 120,000 and 130,000 eventually gathered, comprising one of the largest rallies against the laws.
Baljinder Singh, a 52-year-old farmer, said he had travelled 30 kms (18.6 miles) to attend the rally. ""Our objective is that the black laws enacted by the Modi government are repealed,"" Singh said, tightly grasping a flag of a farmers' union.

In New Delhi, a senior official from Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party blamed opposition parties for attempting to prolong the agitation but said the government was open for further talks.

The military has been unable to quell the demonstrations and a civil disobedience campaign of strikes against the coup and the detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others, even with a promise of new elections and stern warnings against dissent.
Tens of thousands of people massed peacefully in the second city of Mandalay, where Saturday's killings took place, witnesses said.
""They aimed at the heads of unarmed civilians. They aimed at our future,"" a young protester told the crowd.
Military spokesman Zaw Min Tun has not responded to attempts by Reuters to contact him by telephone for comment.
He told a news conference on Tuesday the army's actions were within the constitution and supported by most people, and he blamed protesters for instigating violence.
In the main city of Yangon, thousands of mostly young people gathered at different sites to chant slogans and sing.
""Us young people have our dreams but this military coup has created so many obstacles,"" said Ko Pay in Yangon. ""That's why we come out to the front of the protests.""
In Myitkyina in the north, people laid flowers for the dead protesters. Big crowds marched in the central towns of Monywa and Bagan, in Dawei and Myeik in the south, Myawaddy in the east and Lashio in the northeast, posted pictures showed.
At the tourist spot of Inle Lake, people including Buddhist monks took to a flotilla of boats holding aloft portraits of Suu Kyi and signs saying ""military coup - end"".
The more than two weeks of protests had been largely peaceful until Saturday, unlike previous episodes of opposition during nearly half a century of direct military rule to 2011.
The violence looked unlikely to end the agitation.
""The number of people will increase ... We won't stop,"" protester Yin Nyein Hmway said in Yangon.
'AGGRESSIVE PROTESTERS'
The trouble in Mandalay began with confrontations between the security forces and striking shipyard workers.
Video clips on social media showed members of the security forces firing at protesters and witnesses said they found the spent cartridges of live rounds.
U.N. Special Rapporteur for Myanmar Tom Andrews said he was horrified by the deaths of the two, one of them a teenaged boy.
""From water cannons to rubber bullets to tear gas and now hardened troops firing point blank at peaceful protesters. This madness must end, now,"" he said on Twitter.
The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said the strikers sabotaged boats at the city's river port and attacked police with sticks, knives and catapults. Eight policemen and several soldiers were injured, it said.
""Some of the aggressive protesters were also injured due to the security measures conducted by the security force in accordance with the law,"" the newspaper said without mentioning the deaths.
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) condemned the violence by security forces in Mandalay as a crime against humanity.
A young woman protester, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, became the first death among the demonstrators on Friday. She was shot in the head on Feb. 9 in the capital Naypyitaw.
Hundreds of people attended her funeral on Sunday.
Military media said the bullet that killed her did not come from any gun used by police and so must have been fired by an ""external weapon"".
The army says one policeman has died of injuries sustained in a protest.
'COORDINATING HARM'
The army seized power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections that the NLD swept, detaining Suu Kyi and others. The electoral commission dismissed the fraud complaints.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) deleted the military's main page for repeated violations of its standards ""prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm"" and Western countries that condemned the coup decried the violence.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States was ""deeply concerned"".
France, Singapore, Britain and Germany also condemned the violence while U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said lethal force was unacceptable.
The United States, Britain and others have announced limited sanctions, focusing on military leaders, but the generals have long shrugged off foreign pressure.
Suu Kyi faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Her next court appearance is on March 1.

A rights group said 569 people have been detained in connection with the coup.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Tehran said on Sunday the United States must first lift sanctions on Iran if it wants to talk about salvaging the 2015 nuclear deal, reiterating its stance that it will not make the first move to restore the pact with major powers.
President Joe Biden's administration said last week it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the accord, which aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons while lifting most international sanctions.
Former President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran, which in turn gradually began breaching terms of the agreement. 
But Iran and the United States have been at odds over who should take the first step to revive the accord. Iran insists the United States must first rescind U.S. sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance.
""The U.S. will not be able to rejoin the nuclear pact before it lifts sanctions ... Once everybody implements their side of obligations, there will be talks,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Iran's English Language Press TV. 
""Biden claims that Trump's maximum pressure policy was maximum failure...but they have not changed that policy (towards Iran). The United States is addicted to pressure, sanctions and bullying...It does not work with Iran."" 
Iran has been hard hit by the sanctions, as well as by the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
SNAP INSPECTIONS
Further complicating efforts to revive the deal, Iran's hardline-dominated parliament passed a law last year that obliges the government to end implementation of the Additional Protocol from Feb. 23, if sanctions are not lifted. 
Under the deal, Iran is applying the Additional Protocol, which grants the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) the power to carry out short-notice inspections at locations not declared to it. 
""This is not a deadline for the world. This is not an ultimatum ... Like in any democracy, we have to implement the law passed by the parliament...The move (to end snap inspections) is not abandoning the deal,"" Zarif said. 
""The minute they come back to full compliance, we will come back to full compliance.""
The United States and European parties to the deal have warned Iran against obstructing the IAEA's snap inspections. 
Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director-general who is in Tehran to discuss the agency's ""essential verification activities"", met on Sunday with Iran´s nuclear energy chief, state media reported.
Iran's envoy to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, tweeted that Ali Akbar Salehi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, and Grossi held ""fruitful talks based on mutual respect"".

Zarif said: ""We will talk to Mr. Grossi about respecting the laws of our country...but at the same time not creating an impasse for him to continue to carry out the obligations to show Iran's nuclear programme is peaceful.""

NIAMEY (Reuters) - Niger voted on Sunday in the second round of a presidential election that is expected to usher in the first democratic transition of power since the West African nation gained independence from France in 1960.
Ruling party candidate Mohamed Bazoum is seen by many as the favourite after leading in the first round on Dec. 27 with 39.3% of the vote. He is up against former President Mahamane Ousmane, who scored 17%.
Bazoum, who had held several top positions in outgoing President Mahamadou Issoufou's governments including the foreign and interior ministries, is backed by the candidates who came third and fourth in the first round.
In the capital Niamey, crowds of voters, some wearing masks to protect against COVID-19, queued in dusty school courtyards.
""I am satisfied by the calm that characterised our second-round campaign,"" Bazoum said after voting. ""I hope that luck is on my side, but I have many reasons to believe it is indeed."" 
Bazoum, 61, has vowed to continue Issoufou's policies, making security a focal point as the country battles insurgencies, while introducing policies to revamp the economy.
Ousmane, 71, was Niger's first democratically elected president and was ousted in a 1996 military coup. He has been endorsed by around a dozen smaller parties and first round candidates. He has promised to bring change and tackle corruption. 
The Sahel nation of around 24 million is one of the poorest in the world and struggles with recurring drought and destructive floods. The coronavirus pandemic has weighed on its economy, while weak prices for its main export, uranium, have hit revenues.
The International Monetary Fund expects Niger's economy to rebound to pre-pandemic levels, with growth of over 6% this year after dipping by 1.2% in 2020. 
""The vote is in every way between continuity and change,"" said Mahamadou Harouna, a 30-year-old student after casting his ballot. ""What is important is to find a leader who can respond to the aspirations of the people."" 
Niamey-based political analyst Elhadj Idi Abou said he expected turnout to be high but did not see a clear favourite.
Niger is facing two of Africa's deadliest insurgencies - one near its western border with Mali and Burkina Faso, where militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have carried out a series of attacks. An attack on two villages in early January near the border with Mali killed 100. 
Along its southeastern border with Nigeria attacks by Boko Haram have killed hundreds and displaced thousands.

The first round of the election was largely peaceful, and there were no immediate reports of disruptions on Sunday.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel reopened swathes of its economy including malls and leisure facilities on Sunday, with the government saying the start of a return to routine was enabled by COVID-19 vaccines administered to almost half the population. 
Shops were open to all. But access to gyms, hotels and theatres was limited to people with a ""Green Pass"": those who have had both doses of the vaccine more than a week prior, or recovered from the disease with presumed immunity. 
Pass-holders could prove their status by presenting a vaccination certificate or downloading a Health Ministry app linked to their medical files.
Coming exactly a year after Israel's first documented coronavirus case, Sunday's easing of curbs was part of a government plan to open the economy more widely next month, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is up for reelection.
""We are the first country in the world that is reviving itself thanks to the millions of vaccines we brought in,"" he tweeted. ""Vaccinated? Get the Green Pass and get back to life.""
Mask-wearing and social-distancing were still in force. Dancing was barred at banquet halls. Synagogues, mosques or churches were required to halve their normal congregation sizes.
Elementary schoolchildren and pupils in the last two years of high school resumed classes in towns with contagion rates under control. Middle-school pupils were still home-learning, however, prompting some to stage a sit-down protest in a mall.
""I haven't been in school in a year,"" said 14-year-old demonstrator Rotem Bachar. ""How does it make sense to open malls up to crowds, while we can't attend class if even they are capped at 15 to 20 pupils and have other precautions?""
Israel has administered at least one dose of the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) vaccine to more than 46% of its 9 million population, the Health Ministry says. The ministry said on Saturday that the risk of illness from COVID-19 dropped 95.8% among people who received both shots.
Israel has logged more than 740,000 cases and 5,500 deaths from COVID-19, drawing criticism of Netanyahu's sometimes patchy enforcement of three national lockdowns. The government has pledged that there will not be a fourth.

But Nachman Ash, a physician in charge of the country's pandemic response, told Army Radio that another lockdown ""is still possible ... Half of the population is still not immune.""

Dimitris Lignadis, former artistic director of Greece's National Theatre who resigned earlier this month after accusations of harassment in media reports, turned himself in to police after a prosecutor issued an arrest warrant.
Greek TV showed Lignadis, handcuffed, being brought before a magistrate on Sunday. He will be detained until his plea on Wednesday, police said. His lawyer said he denies the charges.
The arrest warrant came after two lawsuits were filed against him by two men claiming they were raped by him at a much younger age. One of the two suits falls under the statute of limitations.
The case has fast spilled over into politics with the parties in the opposition accusing the government and its culture minister of a failed cover-up attempt and calling for her resignation.
On Friday Culture Minister Lina Mendoni, whose ministry oversees the National Theatre, told reporters Lignadis had fooled her, calling him a ""dangerous man"". 
""From the moment the rumours started...we pressed him a lot to tell us if he had any involvement,"" Mendoni told reporters.
""I feel that Lignadis, apart from everything else, conned us. With a deep acting art he tried to convince us he had nothing to do with all this,"" she said. 
Greece's ""#MeToo"" revelations took off when Sofia Bekatorou, a Greek sailing gold medallist in the 2004 Olympics, opened up last month about being sexually assaulted by a sports official as a 21-year-old.

Her account - and the outpouring of support it provoked - prompted dozens of actors, singers, athletes and students to come forward in Greece's delayed ""MeToo"" moment, shaking the arts establishment and piling on pressure for change.

President Tayyip Erdogan, his ruling AK Party and their ally the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) accuse the HDP of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which the HDP denies.
The HDP has come under renewed pressure this week after the government said that fighters from the PKK had executed 13 Turkish captives in Iraq's Gara region, including military and police personnel. The PKK said the captives had died during clashes in the area.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told broadcaster A Haber on Saturday that the HDP's Dirayet Dilan Tasdemir had visited Gara, according to an account by someone he said was a PKK militant who had surrendered. Ankara says the PKK have several bases in Gara.
Prosecutors in Ankara said on Sunday that Soylu's comments were considered a notice and that an investigation had been launched into Tasdemir's links to an armed terrorist organisation. 
Tasdemir, in a tweet on Saturday, had denied Soylu's comments. 
""This country's interior minister made a statement giving my name based on the so-called accounts of one person. We will prove that this is a giant lie and slander,"" she wrote. 
Many prominent HDP members have been investigated, tried and jailed over terrorism charges. Selahattin Demirtas, the party's former leader and one of Turkey's most prominent politicians, has been in jail for more than four years.
On Friday, Turkey's top appeals court approved a jail sentence against another HDP lawmaker on terrorism charges, potentially opening the way to revoking his parliamentary membership.
Turkey has carried out several cross-border operations into northern Iraq against the PKK, which has waged an insurgency in the mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984. It is considered a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and European Union.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's biggest vaccine maker by volume, on Sunday asked for patience from foreign governments awaiting their supply of COVID-19 shots, saying it had been directed to prioritise India's requirements.
""...I humbly request you to please be patient,"" SII's Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla said in a tweet https://twitter.com/adarpoonawalla/status/1363346341275967488, adding the company ""has been directed to prioritise the huge needs of India and along with that balance the needs of the rest of the world.""
""We are trying our best,"" Poonawalla said.
Based in the western Indian city of Pune, the company is manufacturing the Oxford University/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, one of the two shots that India is using to initially vaccinate some 300 million people as part of a national inoculation drive.
Many low-and middle-income countries, ranging from Bangladesh to Brazil, are depending on SII's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine, branded COVISHIELD by the Indian company.
But demand is growing, including from Western countries like Canada, where Poonawalla has promised to deliver the COVISHIELD vaccine next month.
Britain's drug regulator is also auditing manufacturing processes at SII, potentially paving the way for the COVISHIELD vaccine to be shipped from there to the UK and other countries..
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has come under criticism for the slow take-off of its vaccination drive but health authorities are preparing to expand the number of inoculation substantially in coming weeks.
India has vaccinated around 11 million people since mid-January.
With more than 10.9 million confirmed infections, India has the world's second highest number of COVID-19 cases, behind only the United States. 
The country is currently reporting around 12,000 new infections on average each day, a fraction of its peak from last September, according to a Reuters analysis.

But federal health authorities on Sunday said they had written to some states that are currently seeing a surge in cases, asking them to improve overall testing, surveillance and monitoring of COVID-19 mutations.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Russia would only consider releasing Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny if its leadership was hit with painful personal sanctions, a close ally said ahead of a meeting with European policymakers in Brussels on Sunday.
European foreign ministers are expected to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in response to the jailing of Navalny.
Navalny was arrested last month on his return from Germany following treatment for poisoning with what many Western countries say was a nerve agent. He was jailed on Feb. 2 for violating parole on what he and the Western countries said were trumped-up charges. He lost an appeal on Saturday.
Leonid Volkov, Navalny's chief of staff, told Reuters on Saturday he believes Putin would only consider releasing him if hit by sanctions.
""Putin is a dictator, but he is quite rational. If the upsides of having Navalny in prison become less than the downsides, he will change his decision,"" said Volkov.
""If many of his closest allies become unhappy, this can be dangerous to Putin and this could lead him to decide to change his mind,"" Volkov added. ""Or maybe not - but sanctions is the best thing that Europe can do now.""
In Brussels on Sunday at the invitation of Lithuania, where he has been sheltering since 2019, Volkov said he will tell policymakers to use the ""language of power"" towards the Russian government, as he believes Putin sees bridge-building attempts by the West as a sign of weakness.
Asked to comment on Navalny’s political future after the court decision on Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, “It is absolutely none of our business.”
Navalny's allies have published a list of 35 people they believe should be sanctioned.
His supporters are now gearing up to organise a ""huge peaceful protest"" in Russia this spring, Volkov said.

Navalny's organization will then attempt to prevent Putin's party from achieving a comfortable win at elections in September by campaigning for its rivals, said Volkov.

Her predecessor stepped down on Friday after reports that people had been able to use connections to get priority access to COVID-19 vaccines, piling pressure on the center-left government of President Alberto Fernandez.
""We will strengthen the tools and actions that guarantee fairness in access to vaccines, monitoring compliance with the planned process,"" Vizzotti, 47, a doctor and specialist in infectious diseases, wrote on Twitter after taking office.
""It is the President's decision that we carry out the largest vaccination plan in our history with the greatest speed and offer each Argentine the peace of mind that all vaccines are administered according to precise sanitary criteria.""
Argentina's state attorney for administration investigations has opened a probe into potential abuses of power by the former minister Gines Gonzalez Garcia, who in his resignation letter had blamed ""confusion"" in his office.
The South American country, with a population of about 45 million, has so far received some 1.22 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine and 580,000 doses of the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by the Indian Serum Institute.

The scandal mirrors one in Peru earlier this month, which led to the resignation of a number of ministers after it emerged that some 500 people had received early vaccines in secret.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for Texas on Saturday as the state struggles with the fallout from a winter storm that killed at least two dozen people and caused widespread blackouts and water shortages. 
Millions of residents in the United States' biggest oil and gas producer have had to contend with days of electricity outages, and nearly half of all Texans are still suffering from disruptions to their water service. 
Lina Hidalgo, the top elected official in Harris County, which encompasses Houston, said on Friday authorities were reporting 10 deaths due to hypothermia. Officials said an accurate death toll will take time to establish. 
The action by the Biden administration makes federal funding available to affected individuals, including assistance for temporary housing and home repairs and low-cost loans. 
Biden is also weighing a trip to Texas to survey the federal response to the first new crisis to develop since he took office a month ago. The White House is working closely with Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican who did not initially acknowledge Biden's November election win. 
Abbott thanked the president for approving the major disaster declaration, saying in a statement that it was ""an important first step."" But, he added, individual assistance had only been approved for 77 counties, not all the state's 254 counties as he had requested. 
FROM RESPONSE TO RECOVERY 
With all the state's power plants back online, millions of Texans were finally able to turn on the lights and heat their homes again. However, outages persisted and more than 78,000 homes remained without electricity as of Saturday morning. 
With the weather set to improve and temperatures expected to return to normal in the coming days, the main concern has shifted from power to water. 
More than 1,200 public water systems have reported service disruptions, many of them leading to boil water notices, said Gary Rasp, a spokesman for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ.) He said 14.3 million people in 190 counties were affected as of Saturday morning. 
Toby Baker, TCEQ's executive director, said the agency will do a full review of the regulations governing the state's water systems.
""I'm not aware of ever having issues of this magnitude from a water system standpoint in the history of the state,"" he said at a press conference on Saturday. ""We're going to take full advantage of this event to learn."" 
At his home in Houston, plumber Jay Farrell said he would have ""rather gone through a hurricane than this freeze.""
Farrell said he has not been able to take showers and for days has been using buckets of water from his hot tub to flush the toilet. As Texas shivered in the dark during the freeze, he said the temperature in his house dropped to 22 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 5.5 Celsius).
In Houston, officials struck a more optimistic tone after power was restored to most residents and with mass distributions of bottled water under way.
""Things are looking up... We are headed in the direction of normalcy,"" Hidalgo said in a video address on Friday. ""Right now it's about shifting from response to recovery.""
Meanwhile, Abbott said he was convening an emergency meeting with officials on Saturday to discuss the spike in energy bills received by many residents following the power outages.
FINGER POINTING
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), a cooperative responsible for 90% of the state's electricity, has come under fire after the power grid collapsed as demand spiked during the freeze. 
Abbott lashed out at ERCOT last week, saying the corporation had told officials before the storm that the grid was prepared.
A lawsuit against ERCOT was filed on Friday in Nueces County court in Corpus Christi alleging the council failed to heed warnings and take action to address weaknesses in the power infrastructure. 
Separately, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued civil investigative demands to ERCOT and other power companies regarding power outages, emergency plans, energy pricing and more related to the winter weather. 
In a statement on Friday, Paxton said the companies ""grossly mishandled"" the weather emergency, and vowed to ""get to the bottom of this power failure.""
On Saturday, Senator Tina Smith wrote to federal regulators calling for an investigation into any price gouging by natural gas producers and suppliers. 
""I urge you to launch an investigation into the conditions in the natural gas market over the last week,"" Smith said in the letter to the Department of Energy, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Smith said the effects of the crisis in Texas could be felt in the region, including natural gas spot prices that in some cases rose to nearly 100 times usual levels.

Iran and the United States have been at odds over who should take the first step to revive the 2015 accord. Iran insists the United States must first lift former President Donald Trump's sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested earlier this month a way to overcome the U.S.-Iranian impasse over who goes first in returning to the nuclear deal, saying EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell could “synchronize” or “choreograph” the moves.
""We are studying Josep Borrell's proposal to hold an informal meeting of the 4 + 1 (nuclear deal members) with the United States and Iran, and we are consulting with our partners, including Russia and China, and we will respond to this proposal in the future,"" Araqchi said in an interview with state TV.
""However, we believe a U.S. return to the nuclear accord does not require a meeting and the only way for it is to lift the sanctions,"" Araqchi said.
The White House said on Friday the United States plans to take no additional actions in response to pressure from Iran before potential talks with Tehran and major powers about returning to the deal.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the EU had floated the idea of a conversation among Iran and the six major powers that struck the nuclear accord. ""The Europeans have invited us and ... it is simply an invitation to have a conversation, a diplomatic conversation."" 
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, arrived in Tehran on Saturday, weeks after Iran's hardline parliament set a deadline of Feb. 23 for Washington to lift the sanctions, or Tehran would halt snap IAEA inspections.
""Grossi's trip has nothing to do with Iran's decision and Iran's decision shall be implemented,"" Araqchi said. ""About 20 to 30% of the IAEA's oversight capacity will be reduced as a result of the implementation of the parliament's decision.""
Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei said earlier that Iran believed sanctions would soon be lifted despite continued ""diplomatic wrangling"" over reviving the nuclear deal, signalling Tehran's desire to end the impasse while not offering a new position.
""We predict with confidence that diplomatic initiatives will result in a favourable outcome despite the diplomatic wrangling, which are a natural prelude to the return of the parties to their commitments, including the lifting of all sanctions in the near future,"" Rabiei was quoted as saying by state media.

Under the deal with major powers, Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Washington reimposed sanctions after Trump quit the deal in 2018, and Iran responded by violating some of the deal's nuclear limits.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Protesters threw bottles at police, set fire to containers and smashed up shops in Barcelona on Saturday in a fifth night of clashes after a rapper was jailed for glorifying terrorism and insulting royalty in his songs.
The nine-month sentence of Pablo Hasel, known for his virulently anti-establishment raps, has sparked a debate over freedom of expression in Spain as well as protests that have at times turned violent.
Demonstrators hurled projectiles and flares at police, who fired foam bullets to disperse the crowd, the Mossos d'Esquadra, the Catalan regional police, said on Twitter. 
About 6,000 demonstrators gathered in the city, local police said. 
Protesters attacked shops on Barcelona's most prestigious shopping street, Passeig de Gracia, while newspaper El Pais reported others had smashed windows in the emblematic Palau de la Musica concert hall.
Nine people were arrested in Catalonia, the regional police said, including three minors. 
Some were detained for looting shops in Barcelona, local police said. 
Nine people were injured, two of whom were taken to hospital, police said. 
A demonstration in Madrid was peaceful but in the northern cities of Pamplona and Lleida, police charged protesters.
Earlier, Socialist Party President Cristina Narbona condemned the violence that has marked protests over the past four nights. 
""We reiterate our strongest condemnation of violence which cannot be justified as a defence of the freedom of expression,"" she said.
Officials said four people were injured in Barcelona on Friday after demonstrators pelted police with projectiles, attacked two banks and burned containers. Protesters caused 128,000 euros ($156,000) in damages, the city council said.
More than 60 people have been arrested across Catalonia, police said. One woman lost an eye during clashes in Barcelona, triggering calls from politicians to investigate police tactics.
Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem was among artists, celebrities and politicians who called for a change in the law covering freedom of expression.
The Spanish government announced last week it would scrap prison sentences for offences involving cases of freedom of speech.

Djordje Balasevic, 67, who had been appointed goodwill ambassador of the United Nations High Commissionaire for Refugees in 1998, passed away on Friday evening in a hospital in his hometown Novi Sad in northern Serbia. 
Balasevic, known for his emotional lyrics and soft pop music, was among the most outspoken anti-war activists during a decade of wars that followed the breakup of former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. He was among the first singers to cross borders right after armed conflicts ended and held concerts in packed stadiums and concert halls throughout the region.
""That unique man who wrote the most beautiful love songs, the kindest versus about our childhoods, the saddest rhymes about our misfortune and the funniest verses about our mentalities should be celebrated,"" said Rade Serbedzija, a Croatian-born actor who starred in several Hollywood movies.
On Saturday afternoon, crowds gathered in Croatia's coastal towns, Split and Pula. In the evening, fans in his native Novi Sad laid candles in the shape of a heart in the city square. In Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb hundreds gathered in main squares singing his most popular songs.
""For me he is a symbol of a great time that has passed and that will never be repeated,"" said Ivana Kurtesvki, of Belgrade, who joined mourners in front of the concert hall where Balasevic held concerts every December.

The vaccine was also 98% effective in preventing fever or breathing problems and 98.9% effective in preventing hospitalizations and death, the ministry said.
The findings were based on data collected nationally through Feb. 13 from Israelis who had received their second shot at least two weeks previously. According to the Health Ministry's website, about 1.7 million people had been administered a second shot by Jan. 30, making them eligible to be included.
Israel's ambitious vaccination drive has made it the largest real-world study of Pfizer’s vaccine and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday he expects 95% of Israelis age 50 and over to be vaccinated in the next two weeks.
Previous reports from individual health care providers also showed positive results, spurring Israel to remove restrictions on the economy after weeks of lockdown. On Sunday, schools and many stores will be allowed to reopen.

The Health Ministry has also rolled out a ""Green Pass"" app, linked to personal medical files, which people who have been fully inoculated or deemed immune after recovering from COVID-19 can show to stay at hotels or attend cultural or sporting events.

No group immediately claimed the attack. It was the second salvo of rockets to hit a base hosting U.S. forces or contractors in less than a week.
The Iraqi military said four rockets hit the base. Iraqi security officials initially said three rockets had hit and told Reuters the contractor had suffered non-lethal injuries.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorised to speak to the media. 
Armed groups that some Iraqi officials say are backed by Iran have claimed similar incidents in the past, including an attack last week on the Erbil International Airport compound. The attack killed a contractor working with U.S. forces at the military base part of the compound.
Iran-aligned paramilitary groups demand that all foreign troops, including U.S. forces who number around 2,500 in Iraq, leave the country, calling their presence an occupation.

Inside a warehouse on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, people are able to swing giant hammers at old televisions, computers and printers, demolishing the machines, and shattering the glass into tiny pieces.
Forty-two-year-old Vanderlei Rodrigues, who opened the business a month ago in Cidade Tiradentes, said he has received a fair number of customers wanting to vent, especially during the pandemic.
""I think it was the best moment to be able to set this up here in Cidade Tiradentes, related to everything that people are going through, a lot of anxiety, stress.""
The ""Rage Room"" experience costs $4.64.
Wearing protective suits and helmets, participants write issues that bother them on the walls - ""ex-girlfriends"", ""ex-husbands,"" ""corruption"" and ""work."" These words become the targets of their anger.
Alexandre de Carvalho, 40, who works in advertising and drives two hours back and forth to work, said with worries about health due to the pandemic, ""it's great to come here and release some adrenaline and pent-up feelings.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis paid a surprise visit on Saturday to the home of Edith Bruck, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor and author, and paid homage to all those killed by Nazi ""insanity"".
Bruck, 89, who lives in Rome, was born into a poor Jewish family and spent time in a series of concentration camps, losing her father, mother and brother in them. 
A Vatican spokesman, who announced the visit after it ended, said the two spoke of her time in the camps and the importance that future generations be made aware of what happened.
""I came here to thank you for your witness and to pay homage to the people martyred by the insanity of Nazi populism,"" the Vatican quoted the pope as telling Bruck.
Bruck, who has lived in Italy for decades and writes in Italian, was about 13 when she was taken to Auschwitz in German-occupied Poland with her family.
Her mother died there and her father died in Dachau, in Germany, where they were taken after that. While in Dachau, she dug trenches and laid railway sleepers (ties), she recently told the Vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano. 
She later spent time in Christianstadt, a sub-camp of the larger Gross-Rosen camp. She finally wound up in Bergen-Belsen, where she was liberated by the Allies in 1945.
The Nazis and their allies murdered around 6 million Jews, as well as others, in German-occupied Europe.
More than a million people, most of them Jews, were killed at Auschwitz in southern Poland, which was liberated by Soviet troops on Jan. 27, 1945. The vast majority were gassed to death.
The pope, who rarely leaves the Vatican for private visits, spent about an hour with Bruck, who has written novels and plays and directed films.

Last month on Holocaust Remembrance Day, the pope, who visited Auschwitz in 2016, urged people to keep a close watch on ideological extremism, because ""these things can happen again"".

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has registered the first case of a strain of bird flu virus named A(H5N8) being passed to humans from birds and has reported the matter to the World Health Organization (WHO), Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, said on Saturday.
Outbreaks of the H5N8 strain have been reported in Russia, Europe, China, the Middle East and North Africa in recent months but so far only in poultry. Other strains - H5N1, H7N9 and H9N2 - have been known https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/influenza-(avian-and-other-zoonotic) to spread to humans.
Russia reported the case of human infection to the WHO ""several days ago, just as we became absolutely certain of our results,"" Popova said on Rossiya 24 state TV. There was no sign yet of transmission between humans, she added.
Seven workers at a poultry plant in Russia's south had been infected with the H5N8 strain in an outbreak at the plant in December, Popova said, adding that the individuals involved felt fine now. ""This situation did not develop further,"" she said. 
In an email WHO's European arm said it had been notified by Russia about a case of human infection with H5N8 and acknowledged this would if confirmed be the first time the strain had infected people.
""Preliminary information indicates that the reported cases were workers exposed to bird flocks,"" the email said. ""They were asymptomatic and no onward human to human transmission was reported. 
""We are in discussion with national authorities to gather more information and assess the public health impact of this event,"" the email added.
The majority of human bird flu infections have been associated with direct contact with infected live or dead poultry, though properly cooked food is considered to be safe.
Bird flu outbreaks often prompt poultry plants to kill their birds to prevent the virus from spreading, and avoid importing countries having to impose trade restrictions.
The vast majority of cases are spread by migrating wild birds, so producing countries tend to keep their poultry indoors or protected from contact with wildlife.

Siberia's Vector Institute said on Saturday it would start developing human tests and a vaccine against H5N8, RIA news agency reported.

54,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 20, 2021 01:20PM ET</span>",Former Nazi camp guard arrives in Germany after removal from U.S.,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A former Nazi concentration camp guard who lived in the United States for over 60 years returned to Germany on Saturday after being expelled, a police spokesman said.
The 95-year-old man faces questioning by local police after arriving at Frankfurt airport. He was not arrested. U.S. Justice Department officials have named him as Friedrich Karl Berger, while Germany authorities refer to him only as Friedrich Karl B. 
A U.S. court last year ruled that Berger should be expelled after prosecutors in the northern German town of Celle opened an investigation into whether he was involved with the murder of prisoners at a satellite concentration camp of the Neuengamme network near Hamburg in 1945.
According to German prosecutors B., who has lived in the United States since 1959, admitted to guarding prisoners for a few weeks in the Meppen area close to the Dutch border without witnessing any killings or abuse of prisoners.
The German case against him was dropped in December after prosecutors were unable to dispute his account.
The U.S. court found that prisoners at the camp were held in “atrocious” conditions and were exploited for outdoor forced labor, working “to the point of exhaustion and death,"" the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said. The court also found, and Berger admitted, that he guarded prisoners to prevent them from escaping during their dawn-to-dusk workday, on their way to worksites and on their way back to the camp in the evening. 
A spokesman for the prosecutor’s office in Celle said police in the German state of Hesse had been asked to question him on his return to Germany. 
A police spokesman said there is no live investigation linked to him and he is a free individual and has not been taken in custody.
The DOJ said it had marshalled evidence leading to Berger's removal that its human rights section found in the United States and in Europe, including records of the trial 75 years ago of former leaders of the Nazi regime in Nuremberg.
In recent years, prosecutors have brought charges against several former Nazis, seizing the last opportunity to secure justice for the millions who perished in concentration camps.

Earlier this month, prosecutors charged a 100-year-old German man with being an accessory to 3,518 murders committed while he was allegedly a guard at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

Ties between the two NATO allies have been strained over a host of issues. In December, the United States sanctioned Turkey for its purchase of Russian S-400 defence systems, while Ankara has been infuriated by U.S. support for the Kurdish YPG militia in Syria, which it considers a terrorist organisation.
Turkey, which has said it wants improved ties under U.S. President Joe Biden, has called on Washington to end its support for the YPG and accused it of siding with militants who it says executed 13 Turks in northern Iraq this month, while the United States has criticised Ankara over rights and freedoms.
""As Turkey, we believe our common interests with the United States far outweigh our differences in opinion,"" Erdogan said in televised comments, adding Ankara wanted to strengthen cooperation through ""a long-term perspective on a win-win basis.""
""Turkey will continue to do its part in a manner worthy of the allied and strategic partnership ties between the two countries,"" he said, adding Turkish-U.S. ties had been ""seriously tested"" recently.
In a phone call this month marking the first official contact since Biden took office, Erdogan's foreign policy adviser Ibrahim Kalin told U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan the S-400 dispute needed resolving.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed the S-400 dispute and other disagreements during their first call.

Turkey has hired Washington-based law firm Arnold & Porter to lobby for its readmission into the F-35 jet programme, where it was a buyer and manufacturer, after it was removed by the United States over the S-400s. Washington's claim that the defence systems poses a threat to the F-35s is rejected by Ankara.

HAVANA (Reuters) - A group of Miami-based Cuban musicians including reggaeton duo Gente de Zona launched an impassioned anti-Communist anthem this week that has gone viral, sparking a furious state response. 
Gente de Zona, Yotuel of hip-hop band Orishas fame and singer-songwriter Descemer Bueno collaborated on the song with two rappers in Cuba, Maykel Osorbo and El Funky, who are part of a dissident artists' collective that sparked an unusual protest against repression outside the culture ministry last November.
""Homeland and Life"" repurposes the old slogan ""Patria o Muerte"" (""Homeland or Death"") emblazoned on walls across the Caribbean country ever since Fidel Castro's 1959 leftist revolution and expresses frustration with being required to make sacrifices in the name of ideology for 62 years. 
The lyrics refer to ideological intolerance, the partial dollarization of the economy, food shortages and the exodus of young Cubans who see no future on the island. The government blames its economic woes largely on crippling U.S. sanctions.
The video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP9Bto5lOEQ featuring the five artists - all Black men - has racked up 1 million views on YouTube in three days, sparking lively discussions on social media, while many in Cuba - where internet service is costly - are sharing it on USB sticks.
""No more lies, my people calls for freedom, no more doctrines"" sings Alexander Delgado, one half of GdZ, chanting ""It's over"" in the refrain.
The Miami-based artists had until recently managed the tightrope of achieving capitalist success abroad without breaking with the Communist-run island. GdZ even called for applause for Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel at a Havana concert in 2018 although that sparked calls for a boycott from some in the exile community.
BACKLASH
Cuban state media and officials including the president have launched a barrage of attacks, Twitter hashtags and memes on ""Homeland and Life,"" branding it unpatriotic and without artistic merit. They say the artists behind it are opportunistically trying to placate their Miami public.
""It makes fun of one of the slogans held aloft by our people in the face of continuous U.S. aggressions,"" said Havana-based TV anchor Froilan Arencibia.
Ana Dopico, the Cuban-born director of the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics at New York University, said the rejection of that revolutionary cry was unprecedented in recent Cuban popular music.
""It shocks us all out of the depressing menace of death that comes with our understanding of nation,"" she said.
The song reflects a surge in overt anti-Cuban-government sentiment among more contemporary generations of Cuban migrants, said Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University.
But it has also resonated with people on the island, especially youths who have become increasingly vocal about their frustrations since the advent of mobile internet two years ago, with some emblazoning their Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Profile photos with the banner ""Homeland and Life.""
""I follow Fidel's ideals but lately things have been happening that I don't really agree with,"" said Havana resident Loraine Martinez, who enjoyed the song.
This is not the first time that the songs of Cuban musicians on the island and abroad have become stand-ins for political causes, said Bustamante. But the Cuban government's response was unusually forceful, he said, reflecting its anxiety and what he called ""misplaced priorities.""

""If they are worried about popular frustration, the way to fix that is to focus on bread-and-butter reforms, not this kind of reflexive ideological performativity,"" he said.

Clashes erupted between Sudanese and Ethiopian forces over Al-Fashqa, an area of fertile land settled by Ethiopian farmers that Sudan says lies on its side of a border demarcated at the start of the 20th century, which Ethiopia rejects.
    In a statement on Thursday, Ethiopia's foreign ministry said it believes ""the conflict being trumpeted by the Sudanese government's military wing could only serve the interests of a third party at the expense of the Sudanese people"".
Sudan's foreign ministry responded on Saturday by saying ""slander towards Sudan and accusation of being an agent for other parties is a grave and unforgivable insult"". 
    It added: ""What the Ethiopian foreign ministry cannot deny is the third party whose troops entered with Ethiopian troops trespassing on Sudanese land.""
Neither country specified the third parties to whom they were referring in their statements, although the veiled references underscored the potential for any conflict to embroil neighbouring countries. 
Ethiopia may have been referring to Egypt, which has been angered by Ethiopia's construction of a massive hydropower dam on the Blue Nile. Sudan has also expressed concerns over the dam. 
Sudan may have been referring to Eritrea, whose troops entered Ethiopia to support beleaguered federal forces in Tigray after a regional force attacked military bases in November, according to the United States and European Union. Both Ethiopia and Eritrea have denied the incursion, although dozens of eyewitnesses say they have seen Eritrean soldiers in Ethiopia. 
    Earlier this week, Sudan accused Ethiopian troops of crossing the border after a similar act by Ethiopian aircraft last month, both of which Ethiopia denied.
    Ethiopia on Thursday reiterated its accusation that Sudan had invaded in early November, attacked and displaced Ethiopians and took control of vacated military camps.
    In its statement, Sudan said that Ethiopia had in the past affirmed its commitment to the 1903 border agreement several times, most recently in 2013. It accused Ethiopia's foreign ministry of ""exploiting (the border issue) for personal interests and for the specific interests of a certain group"".
    Both countries called on each other to pursue legal means to resolve the border issues. 
    African Union mediator Mohamed Hassan Lebatt arrived in Khartoum on Thursday to discuss the conflict, as well as the ongoing negotiations between Sudan, Egypt, and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam.
The Sudanese foreign ministry said in a statement late on Saturday that Lebatt had emphasized the need to reduce tensions between the two neighbors, and discouraged a military solution to the conflict. 

Ethiopian foreign ministry official spokesman Dina Mufti, state minister of foreign affairs Redwan Hussein and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, on Saturday visited the hospital where his father Prince Philip is being kept as a precaution after feeling ill, a Reuters photographer at the hospital said.
Charles arrived at the back of the London hospital where Philip, the 99-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth, has spent four nights. Charles was at the hospital for just over half an hour before departing.
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, was admitted to hospital on Tuesday as a precautionary measure after feeling ill with an ailment that is not related to COVID-19.
He is expected to remain in hospital until next week, a royal source said on Friday, adding that doctors were acting out of an abundance of caution and the duke remained in good spirits. 
Both Philip and the 94-year-old queen received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in January.
He spent four nights at the same hospital at the end of 2019 while being treated for a pre-existing condition.
Philip is now rarely seen in public. He stepped down from official engagements in August 2017 after completing more than 22,000 solo events and thousands more alongside the queen.
A former naval officer renowned for his sometimes brusque manner and humour, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947, five years before she became queen. He is now by far the longest-serving consort of any British monarch.

In an apparent tribute to the duke, one of his granddaughters, Princess Eugenie, and her husband Jack Brooksbank said on Saturday they had named their first son August Philip Hawke Brooksbank.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has accepted the resignation from a top Vatican post of Cardinal Robert Sarah, a hero to many conservatives who often clashed with the pontiff on theological matters. 
The African cardinal, who is from Guinea, held various Vatican positions in the last 20 years, the latest as head of the department that oversees matters of worship and sacraments.
Sarah had submitted his resignation in June last year when he turned 75, as Church law requires of all bishops, but the pope often allows Vatican officials to remain in their posts longer. The Vatican announced on Saturday that he was stepping down.
In his latest position, which he held since 2014, Sarah dragged his feet in implementing changes wanted by Francis, such as allowing women to be among those taking part in Holy Thursday services.
Conservatives in the Church often put Sarah on their wish list to one day succeed Francis as pontiff. But most observers saw that possibility as extremely remote because Sarah was seen as highly divisive and would not have wide support among fellow cardinals.
Apart from openly disagreeing with Francis on a number of theological issues, Sarah was involved in an embarrassing episode last year over a book in defense of priestly celibacy that he said was jointly written with former Pope Benedict.
Just days before its publication, Benedict said he wanted his name removed from the cover because he had made only a minor contribution.

Sarah publicly contested Benedict's version but agreed that in future editions, Benedict would be named as a contributor and not co-author.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's air force scrambled for a second straight day on Saturday after a dozen Chinese fighter aircraft and bombers carried out drills close to Taiwan-controlled islands in the disputed South China Sea, the defense ministry in Taipei said.
Beijing, which claims Taiwan as Chinese territory, has carried out repeated air missions in the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defense identification zone in recent months, mostly near the Pratas Islands. 
After nine Chinese air force aircraft flew near the Pratas Islands on Friday, the Taiwanese Defence Ministry said it tracked 11 aircraft on Saturday - eight fighter jets, two nuclear-capable H-6 bombers and an anti-submarine aircraft, also near the islands.
It said Chinese naval forces were also involved but gave no details. 
Taiwan's air force warned the Chinese aircraft to leave and deployed missile systems to monitor the activity, the ministry said. 
China has not commented on the last two days of activities. It previously said such manoeuvres were a response to ""collusion"" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's main international backer and weapons supplier, and to safeguard Chinese sovereignty.
The Pratas Islands sit in the top part of the South China Sea and are also claimed by China. 
Lying roughly between southern Taiwan and Hong Kong, they are only lightly defended by Taiwan and are considered by some security experts as vulnerable to Chinese attack due to their distance - more than 400 km (250 miles) - from mainland Taiwan. 
Chinese aircraft fly in the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defense zone on an almost daily basis, though the last such large-scale activity was on Jan. 24 when 12 Chinese fighters were involved.

Taiwan on Friday unveiled a reshuffle of senior security officials including the appointment of a new, U.S.-trained defense minister, to help bolster military modernisation and intelligence efforts in the face of what it sees as a rising Chinese threat.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency said on Saturday at least six people registered with it were among 1,200 Myanmar nationals to be deported by Malaysia next week, while the United States voiced alarm that the plan could put deportees' lives at risk. 
The comments came as Myanmar naval ships arrived in Malaysian waters to pick up the detainees. 
Malaysia will deport the Myanmar citizens - including asylum seekers - after Myanmar's military, which seized power in a Feb. 1 coup, offered to send navy ships to pick them up, officials and refugee groups say. 
Malaysia has vowed not to deport Rohingya Muslims or refugees registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
But concerns over deportation of unregistered asylum-seekers persist as UNHCR has not been allowed to interview detainees for more than a year to verify their status. 
Malaysia does not formally recognize refugees and arrests them along with other undocumented migrants. 
Confirming the planned deportation of six persons of concern registered with it, the UNHCR said it has asked authorities not to send back those in need of international protection. 
""We are concerned that there may be others of concern to UNHCR in the group,"" Yante Ismail, a spokeswoman for the agency, told Reuters in an emailed statement. 
Rights groups have asked Malaysia to scrap the deportation, saying it would endanger the deportees. Some of the deportees include people from Myanmar Muslim and Chin communities who arrived in Malaysia fleeing conflict and persecution at home. 
The U.S. embassy confirmed to Reuters that it has raised concerns and echoed calls for UNHCR access to those in immigration detention. 
Malaysia's foreign ministry had no immediate comment.
The Myanmar Embassy in Malaysia did not respond to calls seeking comment. On Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Saturday it confirmed it would be bringing back the 1,200 people, saying it was prioritising the repatriation of nationals stranded due to the pandemic.
Three Myanmar-flagged vessels were anchored off Malaysia's Lumut naval base on Saturday, including one described as a military operations ship, according to ship-tracking website Marine Traffic.
Two Malaysian sources, who requested anonymity, confirmed those ships were sent to pick up the detainees. They are scheduled to leave for Myanmar on Tuesday, Malaysia has said.
U.S. and other Western missions in Kuala Lumpur have been trying to dissuade Malaysia from proceeding, four other sources with knowledge of the matter said.
""Malaysia is legitimising the military government by handing over the detainees,"" one source said.
Diplomats are also urging Malaysia to let the UNHCR interview the deportees and have expressed concern over Malaysia's cooperation with the Myanmar junta, the sources said.
Malaysia had earlier expressed ""serious concern"" over the coup. 

Coup opponents have been protesting for weeks. Two people were killed on Saturday when police fired to disperse protesters.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has put a 19th century English Catholic priest who was a distant relative of Britain's Prince William on the path to sainthood.
The Vatican said on Saturday that the pope had approved a decree recognizing the ""heroic virtues"" of George Spencer, a priest of the Passionist religious order who lived from 1799 to 1864.
Spencer, who left the Anglican Church, took the name ""Ignatius of St. Paul"" after he became a Catholic priest.
Prince William and his brother Prince Harry are related to Spencer through their mother Diana Spencer, the late Princess of Wales, who died in 1997.
Spencer was Diana's great-great-great-uncle, and also a great-uncle of Britain's wartime leader Winston Churchill, according to the website of the Roman Catholic diocese of Shrewsbury.
He grew up on the Spencer ancestral estate in Althorp where Diana is buried.
After his ordination in Rome, he returned to England and ministered to poor Irish migrants in the West Midlands.
The Passionist religious order in Britain has been working on his sainthood cause for decades, investigating his life and writings.
The pope's approval of the decree means Spencer now has the title ""venerable"".
His sainthood cause is still at the early stages. One miracle would have to be attributed to Spencer for him to be beatified and another for him to be made a saint.

The Roman Catholic Church teaches that only God performs miracles, but that saints who are believed to be with God in heaven intercede on behalf of people who pray to them. A miracle is usually the medically inexplicable healing of a person.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny lost his appeal on Saturday against what he said was a politically motivated decision to jail him for nearly three years, but said his faith in God and belief in the rightness of his cause was sustaining him.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed earlier this month for parole violations that he said were trumped up. Western countries have condemned the case and are discussing possible sanctions on Russia.
A Moscow court swiftly rejected Navalny's appeal on Saturday, while shortening his original jail term by six weeks. The original term was 3-1/2 years. 
But with the amount of time he had already spent under house arrest taken into account, it amounted to around two years and eight months. His lawyer said on Saturday he would now spend a little over 2-1/2 years behind bars and that his legal team would try to challenge the decision to reject his appeal. 
Navalny responded sarcastically to the ruling, which paves the way for him to be transferred from an infamous Moscow jail to a prison camp. ""They've reduced the sentence by 1-1/2 months. Great!"" he said from a courtroom glass cage.
Navalny's allies reacted with anger. 
""The court decision to keep Alexei in jail says only one thing. There is no law in Russia right now,"" staff at Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, who investigate alleged official corruption, wrote on Twitter.
Navalny, 44, had earlier told the judge he was not guilty of parole violations as a previous court had found. 
He returned to Russia last month from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning in Siberia in August with what many Western nations said was a nerve agent.
He said he had been unable to report to the Moscow prison service last year because he had been convalescing in Germany at the time.
""I don't want to show off a lot, but the whole world knew where I was,"" Navalny told the judge. 
He said he had no regrets about returning to Russia, that his belief in God helped sustain him, and that ""strength was in truth"".
""Our country is built on injustice. But tens of millions of people want the truth. And sooner or later they'll get it.""
Latvian Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkevics said on Twitter the court's ruling was at odds with a call by the European Court of Human Rights this week to free Navalny, and could lead to more sanctions against Moscow. 
Asked to comment on Navalny's political future after the court decision, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, ""It is absolutely none of our business"".
SLANDER CASE
Navalny appeared in court again later on Saturday for the culmination of a separate slander trial against him. 
He is accused of defaming a World War Two veteran who took part in a promotional video backing constitutional reforms last year that let Putin run for two more terms in the Kremlin after 2024 if he wants.
Navalny described the people in the video as traitors and corrupt lackeys. But he has said his comments were not specifically directed against the veteran, and that the authorities are using the charge to smear his reputation. 
State prosecutors have asked the court to fine Navalny 950,000 roubles ($12,800) for slander.
Navalny told the court the case was an attempt to distract people from tricky questions he had asked about the wealth of Putin and his allies and that state prosecutors were using the war veteran to get at him.
""You'll burn in Hell for all of this,"" he said. 
The court is expected to announce its decision at 1500 GMT.
MORATORIUM ON BIG DEMONSTRATIONS 
Navalny's arrest and jailing sparked nationwide street protests in Russia, but his allies - most of whom are either under house arrest or abroad - have now declared a moratorium on major demonstrations until the spring. 
Alexei Venediktov, one of Russia's most prominent journalists, noted what he called a defeatist atmosphere within the opposition in the absence of immediate plans for street protests. 
""We have seen the rejection of a mass (street protest) movement and a transition to candle-lit gatherings, and now absolutely nothing,"" he said on Ekho Moskvy radio station. 
Navalny accuses Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.

""Twenty people were injured and two are dead,"" said Ko Aung, a leader of the Parahita Darhi volunteer emergency service agency in the city.
Opponents of the coup took to the streets in several Myanmar cities and towns with members of ethnic minorities, poets and transport workers among those demanding an end to military rule and the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others.
Some protesters fired catapults at police in Mandalay who responded with tear gas and gun fire, though it was initially not clear if they were using live ammunition or rubber bullets.
One man died from a head wound, media workers including Lin Khaing, an assistant editor with the Voice of Myanmar media outlet in the city, and a Mandalay emergency service said.
A volunteer doctor confirmed there had been two deaths: ""One shot in the head died at the spot. Another one died later with a bullet wound to the chest.""Police were not available for comment.
The protests against the coup that overthrew the government of veteran democracy campaigner Suu Kyi have shown no sign of dying down. Demonstrators are sceptical of the army's promise to hold a new election and hand power to the winner.
A young woman protester died on Friday after being shot in the head last week as police dispersed a crowd in the capital, Naypyitaw, the first death among anti-coup demonstrators.
The army says one policeman died of injuries sustained in a protest.
On Saturday, young people in the main city of Yangon carried a wreath and laid flowers at a memorial ceremony for the woman, Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, while a similar ceremony took place in Naypyitaw.
""The sadness from her death is one thing, but we've also got courage to continue for her sake,"" said student protester Khin Maw Maw Oo in Naypyitaw.
The demonstrators are demanding the restoration of the elected government, the release of Suu Kyi and others and the scrapping of a 2008 constitution, drawn up under military supervision, that gives the army a major role in politics.
The army seized back power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy swept, detaining her and others. The electoral commission had dismissed the fraud complaints. 

Suu Kyi faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. Her next court appearance is on March 1.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Severe flooding across several areas in the Indonesian capital forced more than a thousand people to flee their homes on Saturday, with the country’s meteorology agency warning the conditions were set to continue for the next week.
Some 1,380 Jakarta residents were evacuated from southern and eastern areas of the city, home to 10 million people, after floodwaters reached up to 1.8 meters high in some areas, said Sabdo Kurnianto, the acting head of Jakarta's disaster mitigation agency in a statement. He said no casualties had been reported.
People posted photos on social media of residents wading through shoulder-high muddy waters, cars almost entirely submerged, and search teams evacuating elderly residents in rubber dinghies in the peak of the monsoon season. 
""Two hundred neighbourhoods have been affected, according to the latest data,"" Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan told local television early on Saturday, adding that more than two dozen evacuation centres have been prepared across the city.
""The rain has stopped, but water from other areas is still affecting Jakarta. Hopefully it won’t hit the city centre and when the water recedes people can resume their activities.""
The floods come at a time when Indonesia is already grappling with the highest caseload and death tally from COVID-19 in Southeast Asia and an economic recession.
Indonesia’s meteorology agency (BMKG) has warned the heaviest rain of the season may fall in and around the densely populated capital in the coming days, with extreme weather, including heavy rain, thunder and strong winds, expected throughout next week.
""These are critical times that we need to be aware of,"" said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of BMKG. 
""Jakarta and its surrounding areas are still in the peak period of the rainy season, which is estimated to continue until the end of February or early March.""

The BMKG said Jakarta would be on alert for the next four days with data from the meteorology agency showing intense rainfall in the past 24 hours with the area of Pasar Minggu, in Jakarta’s south, recording 226 millimeters of rain since Friday.

The Arctic environment and production security at Nornickel's assets has been in the spotlight since a major fuel leak at its power plant near the city of Norilsk and a list of smaller accidents in 2020.
The plant in the Krasnoyarsk region of Russia continues to operate with some restrictions, it added in a statement. A regional investigative committee said in a separate statement it had opened a criminal investigation into the accident.
An ore loading section of the plant collapsed early on Saturday during renovation work to reinforce the building's structure, Nornickel said.
Four workers of the Nornickelnickelremont firm, which was doing the repairs, were recovered from the debris, and one of them died in a hospital. The search for two missing workers continues, Nornickel said.
Earlier this month, Nornickel, the world's largest producer of palladium and a leading producer of nickel, was fined $2 billion for the damage caused by the major fuel spill last year.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Saturday he was ""sickened"" by allegations of sexual assault in Parliament House, adding that there was a ""culture"" problem at the government building.
His comments followed reports that a second woman had said she had been assaulted by the same man whom a former media adviser to the government this week publicly accused of rape.
Brittany Higgins said on Friday, in a statement reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC), that the man had raped her two years ago in parliament. Reuters has been unable to contact her.
Morrison apologised to Higgins on Tuesday for the way her complaint was handled at that time, ordering a probe into the government's workplace culture.
""I think we've got a problem in the parliament and the workplace culture that exists there,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney on Saturday. ""We would be naive to think it's not a challenge that other workplaces face all around the country, but I agree the parliament should be setting the standard.""
Higgins told ABC she was raped by an unnamed colleague who also worked for Morrison's ruling Liberal party and that she would lodge a formal complaint to open a police investigation.
""These events truly do sicken me... as they should anyone,"" Morrison said. ""That is why I'm seeking to try to address this as swiftly but as effectively as we possibly can.""
Media reports on Saturday said a second woman alleged she was sexually assaulted by the man in 2020, after he had been sacked following Higgins's allegations and while he was working in the private sector. The second alleged attack occurred at the woman's home after the two had been out for dinner, she was quoted as saying.
Reuters was not able to reach the second woman or the man.
""I am telling my story because I want to support Brittany and I want to help shine a light on this awful culture,"" she said in anonymous comments reported by The Weekend Australian newspaper.
A police media liaison officer in the capital Canberra said on Saturday there was an ""open"" investigation into the incident involving Higgins but that the case was not ""active"" because she had not filed a formal complaint.
The accusation by the second woman had not been referred to police, the liaison officer said.

Higgins told the ABC this week she had not been encouraged to make a police complaint at the time of her assault when she worked in parliament for Defence Minister Lynda Reynolds. Reynolds says Higgins was not pressured against making an official complaint.

Tehran and Washington have been at odds over who should make the first step to revive the accord. Iran says the United States must first lift former President Donald Trump’s sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.
The United States said on Thursday it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the deal that aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, which Trump, a Republican, abandoned nearly three years ago.
U.S. acting Ambassador Richard Mills told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that the United States was rescinding a Trump administration assertion that all U.N. sanctions had been reimposed on Iran in September.
Iran reacted coolly, with Foreign Minister Javad Zarif saying Tehran will “immediately reverse” actions in its nuclear program once U.S. sanctions are lifted.
But White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki, speaking to reporters on Air Force One as Democratic President Joe Biden flew to Michigan, said ""there is no plan to take additional steps"" on Iran in advance of having a ""diplomatic conversation.""
Under the deal, Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Washington reimposed sanctions after Trump quit the deal, and Iran responded by violating some of the deal's nuclear limits.
Asked if the Biden administration was considering an executive order about reviving the agreement, Psaki noted the European Union has floated the idea of a conversation among Iran and the six major powers that struck the agreement: Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.
""The Europeans have invited us and ... it is simply an invitation to have a conversation, a diplomatic conversation. We don’t need additional administrative steps to participate in that conversation,"" she said.

The European Union is working on organizing an informal meeting with all participants of the Iran deal and the United States, a senior EU official said on Friday.

""The vote shows that there is confidence,"" said Chuan Leekpai, president of the National Assembly, announcing the result, which had been widely expected. 
Opposition lawmakers have taken aim at what they say is a slow government rollout of the coronavirus vaccine and at its economic policies, vowing to continue investigating.
""We've opened a wound and now will pour salt on it,"" Pita Limjaroenrat, head of the Move Forward Party told reporters after the vote.
The government’s victory comes as pro-democracy protests returned after a lull brought on by a second outbreak of COVID-19. 
Protesters gathered at parliament on Friday in anticipation of the vote with more demonstrations planned for Saturday. Earlier this month, protesters demanding the release of activists scuffled with police.
Prayuth, who overthrew an elected prime minister in 2014 and stayed in office after a 2019 election that his rivals said was badly flawed, had been expected to survive Saturday's vote due to his coalition government's majority in the lower house. 

Youth-led protests last year reached hundreds of thousands, occupying major commercial intersections in Bangkok and spreading to university campuses across the country.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina's health minister resigned on Friday following reports that people had been able to use connections to get access to COVID-19 vaccines to which they were not entitled.
    Gines Gonzalez Garcia said in a letter posted on Twitter that individuals were able to sidestep proper procedure for vaccinations due to ""unintended confusion"" in his office while he was away.
    Two sources in the presidency said earlier on Friday that President Alberto Fernandez had asked for Gines' resignation after allegations were made in the media of at least 10 people receiving vaccinations without following the proper procedure, among them a veteran journalist who claimed he had received a shot after speaking directly with the minister. 
    The growing scandal throws a spotlight on wider fears in the region over corruption and access to vaccines, which are in short supply.
    Earlier this month, Peru's health and foreign ministers quit and its former president was placed under criminal investigation after reports of hundreds of Peruvian officials and others receiving vaccine doses outside of clinical trials and before the national immunization program began.
    In Argentina, well-know local journalist Horacio Verbitsky said he had received a shot after approaching the minister.
    ""I called my old friend Ginés González García and he told me to go to the Posadas Hospital,"" Verbitsky, who is in his seventies, told radio station El Destape.
    Since December, Argentina has been using Russia's Sputnik V vaccine to inoculate frontline health workers, though deliveries have lagged far behind what it initially hoped for. The country has started inoculating some people over 70 this week but appointments are scarce and people are supposed to follow a procedure that involves registering first.
    As of Wednesday in Argentina, about 250,000 people had received two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The country of around 45 million people has confirmed over 2 million coronavirus infections and 51,000 deaths.

    Argentina's state news agency said Carla Vizzotti, a current vice minister in the health ministry, would be the next health minister, although there was no official confirmation.

Older people living in care homes have been offered the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine as part of a programme that has seen almost 17 million shots given to date.
The number of infections in the United Kingdom has also fallen from a peak at the beginning of the year, although it still remains high, the government said on Saturday.
Each care home resident will be able to name one visitor, who will be required to take a COVID-19 test beforehand, wear personal protective equipment during the visit and avoid close contact beyond holding hands.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the measure would allow people to be carefully and safely reunited with loved ones.

""We need to make sure we keep the infection rate down, to allow greater visiting in a step by step way in the future.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal grand jury indicted nine associates of the ""Oath Keepers"" militia on Friday for conspiring to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6 to prevent Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's election victory, adding to a list of defendants with ties to the far-right anti-government group.
In a superseding indictment, the U.S. charged six people allegedly connected to Oath Keepers - Ohio residents Sandra Ruth Parker, 60, and her husband Bennie Alvin Parker, 70, Graydon Young, 54, of Florida, Kelly Meggs, 52, and his 59-year-old wife Connie Meggs, also of Florida, and Laura Steele, 52, of North Carolina.
The remaining three defendants - Thomas Caldwell, Jessica Watkins and Donovan Crowl - were previously indicted for conspiracy in January. In the latest version of the indictment, the government filed additional charges against Caldwell for tampering with evidence by deleting his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts.
Caldwell and Watkins have pleaded not guilty. Crowl has not yet entered a plea.
The indictment alleges that the group conspired as far back as November to storm the Capitol, and extensively planned for a military-style attack that even contemplated staging an armed ""quick reaction force"" outside the city that would be ready to move if ordered by then President Donald Trump.
According to the indictment, Kelly Meggs is a self-described leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers. 
In a Facebook post in late December, Kelly Meggs posted a message about the upcoming Jan. 6 rally: ""Trump said It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!! It’s gonna be wild!!!!!!! He wants us to make it WILD that’s what he’s saying. He called us all to the Capitol and wants us to make it wild!!! Sir Yes Sir!!! Gentlemen we are heading to DC pack your s***!!” 
More than 200 people have been charged so far for their roles in the Capitol riots that left five people dead and caused members of Congress to flee.
The FBI has been investigating whether far-right fringe groups such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys conspired in advance to impede the election certification.
So far, at least 18 associates of the Proud Boys have been charged for roles in the riots.
Sandra and Bennie Parker appeared in a federal court in Ohio on Thursday and were released on bond pending their next appearance in a federal court in Washington, D.C. An attorney for Sandra Parker declined comment. An attorney for her husband did not respond to a request for comment.
The remaining defendants are due to appear in federal courts in Florida and North Carolina next week.
Attorneys for Young and Kelly Meggs declined comment. Attorneys for the others could not immediately be reached.
According to one of the criminal complaints filed in the case, some of the defendants did not seem too concerned they would face criminal charges.
""I've been following FBI wanted list, seems they're only interested in people who destroyed things. I wouldn't worry about them coming after us,"" Watkins told Bennie Parker, according to texts obtained by the FBI.

""I'm sure they're not on us,"" Bennie Parker replied.

(Reuters) - Democrats and voting rights groups condemned on Friday a broad proposal by Georgia Republicans to limit absentee and in-person voting in the state, the latest salvo in a national fight over efforts to place new restrictions on casting a ballot.
Republicans said the sweeping measure was needed to bolster confidence in election integrity after former President Donald Trump disputed November's results that saw Joe Biden become the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state in 28 years.
The legislation, one of dozens of restrictive voting measures pending in Georgia, would have ""devastating consequences"" for voters, a coalition of voting rights groups said in an open letter to Republican state legislators. They said it was designed to reduce the influence of Black voters, whose heavy turnout helped propel Biden to victory and delivered Democrats two U.S. Senate wins in January.
The bill includes new ID requirements for absentee voting, a shorter window to seek an absentee ballot, limits on the use of drop boxes and the elimination of early voting on Sundays - a provision that would curtail traditional ""Souls to the Polls"" voter turnout programs in Black churches.
""Georgia Republicans saw what happens when Black voters are empowered and show up at the polls, and now they’re launching a concerted effort to suppress the votes and voices of Black Georgians,"" said Nse Ufot, founder of the advocacy group New South Super PAC.
State Representative Barry Fleming, a Republican who authored the bill, said at a state House of Representatives hearing on Friday that provisions such as the voter ID requirement should not be a burden.
""We're simply asking for what is already approved and required for the federal law,"" Fleming said.
Trump battled with Republican state leaders and elections officials in Georgia for weeks after his narrow defeat, making baseless claims of election fraud that were disproved by a hand and machine recount and rejected by the courts and investigators.
But Republicans angry about the election outcome have seized on Trump's voter fraud claims to push a new wave of voting limitations in Georgia and across the country.
More than 150 bills proposing new voting restrictions have been introduced in state legislatures since the November election, according to Sylvia Albert, voting and elections director for good-government watchdog Common Cause.
""What we saw in this election was record turnout, and Republican legislators have responded by saying, 'We didn't actually want you to come vote,'"" Albert said.
UNWINDING COVID-19 VOTING RULES
A record 158 million people voted in November’s elections, in part thanks to new rules that made voting easier during the worst public health crisis in a century. New York University’s nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice found 29 states and the District of Columbia passed laws and changed procedures to expand voting access during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Republican proposals in Georgia and other battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin would impose new limitations and unwind many of those rules that eased restrictions on voting by mail and extended early voting.
Albert said her group is particularly concerned about new restrictions in states where Republicans control the governorship and both houses of the legislature, such as Georgia, giving Democrats less chance to block them.
Republican backers of the Georgia legislation portrayed their proposal as a common-sense measure to ensure safe and accurate voting.
""We all want the same thing at the end of the day, that the elections are fair, honest, and that everyone votes their conscience, and no one is manipulated (or) threatened,"" state Representative Rick Williams (NYSE:WMB), a co-author of the bill, said at Friday's hearing.
Georgia is likely to be one of the biggest battlegrounds in the 2022 elections, with a U.S. Senate seat and the governor's office on the ballot.

Democrat Stacey Abrams, whose Fair Fight Action group helped bolster Black voter turnout last year after she narrowly lost her bid for governor in 2018, is considering another run for governor. Fair Fight Action signed a letter on Thursday warning of the consequences of the new measure.

The nine-month sentence of Pablo Hasel, known for his fiercely anti-establishment raps, has galvanised a debate over freedom of expression in Spain, prompting the government to announce it would make speech laws less restrictive and sparking protests that, at times, turned violent.
Protesters threw projectiles at police and at neighbours who condemned them for the disturbances. Two banks and businesses were attacked in Barcelona. Police charged protesters in the northern Catalan city of Girona.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez condemned the violence which has marked protests over the past three nights. 
""Democracy protects freedom of speech, including the expression of the most awful, absurd thoughts, but democracy never ever protects violence,"" he told an event, promising to ""widen and improve freedom of speech.""
During the last three nights police fired tear gas and foam bullets at demonstrators who set fire to trash containers and motorcycles and looted stores. There were also clashes in the capital Madrid and other cities.
Officials said three people were arrested in Barcelona on Friday. Around 60 people have been arrested across Catalonia, where Barcelona earlier this week. One woman lost an eye during clashes in Barcelona, triggering calls from politicians to investigate police tactics.
Rights group Amnesty International called for legal changes in Spain, saying that anti-terrorism and gagging laws also unfairly limited people's right to demonstrate their disapproval in the streets.

U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters that President Joe Biden's administration will review U.S. policy on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) and will assess the role the administration can play in facilitating a solution between the countries.
A bitter dispute between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over the filling and operation of the dam remains unresolved even after the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July.
""We continue to support collaborative and constructive efforts by Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan to reach an agreement on the GERD,"" Price said. 
The temporary pause on certain U.S. foreign assistance to Ethiopia affects $272 million in development and security assistance to Ethiopia, Price said, adding that the resumption of assistance will be assessed on a number of factors and that the decision has been shared with Addis Ababa.
Among the factors assessed will be ""whether each paused program remains appropriate and timely in light of developments in Ethiopia that occurred subsequent to the pause being put in place,"" a State Department spokesperson said.
The United States has expressed concern over the humanitarian crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, where the central government has claimed victory over a rebellious regional government in a conflict that began in November.
Ethiopia began filling the reservoir behind the dam after the summer rains last year despite demands from Egypt and Sudan that it should first reach a binding agreement on the dam's operation.
Egypt views the dam as a major threat to its fresh water supplies, more than 90% of which come from the Nile. The Blue Nile flows north into Sudan then Egypt and is the Nile's main tributary.
Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development.
Then-U.S. President Donald Trump said Ethiopia had broken a U.S.-brokered agreement to resolve the dispute, forcing him to cut funds. The United States cut $100 million in aid to Ethiopia in September. 

Ethiopia in October summoned the U.S. ambassador over what it called an ""incitement of war"" between Ethiopia and Egypt from Trump over their dispute.

China, which has maritime sovereignty disputes with Japan in the East China Sea and with several Southeast Asian countries in the South China Sea, passed a law last month that for the first time explicitly allows its coast guard to fire on foreign vessels.
State Department spokesman Ned Price told a regular briefing Washington was ""concerned by language in the law that expressly ties the potential use of force, including armed force, by the China coast guard to the enforcement of China's claims, and ongoing territorial and maritime disputes in the East and South China Seas."" 
He said language, ""strongly implies this law could be used to intimidate (China's) maritime neighbors.""
""We are further concerned that China may invoke this new law to assert its unlawful maritime claims in the South China Sea, which were thoroughly repudiated by the 2016 arbitral tribunal ruling,"" he said, referring to an international ruling that found in favor of the Philippines in a dispute with China. 
Price said the United States reaffirmed a statement last July in which then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo rejected China's disputed claims to offshore resources in most of the South China Sea as ""completely unlawful.""
He added that the United States ""stands firm"" in its alliance commitments to both Japan and the Philippines. 
The United States has mutual defense treaties with both countries and has sailed regular naval patrols in the region to challenge China's extensive maritime claims. 

The Philippines said last month it had filed a diplomatic protest over China's new law, describing it as a ""threat of war.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Ukraine's top prosecutor said on Friday investigations into Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings Ltd, a matter closely tied to a scandal that led to former U.S. President Donald Trump's first impeachment, have been closed with no plans to reopen them.
Ukrainian prosecutors in recent years had looked into the actions of Burisma, a company on whose board U.S. President Joe Biden's son Hunter had served from 2014 to 2019, and its founder Mykola Zlochevsky.
""Everything that prosecutors could do, they have done,"" Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said in an interview with Reuters by video link from Kyiv. ""This is why I don't see any possibilities (or) necessity to come back to these cases.""
Venediktova also said U.S. authorities had made no requests of her office since Biden took office last month.
The U.S. House of Representatives impeached Trump in December 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his request in a July 2019 phone call to Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for an investigation into Biden and his son Hunter. The U.S. Senate voted in February 2020 to keep Trump in office.
Trump made unsubstantiated corruption allegations against both Bidens. U.S. Democrats accused Trump, a Republican, of soliciting foreign interference in an American election by trying to get a vulnerable ally to smear a domestic political rival, using American aid as leverage. Biden defeated Trump in the November U.S. election.
As vice president under President Barack Obama, Biden oversaw U.S. policy toward Ukraine and sought the removal of the country's top prosecutor at the time, who the United States and Western European countries had viewed as corrupt or ineffective. Trump and his allies made unsubstantiated claims that Biden did so because the prosecutor had been looking into Burisma while his son served on the board.
Zlochevsky, a former Ukraine ecology minister, is now living abroad.
One Burisma probe had related to suspected tax violations. Burisma said in 2017 investigations into the company and Zlochevsky had been closed after it paid an additional 180 million hryvnias ($6.46 million) in taxes.
NEW APPROACH
Venediktova, in her post for just under a year, said she wants to take a different approach in her job than predecessors she described as being ""too political"". 
Asked about Ukraine's fight against corruption, Venediktova dismissed concerns that the independence of the national anti-corruption bureau, known as NABU, had been undermined after the government drafted new legislation on its status that the bureau said would harm its ability to fight high-level graft.
""NABU is now an independent body and will be an independent body in future,"" Venediktova said.
Corruption has been a longstanding issue for Ukraine, and any threat to the independence of NABU, set up with the backing of Western donors, could further derail the flow of foreign aid at a time when its economy has been hammered by lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The International Monetary Fund has told Ukraine it needs to adopt more reforms to unlock further funds from its $5 billion IMF programme.
Venediktova also said she is hopeful that legal cases surrounding PrivatBank would come to a conclusion before the end of the year. The central bank declared PrivatBank insolvent in 2016 and said its poor lending practices blew a $5.5 billion hole in its finances before it was taken into state hands. The lender's former owners dispute this and have fought to reverse the nationalisation.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered air strikes and a ground offensive against the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - the former ruling party in the northern region - after regional forces attacked federal army bases in the region on Nov. 4.
Abiy declared victory less than a month later after the TPLF withdrew from the regional capital, Mekelle, and major towns, but low-level fighting continues. Some senior TPLF members remain at large, though the federal government has captured or killed a number of former officials.
TPLF spokeswoman Liya Kassa outlined the group's preconditions for joining talks to end the conflict in a statement on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of Dimtsi Weyane TV, a station owned by the former ruling party.
Abiy's spokeswoman and the head of the government's taskforce on Tigray did not respond to requests for comment.
During the height of the conflict in November, the government said it would not negotiate until its efforts to restore the rule of law were complete. After declaring victory later that month, it has said it is focused on apprehending senior TPLF members who remain at large.
Among the points made by the TPLF was a demand that Eritrea withdraw its forces from Tigray. Accusations of an Eritrean military presence are one of the most contentious issues in the conflict. 
Eritrea and Ethiopia have both previously denied that Eritrean troops operated on Ethiopian territory. Dozens of eyewitnesses have said they have seen Eritrean troops.
The TPLF also called for the removal of the interim administration appointed by the federal government as fighting raged in November. It said the officials elected in September in a regional vote that Abiy's government called illegal should be allowed to return. 
In the region of more than five million people, thousands of people are believed to have died and 950,000 have fled their homes since fighting began.

Verifying details of the situation has been difficult because communications to Tigray remain difficult and the government tightly controls access.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Authorities in Los Angeles are investigating allegations of domestic violence by rock singer Marilyn Manson, the LA County Sheriff's Department said in a statement on Friday.
""Westworld"" TV and film actress Evan Rachel Wood and three other women said earlier this month in social media posts that Manson had abused them.
On Friday, the LA County Sheriff's Department said its special victims unit was ""investigating allegation(s) of domestic violence involving Mr. Brian Warner also known as 'Marilyn Manson,' who works in the music industry.""
""The incidents occurred between 2009 and 2011 when Mr. Warner lived in the city of West Hollywood,"" the statement said.
No other details were provided.
Representatives for Manson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. On Feb. 1, Manson said on Instagram that all of his intimate relationships had been ""entirely consensual"" and that ""others are now choosing to misrepresent the past."" 
""These recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,"" he said at the time.
Wood, 33, who dated Manson, 52, from around 2007 and was briefly engaged to him in 2010, said the singer ""horrifically abused me for years"" and ""I was brainwashed and manipulated into submission."" 
The three other women also accused Manson of emotional and psychological abuse in the last 10 years.
Manson's record label, Loma Vista Recordings, dropped him in early February after the public accusations. 
The singer and songwriter is known for his Gothic-inspired black outfits and heavy make-up. His hits include ""The Dope Show"" and ""Personal Jesus.""

Dozens of men in entertainment, politics, business and sports have been accused of sexual misconduct or emotional abuse since the #MeToo movement went viral in 2017 following multiple allegations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein was sentenced in 2020 to 23 years in prison.

Earlier this week, Macron urged Europe and the United States to allocate up to 5% of their current vaccine supplies to developing countries in an effort to avoid an unprecedented acceleration of global inequality.
Addressing the Munich Security Conference after U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Macron said the first step should send 13 million doses to Africa - enough, he said, to inoculate all its healthworkers.
""If we announce billions today to supply doses in 6 months, 8 months, a year, our friends in Africa will, under justified pressure from their people, buy doses from the Chinese and the Russians,"" Macron told the conference. ""And the strength of the West will be a concept, and not a reality.""
Macron said 13 million doses amount to 0.43% of all vaccine shots ordered by Europe and America.
Group of Seven leaders earlier in the day reaffirmed their support to the most vulnerable countries.
Oxfam France urged the G7 countries to break the monopoly held by their pharmaceutical companies. That would be the ""fastest, fairest and most effective way to boost vaccine production so that countries don't have to compete for doses,"" the charity said in a statement.
The World Health Organization on Thursday urged nations producing COVID-19 vaccines not to distribute them unilaterally but to donate them to the global COVAX scheme to ensure fairness.

Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates told the conference the politically sensitive gap between vaccinating people in wealthy and developing countries could narrow to half a year if authorities take proper action.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine on Friday announced sanctions on Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent opposition party leader with ties to the Kremlin, and also said it was taking back into state hands a pipeline that transports Russian oil products to Europe. 
Medvedchuk's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
But a statement from Medvedchuk's party on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said: ""Today, Ukraine is one step closer to becoming a dictatorship.""
A wealthy businessman, Medvedchuk is a Ukrainian citizen but has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has said the Russian leader is godfather to his daughter. 
His links to Russia are a problem in Ukraine as relations between the two countries collapsed following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatists in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. 
Sanctioning Medvedchuk follows Ukraine's move at the start of the month to sanction several TV stations owned by an associate of Medvedchuk that Kyiv says were part-financed by Moscow. 
Medvedchuk had said the sanctions on the media outlets were illegal. 
At a briefing on Friday evening, Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, said the security services were investigating Medvedchuk on suspicion of financing terrorism.
Ukraine's state security service (SBU) said the sanctions were linked to its investigation into how coal from mines in the separatist-held Luhansk region was sold to Russia and government-controlled Ukraine. 
Danilov said the sanctions would include a freeze on Medvedchuk's assets but said a full list of measures would be disclosed in a special presidential decree that has not been published yet.
The Kyiv authorities also said they were taking back into state hands the PrykarpatZakhidtrans oil product pipeline.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office said the pipeline officially had two owners registered abroad but was ""affiliated with two citizens of Ukraine"".
""Having considered this issue, the National Security and Defence Council decided to take urgent measures to return the state property to the people of Ukraine. Law enforcement agencies are also tasked with investigating the circumstances in which state property fell into private hands,"" it said.

Ukrainian media have previously suggested the pipeline was under Medvedchuk's control.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday drew a sharp contrast with the foreign policy of his much-derided predecessor, Donald Trump, and urged democracies to work together to challenge abuses by autocratic states such as China and Russia.
In his first big appearance as president on the global stage, an online ""virtual visit"" to Europe, Biden sought to re-establish the United States as a multilateral team player after four years of divisive ""America First"" policies under Trump.
Speaking to the Munich Security Conference, Biden drew a stark contrast with the more transactional foreign policy of Trump, who angered allies by breaking off global accords and threatening to end defense assistance unless they toed his line.
""I know the past few years have strained and tested our transatlantic relationship, but the United States is determined - determined - to re-engage with Europe, to consult with you, to earn back our position of trusted leadership,"" he said.
Several years ago as a private citizen at the Munich Security Conference, Biden reassured participants rattled by the Trump presidency, telling them: ""We will be back."" On Friday, he told the virtual online audience: ""America is back.""
The message of collaboration echoed his message during a private videoconference earlier on Friday with the leaders of the Group of Seven advanced economies, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan, a senior administration official said.
Biden plans to join G7 members for an in-person summit hosted by Britain this summer.
U.S. partnerships had endured and grown through the years because they were ""rooted in the richness of our shared democratic values,"" Biden said. ""They’re not transactional. They’re not extractive. They’re built on a vision of the future where every voice matters.""
He said U.S. allies must stand firm against the challenges posed by China, Iran and Russia, saying Russia was seeking to weaken the transatlantic alliance and calling for unity to counter what he called China's abusive economic practices.
""The Kremlin attacks our democracies and weaponizes corruption to try to undermine our system of governance,"" he said. ""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin seeks to weaken the European project and our NATO alliance. He wants to undermine our transatlantic unity and our resolve,"" Biden said.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied any such action.
Biden stressed what he called America's ""unshakeable"" commitment to the 30-member NATO alliance, marking another switch from Trump, who called NATO outdated and even suggested at one point that Washington could withdraw from the alliance.
Biden also arrived bearing gifts - a $4 billion pledge of support for global coronavirus vaccination efforts, the re-entry of the United States into the Paris climate accord and the prospect of a nearly $2 trillion spending measure that could bolster both the U.S. and global economies.
Biden said the world was at an inflection point, but he was convinced that democracies, not autocracies, offered the best path forward for the world.
CALL FOR COORDINATED APPROACH TO CHINA 
Biden said major market economies and democracies needed to work together to tackle challenges posed by great-power competitors like Russia and China, and challenges ranging from nuclear proliferation to climate change and cybersecurity.
He took particular aim at China, the world's second largest economy, and its failure to abide by international standards, arguing that democracies must shape the rules to govern the advance of new technologies such as artificial intelligence.
""We have to push back against the Chinese government's economic abuses and coercion that undercut the foundations of the international economic system,"" he said.
Chinese companies, he said, should be held to the same standards that applied to U.S. and European companies.
""We must stand up for the democratic values that make it possible for us to accomplish any of this, pushing back against those who would monopolize and normalize repression,"" he said.
The Biden White House is reviewing China policy across all fronts, including its military buildup and trade policies, its actions in Hong Kong, treatment of minority Uighurs in Xinjiang and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
On the challenge posed by Iran's nuclear program, Biden said the United States looked forward to re-engaging in diplomacy amid efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal that Trump abandoned.

The G7 countries, who control a little under half of the world economy, sought at their meeting to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic towards rebuilding their economies with free trade and countering China's ""non-market oriented"" policies.

Each year, dry, dusty winds sweep in from the Sahara and cover much of West Africa and the Gulf of Guinea. The yearly phenomenon, known as the Harmattan season, runs from November through March.
""Those who have toddlers with poor health like mine, who is not yet one year old, cannot work properly,"" said Khoudia Ndiaye, who sells fish at a market in Dakar. ""Yesterday I couldn't work because of the dust, I had to go home."" 
The hazy weather has blanketed Senegal's capital since the start of the week, coating the city with fine dust particles that have prompted health and air quality warnings from the environment ministry. 
In a statement, the ministry urged people to curb outside sporting activities and suggested that children, the elderly and those suffering from respiratory problems remain indoors. The importance of wearing face masks, which have become commonplace in the COVID-19 era, was reinforced.
Authorities in Cameroon this week also warned that a huge plume of Saharan dust carried by Harmattan winds was expected to hit its three northern provinces, reducing visibility. It urged residents not to travel. 
The dust cloud in Senegal reduced visibility to a few dozen metres, leading to a reduction of fishing, an essential source of income for many families, along Dakar's shoreline.
At Soumbedioune, one of the city's main fish markets, a few fishermen loiter around the shipyard. A barely visible red flag flutters in the wind.
""You can see the red flag behind me indicates that it is still dangerous,"" said Moustapha Ndoye, the head of the fishmongers' association. 

Some fishermen have been unable to fish for several days, he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thirty-five U.S. Capitol Police officers are being investigated for their actions during the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, and six have been suspended with pay, the police department said in a statement on Friday.
Five people, including a Capitol Police officer, died in the violence when throngs of former President Donald Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol, overpowering security forces.
Two law enforcement officers later committed suicide.
""Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman has directed that any member of her department whose behavior is not in keeping with the department's rules of conduct will face appropriate discipline,” police department spokesman John Stolnis said.
Details of the investigation were not provided.
A U.S. House of Representatives panel has scheduled a hearing on Feb. 25 to look into Capitol security failures on Jan. 6. Pittman and Acting House Sergeant-at-arms Timothy Blodgett are scheduled to testify.
Investigators have been looking into the response by the Capitol Police officers and whether any of the officers may have aided the rioters, according to congressional aides and some lawmakers.
Just days after the attack, it was disclosed that two officers had been suspended, according to Democratic Representative Tim Ryan. One had taken a selfie with a protester, while another wore a Trump-supporting hat and was directing protesters around the building, Ryan told reporters.
It was unclear whether the two were among the 35 now being investigated or whether they were trying to quell the crowd by establishing personal contact with rioters.
The right-wing protesters went to Capitol Hill shortly after Trump addressed a crowd near the White House, telling them: ""We fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.""
The rioters went to the seat of the U.S. Congress, temporarily blocking lawmakers from formally certifying Joe Biden's victory in the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election, following repeated attempts by Trump to reverse that outcome.

One week after the riot, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives impeached Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection. The Senate failed to convict him when most Republicans voted for an acquittal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. land borders with Canada and Mexico will remain closed to non-essential travel until at least March 21, the one-year anniversary of the restrictions to address COVID-19 transmission concerns, the U.S. government said Friday.
The new 30-day extension is the first announced under President Joe Biden and comes as the White House has been holding meetings about potentially tightening requirements for crossing at U.S. land borders in North America, officials said.
Canada has shown little interest in lifting the restrictions and recently imposed new COVID-19 testing requirements for some Canadians returning by land crossings.
On Jan. 26, the U.S. government began requiring nearly all international air travelers to get negative COVID-19 test results within three days of travel, but has no similar requirements for land border crossings.
In an executive order issued last month, Biden directed U.S. officials to ""immediately commence diplomatic outreach to the governments of Canada and Mexico regarding public health protocols for land ports of entry.""
It added U.S. agencies should submit a plan to Biden within 14 days ""to implement appropriate public health measures at land ports of entry.""
""The plan should implement CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines, consistent with applicable law, and take into account the operational considerations relevant to the different populations who enter the United States by land,"" it said.

""I do believe in NATO,"" Macron said during the Munich Security Conference, more than a year after causing confusion among other members of the transatlantic military alliance by saying NATO was ""experiencing brain death"".
""I do believe NATO needs a new political momentum and clarification of its strategic concept. NATO needs a more political approach,"" he added, speaking after the first G7 meeting attended by U.S. President Joe Biden.
Since his election in 2017, Macron has been pushing for the European Union to stand on its own feet when it comes to security, and no longer rely solely on U.S. military protection inherited from World War Two.
His comments on NATO's ""brain death"", coupled with his decision to seek more cooperation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, had caused consternation among some European allies, especially in eastern Europe, which sees the United States as the only credible protection from neighbouring Russia.
""I do believe the best possible involvement of Europe within NATO is to be much more in charge of its own security,"" Macron said on Friday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Group of Seven leaders, who control a little under half of the world's economy, on Friday sought to look beyond the COVID-19 pandemic towards rebuilding their battered economies with free trade and to countering China's ""non-market oriented"" policies.
U.S. President Joe Biden and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi debuted at the G7 virtual leaders' meeting which was chaired by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
The leaders called for stronger defences against a future pandemic, including exploring a global health treaty, but the focus was on a green recovery - on the same day that the United States rejoined the Paris climate agreement.
""Jobs and growth is what we're going to need after this pandemic,"" Johnson told the opening of the meeting. 
An official communiques said the G7 would champion open economies, ""data free flow with trust"" and work on ""a modernised, freer and fairer rules-based multilateral trading system"".
After Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) cut news feeds in Australia, French President Emmanuel Macron raised the role social media platforms should have in preserving freedom of speech and how to regulate them, a French official said on Friday.
G7 leaders also supported the commitment of Japan to hold the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 this summer.
In a clear reference to China, they said they ""will consult with each other on collective approaches to address non-market oriented policies and practices"".
But the tone of the G7 was distinctly cooperative and collective - as Biden tried to project a message of re-engagement with the world and with global institutions after four years of Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies.
The COVID-19 pandemic has killed 2.4 million people, tipped the global economy into its worst peacetime slump since the Great Depression and upended normal life for billions.
'MUTE ANGELA'
Even at the virtual top table of world politics, the ""mute curse"", which has stilted video calls for millions of businesses and families over the past months of COVID-19 lockdown, struck.
As Johnson began the meeting, a German voice suddenly interrupted him.
""Can you hear us Angela,"" Johnson quipped to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, chuckling. ""I think you need to mute.""
Johnson also claimed that Biden had ""nicked"" - British slang for stolen - his slogan ""build back better"", though Johnson said that he himself had probably stolen it from somewhere else. 
Once the mute problems were over, leaders pledged billions of dollars to COVAX, a coronavirus vaccination programme for poorer countries.

101,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",UK's Prince Philip set to remain in hospital until early next week,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, is likely to remain in hospital until next week, a royal source said on Friday, adding that doctors were acting out of an abundance of caution and the duke remains in good spirits.
Queen Elizabeth's 99-year-old husband was admitted to hospital on Tuesday as a precautionary measure after feeling ill with an ailment that is not related to COVID-19.
""Following consultation with his doctor the Duke of Edinburgh is likely to remain in hospital for observation and rest over the weekend and into next week,"" the source said. 
""As we have said previously the doctor is acting with an abundance of caution. The Duke remains in good spirits.""
Both Philip and the 94-year-old queen received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in January.
The Duke was admitted to the private King Edward VII's Hospital in central London after feeling unwell for a short period, Buckingham Palace said on Wednesday.
He spent four nights at the same hospital at the end of 2019 while being treated for a pre-existing condition. 
Philip is now rarely seen in public. He stepped down from official engagements in August 2017 after completing more than 22,000 solo events and thousands more alongside the queen.
A former naval officer renowned for his sometimes brusque manner and humour, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947, five years before she became queen. He is now by far the longest-serving consort of any British monarch.
During the pandemic the royal family has visited hospitals and frontline workers, either online or in person, to thank them for their efforts. 
Earlier on Friday Buckingham Palace said Prince Harry and his wife Meghan had made a final split with the family, telling the queen that they would not be returning as working royals.

Harry, who is grandson to the queen and brother of heir William, sent shockwaves through the monarchy in January 2020 by suddenly announcing that he and his wife were embarking on a new future across the Atlantic - one of the most extraordinary royal exits in decades.

The resolution adds to growing calls in the U.S. Congress for President Joe Biden's administration to push Communist Party rulers in Beijing to respect human rights.
House lawmakers on Thursday reintroduced a bipartisan bill that would ban imports from China's Xinjiang region unless it is certified they are not produced with forced labor, and allow further sanctions against Chinese officials responsible for abuses against Uighur Muslims.
Lead sponsors of the Hong Kong resolution introduced on Friday include Representative Greg Meeks, the Democratic chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Representative Michael McCaul, the panel's top Republican.
Critics see a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in June 2020 as a blunt tool to stifle dissent and curb media freedom and other liberties in the former British colony of Hong Kong, that returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The law calls for tougher media regulation and supervision.
The government says Hong Kong's rights and freedoms, guaranteed under the handover agreement, remain intact.
Since the law was introduced, many prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested, while some songs and slogans have been banned, along with anything that may be considered political activity in schools.

The resolution introduced on Friday encourages the Biden administration to work with other countries to hold the Chinese government accountable and to push U.S. companies to be aware of the risks the Chinese national security legislation poses to U.S. security, citizens and long-term business interests.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States should consult the Taliban on any extension of a May 1 deadline for a full U.S. troop pullout from Afghanistan and should not decide unilaterally, the Pakistani ambassador to the United States said on Friday.
Ambassador Asad Majeed Khan's comments come as the Biden administration conducts a review of a February 2020 deal with the Taliban that is expected to determine whether it will meet the deadline to withdraw the last U.S. soldiers from America's longest war.
U.S. and European officials say the Taliban have not fulfilled commitments they made in the accord and that conditions are not conducive to advancing the peace process amid a surge in violence blamed on the insurgents.
The Taliban, seeking to reimpose Islamic rule in Afghanistan after their 2001 ouster at the hands of U.S.-led troops, deny the charges and indicate they will resume attacks on U.S. and allied troops unless the May deadline is kept.
Khan told an online forum sponsored by the Stimson Center that U.S. officials should consult the Taliban before deciding whether to maintain the last 2,500 U.S. troops in Afghanistan. 
""That is where the process should start,"" Khan said. ""To present this as a fait accompli, I think, will only create difficulty.""
Khan's comments were significant as Pakistan, which helped facilitate the U.S.-Taliban negotiations in Doha that clinched the February 2020 deal, wields considerable influence with the insurgents.
The insurgents have sanctuaries in Pakistan, whose main military-run intelligence service gives them support, according to U.S. and Afghan officials. Pakistan denies the allegation. 

""If there is strong justification and reasoning to have an extension for logistical or other reasons, the parties have overcome difficulties ... before in terms of reaching common ground,"" Khan said. ""It's really also a question of the credibility of the United States.""

The nine-month jail sentence of Pablo Hasel, known for his fiercely anti-establishment raps, has galvanised a debate over freedom of expression in Spain, prompting the government to announce it would make freedom of speech laws less restrictive and sparking protests that, at times, turned violent.
""Democracy protects freedom of speech, including the expression of the most awful, absurd thoughts, but democracy never ever protects violence,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told an event, promising to ""widen and improve freedom of speech"".
On Friday, a few hundred university students marched in Barcelona demanding Hasel's release in a largely peaceful rally, whose most dramatic moment was when some protesters tossed eggs at the police headquarters. 
The mood was in marked contrast to the last three nights when police fired tear gas and foam bullets at demonstrators who set fire to trash containers and motorcycles and looted stores. There were also clashes in the capital Madrid and other cities.
Organisers have called more protests on Friday night and over the weekend.
Officials said around 60 people have been arrested across Catalonia, where Barcelona is located. One woman lost an eye during clashes in Barcelona, triggering calls from politicians to investigate police tactics.
Rights group Amnesty International called for legal changes in Spain, saying that anti-terrorism and gagging laws also unfairly limited people's right to demonstrate their disapproval in the streets. 

""Spain is a country with freedom of expression, of course, but there are threats to that freedom,"" Amnesty head for Spain, Esteban Beltran, told Reuters.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Families of people killed in the Beirut port explosion last August protested on Friday for a second day after a court removed the lead investigator into the blast in a severe setback to their campaign to hold those in power to account.
Around 70 people gathered in front of Beirut's Palace of Justice on Friday, some burning tires to block roads or holding images of their dead relatives.
""Even when the case now goes to another judge, we will not give them our complete trust...the day that we discover a judge is being too lenient with the investigation we will stand up to them no matter who they are,"" said Rima al-Zahed, 41, whose brother Amin died in the blast.
Judge Fadi Sawan charged three ex-ministers and the outgoing prime minister with negligence over the blast in December, but the four did not appear for questioning and accused him of overstepping his powers.
On Thursday, the Lebanese court of cassation dismissed Sawan from the investigation upon a request from two former ministers he had levelled charges against. The court cited ""legitimate suspicion"" over Sawan's neutrality, partly because his house was damaged in the blast which devastated much of the capital.
""No one in the political class wants an investigation like this,"" Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said. 
""That would open up a Pandora (OTC:PANDY)'s box of justice and these are politicians used to getting away with major crimes since the Lebanese civil war...the judiciary is one of the most distrusted institutions in the republic."" 
Two hundred people died in the August blast when a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate, stored unsafely for years, detonated at the capital's port. 
Before the investigation can resume, the ministry of justice will have to appoint a new judge to lead it who will also need the approval of the higher judicial council, setting the whole process back. 
For some the judge's dismissal is a blow, but Lebanese analyst Sarkis Naoum does not believe a domestic investigation will ever deliver any real results. 
""Our state has become a failed state which means failed security agencies, failed institutions, failed judiciary and failed everything so I never believed that judge Sawan was going to reach anything,"" Naoum said. 
The Aug. 4 blast, the largest non-nuclear explosion to date, killed two hundred people, injured thousands and destroyed entire neighbourhoods. 
Documents seen by Reuters showed both the president and prime minister had been warned just over two weeks before the blast that the ammonium nitrate, stored unsafely for years, could destroy the capital if it exploded. 
Around 25 people are currently in jail pending investigation over the blast so far, including the Beirut port chief and customs chief. No senior politicians have been held accountable so far. 
""Those in jail they are the small fish,"" Naoum said. 
With the lead investigator appointed by Lebanon's executive, and the use of a court of exception, the investigation does not lend itself to impartiality, said Lynn Malouf, Amnesty International deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. 
""I wouldn't say this move took us back to square zero because we were always at square zero from the very beginning,"" she said.
The court of exception is a special court set up to have jurisdiction over cases referred to it by the government such as assassinations of senior politicians and cases linked to political violence and terrorism. 
""It was set up with the view of the politicians being the victims rather than the perpetrators,"" Malouf said. 
""A domestic-led investigation cannot deliver on justice."" 
But so far there has been little interest in an international investigation into the blast. Hage Ali sees a different kind of search prevailing. 

""A search by the Lebanese political class for a scapegoat...no politician will be indicted unless there is political consensus over a scapegoat,"" he said.

The battle over the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) with an estimated cost of more than 100 billion euros ($120.4 billion) has intensified since Spain officially joined the project late last year.
The three countries still disagree over intellectual property rights and workshares, with French company Dassault demanding 50% of the workload, security sources told Reuters on Friday.
The disagreements run so deep, there are considerations by now to build three demonstrators instead of one, further driving up the cost of the project, they said.
The Berlin government refused to give any details on the status of the negotiations after the latest round of talks of the defence ministers of Germany and France on Thursday.
The government was still planning to send the budget proposal for the next tranche of project payments to parliament before general elections in September, a defence ministry spokesman in Berlin said.
On Wednesday, a meeting of defence officials from France, Germany and Spain, as well as Dassault, Airbus and Indra, failed to reach a breakthrough.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron kicked off the ambitious venture in 2017, when the EU was rattled by Britain's decision to leave the bloc and deeply divided over other issues such as the migrant crisis.
But it has become mired in mistrust and differing visions between Berlin and Paris as well as corporate infighting over workshare, according to insiders.

At the beginning of February, Merkel and Macron failed to settle the issue, leaving open when the next tranche of payments of at least 5 billion euros can be released.

Two other lawmakers from the HDP, the parliament's third largest, had their parliamentary status revoked last year, after convictions against them became final. Revocation of their status means they are no longer a member of the assembly.
President Tayyip Erdogan, his AK Party and their allied Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) accuse the HDP of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). HDP denies links to terrorism.
Many of the party's prominent members have been investigated, tried and jailed over terrorism charges. Selahattin Demirtas, the party's former leader and one of Turkey's most prominent politicians, has been in jail for more than four years.
The HDP has came under renewed pressure this week after 13 captive Turks were found to have been killed by PKK militants in a cave in northern Iraq.
State-owned Anadolu news agency said on Friday the Court of Cassation approved a jail sentence of two years and six months against HDP lawmaker Omer Faruk Gergerlioglu over spreading terrorism propaganda. 
The ruling means the sentence is final, which could lead to his parliamentary status being revoked.
Another investigation was launched against Gergerlioglu this week after he said on Twitter that the Turks who were killed by the PKK could have survived if the government had made efforts to rescue them.
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, has been waging an insurgency in the mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
Turkey's recent fight against the PKK has increasingly focused on northern Iraq, where the group has its stronghold in the Qandil mountains.

110,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 10:31AM ET</span>",Dutch curfew to remain in place pending Feb. 26 ruling: court,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A night-time curfew in the Netherlands intended to slow the spread of coronavirus will remain in place for a least a week, after a high court decided on Friday it would rule on the measure's legality only on Feb. 26.
The decision gives some breathing room to Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government, which has argued the curfew is vital to slow a third wave of coronavirus cases.
Protesters and political opponents say the curfew, the first seen in the Netherlands since World War Two, is a unnecessary restriction on freedoms. 
The dispute has raged ahead of elections next month. Opinion polls show opposition to lockdown measures increasing, although Rutte and his conservative VVD Party are favoured to win at the March 15-17 elections.
On Tuesday a lower court agreed with anti-lockdown group ""Virus Waarheid"" or ""Virus Truth"" that the 9 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. curfew, which triggered street protests when it was brought in last month, lacked legal justification and ordered it scrapped.
Rutte's government won a temporary stay of that decision, which the Hague Appeals Court extended at Friday's hearing until it rules on Feb. 26. 
In a separate effort to keep the curfew in place, Rutte's government has drafted an emergency bill explicitly giving it power to enforce the curfew. The Senate is due to vote on that bill later on Friday.
At the appeals court hearing, government lawyers cited experts from the country's National Institute for Health (RIVM) as saying a third wave of coronavirus cases is underway due to the more infectious variant first discovered in the UK, which is now causing most Dutch infections.
""Apparently Virus Truth believes that a disaster must occur first before the state can do anything about it,"" government lawyer Reimer Veldhuis told judges. 
Jeroen Pols of Virus Truth told judges that the curfew was akin to locking people up before they have committed any crime. 
""On this line of reasoning, all our freedoms will be limited and I can tell you we'll soon all be sitting in an open penitentiary institution,"" he said, pointing to other measures currently in place including bans on public meetings of more than two people and a limit of one visitor to a home at a time.

Police have issued 26,000 fines since the curfew was introduced on Jan. 23 - to protesters and those flouting the time limit - that may have to be reversed if the lower court ruling is upheld.

112,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 09:25AM ET</span>",Iran will reverse nuclear actions when U.S. lifts sanctions: Zarif,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will ""immediately reverse"" actions in its nuclear programme once U.S. sanctions are lifted, its foreign minister said on Friday, reacting coolly to Washington's initial offer to revive talks with Tehran aimed at restoring the 2015 nuclear deal. 
President Joe Biden's administration said on Thursday it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to the accord, which aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons while lifting most international sanctions. Former President Donald Trump left the accord in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran.
Tehran said Washington's move was not enough to persuade Iran to fully respect the accord.
When sanctions are lifted, ""we will then immediately reverse all remedial measures. Simple,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter.
Since Trump ditched the deal, Tehran has breached the accord by rebuilding stockpiles of low-enriched uranium, enriching it to higher levels of fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up production. 
Tehran and Washington have been at odds over who should make the first step to revive the accord. Iran says the United States must first lift Trump’s sanctions while Washington says Tehran must first return to compliance with the deal.
However, a senior Iranian official told Reuters that Tehran was considering Washington's offer to talk about the revival of the deal.
""But first they should return to the deal. Then within the framework of the 2015 deal, a mechanism to basically synchronise steps can be discussed,"" the official said. 
""We have never sought nuclear weapons and this is not part of our defence doctrine,"" the Iranian official said. ""Our message is very clear. Lift all the sanctions and give diplomacy a chance."" 
Adding to pressure for a resolution to the impasse, a law passed by the hardline parliament obliges Tehran on Feb. 23 to cancel the sweeping access given to U.N. non-proliferation inspectors under the 2015 deal, limiting their visits to declared nuclear sites only.
The United States and the European parties to the accord have urged Iran to refrain from taking the step, which will complicate Biden's efforts to restore the pact. 
SHORT-NOTICE INSPECTIONS
""We have to implement the law. The other party must act quickly and lift these unjust and illegal sanctions if they want Tehran to honour the deal,"" said the Iranian official.
The IAEA's short-notice inspections, which can range anywhere beyond Iran’s declared nuclear sites, are mandated under the IAEA’s “Additional Protocol” that Iran agreed to honour under the deal. 
In London, UK junior foreign minister James Cleverly reiterated that Iran had to resume compliance with the deal, adding the West should not send signals that it is prepared to overlook Tehran's breaches of the accord.
Some Iranian hardliners said Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's tough stance had forced Washington to cave in. On Wednesday he demanded “action, not words” from the United States if it wants to restore the deal.
""They have reversed some measures ... It is a defeat for America ... but we are waiting to see whether there will be action on lifting sanctions,"" state media quoted Tabriz city's Friday prayer leader Mohammadali Ale-Hashem as saying. 
Biden has said that he will use the revival of the nuclear deal as a springboard to a broader agreement that might restrict Iran’s ballistic missile development and regional activities.
Tehran has ruled out negotiations on wider security issues such as Iran’s missile programme.

""I am happy, but not hopeful at all. I don’t trust America. It's never been trustworthy. They may well be tricking us and the world again,"" Pirouz, an architect, told Reuters from Tehran.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's air force scrambled on Friday after eight Chinese fighter aircraft flew into the southwestern part of its air defence zone in another display of stepped-up military activity around the democratic island.
Beijing, which claims Taiwan as Chinese territory, says it is responding to what it calls ""collusion"" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's main international backer and weapons supplier.
The Taiwanese Defence Ministry said four Chinese J-16s and four JH-7s as well as an electronic warfare aircraft flew near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the top part of the South China Sea.
The air force scrambled, with ""radio warnings issued and air defence missile systems deployed to monitor the activity,"" the ministry said.
Chinese aircraft fly in the southwestern corner of the zone on an almost daily basis, though the last such large-scale incursion was on Jan. 24 when 12 Chinese fighters were involved.
There was no immediate comment from China.
Shortly before the ministry's statement, Taiwan announced a reshuffle of senior security officials including a new, U.S.-trained defence minister, to help bolster military modernisation and intelligence efforts.
President Tsai Ing-wen has pledged to defend the island and has made modernising its armed forces a priority, including developing a fleet of new submarines, buying new F-16 fighters from the United States and upgrading its warships.
National Security Bureau Director-General Chiu Kuo-cheng, who graduated from the U.S. Army War College in 1999, would replace Yen De-fa as defence minister, Presidential Office spokesman Xavier Chang told reporters.
The president expected Chiu to complete the next stage of military reforms, including planning for ""asymmetric warfare"", focusing on high-tech, mobile weapons designed to make any Chinese attack as difficult as possible, Chang said. 
Chiu's old job as intelligence chief will be taken by Taiwan's top China policy-maker, Chen Ming-tong, now head of the Mainland Affairs Council.
""The most important task of the National Security Bureau is to understand and have a grasp on China,"" Chang said.
They will take up their posts next week.
China announces its 2021 military budget next month at the annual meeting of parliament, a figure closely watched as an indication of its strategic intentions. Last year it set a rate of increase at a three-decade low as the economy wilted during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Chinese military expert Ni Lexiong, a retired professor at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, said this year it would likely get a big boost, partly due to the increased tensions over Taiwan.

""If the mainland wants to liberate Taiwan it needs to make preparations for war, so we need to pump up our equipment,"" he said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain has given a full two-shot course of coronavirus vaccines to almost all its elderly nursing-home residents, the FED care-home association said on Friday, restoring some sense of security to the most vulnerable section of the population. 
Separately, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the country, which has administered 2.8 million doses and fully inoculated 1.14 million people, was on track to vaccinate 20 million people in the first half of 2021 out of a population of 47 million.
Nearly 43,000 care-home residents died of COVID-19 or suspected infection in the devastating March-May first wave of contagion, and prosecutors are investigating more than 200 cases of potential criminal negligence at such homes.
But more than 97% of residents have now been vaccinated across Spain's 17 regions, according to the FED, putting nursing homes among the country's safest places.
""They are very positive data that allow us to be optimistic about the future,"" said FED's president Ignacio Fernandez Cid. ""Immunity will allow us to gradually return to the longed-for lost normality.""
Health Emergency Chief Fernando Simon said earlier this week that for the first time since the start of the pandemic, people over 65 who live in care homes have a lower rate of infection than those who live outside, supporting the thesis, if indirectly, that the vaccines are having an effect.
Frontline (NYSE:FRO) medics and care workers are the only people under 65 to receive a vaccine so far.
Spain will now give shots made by Pfizer-BioNTech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) to people over 80, while AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s drug will go to key workers under 55.
With a third wave quickly receding, Spain's two-week infection rate hit 321 cases per 100,000 people on Thursday, from almost 900 cases at the end of January, prompting several regions to relax measures.

Madrid on Thursday pushed its curfew back an hour to 11 p.m. and on Friday lifted travel restrictions on 31 neighbourhoods.

Thousands of police officers were on standby ahead of an expected parliamentary vote on Saturday, in anticipation of another protest.
The protest is part of the youth-led anti-government movement that emerged last year to demand the resignation of one-time coup leader Prayuth, and also broke longstanding taboos by calling for reform of the powerful monarchy.
The activists took turns speaking on a makeshift stage on the road leading to parliament, criticizing the prime minister and his cabinet of abuse of power, mismanagement and policy failures in various areas.
""We know that it will be difficult to stop this government inside parliament,"" Sukriffee Lateh, a student activist, told Reuters.
""So our movement outside will help the public better understand the real problems that ordinary people face from this government,"" he said.
The censure debate began on Tuesday, led by an opposition that accused Prayuth and nine members of his cabinet of various failings. 
The prime minister is expected to survive the no-confidence vote on Saturday along with his cabinet.
The police says all protests in Bangkok are illegal, citing the ban on public gatherings since a second wave of coronavirus infections began in December.
Police Major General Piya Tavichai, deputy commissioner of Bangkok Metropolitan Police Bureau, said the police had deployed 900 officers around parliament and put 11,850 officers on standby for the weekend. 

Last week, police clashed with protesters demanding the release of four activists jailed pending trial on charges they insulted the monarchy, a crime in Thailand punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A Delhi court granted a police request on Friday to extend the detention of climate activist Disha Ravi who they accuse of sedition for her alleged role in the creation of an online ""toolkit"" intended to help farmers protesting reforms.
The 22-year-old Ravi, who is part of an organisation founded by Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg, appeared in court following her arrest in Bengaluru last weekend in a case that has raised concerns about a crackdown on dissent.
Police allege that Ravi was involved in creating and sharing an online document containing advice for protesters. Police say this document stoked the violence that took place on India's Republic Day last month when farmers stormed the famous Red Fort in the old quarter of Delhi.
Police have registered a case of sedition against Ravi, which carries a life term.
""This court remands the accused, Disha Ravi, to judicial custody for three days,"" judge Akash Jain said.
Ravi did not speak herself but denied the accusations against her through her lawyer Siddarth Agarwal, arguing in court that police had no evidence to back them up.
""There is nothing against me, please consider this,"" Agarwal told the court on her behalf.
Senior lawyers and lawmakers have criticised the sedition case, disputing the allegation by police that the document in question incited violence.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been trying to get farmers to back down from their months-long protest on the outskirts of Delhi against three new laws to deregulate the vast and antiquated farm produce market. 
It has offered to hold the laws in abeyance and water down some the provisions.
But the farmers want Modi to repeal the laws altogether and provide legal backing for minimum price support for their produce and their long campaign in Delhi's biting cold has drawn a growing band of supporters at home and overseas.

Thunberg also briefly tweeted a link to the document that police are investigating before withdrawing it. She has made no comment on the detention of Ravi's who is one of the leaders of her Fridays for Future (FFF) movement.

   Since nearly 200 countries signed the 2015 pact to prevent catastrophic climate change, the United States was the only country to exit. Former President Donald Trump took the step, claiming climate action would cost too much. 
    U.S. climate envoy John Kerry will take part in virtual events on Friday to mark the U.S. re-entry, including appearances with the ambassadors to the UK and Italy, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres and U.N. climate ambition envoy Michael Bloomberg.
    Biden has promised to chart a path toward net-zero U.S. emissions by 2050. Scientists have said that goal is in line with what is needed, while also stressing that global emissions need to drop by half by 2030 to prevent the most devastating impacts of global warming.
""Climate change and science diplomacy can never again be 'add-ons' in our foreign policy discussions,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. ""It is vital in our discussions of national security, migration, international health efforts, and in our economic diplomacy and trade talks.""
Kerry along with Biden’s domestic climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, are crafting new regulations and incentives aimed at speeding the deployment of clean energy and transitioning from fossil fuels. 
    Those measures will form the backbone of Washington’s next emissions reduction goal, or Nationally Determined Contribution, to be announced before a global climate leaders summit Biden will host on April 22. The next U.N. climate conference is in November in Glasgow. 
   Biden also has also signed more than a dozen executive orders related to climate change, and has mobilized every federal agency https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-biden-climate-factbox/factbox-biden-mobilizes-the-federal-government-to-tackle-climate-change-idUSKBN29W30X to help shape the government's response. 
    Despite the excitement over the U.S. return to global negotiations, climate negotiators say the path forward will not be easy. Biden’s climate goals face political challenges in the United States, opposition from fossil fuel companies and some concern among foreign leaders about U.S. flip-flopping on climate policy. 

    ""There’s a lot of ground to make up, but the hope of Paris is alive and strong,"" said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

The BBC's investigative news programme Panorama on Tuesday published a video it said was of Latifa, one of the ruler of Dubai's daughters, saying that she was being held against her will in a barricaded villa.
""We raised our concerns about the situation in light of the disturbing video evidence that emerged this week. We requested more information and clarification about Sheikha Latifa's current situation"", Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, told an online briefing in Geneva.
The OHCHR agency had approached the country's permanent mission in Geneva on Thursday, she said.
""Given the serious concerns about Sheikha Latifa, we have requested that the government's response comes as a matter of priority....We did ask for proof of life,"" she added, adding the agency would continue to monitor the situation closely.
The UAE Foreign Ministry referred all enquiries to the Dubai government's media office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Sheikh Mohammed's law firm in London, to whom the Dubai Media Office referred enquiries earlier this week, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum drew international attention in 2018 when a human rights group released a video made by her in which she described an attempt to escape Dubai.
Last March, a London High Court judge said he accepted as proved a series of allegations made by Sheikh Mohammed's former wife, Princess Haya, in a legal battle, including that the sheikh ordered the abduction of Latifa. The sheikh's lawyers rejected the allegations. 
""I am a hostage and this villa has been converted into a jail,"" Latifa, 35, said in the video published by the BBC on Tuesday.
""All the windows are barred shut, I can't open any window."" She said she was making the video in the bathroom of the villa, the only room she could lock herself into.
Reuters could not independently verify when or where the video was recorded.

Security forces fired tear gas and stun grenades in some neighbourhoods in the capital Libreville and Port Gentil to disperse protesters who had set up barricades, burning tyres and debris.
Gabon restricted travel in and out the capital city, and expanded curfew hours to limit travel and slow the spread of coronavirus infections last week.
Among the measures that sparked the protests was the decision to extend a nationwide curfew, starting two hours earlier at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT) until 6 a.m.
""The new 6 p.m. measure is harsh and thoughtless,"" law student Sarah Lewoubi, said on Friday. 
She added that most Gabonese workers and students, who don't have cars, struggle to get home before the curfew hour. 
""Work ends at 4 p.m. and it is impossible to reach our homes for most part before 8 p.m. because of traffic jams and others hassles. So the government must review this matter,"" Lewoubi. 
A spokesman for the government was not immediately available to comment. Gabon has reported 13,107 coronavirus infections, and 75 coronavirus-related deaths since the pandemic began. 
The central African nation is witnessing a second wave of infections and is reporting 133 new infections on average each day.

Porfirije, 59, Serbia's 46th Patriarch is seen as a modernist inside the conservative church. He is the successor to Patriarch Irinej, who died in November from COVID-19 at the age of 90.
Porfirije will lead a church of about 12 million people in Serbia, the other five former Yugoslav republics, Kosovo, and dioceses in the United States, Australia and Western Europe.
Flanked by bishops in their ornate robes, Porfirije was handed over a crosier, a stylized staff that is a symbol of his office and a white stiff hat.
Another part of the enthronement will be Porfirije's takeover of the throne at the Pec monastery in Kosovo, the medieval seat of Serbian Orthodox patriarchs and it is expected in the coming weeks.
In a sermon, Porfirije said that Kosovo, Serbia's former southern province, mainly populated by Albanians, would remain in the focus of the church's policies. 
""Kosovo is for us ... an umbilical cord that links us with the essence of our identity,"" he said.
Serbs and their church regard Kosovo as the cradle of their Orthodox Christianity and it is the home to some of their most important religious sites.
Belgrade lost control over Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombed its forces to end a bloody counterinsurgency against Albanians there. 
The church and the government in Belgrade enjoy the backing of Russia, a traditional Slavic and Orthodox Christian ally, in their refusal to recognise independent Kosovo.
Serbia is a European Union membership candidate, but before it joins the bloc, it must mend ties with Kosovo and allow it to join international bodies, including the United Nations. 

Most in the crowd, including Porfirije, did not wear face masks, despite a surge in coronavirus infections in the country.

LONDON (Reuters) - The chief of Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service publicly apologised on Friday for historic discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT+) people in the spy agencies before 1991. 
Britain decriminalised homosexual acts between men in 1967, but its spy agencies refused to hire gay, lesbian and transgender officers until 1991 because they believed they would be susceptible to blackmail.
""Until 1991, being openly LGBT+ in MI6 would cause you to lose your job or prevent you from being allowed to join in the first place,"" said Richard Moore, chief, or C, of the Secret Intelligence Agency (SIS).
""Committed, talented, public-spirited people had their careers and lives blighted because it was argued that being LGBT+ was incompatible with being an intelligence professional,"" Moore said. ""This was wrong, unjust and discriminatory.""
Moore said that such misguided policies had deprived Britain's spy services of talent and that some staff who ""came out"" after 1991 were treated badly for failing to have disclosed their sexuality during vetting.
SECRETIVE 
""Others who joined in the period post-1991 were made to feel unwelcome,"" Moore said. ""We still have more to do to become a fully inclusive employer, and my goal for MI6 is to make it a workplace where you can always bring your true self to work.""
Britain's notoriously secretive spy services - SIS, the MI5 Security Service and GCHQ eavesdropping agency - have been trying for several years to present a much more open and enlightened image as they search for broader talent.
Despite the previously discriminatory rules, some of the most famous characters in British intelligence history were gay, including Guy Burgess, an MI6 officer and diplomat, who was also a Soviet mole and who fled to Moscow in 1951.
Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who is now considered to be the father of modern computing, broke the German naval Enigma code for British spies during World War Two.
He was gay, disgraced and was found guilty of gross indecency. He lost his security clearance and was no longer allowed to work for GCHQ. 

He was forced to have hormonal injections and in 1954 committed suicide aged 41 by eating an apple laced with cyanide.

SAN DIEGO, Calif. (Reuters) - The United States will on Friday begin rolling back one of former President Donald Trump's strictest immigration policies, allowing in the first of thousands of asylum seekers who have been forced to wait in Mexico for their cases to be heard.
President Joe Biden pledged while campaigning to immediately rescind the Trump policy, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). Under the program more than 65,000 non-Mexican asylum seekers were denied entry and sent back across the border pending court hearings. Most returned home but some stayed in Mexico in sometimes squalid or dangerous conditions, vulnerable to kidnapping and other violence. 
Now they will be allowed into the United States to wait for their applications to be heard in immigration courts. The effort will start slowly, with only limited numbers of people being admitted on Friday at the port of entry in San Ysidro, California.
It will expand to two additional ports of entry in Texas, including one near a migrant encampment in Matamoros, Mexico, in the coming week, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman.
The administration estimates that only 25,000 people out of the more than 65,000 enrolled in MPP still have active immigration court cases and is set to begin processing that group on Friday. But it has cautioned that the efforts will take time. 
Biden officials say they expect eventually to process 300 people per day at two of the ports.
The Biden administration is treading carefully, wary that the policy shift could encourage more migrants to trek to the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. officials say anyone who seeks to enter and is not a member of the MPP program will be immediately expelled.
A group of Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Biden on Feb. 10 that said allowing MPP migrants to enter the United States ""sends the signal that our borders are open.""
The United States, Mexico and international organizations have scrambled in recent days to figure out how to register migrants online and by phone, transport them to the border, test them for COVID-19 and get them to their destinations in the United States, people familiar with the effort said.
The fast-moving process and lack of information from U.S. officials has frustrated some advocates eager to assist the effort.
The situation has taken on urgency as a winter storm has brought frigid temperatures to much of the southern United States and northern Mexico. 
Migrants in the sprawling Matamoros encampment have reported children and families struggling to stay warm in makeshift tents lacking insulation or other protection from the cold. The camp has grown in recent weeks as migrants anticipate the end of the MPP program, but DHS has said that processing will not begin there until Feb. 22.
On Thursday, Honduran asylum seeker Antonia Maldonado served hot chocolate from a steaming pot on a stove made from the inside of a washing machine to other asylum seekers in Matamoros shivering in the near freezing weather.
She has been taking goodbye photographs and making plans to leave with her partner, Disón Valladares, a fellow asylum seeker she met on the journey to Matamoros.
""He wants me to go first, and I want him to go first,"" she said. They are hopeful that once they enter the United States they will be able to marry.
Those seeking asylum may not have their cases resolved for years due to COVID-related immigration court closures and existing backlogs, according to Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the pro-immigrant American Immigration Council.
The delay would give the Biden administration time to reverse some Trump policies that sought to make it harder to obtain asylum, he said.

In the meantime, migrants will be released to the United States and enrolled in so-called ""alternatives to detention"" while awaiting their hearings, a U.S. official said last week. Such programs can include check-ins with immigration authorities as well ankle bracelet monitoring.

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying made the comments in response to a question from a state media journalist on calls by western countries for an investigation into alleged human rights abuses in its western Xinjiang region.
During her lengthy response, made at a regular ministry news conference, Hua repeated China's denials of abuse of Muslims in the region, and said that Australia, Canada and the United States had histories of genocide.
But she also contrasted the vulnerability of many Texans with the festive experience of Chinese during the recently-completed Lunar New Year holiday. State and social media in Communist Party-led China frequently draw attention to crises in the United States and other western countries.
""Not to be wanting of food or clothing, not to be hungry or cold, this is the fundamental human right that is the most real,"" she said.
""In the meantime in Texas ... millions of people found themselves caught in the terrible situation of not having electricity and heating at home, a few tens of people even lost their lives because of this,"" she said.
""This gave the Chinese people a deeper appreciation for what is the real human right, and made us believe more strongly that China is on the right path. We are fully confident about our future,"" she said.
The bitter cold spell in the United States has killed at least 21 people in Texas and knocked out power to more than four million people in the state, with more than 13 million Texans seeing interruptions in their water services.

Since U.S.-China relations worsened during the previous administration of Donald Trump, many Chinese diplomats have taken to social media with an aggressively nationalistic posture known as ""Wolf Warrior"" diplomacy.

The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to name as early as Friday companies it believes are helping build Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany, according to sources, a move that could prompt sanctions on the nearly completed project.
Diplomats have also said that the European Union is set to impose travel bans and asset freezes on allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in March in response to the jailing of Navalny this month by a Russian court. 
""We still hope that our interlocutors' common sense approach to the situation will prevail and we will not go further down the path of sanctions pressure, which has already repeatedly demonstrated its inefficiency,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. 
The European Court of Human Rights said on Wednesday that Moscow should immediately free Navalny, whose arrest and jailing sparked street protests in cities across Russia.
The Kremlin said such a call amounted to unacceptable meddling in its internal affairs.
Navalny was arrested last month upon returning from Germany following treatment for poisoning with what many Western countries say was a military-grade nerve agent.
Putin, who makes a point of never uttering Navalny's name, has said Russian state security agents would have ""finished the job"" if they had wanted to kill Navalny who he suggested was not important enough to eliminate.
The Kremlin has questioned whether Navalny was poisoned at all and denied any Russian state involvement if he was. 

Navalny, 44, was jailed on Feb. 2 for alleged parole violations that critics say were politically motivated charges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In 1995, Merrick Garland was tasked with supervising a sprawling U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation into the bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people.
Former colleagues recall that he maintained his composure as he surveyed the crime scene, coordinated the investigation among numerous law enforcement agencies and put together a trial team to bring bomber Timothy McVeigh and his co-conspirator Terry Nichols to justice. 
""It really was one of those things that took a lot of organization, coordination, smarts. Merrick Garland had it all,"" said Donna Bucella, a former Justice Department colleague who worked alongside him in the aftermath of the bombing.
Now, 26 years later, the threat of domestic terrorism is once again at the forefront of Justice Department's agenda as Garland, 68, prepares for a new role as President Joe Biden's pick for attorney general. The topic is likely to be a major theme on Monday when Garland appears for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
If confirmed by the full Senate, he will inherit the beginnings of a probe into the deadly Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters, as well as the challenge of preventing future domestic attacks.
Garland will also face the daunting task of rebuilding a civil rights enforcement program that many advocates say was left in tatters by the Trump administration, promoting initiatives to eliminate racial disparities in criminal justice, and restoring morale among Justice Department employees, whom Trump repeatedly attacked as being part of a ""deep state.""
""He will have his hands full with many different priorities,"" said Jamie Gorelick, a former deputy attorney aeneral who attended Harvard University with Garland in the early 1970s and in 1994 tapped him to serve as her principal deputy.
Garland has served as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of 13 federal appeals courts, since 1997.
Former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated him to the Supreme Court in 2016 while Biden was vice president, but the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate refused to hold hearings on the nomination.
His confirmation this time around is considered a near-certainty, as several key Senate Republicans have endorsed him.
FRAUGHT TIME
Garland would take the helm of the department at a fraught moment, after the May 25 police killing of George Floyd led to widespread protests over systemic racism and police violence against African Americans.
In accepting Biden's nomination, Garland said he believes the department's top priorities will be ""ensuring racial equity"" and ""meeting the evolving threat of violent extremism.""
""If confirmed, those are the principles to which I will be devoted as attorney general,"" he said.
Gorelick recalled that Garland was a strong advocate for civil rights even in college, when he served with her on a committee that fought for female students to have equal access to basic things from post-grad fellowships to tickets to football games.
""Merrick was a staunch ally in these debates. He was as great a feminist as you could find on campus,"" she said.
Beyond policy, part of the task of attorney general will also be to restore confidence in the department's independence.
Under former Attorney General William Barr, many career prosecutors were dismayed to see Barr intervene directly in criminal cases in ways that benefited Trump's political allies, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and Trump's longtime friend Roger Stone.
""He has a very demoralized institution after Barr and Trump, and so I think his top priority will be to reinvigorate the department,"" said Mark Tuohey, a defense attorney who argued against Garland during a six-month civil negligence and breach of contract case against a savings and loan bank and its executives in the late 1980s. 

""The department has really been in a very different course the last four years, and he has got to reorient, and realign, and he'll do it.""

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Gunfire and rockets exploded on Friday in Mogadishu as Somali government forces clashed with opposition supporters angered by delayed elections, fighting that could split the military along clan lines and strengthen the al Qaida-linked insurgency. 
Video sent to Reuters from an anti-government demonstration showed civilians in facemasks - accompanied by friendly soldiers in red berets with ammunition belts wrapped around them - waving Somali flags scattering before gunfire erupted. Reuters journalists nearby could hear intermittent gunfire as well as heavier explosions. 
""Many forces heavily attacked us, I am now on my chest in an alley. This is a massacre,"" protester Farah Omar told Reuters by phone. He said Turkish-trained special forces troops known as Gorgor were among those attacking demonstrators. 
Another video showed flames where a rocket propelled grenade hit a row of shops opposite the airport entrance. 
The spillover of political rivalries into open conflict will dismay Somalia's allies and play into the hands of the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency, which mounts attacks on civilians around East Africa in its bid to install strict Islamic law.
""The military is dissolving and many troops seemingly reverting to clan loyalties,"" said Colonel Ahmed Abdullahi Sheikh, who served for three years until 2019 as the commander of Somalia's elite U.S.-trained Danab unit.
""It's a mess. There’s no longer any command structure whatsoever."" 
""My fear is that many SNA (Somali National Army) outstations will leave their bases to come and participate in the fighting and give more ground to al Shabab. This will really empower al Shabab. Over a decade’s worth of gains might be lost,"" he told Reuters. 
OVERNIGHT ATTACKS
Hours before the demonstrations, Somalia's former president, Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, accused government troops of attacking a hotel where he was staying with another former president ahead of Friday's rally.
""Farmajo attacked us with armoured vehicles. That is dictatorship. He attacked us and residents at Maida hotel,"" Ahmed tweeted after the attack, referring to President Mohammed. ""We ask all civilians to come out and respond.""
Somalia's minister of security Hassan Hundubey Jimale accused the opposition of starting the fighting.
""Armed militia attacked government forces. We repulsed and overpowered the militias,"" Jimale said in an overnight statement.
Mogadishu resident Ahmed Aden, 44, told Reuters on Friday he had to flee during the night's gunbattles.
""Last night we took our children and mattresses on our shoulders and fled before war started,"" he said. ""We returned at gunpoint. Turkish-made armoured vehicles and government forces blocked every road and alley.""
POLITICS BY OTHER MEANS
Without mediation, the fighting has the potential to spread quickly. Somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991; both government and opposition can call on heavily armed supporters. 
President Mohamed - often known by his nickname ""Farmajo"" or ""cheese"" - is a from the powerful Darod clan. But most military units in and around the city of Mogadishu are from the Hawiye clan - heavily represented in the opposition alliance. 
Somali lawmakers were due to select a new president on Feb. 8, but the process was delayed after the opposition accused Mohamed, who is seeking a second term, of packing regional and national electoral boards with supporters. 
Somalia's opposition alliance says Mohammed's term has expired and he is no longer president. The stand-off imperils Somalia's recent history of peaceful transitions, said former national security adviser, Hussein Sheikh Ali, who now runs the Mogadishu-based Hiraal Institute thinktank.
""Somalia – although known as a failed fragile country – has had some success in terms of power exchanging hands peacefully,"" he said. ""This is the first time that is under threat.""
Residents were ""incensed"" about the crackdown on protesters, he said, after the city had welcomed Mohamed - an outsider - as president when he was elected. 

""People in this city feel humiliated. They cannot tolerate someone who is not respecting any rule – either the rule of law or the customs of Somalia,"" he said.

""Firstly, I want a comprehensive police investigation into what happened to me … and for my perpetrator to face the full force of the law,"" Brittany Higgins said in the statement, reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
Reuters has been unable to contact her.
Police in the capital Canberra confirmed they had spoken to a woman in April 2019 over the alleged incident though she chose not to make a formal complaint at that time.
Higgins, who worked as a media advisor to then Defence Industry Minister Linda Reynolds, says she had not been encouraged to make a police complaint. Reynolds, who is now defence minister, denies Higgins was pressured against making an official complaint.
“The prime minister has repeatedly told the parliament that I should be given ‘agency’ going forward,” Higgins said in her statement. “I don’t believe that agency was provided to me over the past two years but I seize it now.”
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison apologised to her for the way her complaint was handled at that time, ordering a probe into the government's workplace culture.
Morrison has since announced three investigations to look at what support is available to staff, processes in place for dealing with complaints as well as the broader workplace culture issues and steps needed to bring parliament in line with other institutions. 
In her statement, Higgins said she has advised the Prime Minister's Office that she expected to have a voice in framing the scope and terms of reference for the review, ABC reported.
Morrison's Liberal Party has been dogged by allegations of improper behaviour towards women.
In 2019, female backbench lawmakers said they felt bullied to support a move to oust then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, while a former female Liberal staff member last year made an official complaint of improper behaviour by then immigration minister Alan Tudge. 

Tudge has denied the allegation.

Ankara had ordered more than 100 stealth fighters and has been making parts for their production, but was removed from the programme in 2019 after it bought the Russian S-400 missile defence systems, which Washington says threaten the F-35s.
It has now hired law firm Arnold & Porter for ""strategic advice and outreach"" to U.S. authorities, in a six-month contract worth $750,000 which started this month.
Ankara has said its removal from the programme was unjust, and President Tayyip Erdogan has said he hopes for positive developments under U.S. President Joe Biden.
The contract was signed with Ankara-based SSTEK Defence Industry Technologies, owned by the Turkish Presidency of Defence Industries (SSB), Ankara's main defence industry authority.
Arnold & Porter will ""advise on a strategy for the SSB and Turkish contractors to remain within the Joint Strike Fighter Program, taking into consideration and addressing the complex geopolitical and commercial factors at play,"" the contract said.
Despite Turkey's removal from the programme, and sanctions imposed on Turkey's defence industry in December, the Pentagon has said it will continue to depend on Turkish contractors for key F-35 components.
Turkey's communications director Fahrettin Altun said Turkey had already paid for some F-35 jets. ""Even a hangar fee was taken from Turkey for the jets it could not take delivery of,"" he told a NATO-related event on Thursday.

Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, speaking after a NATO defence ministers' meeting, said he had ""brought to the clear attention of our allies that licensing restrictions, attempts for sanctions or even the threat of sanctions against Turkey"" only weaken the alliance.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's highest court on Friday found news portal Malaysiakini in contempt over comments about the judiciary posted by readers, a ruling condemned by rights groups as a clampdown on free speech.
The Federal Court found Malaysiakini was fully responsible for publishing readers' comments that were critical of the judiciary and fined the news portal 500,000 ringgit ($123,762).
The landmark ruling comes on the heels of increasing concerns from rights groups over a crackdown on dissent under Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin. 
It could also influence how news sites and social media platforms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter manage user comments in a country where traditional media is largely pro-establishment or linked to the state.
The ruling came after Malaysia's attorney-general last year sought to cite Malaysiakini and its editor-in-chief Steven Gan for contempt over five comments posted by readers on its website that it said undermined public confidence in the judiciary.
""The impugned statements had gone far and wide... the content was spurious and reprehensible in nature and the content involved allegations of corruption which were unproven and untrue,"" said judge Rohana Yusuf.
Malaysiakini and Gan had maintained that they could not be held responsible and that the offending comments had been immediately removed after they were contacted by police.
The fine was more than double the 200,000 ringgit prosecutors had sought, though the court cleared Gan of any offence.
As one of the few independent news outlets in the country, Malaysiakini has often attracted scrutiny from authorities. It has long provided a platform for the opposition and been critical of the establishment.
Gan said last month that in the two decades since he founded Malaysiakini, its journalists had been declared traitors, faced debilitating cyber-attacks, been kicked out of press conferences, arrested, and raided by the police.
After the hearing, Gan expressed disappointment with the court's decision, which he said put a burden on news and technology companies to control comments posted by external parties.
""It will have a chilling effect on discussion of public issues in the country and delivers a body blow on our campaign to fight corruption in the country,"" Gan told a news conference.

Rights groups, the United States and other foreign missions in Malaysia said the decision raised concerns about a free press and public discourse.
""The use of contempt of court laws to censor online debate and silence independent media is yet another example of the shrinking space for people to express themselves freely in the country,"" Amnesty International's Malaysia chapter said in a statement.
Authorities questioned Al Jazeera journalists last year and raided the broadcaster's office amid a probe into a programme they aired on the treatment of foreign workers. A foreign worker who spoke critically of Malaysia in the programme was deported.
The government had denied that it was clamping down on media freedom.
The ruling may also have broader implications for how social media companies like Facebook and Twitter manage their sites, especially as the case involved comments by third parties, said Malaysiakini's lawyer, Malik Imtiaz Sarwar.
""I would think it is safe to say that you could similarly take issue with postings or comments on Facebook or Twitter. But it's still premature and I think we should wait for the judgments,"" Malik said.
Facebook and Twitter declined to comment.
Malaysiakini launched a fundraiser, seeking public support for the penalty imposed by the court. It raised more than 500,000 ringgit in four hours.

Attacks by armed groups against civilians intensified in 2020 and victims are targeted along ethnic lines, often with the support of government and opposition forces, the report by the U.N.'s Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan said.
The scale of violence exceeds that of 2013 to 2019, commission chairwoman Yasmin Sooka said.
Hundreds of people were killed, and hundreds of thousands more displaced during fighting in Central Equatoria, Warrap, Jonglei, and Greater Pibor, the report said.
Women and girls have been ""abducted, raped, gang-raped, and sexually enslaved, and in some instances are forcibly married,"" the commission said in a press release.
Commission member Andrew Clapham said the scale of the violence and the fact that local groups were using newer weapons suggested either the involvement of state forces or external actors.
Acting military spokesman Santo Domic Chol said it was not the first time the commission had issued such a report.
""We are not against your report, but you need to share it with us so that if there are areas of mistakes that some of our institutions has undertaken, we can change,"" he said.
  However, the government and the army would not accept
negative campaigns against institutions waged through the media, he said.
South Sudan won independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of civil war. Violence erupted in late 2013 after President Salva Kiir, from the Dinka ethnic group, sacked vice president Riek Machar, a Nuer. 
The two men have signed many deals to end a war estimated to have killed more than 400,000 people. They repeatedly pushed back deadlines to form a government of national unity, but a year ago finally did so. 
In February 2020, Kiir swore in former rebel leader Machar as his vice president. The government later appealed for donor funding to implement the deal, saying it did not have enough money to do so on its own.

132,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 04:42AM ET</span>",Myanmar protester dies after 10 days on life support; pressure on army grows,"(Reuters) - A young woman protester in Myanmar who was shot in the head last week as police dispersed a crowd died on Friday, her brother said, marking the first death among opponents of the Feb. 1 military coup since they began demonstrating two weeks ago.
News of her death came as police and soldiers arrested about 50 people in the northern town of Myitkyina, a human rights activist said, after breaking up a procession carrying banners of detained government leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, who had just turned 20, had been on life support since being taken to hospital on Feb. 9, after she was hit by what doctors said was a live bullet at a protest in the capital, Naypyitaw.
""I feel really sad and have nothing to say,"" said her brother, Ye Htut Aung, speaking by telephone.
Her death could become a rallying cry for the protesters who were again on the streets on Friday. 
""I'm proud of her and I'll come out until we achieve our goal for her,"" protester Nay Lin Htet, 24, told Reuters at a rally in the main city of Yangon.
Friday marks two weeks of daily demonstrations against the military's seizure of power and the arrest veteran democracy campaigner Suu Kyi.
The protests in towns and cities throughout the ethnically diverse country have been more peaceful than the bloodily suppressed demonstrations during nearly 50 years of direct military rule up to 2011.
But police have fired rubber bullets several times to break up crowds. The army says one policeman died of injuries sustained in a protest.
In Myitkyina, baton-wielding police and soldiers sent protesters scattering down a street lined with shops, video on social media showed. 
Rights activist Stella Naw said about 50 people had been detained. ""The military truck is just picking people up from the protest,"" she said.
Clashes have occurred in the town, the capital of Kachin State, over the past two weeks with police firing rubber bullets and using catapults to disperse crowds.
Police in Yangon sealed off the city's main protest site near the Sule Pagoda, setting up barricades on access roads to an intersection where tens of thousands have gathered this week.
Hundreds of people gathered at the barricades anyway, a witness said, while a procession of several thousand formed at another protest site near the university and set off for the city centre.
'SYMBOLIC' SANCTIONS 
As well as the protests, a civil disobedience campaign has paralysed much government business and international pressure is building on the military.
Britain and Canada announced new sanctions on Thursday and Japan said it had agreed with India, the United States and Australia on the need for democracy to be restored quickly.
The junta has not reacted to the new sanctions. On Tuesday, an army spokesman told a news conference that sanctions had been expected.
There is little history of Myanmar's generals giving in to foreign pressure and they have closer ties to neighbouring China and to Russia, which have taken a softer approach than long critical Western countries.
Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing was already under sanctions from Western countries following the 2017 crackdown on the Muslim Rohingya minority.
""Sanctioning military leaders is largely symbolic, but the moves to sanction military companies will be much more effective,"" said Mark Farmaner, director of the Burma Campaign UK group, in a reaction to the sanctions.
Youth leader and activist Thinzar Shunlei Yi applauded Britain's asset freezes and travel bans on three generals as well as steps to stop any aid helping the military and to prevent British businesses working with the army. Canada said it would take action against nine military officials. 
After decades of military rule, businesses linked to the army have a significant stake across the economy in the country of 53 million people, with interests ranging from banking to beer, telecoms and transport.
The army seized back power after alleging fraud in Nov. 8 elections won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, halting a transition to democracy that had begun in 2011 and detaining her and hundreds of others.
Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said 521 people had been detained as of Thursday. Of them, 44 had been released.
Protesters have called for the recognition of last year's election as well as the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees.
Suu Kyi, 75, faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as charges of illegally importing six walkie talkie radios. Her next court appearance has been set for March 1.

She spent nearly 15 years under house arrest for her efforts to bring democracy and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her struggle.

Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing died on Friday while in intensive care at a hospital in the capital Naypyitaw, where she had been on life support for 10 days since she was shot by police cracking down on demonstrators.
The first known serious casualty of Myanmar's biggest protests in over a decade had stirred anger across the country, adding to the growing fury over the military's Feb 1 overthrow of Aung San Suu Kyi's government, three months after her party won a second successive election in a landslide. 
""I feel really sad about her. I am more determined to come out on street,"" said 24-year-old Nay Lin Htet at a protest in the commercial hub Yangon. 
""I feel proud of her and I will come to the streets until we achieve our goal for her. I have no concern for my security.""
Many members of the anti-coup movement that has rallied for two weeks across Myanmar are of the same Generation Z as Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, a grocery store worker who was a teenager when she was shot, and turned 20 while in intensive care. 
The shooting triggered memories of the bloody suppression of uprisings against a half-century of brutal military rule, in which thousands were killed and many more thrown in jail for years.
She is one of two reported deaths associated with the protest movement, the other a policeman who the military said died of injuries sustained on Monday. 
Within hours of her shooting, videos and images went viral on social media of the moment Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing, wearing a motorcycle helmet and red T-shirt, slumped to the ground with her back turned to the police, who doused crowds with water cannon.
In the days that followed, protesters marched holding aloft pictures of her, with placards calling for an end to dictatorship. 
The day after her shooting, they hung the first of several huge portraits of her from a bridge in downtown Yangon, with a banner that read: ""Lets together oppose the dictator who kills the people"".
""Shooting at a peaceful protester with real bullets is such an unforgivable thing in our society,"" said a doctor who was part of the team that gave her initial treatment, responding to her death. 
The doctor, who asked to remain anonymous due to safety fears, said Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing's story had given impetus to a civil disobedience movement in Myanmar, which medical personnel have been a central part of. 
Her brother Ye Htut Aung had last week recounted how his sister, who voted for the first time in the November election, had been determined to go to the capital to join the demonstration, and knew police were carrying guns. 
He confirmed she had passed away around 11 a.m. local time on Friday while on life support. 
""I feel really sad and have nothing to say,"" he said.
""I am thankful for all of those who have been praying for her.""

Crown Prince Mohammed, who is also Saudi Defence Minister, reviewed bilateral relations with Austin, especially in defence cooperation, state news agency SPA said. 
Austin reaffirmed the importance of the strategic defence partnership between the two countries, and said the United States was committed to helping Riyadh defend itself, condemning attacks launched into the kingdom by the Houthi group in Yemen. 
Austin said in a statement he had a productive call.
""We discussed the continued commitment to the 70 year US-Saudi security partnership, and I'm looking forward to working together to achieve regional security & stability,"" he said.
U.S. President Joe Biden said this week he plans to recalibrate U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and will conduct diplomacy through Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz rather than his powerful son the crown prince, widely referred to as MbS. 
Biden is returning to ""counterpart to counterpart"" engagement, the White House said.
Saudi has led a military coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen since early 2015. 
Austin thanked MbS for Saudi efforts towards a political solution in Yemen and said the two countries had a shared commitment to confronting the threat posed by the Iranian leadership in the region, the SPA report of the meeting said.
MbS is considered by many to be the kingdom's de facto leader and is next in line to the throne held by 85-year-old King Salman. MbS's prestige suffered a blow after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the hands of Saudi security personnel seen as close to the crown prince.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's government review of public broadcaster RTHK has found deficiencies in editorial management and a lack of transparency in handling complaints, signalling a major overhaul of the revered institution as concerns grow over media freedom.
The only independent, publicly funded media outlet on Chinese soil, Radio Television Hong Kong was founded in 1928 and is sometimes compared to the British Broadcasting Corporation. Its charter guarantees it editorial independence.
It angered Hong Kong's government, the police, and Beijing with its coverage of 2019 anti-government protests that shook the Asian financial hub, including several investigations that sparked widespread criticism of authorities.
""There are deficiencies in (the) editorial management mechanism,"" the Commerce Bureau said in a 154-page report of its review released on Friday. 
There were ""no well-defined and properly documented editorial processes and decisions,"" and no ""clear allocation of roles and responsibilities among editorial staff,"" it added. ""Weak editorial accountability is observed.""
The government-led review focusing on aspects of RTHK’s governance and management was announced last year, spanning the issues of administration, financial control and manpower.
However, the union of the broadcaster's staff said the review ""challenges the bottom line of logic"".
In a statement, it added, ""Editorial autonomy has vanished into nothing."" 
Earlier on Friday, Hong Kong appointed deputy secretary for Home Affairs Patrick Li as director of broadcasting, from March 1. 
Li, a career bureaucrat who worked in the government's constitutional and mainland affairs and security bureaus, but has no experience in media, will replace veteran journalist Leung Ka-wing, six months before his contract expires.
Leung, whose management the review has described as too ""passive"", was not thanked for his service in the government notice of the new appointment, contrary to practice. Beijing has said patriots must run every public institution in Hong Kong.
The broadcaster ""serves residents of the city instead of bureaucrats,"" its staff union said. 
""It’s a whole body operation,"" said Bruce Lui, a former host of RTHK's 'China on the dot' radio programme.
""It’s foreseeable that sensitive reporting that, for example, might involve criticising China's Communist Party will be hard to do,"" added Lui, who is now a journalism lecturer at Hong Kong Baptist University. 
Pro-Beijing supporters regularly file complaints against RTHK and stage protests outside its headquarters, accusing it of anti-government bias.
Last week, RTHK said it was suspending the relay of BBC radio news after China barred the BBC World News service from its networks, highlighting how media in the former British colony are falling under Beijing's tightening sway.
When Beijing expelled about a dozen journalists working for U.S. news outlets last year, it also barred them from relocating to Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Critics see a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing in June 2020 as a blunt tool to stifle dissent and curb media freedom and other liberties. The law calls for tougher media regulation and supervision.
The government says rights and freedoms remain intact.
Since the law was introduced, most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested, while some songs and slogans have been banned, along with anything that may be considered political activity in schools.
Media tycoon and Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, the founder of the popular Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid, is the highest profile activist charged under the new law, accused of colluding with foreign forces.

Hong Kong's ranking fell to 80 in the global press freedom index of Reporters Without Borders in 2020, from 18 in 2002. China ranks 177th.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has criticised UN rights experts for their concerns about constitutional changes made in the Muslim-majority territory of Kashmir, where militants have been fighting for independence for three decades, and said the officials lacked neutrality. 
Two Special Rapporteurs on minority issues and freedom of religion or belief said in a statement on Thursday that the Indian government's decision last year to end Jammu and Kashmir state's autonomy and enact new laws could curtail the political participation of Muslims.
Muslims and other minority groups also stood to lose on issues such as employment and land ownership, they said.
Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said that Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India and the changes made in its status were enacted by parliament. 
One of the changes was that laws that were in force in the rest of India would also apply to the people of Kashmir, allowing them the same legal rights as the rest of India, he said. 
""This press release calls into question the larger principles of objectivity and neutrality that the SRs (Special Rapporteurs) are mandated by the Human Rights Council to adhere to,"" he said in a statement late on Thursday night.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has maintained it revoked Kashmir's special status in an effort to integrate the revolt-torn region in India and open it up for faster economic growth.
Srivastava said the experts had issued their statement just when India was hosting a group of ambassadors in Kashmir to show them the ground situation and did not wait for a response from the Indian government to their questionnaire.
""Instead, they chose to release their inaccurate assumptions to the media. The press release has also been deliberately timed to coincide with the visit of a group of ambassadors to Jammu and Kashmir,"" he said.
More than 50,000 people have died in an uprising against New Delhi's rule in Kashmir that began in 1989, by government count. Others put the toll at well over 100,000.
Arch rival Pakistan claims Kashmir to be its own and has twice gone to war with India over the territory.

The UN experts said that the new laws could pave the way for outsiders to settle in Kashmir and alter the demographics of the region.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's prime minister assured there were no safety issues with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s coronavirus vaccine on Friday, as the government held final drills ahead of next week's scheduled rollout of the first vaccines.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, which was developed with Britain's Oxford University, was the first to win approval in South Korea, but it has been dogged by questions over its efficacy among older people and concerns over side effects.
""The vaccine was granted approval in around 50 countries and recently got emergency approval from the World Health Organization,"" said Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun. ""I repeat, there is no issue with safety.""
The authorities have said they will not use the British vaccine on people aged 65 and older until more efficacy data becomes available, reversing an earlier decision.
Health authorities in some European countries are facing resistance to AstraZeneca's vaccine after side effects led hospital staff and other front-line workers to call in sick.
Some South Korean health care workers, who are first in line to receive the vaccine next week, have expressed similar concerns, amid worries and uncertainty among the broader public.
A Gallup Korea survey released on Friday found that 71% of respondents were worried about vaccine side effects, but an equal number said they would nevertheless get a vaccine when it becomes available.
The country's drug safety ministry granted final approval for a shipment of 1.57 million doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford coronavirus vaccine this week, as authorities gear up to begin vaccinating health care workers on Feb. 26.
Aside from AstraZeneca, South Korea has also reached agreements with Pfizer/BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA),  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and global vaccine-sharing scheme COVAX, for the supply of their vaccines. 
Plans call for about 10 million high-risk people to be inoculated by July with the aim to reach herd immunity by November. The chief of the South Korean Medical Association and some experts have cast doubt on that timeline, calling it practically an impossible goal.
The defence ministry in charge of transport of the vaccine held a drill on Friday to practice shipping the AstraZeneca products to a local clinic.
The military mobilised its army, navy and the air force to move the shots from SK Chemical's drugmaker arm SK bioscience's production facility in Andong city, some 100 kilometres (62 miles) southeast of Seoul, across the country. The drill also involved military aircraft and helicopters to deliver to Jeju island.

As of midnight Thursday, there were 561 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 86,128 with 1,550 deaths, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said.

The tally of confirmed infections is 10.96 million, the second highest after the United States, with more than 156,000 deaths. But actual infections could range as high as 300 million, a government serological survey showed this month.
In recent days, 75% of India's new cases have been reported from the southern state of Kerala and Maharashtra, home to Mumbai, a densely populated city of 20 million people. The two states already had the highest number of reported infections.
Health experts suggest the re-opening of educational institutes in Kerala and resumption of suburban train services in Mumbai could be key factors.
After a gap of 11 months, Mumbai resumed on Feb. 1 full suburban train services, which before the pandemic carried a daily average of 8 million people. 
The city has begun hiring marshals to enforce mask wearing. Out of nearly 5,000 marshals, around 300 would be deployed on the rail network, city authorities said.
Indians have largely given up on masks and social distancing, Reuters reporting shows. 
""Coronavirus ... has not yet left the country,"" the health ministry said on Twitter. ""We still need to follow COVID-appropriate behaviour. No carelessness till there is a cure.""
Despite the recent rise infections, India's daily tally of new cases remains well below a mid-September peak of nearly 100,000. Testing numbers have also fallen to about 800,000 a day from more than 1 million.

Since starting its vaccine campaign in mid-January, India has administered nearly 10 million doses, aiming to cover 300 million people by August.

139,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 19, 2021 01:50AM ET</span>","Divided over Draghi, Italy's 5-Star has an identity crisis","By Gavin Jones, Angelo Amante and Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's 5-Star Movement, once a prototype for successful populist and anti-establishment parties around Europe, is at a crossroads. Does it fully embrace the political mainstream, or revert to being an outsider?
With support ebbing, its fate could shape Italian politics for years to come, and the battle lines over its future have been drawn.
When the head of state asked former European Central Bank head Mario Draghi on Feb. 2 to try to form a government, and so end Italy's political stalemate, 5-Star's leadership immediately ruled out supporting him.
But its founder, 72-year-old former comedian Beppe Grillo, had other ideas. Four days later, he rushed from his home in Genoa for a crisis meeting in Rome with about 30 of 5-Star's top lawmakers. 
At the encounter in a conference room in the capital's labyrinthine Chamber of Deputies, he made clear 5-Star's initial decision should be reversed, according to a lawmaker who was present.
""When we walked in Grillo was pretending to talk to someone on the telephone; it was a kind of comedy act,"" said the source, who declined to be named because the meeting was private. ""He was discussing ... why we should be part of the government.""
Some 5-Star politicians and voters are deeply unhappy with the line imposed by Grillo.
At Draghi's first vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday, 23 of 5-Star's 92 senators defied the party line and refused to back him. 5-Star's caretaker leader Vito Crimi said most of them would be expelled.
POPULIST WAVE
If 5-Star emerges from its crisis further weakened or transformed into a mainstream progressive party, it could mark the end of the populist wave which swept Italy at the last election and which alarmed financial markets and its European partners.
Matteo Salvini's League has already shifted out of the far-right camp to get behind Draghi.
In some ways, 5-Star has followed a similar trajectory to other populist parties in southern Europe such as Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain.
All three achieved power, but have been absorbed into the mainstream they vowed to fight and seen their support wither. 
""I don't know what you should call us now. Maybe the anti-anti-establishment party?,"" 5-Star lawmaker Raphael Raduzzi told Reuters. ""We have to ask ourselves what we want to become.""
Grillo gave up day-to-day involvement in 5-Star's affairs about five years ago, but when crucial decisions are to be made he is still the one who calls the shots.
Shortly before his meeting with 5-Star parliamentarians, he wrote a blog post calling for the new government to name a minister for ecological transition with full responsibility for energy policy.
Grillo had already spoken to Draghi and received an assurance this ministry would be created in return for 5-Star's backing, a source close to the 5-Star founder told Reuters.
Grillo, who communicates with the public mainly through his blog, declined to comment for this article.
Draghi's spokeswoman confirmed Grillo and Draghi spoke about the government's formation.
""They agreed over the importance of creating a government with a strong emphasis on ecological transition,"" she said.
ECOLOGY
Ecology has always been a central part of 5-Star's platform. It is one of the five policy ""stars"" from which it takes its name. Sustainable transport is another.
Italy, unlike Germany and France, has never had a successful Green party and Grillo is eyeing that gap in the hope of saving his party from gradual extinction.
Huge sums as well as high ideals are involved. The European Commission has ordered that policies to fight climate change must account for 37% of its Recovery Fund set up to help the bloc's battered economies, the largest single component.
In Italy's case that means 70 billion euros ($85 billion) to spend on green transition over the next six years.
""Now the environment. Whatever it takes,"" Grillo tweeted this week under an Andy Warhol-style multicolour diptych of Draghi, in reference to the former ECB chief's famous 2012 pledge to do ""whatever it takes"" to save the euro.
5-Star is the largest force in parliament thanks to its triumph at a 2018 election when it took 33% of the vote, double the tally of its nearest rival.
It now has less than 15%, making it Italy's fourth largest party, and desperately needs a new identity.
It has four ministers in Draghi's newly formed cabinet, but for many members, supporting the government of a former ECB chief is unacceptable. Doing so in a coalition with sworn enemies makes matters worse.
Founded in 2009 as a channel for protest against the perceived corruption and cronyism of Italy's political and business elite, 5-Star espoused internet-based direct democracy and vowed never to form alliances with traditional parties.
In the last three years it has ruled in two coalitions, with the right and centre-left, and is now set to govern with both at once.
""For me this is a step too far,"" said Raduzzi, a lower house deputy who opposed joining the government of technocrats and career politicians.
FUTURE LEADER?
Raduzzi has not left the party, unlike one of its most popular figures - Alessandro Di Battista - who writes frequent articles attacking Draghi or members of his government.
Di Battista, a charismatic 42-year-old firebrand, walked out after the decision to back Draghi, but his followers expect him to return when the time is right and see him as a future leader.
The battle for 5-Star's future is likely to be fought over the opposing visions of Di Battista on the one hand and Grillo on the other.
Grillo, for now in the driving seat, wants to transform 5-Star into an environmentalist, pro-EU party allied with the centre-left Democratic Party to compete with Salvini's rightist bloc.
Di Battista wants 5-Star to avoid a structural alliance with the left and to regain its old anti-establishment spirit, with a more critical stance towards the EU and big business.
""I believe this government is suicide for the 5-Star Movement and is bad for Italy,"" Di Battista told Reuters. He did not rule out a return to 5-Star's ranks in the future. 
The risk for 5-Star, currently in the hands of the uncharismatic Crimi, is that whatever path the party takes, by the time of the next election in 2023 its decline will be irreversible.
The slump in 5-Star's support was not altogether surprising, given it is an anti-establishment party also in government. Without sufficient seats in parliament to rule alone, the movement also joined forces with either the left or right.
Unlike the leftist Syriza and Podemos, or the far-right National Rally in France and Austria's Freedom Party, 5-Star has always presented itself as an ideology-free movement with voters from the left and right alike.
Some political commentators believe its best chance of revival lies with former Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who has no party affiliation but is close to 5-Star.
The message Conte posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on his last day as prime minister received more than a million likes, a record for an Italian politician. He promised to ""continue the path"" of his 16-month, left-leaning government in future.
Millions of 5-Star voters, and some of its politicians, hope he does so as their leader.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison vowed on Friday to press ahead with laws to force  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to pay news outlets for content, saying he had received support from world leaders after the social media giant blacked out all media.
Facebook stripped the pages of domestic and foreign news outlets for Australians and blocked users of its platform from sharing any news content on Thursday, saying it had been left with no choice ahead of the new content laws.
The move, which also erased several state government and emergency department accounts, as well as nonprofit charity sites, caused widespread outrage.
Morrison, who blasted Facebook on its own platform for ""unfriending"" Australia, said on Friday the leaders of Britain, Canada, France and India had shown support.
""There is a lot of world interest in what Australia is doing,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney.
""That is why I invite ... Facebook to constructively engage because they know that what Australia will do here is likely to be followed by many other Western jurisdictions.""
Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault said late on Thursday his country would adopt the Australian approach as it crafts its own legislation in coming months.
The Australian law, which will force Facebook and Google to reach commercial deals with Australian publishers or face compulsory arbitration, has already been cleared by the federal lower house and is expected to be passed by the Senate within the next week.
Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he had spoken to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg for a second time following the news blackout. 
""We talked through their remaining issues and agreed our respective teams would work through them immediately. We'll talk again over the weekend,"" Frydenberg said in a tweet.
In its statement announcing the move in Australia, Facebook said the Australian law ""misunderstood"" its value to publishers. Frydenberg earlier told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that ""there is something much bigger here at stake than just one or two commercial deals. This is about Australia's sovereignty"".
Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc owned Google had campaigned together against the laws with both threatening to withdraw key services from Australia if the laws took effect.
Google, however, announced a host of preemptive licencing deals over the past week, including a global agreement with News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA).
Facebook restored some government pages later on Thursday, but several charity, nonprofit and even neighbourhood groups remained dark.
WEB TRAFFIC SLUMPS
Facebook's move had an immediate impact on traffic to Australian newsites, according to early data from New York-based analytics firm Chartbeat. 
Total traffic to the Australian news sites from various platforms fell from the day before the ban by around 13% within the country and by about 30% outside the country, the Chartbeat data showed. 
Similarly, traffic to the Australian news sites from Facebook alone plummeted from around 21% to about 2% within Australia, and from around 30% to about 4% outside the country. 
News Corp Australasia Executive Chairman Michael Miller, testifying at an unrelated parliamentary hearing, confirmed the impact but said the number of Australians visiting the company's websites directly had risen.
""Definitely referral traffic was nonexistent ... while at the same time direct traffic to our websites was up in double digits,"" he told the inquiry.

Miller also suggested antitrust regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) should scrutinise Facebook's move.

(Reuters) - South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster on Thursday signed into law a ban on almost all abortions in the state and the women's health group Planned Parenthood followed with a lawsuit, arguing the measure was unconstitutional.
As one of the most restrictive abortion bans, the so-called ""fetal heartbeat"" law bans abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected, often at six weeks and before a woman realizes she is pregnant.
Abortion is one of the most divisive issues in the United States, with opponents citing religious belief to declare it immoral, and proponents declaring it a women's health and privacy issue, among other arguments.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that the constitution protected a pregnant women's right to an abortion.
Various states have passed restrictions on abortions including those similar to South Carolina and most are still tied up in the courts. A law passed in Iowa in 2018 was overturned by a state judge in 2019.
""It is undisputed that such cardiac activity is detectable well in advance of the fetus becoming viable,"" District Court Judge Michael Huppert wrote in his decision.
A fetus that is viable outside the womb, usually at 24 weeks, is widely considered the threshold in the United States to prohibit abortion.
McMaster, a Republican, said at a signing ceremony that is has been his priority to sign an abortion ban into law. The South Carolina law does allow abortions under some circumstances including rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger.
McMaster said just before he signed the law, ""There's a lot of happy hearts beating across South Carolina right now.""
And in a nod to an expected legal fight, McMaster told people at the signing: ""Our battles are not yet over, but I believe the dawn of victory is upon us.""
Planned Parenthood South Atlantic filed a lawsuit in federal court shortly afterwards on the grounds the ban is unconstitutional, citing previous successful challenges to similar laws in other states, the group said in a statement.

""This ban blatantly defies nearly 50 years of Supreme Court precedent protecting a person's right to end a pregnancy,"" Nancy Northup, president of the Center of Reproductive Rights said in a statement.

PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday said it was ready to talk to Iran about both nations returning to a 2015 agreement that aimed to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, seeking to revive a deal that Washington itself abandoned nearly three years ago.
The move reflects the change in U.S. administration, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressing President Joe Biden's position that Washington would return to the accord formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) if Tehran came into full compliance with the deal. 
Iran reacted coolly to the idea, put forward by Blinken during a video meeting with the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany - a group known as the E3 - gathered in Paris. 
""If Iran comes back into strict compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, the United States will do the same and is prepared to engage in discussions with Iran toward that end,"" a joint statement from the four nations said.
Iran began breaching the deal in 2019, about a year after former U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew and reimposed U.S. economic sanctions, and has accelerated its breaches in recent months. 
A U.S. official told Reuters that Washington would respond positively to any European Union invitation to talks between Iran and the six major powers who negotiated the original agreement: Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States.
""We are ready to show up if such a meeting were to take place,"" the official told Reuters, after a senior EU official floated the idea of convening such talks. It is unclear whether any talks might occur, let alone when or where.
Responding to the four nations' statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Washington should make the first move. 
""Instead of sophistry & putting onus on Iran, E3/EU must abide by own commitments & demand an end to Trump's legacy of #EconomicTerrorism against Iran,"" Zarif said in a tweet.
""Our remedial measures are a response to US/E3 violations. Remove the cause if you fear the effect,"" he continued. ""We'll follow ACTION w/ (with) action.""
Zarif has previously signaled an openness to talks with Washington and the other parties over reviving the deal. 
The U.S. official also hinted there could be a way to bridge the impasse over who should go first in returning to the deal - the United States, by relaxing its economic sanctions, or Iran, by adhering to limits on its atomic program.
""I don't think that the issue of sequencing will be the obstacle that prevents ... us from getting there,"" he said, saying a greater challenge may be defining what constitutes compliance.
URANIUM ENRICHMENT
A French diplomatic source said Washington's shift marked an opening for Iran but the path ahead was fraught with obstacles. 
Tehran has set a deadline of next week for Biden to begin reversing sanctions imposed by Trump, or says it will take its biggest step yet to breach the deal - banning short-notice inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
Britain, France, Germany, and the United States called on Iran to refrain from that step and repeated their concerns over Iran's recent actions to produce both uranium enriched up to 20% and uranium metal.
""We remain in a precarious situation,"" said the French source, adding that if Iran ignored these warnings there would likely be ""an extremely firm reaction.""
Refining uranium to high levels of fissile purity is a potential pathway to nuclear bombs, though Iran has long said it its enrichment programme is for peaceful energy purposes only. 
U.S. officials have offered some conciliatory gestures toward Iran such as relaxing the travel restrictions on diplomats in its mission to the United Nations that the Trump administration imposed in 2019, which had confined them to a small section of New York City.
The U.S. official told Reuters the Biden administration has had no contact with Iran apart from notifying their U.N. mission of the easing of travel restrictions.

The United States has also withdrawn a Trump administration assertion that all U.N. sanctions had been reimposed on Iran in September, according to a U.S. letter to the United Nations Security Council seen by Reuters.

Chen Hongjun, Chen Xiangrong, Xiao Siyuan and Wang Zhuoran died during what Chinese state media described as a ""fierce struggle"" against ""foreign troops"" that violated an agreement and crossed into the Chinese side. 
China and India have blamed each other for the skirmish in the western Himalayas, during which soldiers fought each other with nail-studded clubs and stones. India has previously said 20 of its soldiers died in the clash, while Beijing had acknowledged casualties but had not disclosed details.
Chen was posthumously awarded the title of ""Guardian of the Frontier Hero,"" while the other three men were also given first-class merit citations. 
The two countries have sought to de-escalate the situation at the border, though there was another ""minor face-off"" between Indian and Chinese troops in January along the disputed borders.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Recent comments by Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco regarding the possibility of a truckers' strike will have consequences, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said on Thursday, adding that ""something will happen in the coming days.""
Bolsonaro did not further specify what measures he would take with respect to the state-controlled company, adding that there would be no political interference at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known.
In late January, Castello Branco said truckers threatening to strike due to what they perceived as high domestic diesel prices were not the company's problem.
Petrobras has repeatedly said it sells fuels domestically in line with international prices.
But investors have been jittery about possible political interference at Petrobras for the last two weeks. Earlier in February, the company announced it was changing its fuel pricing policy to allow domestic prices to differ from international prices for longer periods of time than previously disclosed.
That prompted multiple analysts to downgrade their recommendation on Petrobras shares.
""As the head of Petrobras said a few days ago: 'I don't have anything to do with truckers.' That's what he said, the head of Petrobras. That's going to have a consequence obviously,"" Bolsonaro said during a live chat broadcast on multiple social media platforms.
He then added: ""I don't have anything to do with this.""
Petrobras declined to comment on Thursday evening.
During the broadcast, Bolsonaro also said he would eliminate federal taxes on diesel for two months starting on March 1, with the goal of permanently eliminating the tax.
Political interference with Petrobras' fuel pricing policy has long been a concern for the market. In 2018, Petrobras' then-chief executive resigned when Brasilia stepped in to artificially lower fuel prices in response to a crippling nationwide truckers' strike.

Earlier on Thursday, Petrobras announced the highest fuel price increase since it modified its pricing policy. Analysts at UBS calculated in a note to clients that the hike represented a 10% increase in gasoline prices and a 15% increase in diesel.

(Reuters) - The Biden administration will pledge $4 billion to a coronavirus vaccination program for poorer countries in hopes of prying loose bigger donations from other governments, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
U.S. President Joe Biden will use his first meeting with leaders of Group of Seven advanced economies on Friday to announce an immediate $2 billion donation to the COVAX program co-led by the World Health Organization, officials said. COVAX aims to ensure a fair supply of coronavirus vaccines around the world.
The United States will provide the remaining $2 billion over the next two years as other nations fulfill and make their own pledges, the officials said.
""We want to turn this into a way to translate $2 billion into several billion dollars, up to at least $15 billion,"" said one of the officials, estimating the total amount needed for the global vaccination drive.
The U.S. funding has already been approved by Congress.
Biden's action is a sharp departure from his predecessor Donald Trump's threat to withdraw from the WHO, which he accused of being too close to China, where the novel coronavirus emerged in late 2019.
COVAX aims to deliver at least 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021 to cover 20% of the most vulnerable people in poor and middle-income countries. The program is at risk of failing, mainly due to a lack of funds. 
The head of the Gavi vaccine alliance, which co-leads the program, has also said COVAX needs greater political support, as wealthier nations strike fresh deals with developers to secure limited supplies.
The incoming head of the World Trade Organization and others have underscored the urgent need to jump-start vaccinations across Africa and in other regions that are lagging behind.
The U.S. officials said the donations would not interfere with Biden's promise to have enough vaccines available for all Americans who want them by the end of July.

""When we have a sufficient supply it is our intention to consider donating surplus vaccines, absolutely,"" said one official.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the United States remains alarmed by the government of President Alexander Lukashenko's continued violent crackdown on protesters, activists, and journalists.
""The United States continues to support international efforts to independently investigate electoral irregularities in Belarus, the human rights abuses surrounding the election, and the crackdown that has followed,"" Blinken said.
""We stand with the brave people of Belarus and support their right to free and fair elections,"" he added.
Thursday's move is the latest in a series of punitive actions by the United States targeting those it accuses of being responsible for undermining Belarusian democracy.
The action targets law enforcement leaders and personnel the State Department accused of detaining and abusing peaceful demonstrators, as well as judges and prosecutors allegedly involved in sentencing protesters and journalists to prison, among others.
The State Department did not name those designated. The action makes them generally ineligible for entry into the United States.
More than 33,000 people have been detained in a violent crackdown on protests against Lukashenko's rule following a contested election last August that his opponents say was rigged to extend his rule. He has been in office since 1994.
The crackdown prompted Western countries to impose new sanctions on Minsk. Lukashenko has refused to step down, buttressed by support from Moscow, which sees Belarus as a buffer state against the European Union and NATO.
In December, Washington expanded sanctions on Belarus, targeting four entities and 40 individuals over their roles in a disputed presidential election and the government’s subsequent crackdown on protesters, blacklisting Belarus' central election commission, among others.

From jazz festivals to outdoor theater, towns and cities across France host summer festivals, but existing COVID-19 restrictions and a lack of certainty over when the pandemic will end left organisers demanding clarity from the government.
""It is essential that we give visibility to our festival organisers who, early in the year, must decide whether to proceed and in what format, even if the pandemic will continue to create uncertainty,"" the culture ministry said in a statement.
The rules will apply to indoor and outdoor events.
A nightly curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. is currently in place in France. Restaurants, bars, museums, theatres and concert halls are all closed. Gatherings are limited to 1,000 people.
If the health crisis deteriorated, the cap on attendees and other safety protocol would have to be modified, the ministry said.

A 30 million euro fund will be made available to compensate festivals which have to make changes or cancel their plans, it added.

Johnson's Britain holds the presidency of the Group of 7 developed economies in 2021 and wants to use it to build momentum for a more coordinated approach to future pandemics, including the creation of a global health treaty.
The 1400 GMT call will be Biden's first multilateral engagement since he took over from Donald Trump whose unorthodox approach to G7 meetings often left attempts to build international consensus in disarray.
Johnson wants to seize on the change in U.S. leadership and the trail of destruction left by the COVID-19 pandemic to put three items at the top of the global agenda: health, climate change and a rebound which distributes economic benefits more fairly.
He will kick off that agenda on Friday by promising to share surplus vaccine doses with developing countries and calling for help to develop vaccines more quickly.
""By harnessing our collective ingenuity, we can ensure we have the vaccines, treatments and tests to be battle-ready for future health threats, as we beat Covid-19 and build back better together,"" Johnson said in a statement ahead of the meeting.
It took 314 days from the first identification of a COVID-19 cluster in China in December to the first successful vaccine trial results. 
Britain hailed that as a huge achievement but said next time it must be done faster, backing a 100-day target previously set out by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
""As leaders of the G7 we must say today: never again,"" Johnson will tell the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada.

Johnson will commit to sending the majority of any surplus COVID-19 vaccines it has later in the year to the COVAX scheme which helps supply jabs to poorer nations. He will encourage other G7 nations to do the same.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government issued interim guidance on Thursday sharply limiting who can be arrested and deported by immigration agents, a move that comes as the Biden administration faces growing pressure from activists to scale back deportations.
The guidelines instruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agents to focus on immigrants deemed national security and public safety threats and those who entered the United States after Nov. 1, 2020. Agents will need pre-approval from a senior manager if they want to arrest someone who does not fall into one of those categories.
""Like every law enforcement agency at the local, state, and federal level, we must prioritize our efforts to achieve the greatest security and safety impact,"" acting ICE Director Tae Johnson said in a statement.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is expected to issue permanent guidelines within 90 days.
Biden's more lenient approach differs dramatically from that of former President Donald Trump, who allowed ICE agents to pursue low-level offenders and non-criminals, as well as people with long ties to the United States. Some career ICE officials have privately criticized the new priorities, saying they would prevent agents from arresting some criminals and citing the need to get manager approval for non-priority arrests. 
On Biden’s first day in office, DHS announced a 100-day pause on most deportations. A federal judge days later blocked it nationwide following a lawsuit by Republican-led Texas, a sign of how Biden’s efforts could be hampered in court.
The Biden administration has also come under pressure from pro-immigrant advocates to scale back enforcement further.
On Thursday, more than 100 organizations led by the We Are Home campaign, which includes some labor unions, called on DHS to halt deportations to Haiti, end all family immigration detention in the next 100 days and close detention facilities ""with the most egregious records of rights abuses.""

The organizations also urged DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to stop detaining asylum seekers at the southwest border, close lower-priority immigration cases and terminate enforcement agreements with state and local governments, among other demands.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's federal government introduced a bill on Thursday aimed at addressing what the justice minister called a ""shameful"" over-representation of Black and indigenous people in the criminal justice system.
Indigenous adults represent 5% of Canada's general population but 30% of its federally incarcerated population, Justice Minister David Lametti said. Black people represent 3% of the general population but 7.2% of the federal offender population.
The bill ends mandatory minimum sentences for select drug and firearm crimes and makes it easier to impose conditional sentences that can be served in the community.
It also requires police and prosecutors to consider alternatives such as treatment in cases of simple drug possession. This comes amid a worsening overdose crisis, with the government under increasing pressure to decriminalize the possession of opioids and other illicit drugs.
Lametti told reporters he would not rule out the possibility of decriminalization, but said ""what I'm focusing on today is the sentencing element.""
""This (racial disparity in the justice system) is shameful,"" he said. ""The reason the numbers are so high is due in good part to current sentencing laws, which focus on punishment.""
Mandatory minimum penalties have been found to contribute to over-incarceration of people of color, and their repeal could make a big difference for individuals who might otherwise spend years behind bars, said Jamie Livingston, a criminologist at Saint Mary's University in Halifax. 
But overall, Livingston said, the bill was a disappointment for advocates, who seek full decriminalization of the simple possession of illicit drugs and expanded treatment facilities.

""If you're going to do this half measure, which is complex, why not do the full meal deal, which can also be complex but achieves many more goals than what this bill will actually achieve?""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday told the United Nations Security Council it was rescinding a Trump administration assertion that all U.N. sanctions had been reimposed on Iran in September.
Acting U.S. Ambassador Richard Mills informed the 15-member body in a letter seen by Reuters. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told European allies on Thursday that President Joe Biden's administration was prepared to talk to Iran about both countries returning to a 2015 deal that aims to stop Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.
The Trump administration quit the pact in 2018. Then in August last year former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had triggered a 30-day process at the Security Council that led to the return of U.N. sanctions on Iran and stopped a conventional arms embargo on Tehran from expiring on Oct. 18.
Thirteen of the 15 Security Council members said Washington's move was void because Pompeo used a mechanism agreed under the 2015 nuclear deal that the Trump administration had abandoned. 

The Trump administration argued it had triggered the return of sanctions - known as ""snapback"" - because a U.N. resolution that enshrined the 2015 nuclear pact still named the United States as a participant.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Former commanders from Colombia's demobilized FARC guerrillas on Thursday accepted accusations by a transitional justice court that they committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during the group's 50-year war with the state. 
The ruling in January by the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP), created under the 2016 peace deal between the government and the rebels, was the first time the JEP attributed criminal responsibility for hostage-taking to former leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
The former commanders were also accused of other war crimes connected with the treatment of kidnap victims, including murder and torture, among others.
""We recognize that during (the conflict) actions and conduct punishable in the eyes of international humanitarian law took place. Actions and conducts that have been individually and collectively recognized by the JEP, society in general, and in activities with victims,"" a statement signed by six of the former rebel commanders and published on Twitter said. 
The FARC used kidnappings for ransom to fund their war, while captured military or government personnel were used to pressure authorities into releasing jailed rebels, the JEP said last month. 
By accepting the accusations, the former commanders could face restrictions on their freedoms for five to eight years.
If they had rejected them, the commanders would have faced up to 20 years in prison, per the terms of the peace deal. 
The signatories were former top leader Rodrigo Londono - known best by his nom de guerre Timochenko - Jaime Alberto Parra, Pablo Catatumbo, Pastor Alape, Julian Gallo and Rodrigo Grande. 
The JEP can also prosecute military leaders for allegations of war crimes, in addition to the cases it handles related to former FARC members.

The Chamber of Deputies approved the confidence motion by 535 votes to 56 in the 629-seat chamber, with the far-right Brothers of Italy being the only major party to oppose the former European Central Bank president.
Draghi was sworn into office last week after a drawn-out political crisis which saw his predecessor Giuseppe Conte forced out over a coalition rupture.
He already won a confidence vote on Wednesday in the upper house Senate, where he gave his maiden speech as premier setting out his policy priorities, starting with tackling the twin coronavirus and economic crises.
The decision to support Draghi has lacerated the 5-Star Movement, the largest party in parliament, which was formed in 2009 as an anti-establishment protest group. 
It has joined Draghi's multi-party government but many of its voters and politicians still baulk at the idea of supporting a former ECB chief.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune on Thursday announced the dissolution of the lower house of parliament and called early legislative elections.
Addressing the nation on state television, Tebboune announced a government reshuffle in the next 24-48 hours and ordered the release of 60 detainees of a protest movement that forced his predecessor, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, from power in 2019.
""I decided to dissolve the assembly and call elections to build a new institution,"" he said, without giving a date for the elections.
The current lawmakers of the lower house had been elected for five years in May 2017, with Bouteflika's allies having an overwhelming majority.
Tebboune said the dissolution decision was part of reforms after amendments to the constitution in November last year aimed at giving parliament more powers.
Algerians have been awaiting the implementation of economic and political reforms Tebboune promised after succeeding Bouteflika, who stepped down in 2019 following mass protests after two decades in power.
The North African OPEC member country has been under financial pressure due to a sharp fall in energy earnings, forcing the government to cut spending and delay some planned investment projects.
Elected in December 2019, Tebboune has vowed to take steps aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil and gas, which account for 60% of the state budget and 94% of total export revenue.
Tebboune returned home earlier this month from Germany where he underwent surgery on his foot for complications after a coronavirus infection.
Tebboune, a former prime minister under Bouteflika, was elected amid protests demanding the departure of the whole ruling elite, with many of them boycotting the vote as they saw it as unfair and not transparent.
Several activists have been in detention since the protests broke out on Feb. 22.
Tebboune said in his speech 55-60 detainees would be released immediately, a demand that has been repeatedly raised by the leaderless protest movement known as Hirak.
The release comes amid calls on social media to stage street marches in the capital, Algiers, to mark the second anniversary of the demonstrations.
Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets on Tuesday in the eastern town of Kherrata, the first protests since the government banned marches in March last year as part of measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

""We have vowed to meet all demands raised by the Hirak,"" Tebboune said in the speech.

About 9,000 migrants from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa have been stuck in the Balkan country on their way to wealthier European countries. Most of them are concentrated in the northwest corner of Bosnia, close to the Croatian border, and in the capital Sarajevo.
""The migration area is one of the 14 priority areas that need to be addressed to have a future together with the European Union, and we see the need for better burden sharing,"" Johansson said.
She was speaking during a tour of a reception camp for migrants in Lipa, northwest Bosnia, close to the Croatian border. 
The camp recently reopened after it was set on fire in late December and had to close, leaving more than a thousand people to sleep in freezing conditions in abandoned houses and camp tents in forests over the winter months.
During her visit, Johansson praised local efforts to rebuild the Lipa camp but underlined that she came with ""a strong message of the need for managing migration properly"".
""Migration is not something that will end, migration is something that always has been here (in the EU) and always will be here,"" Johansson said.
Since early 2018 the EU has provided more than 88 million euros ($106.35 million) to help Bosnia manage the migrant crisis.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A Berlin court ruled in favour of the heirs of the Prussian monarchy on Thursday in a dispute with a historian, the latest twist in a legal battle for compensation for treasures taken from the Hohenzollern dynasty after World War Two. 
The family, which ruled Germany until Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated in 1918, has demanded the return of thousands of paintings, sculptures and books from the German state as well as compensation for the expropriation of property by the Soviet Union whose forces occupied eastern Germany.
The question of the Hohenzollerns’ relationship with Hitler is central to the family’s claims. Under German law, compensation is only possible if the claimant did not significantly assist Nazis' rise to power.
Some historians argue the role of the Hohenzollern family was insignificant. Others say appearing with Hitler and his associates, including in a famous photo of Hitler with Crown Prince Wilhelm, eldest son of Wilhelm II, in Potsdam in 1933, was helpful and symbolic. 
The family says on its website that two reports it commissioned have concluded that the family did not provide significant assistance to the Nazi regime. The family says this would back up their claim for compensation, but it also acknowledges that other reports come to a different conclusion. 
As part of a roughly 7-year wrangle with the states of Berlin and Brandenburg and the federal government, Georg Friedrich Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia, who is the great-great grandson of Wilhelm II, has taken legal action against dozens of historians and journalists. 
The Berlin regional court upheld a preliminary injunction in a dispute about a statement made by historian Winfried Suess in 2019 as part of a debate about possible plans for a Hohenzollern museum in which returned artefacts would be displayed and whether the family would have a say in their presentation. 
Critics say any such move could lead to revisionist interpretations of history.
""The defendant is still prohibited from making the statement that the plaintiff, as the head of an old German noble family, had demanded a say in the historic representation of the family in public institutions,"" the court said. 
Suess told Spiegel Online after the decision: ""If this legal opinion prevails, researchers will have a hard time talking about their work without legal assistance in future."" 
Germany's VHD historians' association condemned the ruling.

""This ruling could be momentous for academic freedom if statements by historians on the Hohenzollern compensation dispute about obvious facts can no longer be discussed publicly without legal action,"" VHD head Eva Schlotheuber told Reuters.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his counterparts from India, Japan and Australia met virtually for the first time under the Biden administration and discussed Myanmar, COVID-19, climate, and Indo-Pacific territorial and navigation issues, the State Department said in a statement.
""We’ve all agreed on the need to swiftly restore the democratic system (in Myanmar),"" and to strongly oppose all unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force, Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters.
""I stressed that, with challenges to existing international order continuing in various fields, the role we, the countries that share basic values and are deeply committed to fortifying free and open international order based on the rule of law, play is only getting bigger,"" Motegi said.
The State Department said Blinken and his counterparts discussed counterterrorism, countering disinformation, maritime security and ""the urgent need to restore the democratically elected government in Burma.""
They also addressed the ""the priority of strengthening democratic resilience in the broader region,"" it said.
The State Department said the four reiterated a commitment for the Quad to meet at least annually at ministerial levels and regularly at senior and working levels ""to strengthen cooperation on advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region, including support for freedom of navigation and territorial integrity.""
Myanmar's military overthrew the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a Feb. 1 coup. The United States has responded with sanctions and urged other countries to follow suit.
President Joe Biden has said working closely with allies will be key to his strategy toward China, in which he has said the United States will aim to ""out-compete"" Beijing.
Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed in a telephone call last week to strengthen Indo-Pacific security through the Quad.

The United States and other Quad members are concerned about China's extensive maritime claims in Asia, including in the South China Sea, where Beijing has established military outposts in disputed waters. In the East China Sea, China claims a group of uninhabited islets administered by Japan, a dispute that has plagued bilateral relations for years.

LONDON (Reuters) - London was never on Hong Konger Aragorn's wish list of places to visit, but now the 36-year-old is trying to build a new life in the British capital after fleeing a security clampdown in his birthplace.
Aragorn, who did not want to give his full name and said his safety would have been at risk at home due to his pro-democracy activism, is one of the first Hong Kongers eligible to set out on a new path to becoming a British citizen.
""Of course, no one wants to leave their home country and I literally miss the milk tea in Hong Kong,"" he said in an interview by the River Thames, in the financial heart of the capital. 
""I can't say we are either betraying or not betraying the cause of fighting for our own rights and fighting for democracy (by leaving). But I think you have to keep living. I mean you have to stay alive for any cause.""
London launched the scheme for holders of a British National Overseas (BNO) passport after Beijing imposed a national security law last June - after months of protests - that activists say erodes the freedoms promised to the territory when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Nearly 5,000 Hong Kong citizens have already applied to live, work and study in Britain using the new visas since the scheme opened on Jan. 31, The Times newspaper said on Thursday.
Britain - which has forecast the scheme could attract more than 300,000 people and their dependants in the first five years - says it is fulfilling a historical and moral commitment to Hong Kong, which became a global financial and commercial centre during its more than 150-year colonial rule.
It accuses Beijing of breaching the terms agreed before the handover by introducing security laws it says are being used to silence dissent.
China says the visa is a violation of international law and interferes with its internal affairs.
TOUGH JOB MARKET
While the scheme removes legal barriers for Hong Kongers, financial and social barriers remain.
Aragorn said the COVID-19 pandemic, which has emptied offices in the city for nearly a year, had made finding a job difficult.
""Before I left Hong Kong and in the first couple of months after I arrived in late September and early October, I was still expecting an office job,"" he said. But when England locked down again in November his optimism started to fade.
""That's why I started looking for waiter jobs or even kitchen assistant jobs in restaurants or a bubble tea shop store assistant or whatever,"" he said.
Under the new rules, Hong Kong residents who hold a BNO passport will be allowed to stay for five years and then apply for ""settled status"" and citizenship.
A government spokeswoman said visa applicants needed to demonstrate they could support themselves and their dependents. 
The government was preparing plans for the arrival of more BNO status holders, she said, and local authorities in England had been updated on the new immigration route. 
""(We) will be communicating further with those areas which may see higher numbers arriving to support their planning,"" she said, adding that help would be provided to access education.
FEAR OF UNCERTAINTY 
Lincoln Chong, a 26-year-old student at London's UCL, said his friends did not see their future in Hong Kong.
""Some of them are considering to go to Canada, to Taiwan, Australia. But I guess at least half of them are planning to come to the UK,"" he said. ""The fear of uncertainty, of unknown, that is the biggest reason why people decide to give up their lives and try to settle in this unfamiliar place."" 
Britain has said there will be some costs to public services, but estimates the visa will have a net positive impact of between 2.4 billion and 2.9 billion pounds over five years. 
Chong for one is confident about his prospects.
""It's relatively easy for me because I consider myself I'm still young and I can easily learn things,"" he said. ""But if you ask a person in their 40s, 50s, or even like my parents' age, the retiring age, you ask them to come here and try to learn all these things, I would say this is quite a challenge for them.""
In total 5.4 million Hong Kongers could ultimately be eligible for British citizenship.
""I don't think anybody knows what the number will be in the next five years, it is a dynamic process,"" said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS, University of London, adding much depended on whether the authorities in Hong Kong and China made further moves to clamp down on dissent. 

""The overwhelming majority of people in Hong Kong do not want to leave Hong Kong.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - People who deny that severe winter can be linked to climate change are displaying ""complete ignorance,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday, days after the U.S. state of Texas was first hit by a historic and deadly deep freeze. 
When asked if global warming played a role in the severe U.S. weather, Guterres said that climate change could make ""all storms, all oscillations ... more extreme.""
Scientists widely agree that climate change is fueling wilder weather worldwide, including stronger hurricanes, more intense heat waves and more erratic rainfall patterns. 
Determining whether climate change is behind a single weather event, such as this week's extreme cold in Texas, is trickier; scientists can investigate the climate link in a weather event, but that will reveal only how much more likely the event was to occur. 
""If you look at hurricanes, if you look at storms, but also if you look at heat waves and cold waves, they are becoming more extreme because of climate change,"" Guterres told reporters. ""Climate change amplifies.""
When people claimed that severely cold weather was evidence that global warming wasn't happening, he said, ""this is total lack of scientific knowledge, this is complete ignorance.""

Scientists say climate change – specifically the rapid warming of the Arctic – could be a factor in this week’s chill in Texas, though more scientific research would be needed to confirm any link.

The attack happened between the towns of Markoye and Tokabangou, where residents were on their way to a weekly market across the nearby border in Dolbel, Niger, said three security sources who spoke on condition of anonymity.
An initial death toll of eight was revised up after one person died of injuries. 
Attacks are common in the tri-border area of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, where Islamist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have exploited ethnic grievances and expanded their reach in recent years.
This week Chad announced it would deploy 1,200 troops to the area to complement France's 5,100-strong Barkhane counter-terrorism force, as leaders of the five Sahel countries and their allies met to assess the security situation.
France is seeking an exit strategy after eight years of battling Islamist militants in the region, but French President Emmanuel Macron ruled out an immediate troop reduction on Tuesday, saying a rushed exit would be a mistake.

Petare was founded in 1621 by Spanish settlers who took advantage of the lush mountain surroundings to grow crops including coffee, cocoa and sugar cane, according to Venezuelan historians. 
During the 20th century, the area was settled by migrants who moved to cities as the country's oil industry took off and is now home to more than 1 million people who range from the extremely poor to middle class professionals.
The area now suffers from gang violence and chronic problems with power and water, but its residents have cultivated a sense of pride at facing adversity with a smile.
""Given the situation of the country, this is the best thing that has happened"" in Petare, said Omaira Montiel, 47, a homemaker who has lived half her life in Petare. ""I'm happy.""
Children and adolescents spent hours flying kites from a hilltop with majestic views of Caracas as a singers performed and a symphonic orchestra of youth musicians played in the background.
The activity helps ensure that ""traditions are not lost,"" said Marisela Moreno, 55, another Petare resident.

""Petare means a feeling of commitment and dedication"", said opposition leader and former mayor, Carlos Ocariz. ""Politics is about spending time with the community.""

""Prime Minister Hun Sen struck a dangerous blow against internet freedom and e-commerce in Cambodia by expanding the government's control over the country's internet,"" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said on Thursday. 
""Cambodia's National Internet Gateway is the missing tool in the government's toolbox for online repression,"" he said in a statement. 
An 11-page decree announced on Wednesday requires internet service providers to reroute their services through a National Internet Gateway within the next 12 months, before February 2022.
The gateway is similar to that of China, an important economic ally for Cambodia, which has seen its ties with the United States and European Union deteriorate recently. 
It requires service providers to make users complete online forms with their correct identities and says failure to connect networks to the gateway would result in operating licenses being suspended and bank accounts frozen. 
Government spokesman Phay Siphan on Wednesday said the decree was necessary because there was no order to the internet in Cambodia, adding it was less intrusive than regulations in the United States and Britain. The new gateway comes as Hun Sen's government faces international criticism over a crackdown that has decimated civil society and the political opposition, resulting in a power monopoly for his party, and criminal charges and jail terms for many of its rivals. 
Emerlynne Gil, Amnesty International's deputy regional director for research, called the new gateway ""a disaster for human rights"". 

""In the context of an escalating crackdown on human rights defenders, mass trials of opposition supporters, and rising numbers of prisons of conscience - this development is especially alarming,"" Gil added

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO defence ministers made no decision on whether or when to pull out of Afghanistan at a meeting on Thursday, Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said, adding that the allies faced a dilemma as violence increases again.
After two decades of Western military intervention and hundreds of billions of dollars in investment, NATO countries are reluctant to heed a May 1 deadline and risk undermining progress towards democracy as a peace process stalls.
""At this stage, we have made no final decision on the future of our presence,"" Stoltenberg said after a video conference with allied defence ministers. ""As the May 1 deadline is approaching, NATO allies will continue to closely consult and coordinate in the coming weeks,"" he told a news conference.
German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said on Wednesday that the Taliban must do more to meet the terms of their 2020 peace agreement with the United States to allow a withdrawal of the foreign troops.
Attacks in Afghanistan, including a bomb that killed the deputy governor of the capital Kabul in December, have prompted members of the U.S. Congress and international rights groups to call for a delay to the pullout, agreed when Donald Trump was U.S. president.
""We are faced with many dilemmas, and there are no easy options,"" Stoltenberg said.

""If we stay beyond the first of May, we risk more violence, more attacks against our own troops ... But if we leave, then we will also risk that the gains that we have made are lost.""U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised to consult with allies and partners on the way forward, Stoltenberg added.

Bishop Porfirije Peric, 59, seen as a modernist inside the conservative church, will be Serbia's 46th patriarch and the successor to Patriarch Irinej, who died in November from COVID-19 at the age of 90.
""The Holy Synod of Bishops ... elected His Eminence the Metropolitan of Zagreb and Ljubljana, Porfirije, as the Serbian Patriarch,"" the Serbian Orthodox Church said in a statement.
""As one of the most prominent contemporary ... clergymen and intellectuals, (Porfirije) ... maintains relations of personal friendship and close cooperation with priests and representatives of other churches and religious communities.""
Porfirije will lead a church of about 12 million people in Serbia, the other five former Yugoslav republics, Kosovo, and dioceses in the United States, Australia and Western Europe. 
The church and the government in Belgrade enjoy Russia's backing in their refusal to recognise the independence of Kosovo, Serbia's former southern province mainly populated by Albanians. 
Serbs and their church regard Kosovo as the cradle of Serbian Orthodox Christianity and it is home to some of their most important monasteries and religious sites. 
Bells on Belgrade's churches tolled as Porfirije was seen leaving the St Sava cathedral in central Belgrade where the vote by the Holy Synod, church's top body, was held.

The comments by Bashir Salihi Magashi, a retired army major, came on Wednesday, hours after gunmen abducted dozens of people, including 27 students, from the Government Science secondary school in the Kagara district of north-central Niger state.
The Nigeria Police Force, in a statement on Thursday, said a massive search and rescue mission was being carried out alongside the military in which helicopters, counter-intelligence unit forces and intelligence agents had been deployed. 
Niger state government officials have said they believe the attack was carried out by ""bandits"" - the term used in Nigeria to describe armed gangs who attack communities and kidnap for ransom. A spate of attacks have been carried out by such groups in the last year. 
On Wednesday, speaking about such gangs in the wake of Wednesday's attack, the defence minister told reporters: ""We shouldn't be cowards."" 
""I don't know why people are running away from minor, minor, minor things like that,"" he said. ""They should stand. Let these people know that even the villagers have the competence and capability to defend themselves.""
The comments attracted widespread criticism. 
""People cannot defend themselves with bare hands while confronted with bandits are who are increasingly acquiring more sophisticated weapons,"" said Isa Sanusi, a spokesman for rights group Amnesty International. 
He said Nigerian authorities had a duty to protect lives and property and should not resort to ""blaming the people"". 
Many expressed frustration on social media. 
Kayode Ogundamisi, a commentator on Nigerian affairs with nearly 600,000 Twitter followers, tweeted: ""Simply put, he's saying YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN!""
A spokesman for Magashi did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Reuters) - Life expectancy in the United States fell by a year in the first half of 2020 - the biggest decline since World War 2 - and stood at the lowest levels since 2006, according to estimates issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday.
While the estimates are provisional, and do not reflect the full effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the CDC said it was publishing provisional data for the first time in order to assess the effect of excess deaths in 2020. 
Excess deaths are the difference between the number of expected deaths and the actual number. 
""The decline in life expectancy in the first half of 2020 is an aberration from the changes in life expectancy from year to year during the past two decades,"" said Elizabeth Arias, one of the report's authors. 
It was the biggest drop since World War Two, she said, when life expectancy fell 2.9 years between 1942 and 1943.
Racial and ethnic disparities in death rates worsened during the period, the CDC said. 
The estimates represent the average number of years a baby will live based on the death rates of the specified period, between January through June in this case.
Americans on average are now expected to live for 77.8 years, from 78.8 years in 2019. Life expectancy among the Black population fell by 2.7 years to 72 years, the largest decline of any group. It fell by nearly a year in the White population, to 78 years. 
The Hispanic population had a life expectancy of nearly 80 years, a decline of 1.9 years, according to the data. 
Certain age groups may have been under-represented in the data, as completion of death certificates takes longer for deaths from causes requiring investigation such as infant deaths and drug overdoses, the CDC said.
""I would expect the impact on life expectancy to persist or, more likely, to become even more pronounced as data from the second half of 2020 are factored in,"" said Marc Gourevitch, the chair of the department of population health at NYU Langone Health. 

Gourevitch, who was not involved in the research, said that the intense economic impact of the pandemic will blunt the speed at which life expectancy returns to pre-pandemic levels.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Lebanese court on Thursday removed the judge leading the investigation into the Beirut port explosion, a move likely to further delay a probe that has faced fierce political pushback. 
More than six months since the largest non-nuclear blast in history, Lebanese still have no answers into why and how tonnes of ammonium nitrate, stored unsafely at the port for years, detonated in the heart of Beirut. 
The explosion killed 200 people, injured thousands and destroyed entire districts.
Judge Fadi Sawan in December charged three ex-ministers and the outgoing prime minister with negligence over the August explosion, which compounded Lebanon's economic meltdown. 
But the officials snubbed Sawan when he sought to question them before deciding whether they should be formally indicted, accusing him of overstepping his powers. He also faced criticism from Shi'ite Hezbollah and former Sunni premier Saad al-Hariri. 
The court of cassation decided to remove Sawan from the case on Thursday after a request from two of the former ministers he charged, Ali Hassan Khalil and Ghazi Zeaiter.
A copy of the court decision seen by Reuters cited ""legitimate suspicion"" over Sawan's neutrality because his house was damaged in the blast, which devastated much of the capital.
Sawan could not be reached for comment.
""As soon as the judge started getting at them, they removed him right away,"" said William Noun, whose firefighter brother died in the blast. ""There's sadness and anger in us. We know there are political pressures ... but we will not give up.""
Human Rights Watch said the judge's removal based on a complaint from politicians was ""an insult"" to the victims. 
""We are back to square one,"" researcher Aya Majzoub said. ""We need answers, and Lebanon has shown that it is incapable of providing them.""
Lawyer Youssef Lahoud, representing around 1,400 victims, told Reuters the justice minister would now have to nominate another judge and get approval from the higher judicial council.
The minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sawan's charges were the first filed against top politicians over the blast. Victims and lawyers have said the judge showed courage in a country where few in authority have ever been held to account. 
Outgoing premier Hassan Diab, whose cabinet quit over public outrage after the blast, has said his conscience was clear.
Khalil said he had no role in the blast. The finance ministry, which he ran from 2014 to early 2020, oversees customs.
Zeaiter, who called the charges ""a blatant violation"", ran the public works ministry in 2014, soon after ship carrying the nitrate arrived at the port.
Both Khalil and Zeaiter are lawmakers from the Amal party of influential Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally.

The third former minister, Youssef Finianos, was due to be questioned on Thursday but also said he would not turn up. He and Khalil were hit with U.S. sanctions last year for links to Hezbollah, which Washington deems a terrorist organisation.

Fighting in the gas-producing region has escalated as the Houthis try to take Marib city, the government's last stronghold in the north of Yemen.
The fighting threatens to displace hundreds of thousands and complicate renewed U.S. and U.N. efforts to find a political solution to the more than six-year-old civil war in Yemen.
A government source in Marib and a military source told Reuters that hundreds of fighters had arrived from Hadhramout and Shabwa in the south, where the Saudi-backed government is based, and from the suburbs of northern Sanaa province.
One resident said military reinforcements passed through Marib on Thursday and that coalition warplanes had carried out several air strikes. 
Clashes could be heard from the frontline about 30 km (18 miles) to the west of the city, the resident added.
The Yemeni army said in a Twitter post on Thursday that coalition air raids had destroyed a Houthi missile launching pad in Makhdara, west of Marib city, and four ballistic missiles.
The United States urged the Houthis on Tuesday to halt their offensive and join international efforts to end the conflict, widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Echoing the U.S. appeal, U.N. Yemen mediator Martin Griffiths said on Thursday ""the quest for territorial gain by force threatens all of the prospects of the peace process.""
The Houthis ousted the government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, prompting the Saudi-led coalition to intervene months later. The Houthis deny being puppets of Iran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.
On Thursday, the Houthi-run Al Masirah channel said the movement's interior minister had ordered a wide deployment of security forces and rescue workers in Marib ""to match military victories with security victories by protecting citizens"".

Around 80% of Yemen's population relies on aid and millions are on the verge of famine.

However while the centrist Civic Platform (PO) announced a change in its platform, legislative changes are unlikely in the current parliamentary term, which is due to continue until 2023. 
A Constitutional Court ruling mandating a near total ban on abortion from last October has upturned nearly three decades of broad consensus in Poland that abortion should be allowed only in the case of rape, incest, a threat to the mother's health and foetal abnormality.
The ruling also exposed growing support among young voters in particular for a liberalisation of abortion rules in line with the European mainstream, despite the nationalist government's backing of the court verdict.
The PO said on Thursday it wanted women to have access to abortions at up to 12 weeks of pregnancy in ""difficult"" situations after consulting with a doctor and psychologist, while also calling for broader access to sex education, birth control, in vitro and prenatal testing.
""This is a response to what our voters expect. A clear stance on this matter,"" PO head Borys Budka told a news conference.
Political observers say young voters, many of whom filled the streets with protests for weeks after the court ruling, may be crucial to the outcome of the next parliamentary election, due in 2023. 
Opinion surveys have shown a sharp turn towards the left among youth, while the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) appeals to older, poorer voters. Budka's PO has relied on centrist voters and moderate conservatives for over two decades.
A February poll published by Polish daily Dziennik Gazeta Prawna showed that over 40% of Poles, especially younger voters, believe abortion rules should be liberalised.

An SW Research poll conducted soon after the court ruling indicates that over 70% of Poles were against the decision to further restrict abortion rights in the country.

Egypt has welcomed the announcement of a new interim government - the latest U.N.-brokered effort to unite rival camps in east and west Libya - and is planning to reopen its embassy in the capital Tripoli.
It had been one of the most prominent backers of eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar, seeing him as the best option for securing its border with Libya. Haftar's campaign to take control of Tripoli, in the west, crumbled in June.
Sisi affirmed ""Egypt's full readiness to provide all its expertise and experience ... in a way that contributes to putting Libya on the right track and preparing the country to move towards horizons of construction, development and stability"", the statement said.
Egyptian intelligence sources and Western diplomats say Egypt's attempts to work with Tripoli represents a recalibration of policy after the failure of Haftar's campaign. 
After the meeting, Dbeibeh tweeted: ""We look forward to a strategic relationship between the two brotherly countries."" 
Egypt closed its Tripoli embassy in 2014, the year when many foreign missions shut during an intensifying conflict that saw rival parallel governments set up in the chaos that followed the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi after four decades.

Turkey, a regional rival of Egypt and military backer of west Libyan factions, reopened its embassy in the Libyan capital in 2017. Dbeibeh also visited Turkey last week.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is set to impose travel bans and asset freezes on allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin in March, possibly in the run-up to an EU summit, after a meeting of envoys gave approval for punitive measures, diplomats said.
Reuters reported on Feb. 11 that the sanctions, in response to the jailing of Putin's main domestic critic Alexei Navalny, could be the first to be imposed under a new EU framework that was enacted in December and allows the bloc to take measures against human rights violators worldwide.
""I expect additional sanctions to be in place before the EU summit in March,"" said a senior EU diplomat, referring to the March 25-26 gathering of the bloc's 27 leaders in Brussels. EU foreign ministers meet on March 22.
A meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday showed broad support for sanctions, with countries including Sweden, Germany, France, Poland and Baltic countries all calling for the travel bans and asset freezes.
There was no discussion of halting the huge Nord Stream II gas pipeline from Russia to Germany, however, despite calls from some EU members for it to be targeted with sanctions. It was not immediately clear if powerful business elites, known as oligarchs, would be targeted, as Navalny's supporters want.
Pressure for sanctions has grown since Moscow infuriated European countries on Feb. 5 by expelling German, Polish and Swedish diplomats without telling the EU's foreign policy chief, who was in Moscow for a visit. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the EU an ""unreliable partner"" during a news conference, which EU lawmakers say aimed to humiliate Brussels.
""Sanctions need to be soon, otherwise their impact is weakened,"" a second senior EU diplomat said.
Some countries have put forward names of those they think should be subject to sanctions, but declined to give details out of concern potential targets could move assets out of European banks.
The EU already imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Last year it imposed travel bans and asset freezes on six Russian officials close to Putin over Navalny's poisoning in August. Moscow has denied blame for Navalny's illness and says it has seen no proof he was poisoned.

Navalny was detained after returning to Russia from Germany last month and jailed on Feb. 2 for violating the parole terms on what he says was a politically motivated charge.

ROME (Reuters) - The leader of Italy's 5-Star Movement on Thursday said a group of senators who broke ranks and rejected Prime Minister Mario Draghi's government in a parliamentary confidence vote will be expelled from the party.
The decision to support Draghi, a former head of the European Central Bank, has lacerated 5-Star, the largest group in parliament, which was created in 2009 as an anti-system, anti-euro party.
In an online ballot last week, some 59.3% of 5-Star members backed the new broad-based administration, but a group of 15 senators decided to ignore the result and voted against Draghi in a confidence vote in the upper house on Wednesday. [nL1N2KH1VC]
5-Star leader Vito Crimi said they would pay heavily for their rebellion, which did not prevent the incoming government from securing an overwhelming victory.
""Those 15 senators will be expelled... they have not respected the commitment to comply with indications coming from members,"" he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
A further eight 5-Star senators failed to show up for the vote and the party said it would investigate their absence.
Among those who voted against Draghi were some of the movement's leading lights, including former minister Barbara Lezzi and the head of parliament's anti-mafia commission, Nicola Morra, who said he was ""shocked"" by Crimi's decision.
Senator Elio Lannutti said efforts to curb internal dissent were reminiscent of the East German secret police, the Stasi.
""We will appeal the decision,"" he wrote on Facebook.
The dissidents have complained that backing a technocrat prime minister goes against the group's ideals and said they could not support a government that included their arch foe -- former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.
The 5-Star Senate group will be reduced to 77 members if the mass expulsion is carried out, leaving it still the largest single party in the chamber. The movement originally had 112 senators after the 2018 general election, but since then, many have been expelled or have quit in dissent with the leadership.

Draghi is likely to win another resounding victory in a second confidence vote to be held later on Thursday in the lower house of parliament. Once again, a number of 5-Star lawmakers are expected to defy orders and vote against.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - The Ugandan military on Thursday sentenced seven soldiers to up 90 days in jail after they were convicted of assaulting journalists who were covering an event outside a U.N. office in the capital Kampala. 
Punishment of security personnel for abuse against journalists is rare and attacks on reporters have escalated in recent months amid a crackdown on supporters of opposition leader Bobi Wine. 
On Wednesday, soldiers descended on a group of journalists outside the U.N. High Commissioner of Human Rights office, beating and injuring at least 20 of them.
NTV Uganda television showed the journalists running for safety and screaming as the security personnel struck them with batons. Four of those assaulted sustained serious injuries including to the head.
The journalists were covering Wine, a pop star and lawmaker, as he delivered a petition to the office asking the United Nations to investigate human rights violations on the country including torture, abductions, illegal detentions and others. 
The Uganda Peoples' Defence Forces (UPDF) said in a statement that a military disciplinary committee had tried the seven soldiers, who included a captain, convicted and given them varying sentences ranging from a severe reprimand to 90 days in jail. 
Military chief, General David Muhoozi, had apologised for the incident and vowed to punish the culprits. 
""Such actions are regrettable and the UPDF as a professional institution doesn't condone such acts,"" Muhoozi said in a statement. 
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has earned the wrath of President Yoweri Museveni after galvanising a large following among the country's youth and emerging as formidable political opponent. 
He lost to Museveni in last month's election and rejected the result, saying there was widespread rigging that included pre-ticking of ballots, falsifying results on tally sheets, intimidating his agents and other irregularities. 
He has challenged the results in court.

In a tweet, Jansa accused Politico reporter Lili Bayer (OTC:BAYRY) of lying in her story entitled ""Inside Slovenia's war on the media"", in which she quoted journalists and watchdogs as saying Jansa was creating a climate of fear in the media.
""Well, @liliebayer was instructed not to tell the truth, so she quoted mainly 'unknown' sources from the extreme left and purposely neglected sources with names and integrity,"" Jansa tweeted, in English.
Asked about the tweet, the EU executive's chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, told a briefing: ""We condemn any attacks on journalists. We would not do that in Brussels and we do not expect others to indulge in such practices.""
Senior members of the European Parliament defended Bayer, including former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, who accused Jansa of bullying.

Jansa responded with a tweet reading: ""And, @guyverhofstadt, we answered all her questions - and @POLITICOEurope ignored all our answers. Who is bullying who?""

Mubasher Muslimyar, an Islamic law professor, was killed in Kabul along with another person, said Ferdaws Faramarz, a police spokesman. The identity of the second individual killed was not immediately known, but media reports said he was a professor too.
Kabul has seen a series of attacks with small magnetic bombs attached under vehicles and other targeted killings against members of security forces, judges, government officials, civil society activists and journalists in recent weeks. 
No group claimed responsibility for the attack but government officials say Taliban insurgents are to be blame and use such tactics to instill fear while avoiding large-scale civilian casualties.
The government announced last week that they had arrested a militant group behind making and deploying sticky bombs, but such attacks do continue to occur. 
Violence in parts of the country has increased recently as peace talks between the government and Taliban insurgents have largely stalled while U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration reviews how to handle the peace process, including a troop withdrawal.
Afghan military officials said both local security forces and the Taliban are preparing for fresh fighting in the spring.

Thailand has seen a sharp increase in use of the ""lese majeste"" law since youth-led street protests last year broke a taboo by demanding reform of the powerful monarchy.
Suporn Attawong, an assistant to the prime minister's Office, reported Amarat Chokepamitkul from the Move Forward Party to the cybercrime police on suspicion of breaking the law with her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts.
Section 112 of Thailand's penal code makes insulting the king, queen, heir or regent a crime.
""We see Amarat posting offensive things and we have found evidence that this lawmaker is involved with other 112 offenders by providing funding and joining demonstrations,"" Suporn told reporters.
""We also found many posts related to the monarchy or mocking the king,"" Suporn said, without specifying which posts.
Amarat told reporters she was not worried about the complaint.
""I am doing my duty as a member of the opposition, and I want the prime minister to answer the accusations inside parliament rather than resorting to this tactic,"" she said.
Amarat had on Tuesday accused Prayuth of abusing his power during a four-day censure debate, proposed by the opposition, against the prime minister and nine members of the cabinet.
All are likely to survive the no confidence votes, which are scheduled for this weekend.
Since November, at least 59 people have been charged with lese majeste, according to records compiled by the campaign group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. 

This month, four activists were remanded in prison pending trial after being accused of actions that damaged the monarchy and ""hurt the feelings of loyal Thai subjects"".

184,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 07:05AM ET</span>",How the battle over redistricting in 2021 could decide control of the U.S. Congress,"By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - With the rancorous 2020 U.S. election now over, Democrats and Republicans are girding for another national political battle with enormous stakes: redistricting.
The once-a-decade process of redrawing electoral maps can determine which party controls Congress. Though Democrats hold power in Washington, Republicans have the redistricting advantage heading into 2021.
HOW REDISTRICTING WORKS
Redistricting occurs every 10 years after the U.S. Census completes its decennial count of the national population.
Because the number of U.S. House of Representatives seats allocated to each state is driven largely by population, some states whose population declined will likely lose seats to others that have seen growth. This year, Texas and Florida are among the states expected to gain seats, while New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania are among those that will likely lose seats.
Each state uses the census data to draw congressional districts, as well as new state legislative districts.
In most states, the legislature produces the maps, with the governor often having veto power. Lawmakers often try to draw lines in a manner most favorable to their party, a process known as gerrymandering.
REPUBLICAN ADVANTAGE
Gerrymandering occurs when district lines are deliberately manipulated to benefit one party over another. Federal law prohibits racial gerrymandering, in which minority communities are intentionally disadvantaged, but partisan gerrymandering, in which lines are altered based on how residents voted, is permitted.
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal judges have no jurisdiction over partisan gerrymandering, though the decision does not prevent state courts from weighing in. Both the Pennsylvania and North Carolina state Supreme Courts have found extreme partisan gerrymandering violates their state constitutions.
In general, the most aggressive current gerrymanders are seen in Republican-controlled states, thanks to the party's massive victories in state-level elections in 2010. That has allowed Republicans in Wisconsin, for example, to maintain an iron grip on the legislature, even as Democrats have won statewide races.
After Democrats failed to make major gains in November at the statehouse level, Republicans will have sole power to draw the lines for 181 seats in the 435-seat U.S. House, compared with only 49 for Democrats, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center at New York University.
Some experts say Republicans could use redistricting alone to flip the half-dozen House seats needed to regain control of the chamber from Democrats in the 2022 congressional elections.
WHAT IS DIFFERENT THIS YEAR?
The biggest immediate concern is a months-long delay in the release of census data due to the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, officials said states would not receive detailed figures until September.
As a result, the two states that hold legislative elections in 2021, Virginia and New Jersey, will use their old maps. Meanwhile, around half of U.S. states have legal deadlines calling for new maps to be completed in 2021, which could be impossible given the delay; experts say many states will likely ask courts for extensions.
Some good government groups are worried the delay could lead to more extreme gerrymandering, since it would leave little time for any legal challenges to make their way through the courts before the 2022 elections in November.
The Supreme Court's decision in 2013 to eliminate a key section of the Voting Rights Act will also make it more difficult for civil rights groups to prevent gerrymandering. In years past, states with a history of racial discrimination in elections were required to get ""preclearance"" from the federal government before making any changes to voting laws, but the court struck down that provision.
Another difference this year: Voters in several states, including Colorado, Michigan, New York and Virginia, approved the creation of redistricting commissions designed to lessen partisanship, though they have varying degrees of autonomy.
Those ballot initiatives reflect a growing public awareness of redistricting, as reform groups, particularly on the left, have spent years mobilizing grassroots efforts in response to Republican gerrymandering in 2011. The backroom deals that marked redistricting a decade ago may be harder to effectuate in 2021.
""Up until recently, redistricting has been obscure, but also obscured – intentionally so,"" said Kathay Feng, national redistricting director for the good government group Common Cause. ""That curtain is coming down.""
STATES TO WATCH
The biggest fights could emerge in four populous Southern states where Republican control over redistricting could yield big gains in Congress – Texas, Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.
Texas and Florida could pick up a combined five new seats in the U.S. Congress thanks to population growth, while Republicans in Georgia may pursue an aggressive gerrymander in response to surprise statewide wins for Democrats in the presidential and twin Senate runoff elections.
A number of battleground states where Republicans previously enjoyed strong gerrymanders now have Democratic governors or independent commissions, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Several states where one party controls the legislature could also see gerrymandering efforts, including Illinois and Maryland for Democrats, and Kansas and Kentucky for Republicans.

The daily protests and strikes that have paralysed many government offices show no sign of easing even though the junta has promised a new election and appealed for civil servants to return to work, threatening action if they do not.
""I don't want to wake up in a dictatorship. We don't want to live the rest of our lives in fear,"" said Ko Soe Min, who was out in the main city of Yangon where tens of thousands took to the streets a day after some of the biggest protests yet.
Big crowds returned to Yangon's central Sule Pagoda while many young people also massed at another favourite protest site, at an intersection near the main university campus, spilling into the streets as police tried to move them on.
The marches have been more peaceful than the bloodily suppressed demonstrations seen during an earlier half century of army rule, but they and the civil disobedience movement have had a crippling effect on much official business.
Many motorists in Yangon drove at a snail's pace in a show of opposition to the coup, a day after many pretended to be broken down to block police and army vehicles.
In the second-biggest city, Mandalay, protesters rallied to demand the release of two officials arrested in the coup. Police fired water cannon in the capital, Naypyitaw, to scatter a crowd approaching police lines.
The northern town of Myitkyina was tense after police and soldiers used catapults to break up a protest, a resident said. Pictures on social media showed soldiers and rows of police trucks.
""They're not acting in line with the constitution nor rule of law. They are acting like terrorists,"" said activist Sut Seng Htoi. Police were not available for comment.
In the old capital of Bagan, people with banners and flags marched in colourful processions against a backdrop of ancient temples. Some protesters stopped at a temple to put a curse on dictators, a witness said.
TRYING TO END CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
Putting an end to the civil disobedience campaign appears to be the military government's priority.
Late on Wednesday, the junta issued arrest warrants against six celebrities, including film directors, actors and a singer, under an anti-incitement law, for encouraging civil servants to join the protest. 
The charges can carry a two-year prison sentence.
""It's amazing to see the unity of our people. People's power must return to the people,"" actor Lu Min, who was on the junta's 'wanted list', posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The military says a majority of people back its actions.
The takeover and arrests have drawn strong Western criticism with the United States and Britain among countries that have announced or threatened sanctions.
China has taken a softer line while neighbours Singapore and Indonesia have proposed regional dialogue. Singapore also urged that violence not be used against civilians.
""In particular, live rounds should not be fired on unarmed civilians under any circumstances,"" Singapore's foreign ministry cited its minister, Vivian Balakrishnan, as saying.
Police have fired rubber bullets several times.
One protester was shot in the head in Naypyitaw last week and is being kept on life support, but doctors say she is not expected to survive.
The army says that one policeman died of injuries sustained in a protest. 
The army said on its Facebook page forces were providing security across the country to ""make sure people have tranquillity and sound sleep"".
Halting Myanmar's tentative transition towards democracy, the army took power after the electoral commission rejected its accusations of fraud in a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.
Opponents of the coup are deeply sceptical of junta promises to hand over power after a new election, for which no date has yet been set.
Suu Kyi, detained since the coup, faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as charges of illegally importing six walkie talkie radios. Her next court appearance has been set for March 1.
Suu Kyi, 75, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest for her efforts to bring democracy and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her struggle.

The number of people known to have been detained since the coup had reached 495 by Wednesday, of whom 460 were still being held, Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican has told employees that they may risk losing their jobs if they refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccination without legitimate health reasons. 
A decree by Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello, effectively the governor of Vatican City, said getting a vaccine was ""the responsible choice"" because of the risk of harming other people.
Vatican City, at 108 acres the world's smallest state, has several thousand employees, most of whom live in Italy. Its vaccination programme began last month and Pope Francis, 84, was among the first to get the jab. 
The seven-page decree says that those who cannot get vaccinated for health reasons may be given another position, presumably where they would have contact with fewer people, but will receive the same pay even if the new post is a demotion.
But the decree said those who refuse to get a vaccination without sufficient reason would be subject to a specific provision in a 2011 law on employee rights and duties.
The article in the 2011 law says employees who refuse ""preventive measures"" could be subjected to ""varying degrees of consequences that could lead to dismissal"".
The decree was signed on Feb. 8 and later posted on the website of the governor's department.
Pope Francis is a big supporter of vaccines to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
""It is an ethical choice because you are gambling with your health, with your life, but you are also gambling with the lives of others,"" he said in an interview with an Italian television station last month.
The Vatican has made a COVID-19 vaccination obligatory for journalists accompanying Pope Francis on his trip to Iraq next month.
Bertello, who signed the decree, tested positive for coronavirus in December and went into self-isolation.

There have been fewer than 30 cases of coronavirus in the Vatican City, most of them among the Swiss Guard, who live in a communal barracks.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's wife, Ri Sol Ju, has been shown by state media appearing in public for the first time in more than a year, joining her husband at a concert on one of the country's biggest holidays. 
North Korea's state-run television channel on Thursday aired footage of the pair at the event marking the birthday of Kim's late father and former leader Kim Jong Il.
The official ruling Worker's Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun had released photos of the pair at the event on Wednesday.
Ri had often accompanied Kim to major public events, but had not been seen since January last year at an event for the Lunar New Year holiday, stoking speculation over her health and potential pregnancy. 
South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) told lawmakers on Tuesday that Ri appeared to have refrained from outside activities to head off coronavirus infections but was ""playing well with their kids.""
The NIS believes Ri and Kim have three children. Little is publicly known about the trio.
North Korea has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but the NIS has said an outbreak could not be ruled out as the country had active exchanges with China, where the virus first emerged, before closing the border early last year.
Ri and Kim smiled as they watched the concert at Mansudae Art Theatre in the capital of Pyongyang. Unlike several previous events, nobody in the photographs published by Rodong Sinmun were wearing masks or maintaining social distancing measures. 

The newspaper also reported that Kim visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of his father and grandfather, to lay wreaths for the anniversary, called the Day of the Shining Star.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Lawyers for a 22-year-old Indian activist charged with sedition said she was arrested illegally in southern India and produced at a New Delhi court without prior notice to her family or counsel, according to legal documents filed on Thursday.
Disha Ravi, an environmental activist who is part of an organisation founded by climate change crusader Greta Thunberg, was arrested by Delhi Police on Saturday for allegedly creating and sharing an online document that stoked violence last month at the months-long farmers' protests around Delhi.
Sedition can be punished with a life sentence and Ravi's arrest has kicked off a fire storm of criticism against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government for using heavy-handed tactics to counter the farmers' agitation.
Tens of thousands of farmers have been camped on the outskirts of Delhi since late last year, protesting against three farm laws enacted by the Modi government.
On Thursday afternoon, groups of farmers and their supporters sat on railway tracks across the country to stall train movement for a few hours as part of the continuing campaign.
Although largely peaceful, the agitation was marred by violence on Jan. 26 when some protesters entered the capital, stormed the historic Red Fort complex and clashed with police.
Delhi Police has alleged that a document authored by Ravi and two others, with the backing of supporters of a separatist group, contained plans for widening the protests and fomenting violence. The police have said the document was shared with Thunberg, who has voiced support for the farmers' protests.
Ravi, who was arrested at her home in the southern city of Bengaluru, is currently in police custody. Her next court appearance is on Friday.
""The police did not obtain any transit remand, nor did they permit the petitioner to consult with a lawyer,"" a petition by Ravi's lawyers filed at a Delhi court on Thursday said, referring to legal permission required to move an accused from one location to another.
She was produced at a New Delhi court on Sunday that remanded her to police custody. 
""Surprisingly, there was significant media coverage of the petitioner's remand hearing and the media seemed to have more knowledge about the time and venue of the petitioner's production than her lawyers,"" it said.

A Delhi Police spokesman said they were waiting for instructions from the court to reply to the allegations levelled by Ravi's lawyers.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's COVID-19 vaccination campaign started on the same day in December as the United States, but it now lags dozens of countries, including its southern neighbor, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is feeling the pressure.
Canada's lack of domestic vaccine production is at the root of the problem, forcing the country to depend on foreign companies with production abroad. 
In June, Trudeau's Liberals had an 11-percentage-point lead against their Conservative Party rival, according to Abacus Data. His government provided billions of dollars so people could stay home and not work during the pandemic while the virus spread rapidly in the United States. 
Canada now ranks about 40th in the world in per capita vaccinations, according to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data. Liberals now lead Conservatives only by one point, Abacus says.
""We don't know if we're really going to get all the promised doses... I'll believe it when I see it,"" opposition Conservative leader Erin O'Toole said on Tuesday during question period in parliament. 
Canada has procured more doses per capita than any country in the world, and Trudeau says everyone who wants to be inoculated will be by the end of September, but a Leger poll published this week shows most Canadians do not believe him.
Fewer than 3% of Canada's 38 million people have received the first of two shots.
The 49-year-old Trudeau's political future could be at stake since senior Liberal sources have said they are eyeing an early vote this year in a bid to free the government from its dependence on opposition parties to pass legislation. 
RAMPING UP PRODUCTION 
The lack of manufacturing capacity became a hot-button issue after  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) reduced its deliveries in January and February in order to boost production capacity at its plant in Belgium.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc cut shipments, too.
Canada is making investments in domestic production, including to produce the U.S.-based  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc vaccine in Montreal; it's also investing in an inoculation being developed by Quebec-based Medicago. Neither is expected to be available soon.
Critics say the government moved too slow to gear up domestic production and some provincial leaders now want to place their own vaccine orders and bypass the federal government.
Canada had to create manufacturing ""from a standing start that is decades and decades old,"" said a senior government source, who declined to be named in order to speak frankly, adding it takes time to ramp up production. 
Opposition politicians also point out that Trudeau's quick embrace of newly elected U.S. President Joe Biden has failed to secure shipments of vaccines from the United States.
Biden has not reversed an executive order signed by former U.S. President Donald Trump that blocks vaccine exports. 
""You could throw a snowball from (Pfizer's Michigan) plant and hit Canada, and yet we're not getting vaccine from the plant, we're getting it from Belgium,"" said Dr. Isaac Bogoch, infectious diseases specialist at Toronto General Hospital.
Officials on both sides of the border have said they have discussed vaccines together, but there has been no indication that the United States is ready to share with its northern neighbor.
Trudeau's government says the delivery disruptions are over.
Both Pfizer and Moderna have boosted planned deliveries for the second quarter, when 23 million doses are expected, and 84 million are due by September. Three other vaccines await regulatory approval and could accelerate inoculations.
It is a race against time. Canada is beginning to open up as case numbers from the second wave come down. But more contagious variants could cause a third wave before most people get vaccinated, Bogoch said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Nearly 100 asylum-seekers are among the 1,200 Myanmar nationals Malaysia plans to send home by ship next week, refugee groups said on Thursday, as it takes a step activists fear could put the deportees' lives at risk.
Although Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, detaining them along with other undocumented migrants, it has vowed not to deport Rohingya Muslims and refugees identified by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 
Last week, Reuters reported the Southeast Asian nation had agreed to return the 1,200 Myanmar citizens after its neighbour's military, which seized power in a Feb. 1 coup, offered to send navy ships to pick up those detained.
Concerns over refugee status persist, however, as the U.N. agency has not been allowed to interview detainees for more than a year to verify such claims.
Leaders of groups representing refugees from the Chin and Myanmar Muslim communities of Myanmar said detained asylum-seekers or their families had contacted them after being told they were set to be sent back in the naval vessels.
""They don't want to go back to Myanmar,"" said Thu Zar Moung, founder and chairwoman of the Myanmar Muslim Refugee Community, adding that 85 Myanmar Muslim detainees, women and children among them, had been confirmed among those set to be deported.
""Even during the trip from Malaysia to Myanmar, their lives can be threatened and (it is) dangerous,"" she said, adding that there could be more.
James Bawi Thang Bik of the Alliance of Chin Refugees said his group had received calls from nine asylum-seekers notified that they would be deported. 
Members of both communities have traditionally come to Malaysia after fleeing conflict or persecution at home. 
Malaysia's immigration department and the UNHCR did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Rights group Amnesty International called for UNHCR to get immediate access to those being deported.
""When the Malaysian government denies UNHCR access to detention for 1-1/2 years, it is jeopardising the lives of refugees and asylum seekers,"" said Katrina Maliamauv, the group's director in Malaysia.

NIAMEY (Reuters) - The ruling party's candidate in Niger, Mohamed Bazoum, will enter Sunday's presidential run-off vote as the heavy favourite to succeed outgoing Mahamadou Issoufou, whose policies to combat Islamist violence and widespread poverty he has vowed to continue. 
After winning the first round in December by 22 points over his nearest rival, former president Mahamane Ousmane, Bazoum was endorsed by the third and fourth-place candidates. 
Ousmane, who was president from 1993-1996, hopes to score an upset by promising change in the face of intensifying attacks by militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, part of a wider security crisis across West Africa's Sahel region.
Suspected jihadists killed at least 100 civilians on Jan. 2 in raids on two villages in the Tillabery region near the Mali border, one of the deadliest episodes in the country's recent history.
""I promise to do everything, if I am elected president of the republic, to give you security,"" Bazoum said while campaigning in Tillabery last week. 
Whatever the outcome, the vote is expected to mark a watershed for Niger, which has experienced four coups since gaining independence from France in 1960, by leading to its first transition of power between two freely elected presidents. 
Unlike his counterparts in Ivory Coast and Guinea, who used constitutional changes to extend their tenures last year, Issoufou is stepping aside after two five-year terms.
While Bazoum has pledged continuity with Issoufou's policies - and even hired Issoufou's son as his campaign manager - Ousmane has criticised the government's record, especially on matters of corruption.
He has seized on a government audit last year that found almost 40% of the $312 million Niger spent on defence contracts in the past three years was lost through inflated costs or material that was not delivered.
""I am not for the continuity of bad governance, waste and ineffective investment,"" Ousmane said in an interview with French radio this week. ""I am the candidate of change."" 
Ousmane disputed that Bazoum is the favourite, saying his rival's winning margin in the first round was due to fraud. He did not provide any evidence.
Both candidates have focused on security on the campaign trail. Twice the size of France, Niger touches two of Africa's deadliest conflicts - one near its western border with Mali and Burkina, and another near its southeastern border with Nigeria. 
The rising insecurity has compounded a host of economic challenges, including drought, the COVID-19 pandemic and low prices for its top export uranium. More than 40% of the population lived in extreme poverty in 2019, according to the World Bank. 
""Everyone agrees that as long as this (security) question is not addressed, no development will be possible,"" said Amadou Boubacar Hassane, a constitutional lawyer. 
Younoussi Abdourhamane, a 35-year-old civil society activist, said he planned to vote for Ousmane, accusing Bazoum of minimising the severity of the security crisis. 

""We are in a critical enough situation that every citizen must mobilise to vote because the real issue is saving this country,"" he said.

193,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 18, 2021 05:00AM ET</span>",Two journalists jailed for two years in Belarus for filming protests,"KYIV (Reuters) - A Belarusian court sentenced two Belarusian journalists from Poland-based TV news channel Belsat who filmed protests against President Alexander Lukashenko to two years in prison on Thursday.
Katsiaryna Andreyeva, 27, and Darya Chultsova, 23, were detained in an apartment in November from where they had been filming protests taking place over the death of a protester who was killed several days earlier.
Both women pleaded not guilty after being accused of orchestrating the demonstrations by filming them. 
The two journalists appeared in a cage at the hearing on Thursday, hugging and making ""V"" for victory signs. Their lawyer said they would appeal the verdict. 
""Just look at Darya and Katsiaryna – strong, smiling, and saying goodbyes to their loved ones through bars. Lukashenka can't break us,"" exiled opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya wrote on Twitter.
Neighbouring Lithuania, where Tsikhanouskaya is based, urged Minsk to end a ""spiral of repression"" while Poland said Belarus should end its persecution of journalists.
More than 33,000 people have been detained in a violent crackdown on protests against Lukashenko's rule following a contested election last August that his opponents say was rigged to extend his rule. He has been in office since 1994. 
The crackdown prompted Western countries to impose new sanctions on Minsk. Lukashenko has refused to step down, buttressed by support from Moscow, which sees Belarus as a buffer state against the European Union and NATO. 
""Every time I went to work, I risked my health and life,"" Andreyeva had said in a statement earlier. ""I managed to hide from rubber bullets, explosions of stun grenades, blows from truncheons. My colleagues were much less fortunate.""
""I have everything: youth, a job that I love, fame and, most importantly, a clear conscience.""
The journalists were filming protests after the death of 31-year-old Roman Bondarenko, who died in hospital in November after what protesters say was a severe beating by security forces. The interior ministry denied responsibility.
Polish President Andrzej Duda instructed Polish diplomats in Minsk to convey to the Belarusian government his opposition to the repression of freedom of speech and civil rights. He called for it to stop and for an amnesty for detainees, presidential aide Krzysztof Szczerski said.
Lukashenko has mixed promises of reform with a renewed crackdown this week that saw police raiding the homes of journalists and rights activists and one of Lukashenko's main electoral opponents put on trial for corruption.
A separate trial begins on Friday of a journalist from the local outlet TUT.BY who contradicted the government's assertion that Bondarenko had been drunk at the time of his death.

The Belsat TV channel specializes in news from Belarus and employs mostly Belarusian citizens.

Senator Leila de Lima, who has spent four years in prison since she led an investigation into alleged summary executions during Duterte's signature war on drugs, said the court's decision showed the charges against her were ""trumped-up"" by the Duterte administration.
The court said that its granting of De Lima's plea to dismiss the case on lack of evidence was ""tantamount to her acquittal"". 
De Lima, a former justice minister, is considered by many activists as a political prisoner and has received awards from human rights groups for standing up to Duterte over the deaths of thousands of suspected drug peddlers. 
""Not a single witness testified that I and my co-accused conspired with drug lords to trade drugs in prisons,"" De Lima said in a statement.
""From the onset, these cases were filed to silence me and distract me from my duties as senator."" 
Before and during her detention, De Lima was subject to humiliating public tirades by Duterte, who accused her of adultery and of making a sex tape and even recommended she hang herself. 
De Lima sought a court injunction to muzzle Duterte and once called him a ""sociopathic serial killer"". She has expressed fear for her life because of the ""diehard fanatics"" among his supporters. 
Akbayan Partylist, a leftwing group of lawmakers, said De Lima's first victory should serve as reminder to the government that ""despite the weaponisation of the law, the people will push back in order for truth and justice to find their way out.""

Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque said De Lima had no reason to celebrate because she remains in jail.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's High Court denied another bail application on Thursday to media tycoon and Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, the most high-profile person to be charged under the Chinese-ruled city's national security law.
The Court of Final Appeal ruled last week that a lower court's decision last year to grant him bail applied ""an erroneous line of reasoning,"" but allowed Lai's team to make a new application for bail to the High Court.
The High Court said it will publish its reasons for rejecting Thursday's application at a later date.
Under the new law, the onus is on the defendant to prove they would not be a national security threat if released on bail. Under Hong Kong's common law-based legal system, the onus has traditionally been on the prosecution to prove its case.
Lai has been in custody since Dec. 3, except for when he was released for about a week last year before his bail was appealed by the prosecutors and subsequently overturned.
He was arrested in August when about 200 police officers raided the newsroom of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid newspaper.
The tabloid and other media reported on Wednesday that Lai, while in jail, had been arrested again, on suspicion of assisting a fugitive China captured at sea last year.
Beijing imposed the national security law on the former British colony last June after months of pro-democracy protests. The law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent and it erodes freedoms in the semi-autonomous financial hub. Its supporters say it restores stability after months of unrest.
Prosecutors have accused Lai of breaching the law over statements he made on July 30 and Aug. 18, in which they allege he requested foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.
Lai has been a frequent visitor to Washington, meeting with officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor"".

Lai stepped down last year as chairman of Next Digital, which publishes Apple Daily.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Jerusalem woke up to the rare experience of seeing its holy sites covered in snow on Thursday, with the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall under a layer of white after an overnight snowstorm. 
Before dawn children were up hurling snowballs at each other outside the Old City gates, as the faithful trudged to sites holy to Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
The snowstorm began on Wednesday evening, leading the authorities to shut down public transportation and block the main road to Jerusalem.
But as it eased overnight the municipality said it would resume services, and people even drove to see the spectacle.

""We came in from Tel Aviv to play in the snow,"" said Ben Miller. ""It's a rare occasion that we get snow in Jerusalem. The last time, I think, was 2013.""

London made changes to its visa rules to give millions of Hong Kong residents a chance to settle in Britain after China imposed a new security law that democracy activists say will end the freedoms promised to the territory in 1997.
Under the rules, Hong Kong residents who hold a British National Overseas (BNO) passport will be allowed to live in the United Kingdom for five years and then apply for ""settled status"" and citizenship.
About half of the 5,000 applications received were from Hongkongers who were already in Britain, The Times reported, citing unidentified sources.
Some 5.4 million Hongkongers could be ultimately be eligible for British citizenship under the scheme. 
Those people had already been offered temporary settlement in the United Kingdom after fleeing China's security crackdown while waiting for the visa change.
Britain's interior ministry declined to comment on leaked information. A spokeswoman said the data would be published in the coming months.
Britain and China have been arguing for months about what London and Washington say is an attempt to silence dissent in Hong Kong after pro-democracy protests in 2019 and 2020.
The British flag was lowered over Hong Kong when the colony was handed back to China in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule - imposed after Britain defeated China in the First Opium War.
Hong Kong's autonomy was guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration signed by then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
China says Britain's views on Hong Kong are clouded by an imperial hangover and that the territory needs the national security law to counter damaging unrest.
China and Hong Kong have said they will no longer recognise the BNO passport as a valid travel document from Jan. 31. BNO status was created by Britain in 1987 specifically for Hong Kong residents.

The British government has forecast the new visa could attract more than 300,000 people and their dependants to Britain. Beijing said it would make them second-class citizens.

Philip, the monarch's dutiful consort who turns 100 in June, felt ill and consulted a doctor before he was driven to the King Edward VII Hospital in London. He walked unaided into the private hospital and he does not have COVID-19. 
""The Duke’s admission is a precautionary measure, on the advice of His Royal Highness’s Doctor, after feeling unwell,"" Buckingham Palace said, adding that he was expected to remain in hospital for a ""few days of observation and rest"".
A royal source stressed that the admission was not an emergency and said that the queen, 94, remained at Windsor where they have stayed during the pandemic. Both received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in January.
Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, is known for his sometimes brusque remarks but also for his helping Elizabeth - and the British monarchy - navigate the political and social upheaval of the 20th Century.
Philippos Schleswig-Holstein Sonderburg-Glucksburg was born on a dining room table on the Greek island of Corfu on June 10, 1921, the fifth child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece.
He is a descendant of Elizabeth's great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria and his wife's third cousin.
Philip married Elizabeth in 1947, five years before she became queen. He is now by far the longest-serving consort of any British monarch - a distinction previously held by Queen Charlotte, George III’s consort.

Philip is now rarely seen in public. He stepped down from official engagements in August 2017 after completing more than 22,000 solo events and thousands more alongside the queen.

Gakharia, who had held the post since 2019, said he was stepping down because of a disagreement with his own team over the detention of Nika Melia, a prominent opposition politician, local media outlets reported.
""I've made the decision to leave my post,"" Gakharia said, according to the Sputnik Georgia news outlet. ""Of course, I believe and want to believe that this step will contribute to lowering the level of polarization in our country.""
Gakharia said Melia's detention was unacceptable ""if it creates a risk to the health and the lives of our citizens or creates the possibility for political escalation,"" TASS news agency reported.
A court in the capital Tbilisi on Wednesday ordered that Melia, chairman of the United National Movement (UNM) opposition party, be taken into custody for allegedly failing to post bail. 
Melia had been accused of inciting violence at street protests in June 2019, a charge he has dismissed as politically motivated. 
Following Gakharia's resignation on Thursday, the Interior Ministry announced it was postponing carrying out the order to take Melia into custody. A crowd gathered outside his party's offices and waved Georgian flags in celebration, according to Sputnik Georgia.
Inside UNM headquarters, Melia called for early elections. 
""On behalf of all opposition parties, I declare: let's sit at the negotiating table with representatives of this government and start negotiations on new early elections,"" Melia said.
Georgian Dream, the country's ruling party, won parliamentary elections in October last year, but the opposition said the vote was rigged and marred with violations.

Melia said at the time that his party did not recognise its outcome and called for a re-run.

Shevchenko, 41, a mother of two in southern Russia's Rostov-on-Don, was put under house arrest in early 2019 in what her supporters say is a politically motivated case to stop her activism and punish her for showing dissent publicly. 
She is accused of carrying out activities on behalf of Open Russia, a British-based group founded by exiled former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. 
It is one of more than 30 groups that Russia has labelled as undesirable and banned under a law adopted in 2015. 
Shevchenko's supporters say the specific activities she is accused of - taking part in an anti-Kremlin rally and a political seminar - were legal forms of political expression. 
They also say that the Open Russia movement, which she was part of, is a separate entity to the outlawed organisation. 
State prosecutors have asked the court to jail Shevchenko for five years. 
The verdict comes amid a crackdown on allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny who returned to Russia last month after recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Siberia. 
Rights advocates say the laws on ""undesirable"" organisations and ""foreign agents"" can be used to pressure and target civil society members. Russia denies that and says the laws are needed to protect its national security from outside meddling.

Victoria lifted a five-day lockdown late on Wednesday, having ordered one after a spate of cases mostly linked to workers at quarantine hotels for people arriving from abroad.
Authorities said the only case of COVID-19 detected across the country in the past 24 hours involved a person that was already in hotel quarantine after arriving from overseas.
Australia's Minister for Health Greg Hunt heralded the result but said the toll worldwide illustrates the need for a ""broad-scale national vaccination programme"".
Australia's inoculation programme will begin on Monday, starting with hotel quarantine workers.

""That's our single highest priority in the first few weeks.""

Australia has largely avoided the high rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths seen in other developed countries thanks to border closures and effective contact tracing systems. It has reported just under 29,000 cases and 909 deaths.

A group of 24 envoys were in Kashmir on Wednesday and in Jammu on Thursday. It was the third delegation of diplomats to visit since August 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government ended Jammu and Kashmir state's autonomy, split it into two federally run territories and locked it down for weeks.
Armed guards and officials from the external affairs ministry accompanied diplomats from Africa, the EU, Central and South Asian nations on a tightly controlled tour of Srinagar, the largest city in Kashmir, residents said.
Despite the government's desire to showcase normalcy, several roads were deserted and markets were partially shut because of a security clampdown.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in an uprising against Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir that started in 1989, but violence has slowed in recent months. 
The diplomats were allowed to speak to local residents and discuss their responses to recent local elections and economic opportunities. 
""I told the diplomats how unemployment was rising and government will have to create many jobs for the youth to prevent them from starting protests,"" said Fayzal Sheikh, 46, a textile trader in Srinagar city.
Sources familiar with the itinerary said the trip included meetings with the Indian army and government officials, as well as journalists and civil society groups selected by the security services.
Modi's government has repeatedly stressed that life is back to normal in the Himalayan region, which is claimed by India and arch-rival Pakistan.

India, which has reported the highest number of overall COVID-19 cases after the United States, detected the South African variant in four people last month and the Brazilian one in one person this month.
The government has said the South African and Brazilian strains can more easily infect a person's lungs than the UK mutation. India has so far reported 187 cases of infection with the UK variant.
The government late on Wednesday said airlines would be required from next week to segregate inbound travellers from those countries. India does not have direct flights with Brazil and South Africa, and most people travelling from these countries generally transit through Middle Eastern airports.
""All the travellers arriving from/transiting through flights originating in United Kingdom, Europe or the Middle East shall be mandatorily subjected to self-paid confirmatory molecular tests on arrival,"" India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a statement.

India's coronavirus infections rose by of 12,881 in the past 24 hours to about 11 million, while deaths increased by 101 to more than 156,000. It was the highest daily increase in cases in a week. The states of Kerala and Maharashtra have seen a recent uptick in cases possibly due to further reopening of economic and other activities.
A government serological survey released this month said nearly 300 million of India's 1.35 billion people may already have been infected by the virus.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Thursday ordered Rosmah Mansor, the wife of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, to enter a defence in a corruption trial linked to a multi-million dollar project approved while the ex-premier was still in power.
Dozens of graft charges were filed against the couple after Najib lost the 2018 election, amid anger over alleged corruption and their opulent lifestyle after police raids revealed Rosmah owned millions of dollars worth of jewellery and luxury handbags.
The Kuala Lumpur high court ruled that the prosecution had proved sufficient grounds for the case to proceed.
""This is my finding that the prosecution has produced credible evidence to prove every element of the offence... I now call upon the accused to enter a defence,"" judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan said in his ruling.
Rosmah, who wore a traditional Malay dress with a shawl covering her head, told the court that she would testify under oath during defence proceedings.
Her lawyer, Jagjit Singh, said after the hearing the defence would be ""hampered to a certain extent"" because the judge did not explain the factors behind his decision, adding that this had caused his client emotional distress.
""We had to comfort her a little bit. We just told her to go back to her house and remove all the stress that has gone through here,"" Jagjit told reporters.
Rosmah was earlier accompanied by Najib, who had to leave midway through her hearing to attend to his own court case.
Rosmah, 69, faces three charges of soliciting and receiving bribes involving a sum of 194 million ringgit ($48.09 million) to help a company, Jepak Holdings Sdn Bhd, secure a solar power project.
Of that total, prosecutors accuse Rosmah of arranging for 187 million ringgit to be paid as a political donation to Najib, while also receiving two bribes of 6.5 million ringgit.
If found guilty, she could be jailed for up to 20 years and fined at least five times the sum specified in the charges.
In July, Najib was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to 12 years in jail in the first of several trials linked to a multi-billion dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). He has since filed an appeal against the decision.
The couple have denied any wrongdoing, saying the charges are politically motivated.

Rosmah's case will resume on June 9.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - All New Zealand schools will have free access to sanitary products from June, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Thursday, an initiative aimed at stamping out period poverty in the country.
The announcement follows a successful pilot programme launched around the middle of last year, which provided free period products to about 3,200 young people in 15 schools.
“Providing free period products at school is one way the Government can directly address poverty, help increase school attendance, and make a positive impact on children’s well-being,” Jacinda Ardern said in a statement.
""We want to see improved engagement, learning and behaviour, fewer young people missing school because of their period, and reduced financial hardship amongst families of participating students.”
Speaking to reporters later in the day, Ardern said research had shown one in 12 young people were missing school due to this issue. She said the programme will cost NZ$25 million ($17.96 million)through to 2024. 
Minister of Women, Jan Tinetti said the issues with periods at school included embarrassment, stigma, missing classes, being ‘caught out’ without product, cost, lack of knowledge and discomfort.

The shooting happened shortly before 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT) near the Olney Transportation Center in the city's Fern Rock neighborhood in northern Philadelphia, police said. The victims range in age from 17 years old to 71, police said.
One person is in custody, said Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw in a brief press conference at the scene. But information on the suspect was not immediately available and no motive was known.
A 71-year-old man was shot in his stomach and both legs, police said. He is listed in critical condition at a nearby hospital.
Police initially said seven people were shot, but updated their information after they learned an eighth person walked from the scene to a nearby medical center with a ""bullet graze wound to his stomach.""
The other victims also suffered wounds that ranged from being grazed by a bullet to suffering shots in the legs, arms, and ankle, Outlaw said. No other information was available on the wounded, other than they were in stable conditions, police said.
Two guns were recovered at the scene and at least 18 bullet shell casings littered the road, police said.
""We are still putting all the pieces together, but this was a very brazen incident,"" she said.
Police are asking witnesses to the shooting to come forward and they are looking for other possible suspects.

TEL AVIV/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden made a long-awaited first phone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday after a delay that had seen Washington deny it was snubbing Israel's leader. 
There had been speculation that the Democratic president was signaling displeasure over Netanyahu's close ties with former President Donald Trump, who called the right-wing leader two days after his inauguration in 2017. 
Biden has spoken with about a dozen other world leaders since taking office on Jan. 20. The White House had said that Netanyahu, who differs with Biden on some Middle East issues such as Iran, would be the first regional leader he would call. 
The delay in the traditional courtesy call was also widely regarded by analysts as a sign that Biden did not want to be seen boosting Netanyahu ahead of Israel's March 23 elections.
Some said it could foreshadow chillier relations if Netanyahu wins re-election, but there were no immediate signs of tensions in relatively bland accounts of the call released by the two governments.
""It was a good conversation,"" Biden told reporters in the Oval Office where he was meeting U.S. labor leaders.
Biden and Netanyahu spoke for about an hour on issues including the ""Iranian threat"" and Israel's budding relations with Arab and Muslim countries, Netanyahu's office said in a statement. ""The two leaders noted their longstanding personal connection,"" it added.
The White House said they discussed, among other issues, the need for ""continued close consultation"" on Iran.
Biden told Netanyahu he intends to strengthen defense cooperation with Israel and stressed his support for normalization of relations with its neighbors. He also ""underscored the importance"" of working toward peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the statement said.
The White House had denied that the delay in a Biden call was meant to disrespect Netanyahu, with spokeswoman Jen Psaki saying last week that it was ""not an intentional dis"".
Netanyahu this week acknowledged differences with Biden over Iranian and Palestinian issues, but said the two enjoy a strong working relationship.
The Israeli leader may find the two countries' alliance tested if Washington restores U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew, and opposes Israeli settlement building on occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood.
Netanyahu was almost in lock-step over Middle East policy with Trump, who took a staunchly pro-Israel approach.
An Israeli diplomat told Reuters that Israel had been concerned about the delay in Biden calling Netanyahu, but was mindful that the U.S. president was dealing with other issues first, such as the coronavirus pandemic and challenges from Russia and China. 

The fact that Netanyahu was the first Middle East leader called was taken as a positive sign, the diplomat said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge found no proof that federal prosecutors in Manhattan knowingly withheld key evidence from lawyers for a banker charged with Iran sanctions violations, even as she excoriated the government for mishandling the case.
In an order on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan urged the Department of Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate any prosecutorial misconduct in the case against the banker, Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad.
Sadr had been convicted last March after prosecutors accused him of funneling $115 million through the U.S. banking system to Iran in connection with a Venezuelan construction project.
The case unraveled and the charges were dropped after prosecutors revealed their inadequate disclosures to the defense, including when a prosecutor suggested that the government ""bury"" a key exculpatory document.
Nathan ordered prosecutors last September to explain in detail what happened, and said on Wednesday she still believed their failures represented ""grave derelictions of prosecutorial responsibility.""
But she said ""the court does not conclude that any of the prosecutors knowingly withheld exculpatory information or intentionally misrepresented facts to the court.
""In light of this, and given the systemic nature of the errors and misconduct that occurred in this case, the court will not engage in further fact-finding,"" Nathan added.
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment.
Sadr's case was dismissed after Strauss' predecessor Geoffrey Berman said continuing ""would not be in the interests of justice.""
Nathan also ordered the release of substantially all declarations from prosecutors and related filings in the case, saying the pubic interest in seeing the materials outweighed any privacy interests.
The case was an unusual rebuke for the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office, which has long been known for its independence, the quality of its lawyers, and its high-profile cases involving Wall Street, corruption and terrorism.

An icy winter storm in recent days has plunged the border region into freezing temperatures, and caused at least 21 deaths across Texas and several other southern U.S. states. 
Migration agents patrolling the river's edge in Piedras Negras in Mexico's Coahuila state, opposite Texas, had observed four people enter the water, the migration institute said in a statement. Two of them reached the United States.

BAUCHI/KADUNA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen killed a student in an overnight attack on a boarding school in the north-central Nigerian state of Niger on Wednesday and kidnapped 42 people including 27 students, the state governor said.
The assailants stormed the Government Science secondary school in the Kagara district of Niger state at around 2 a.m., overwhelming the school's security detail, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello said.
""Twenty-seven students, three staff and 12 members of their families were kidnapped. Unfortunately, one student was shot dead,"" he told a news conference. 
Aliyu Isa, a teacher, told local TV news station Channels that the abductors were dressed in army uniforms and shooting as they broke into the school. 
""They were telling the students not to run,"" added Isa, who said he and others fled in the confusion while the gunmen rounded up some of the pupils.
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the latest abduction. Kidnappings for ransom by armed groups are common across many northern Nigerian states. 
The attack came two months after gunmen stormed a secondary school in northwestern Katsina state and kidnapped nearly 350 boys, who were subsequently rescued by security forces.
Rights group Amnesty International said in a statement that education is ""under attack"" in northern Nigeria. 
""The Nigerian authorities must act immediately to prevent attacks on schools, to protect children's lives and their right to education,"" the group added. 
Militant Islamist group Boko Haram and a branch of Islamic State also carry out abductions in Nigeria's turbulent northeast. About 100 of more than 270 schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram from the town of Chibok in 2014 remain missing.
In the wake of Wednesday's attack, the Niger state governor ordered the immediate closure of boarding schools in the region. 
President Muhammadu Buhari dispatched security chiefs to coordinate rescue operations, his spokesman Garba Shehu said in a statement.
""President Buhari has (given assurance) of the support of his administration to the armed forces in their brave struggle against terrorism and banditry and urged them to do all that can be done to bring an end to this saga,"" Shehu said. 
The Nigerian army said in a statement that it has mobilized troops who are pursuing the abductors. And the country's police chief said his force was working with the Department of State Security to reinforce security in the area where the abduction took place.
The recent attacks have raised concern about rising violence by armed gangs and Islamist insurgents, fuelling criticism of Buhari's handling of national security. In January, the president appointed a new military high command.

Violence and insecurity have compounded the economic challenges faced by citizens in Africa's most populous country, which is struggling to cope with a fall in revenues due to an oil price slump on top of the COVID-19 pandemic.

214,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 04:21PM ET</span>",U.S. conservative radio provocateur and Trump ally Rush Limbaugh dies,"By Will Dunham
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Provocative and polarizing U.S. talk radio luminary Rush Limbaugh, a leading voice on the American political right since the 1980s who boosted, and was honored by, former President Donald Trump, has died at age 70 after suffering from lung cancer, his wife said on Wednesday.
Limbaugh, who pioneered the American media phenomenon of conservative talk radio and became an enthusiastic combatant in the U.S. culture wars, disclosed in February 2020 that he had been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. In a statement announcing his death, his wife Kathryn Adams Limbaugh said, ""Rush's love for our country, and for all of you, will live on eternally.""
Limbaugh's appeal and the success of his top-rated daily radio show arose from his brash and colorful style, his delight in baiting liberals and Democrats and his promotion of conservative and Republican causes and politicians. His show became nationally syndicated in 1988 and quickly built a large and committed following, making him wealthy in the process. 
He was loathed by liberals. Detractors such as Democratic former Senator Al Franken - a former comedian who wrote a book titled ""Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations"" - criticized him as a divisive figure who distorted facts.
Trump, a former reality TV personality with a showman's instincts who pursued right-wing populism during four years in the White House, awarded Limbaugh the highest U.S. civilian honor - the Presidential Medal of Freedom - during his 2020 State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress.
First lady Melania Trump placed the medal around Limbaugh's neck after her husband lauded him as ""a special man beloved by millions of Americans"" and ""the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet."" Underscoring Limbaugh's divisiveness, some Democratic lawmakers were heard groaning ""oh no"" while House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one of his favorite punching bags, sat in stony silence.
Trump, a Republican, honored Limbaugh a day after the radio star announced his cancer diagnosis. Limbaugh at the time said he planned to continue doing his program ""as normally and as competently"" as he could while undergoing treatment.
His show was heard on more than 600 U.S. stations by, according to Limbaugh's website, up to 27 million people weekly. According to Forbes, Limbaugh was paid $85 million in 2020.
'A GUIDING LIGHT'
In a statement on Wednesday, Trump said: ""Rush was a friend to myself and millions of Americans - a guiding light with the ability to see the truth and paint vivid pictures over the airwaves.""
Republican former President George W. Bush said in a statement, ""While he was brash, at times controversial, and always opinionated, he spoke his mind as a voice for millions of Americans and approached each day with gusto."" 
Limbaugh experienced a variety of medical problems over the years as well as an addiction to prescription painkillers that landed him in rehab in 2003. He espoused an unflinchingly populist brand of conservatism, railing against left-wing causes from global warming to healthcare reform as he helped shape the Republican Party's agenda in the media and mobilize its grass-roots supporters.
He promoted Trump's false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen through widespread fraud and irregularities. After Democrat Joe Biden was inaugurated as Trump's successor last month, Limbaugh told listeners the new president had not legitimately won. 
Limbaugh also compared the pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol in a Jan. 6 rampage that left five people dead and interrupted certification of Biden's victory to the American colonists who rose up against British rule in the 18th century.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Biden's ""condolences go out to the family and the friends"" of Limbaugh but she did not expect a formal statement from the president.
Limbaugh ridiculed mainstream news outlets and relished the controversies arising from his on-air commentary. His success helped spawn a new class of right-wing pundits on radio, television and the internet, among them Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY), Glenn Beck and Alex Jones.
He called his followers ""ditto heads."" He coined the term ""femi-Nazis"" to disparage women's rights activists. Limbaugh in 2012 called a law student who spoke to a congressional hearing about birth control a ""slut,"" causing some sponsors to pull advertising from his show.
Limbaugh's career, and talk radio in general, received a boost in 1987, when the U.S. Federal Communications Commission repealed rules requiring broadcasters to provide equal time to both sides of political debates. 

In the 1990s, Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency gave Limbaugh a fresh target, and he claimed to have helped engineer a 1994 Republican takeover of Congress. Limbaugh similarly took aim at Democrat Barack Obama, elected president in 2008. When Obama won the Nobel Peace prize, Limbaugh called it an award given to ""liberal sellouts.""

215,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 04:15PM ET</span>","Ex-UK prosecutor, fired for alleged swearing at FBI, wins employment case","By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A British former prosecutor fired by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after allegedly swearing at an FBI officer in a London pub has won a lawsuit for unfair dismissal and breach of contract.
An employment tribunal ruled that Tom Martin, who led the British part of a global bribery investigation into the prominent Ahsani family and their Monaco-based energy consultancy Unaoil, probably did not use expletives and that U.S. agencies ""clearly"" wanted him removed from his post.
Remedies will be determined at a later date, it said in a judgment seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
The former case controller, who is seeking compensation and reinstatement, was fired for gross misconduct in December 2018 - around two years after allegedly calling an FBI agent a ""quisling"", ""spy"" and a four-letter expletive in a pub after a meeting at the U.S. embassy in London about Unaoil.
But the tribunal found that the FBI officer did not take offence at anything Martin had said and that no reasonable employer should ignore the possibility that such a late complaint might be triggered by ulterior motives.
A SFO spokesperson said only: ""We are carefully considering the judgment and all our options.""
Martin alleged he was fired because the U.S. Department of Justice and Ahsanis wanted to remove him from the Unaoil case and thwart the SFO's attempts to extradite Saman Ahsani, a key suspect, to Britain from Rome in 2018.
The tribunal agreed.
""I find it inescapable that the U.S. agencies and the (Ahsani) defence team had the same reason for raising the complaints, namely that they wanted the claimant removed so as to prevent difficulty with their joint wish to have Mr Ahsani extradited to the U.S.,"" it said.
The latest twist in the Unaoil saga is another blow to SFO director Lisa Osofsky, who has already drawn rebuke from a judge over contacts with an Ahsani agent, and has turned a spotlight on how bitterly U.S. and British prosecutors wrestled over prime Unaoil suspects.
The SFO has secured three convictions in the Unaoil investigation to date.
But in a coup for U.S. authorities, British brothers Cyrus and Saman Ahsani, Unaoil's former CEO and COO, pleaded guilty in the U.S. in 2019 to being part of a multimillion-dollar bribery scam to help major Western companies win energy projects in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa over two decades.

The meeting, announced by State Department spokesman Ned Price at a regular briefing on Wednesday, will be the first of the informal group under the Biden administration that took office on Jan. 20, although it has discussed its future role in bilateral calls with members since then.
""This discussion with the Quad foreign ministers is critical to advancing our shared goals in the free and open Indo-Pacific and rising to the defining challenges of our time, including coordinating our efforts and COVID-19 response, as well as climate change,"" Price said.
Blinken will also discuss shared global challenges with counterparts from France, Germany and the UK in a separate call on Thursday, Price said.
President Joe Biden has said working closely with allies will be key to his strategy toward China, in which he has said the United States will aim to ""out-compete"" Beijing.

Japan hosted an in-person meeting of Quad foreign ministers in October and the four countries the following month held their largest joint naval exercises in over a decade.

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound bombs at two protests in Madrid and Barcelona on Wednesday, each attended by thousands, the day after a rapper was arrested on charges of glorifying terrorism and insulting royalty in his songs.
Protests in the capital's central Plaza de Sol square were initially peaceful, with people clapping their hands in unison and chanting ""No more police violence"" and ""Freedom for Pablo Hasel"", the rapper detained in the Catalan city of Lleida on Tuesday.
But police charged into the crowd wielding batons after a few protesters began throwing glass bottles and stones they had loosened from the pavement. Some protesters responded by setting fire to containers to create barricades in the narrow Madrid streets.
In Catalonia's Barcelona, there were similar scenes as local police the Mossos d'Esquadra fired rubber bullets into the crowd on Wednesday, injuring a Reuters reporter on the ground.
When Catalan protesters began throwing projectiles at the armoured vans, the Mossos retaliated by shooting rubber bullets aimed at face-level. As the riots appeared to stagnate, large stretches of central Barcelona streets were choked with smoke from burning bins.
Pablo Hasel, known for his radical leftist views, had missed a deadline last Friday to surrender to authorities to serve a nine-month jail term handed down in 2018 - a sentence that caused an uproar in Spain and led the government to announce it would make free speech laws less restrictive.
On Tuesday, police had stormed a university building where Hasel had barricaded himself and arrested him, triggering rallies and riots in Barcelona and other Catalan cities.
Police arrested 18 people, while 55 were injured, including 25 officers, officials said on Tuesday.
Protest organisers used social media to call for further rallies on Wednesday night to demand Hasel's release across Spain, including in Madrid. 
A source at Catalonia's interior department said police had ""strengthened sensitive areas"" to avoid more riots, but declined to give further details. 
During a news briefing, regional security chief Miquel Samper appealed to protesters to congregate peacefully. 

A police source said there was no plan to bolster security nationwide for the protests, however.

The move follows a standoff between the elected assembly and the appointed government that led the cabinet to resign last month. The emir, facing his first big political challenge since assuming power in September, had reappointed Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Sabah to nominate a new cabinet. 
KUNA gave no further details in the statement, which was also carried on the cabinet Twitter account. 
The emir has final say in state matters.
Last month's government resignation came after more than 30 MPs in the 50-seat assembly supported a motion to question Sheikh Sabah, premier since late 2019, on various issues, including his choice of ministers.
Since being reappointed on Jan. 24, Sheikh Sabah has been holding consultations with parliamentary blocs ahead of nominating a new cabinet for the emir to approve and has asked for time to select ministers, irritating some parliamentarians.
The political tension complicates efforts to tackle a severe liquidity crunch in the wealthy OPEC member state caused by low oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic.
Frequent rows and deadlocks between cabinet and the assembly have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament over decades, hampering investment and economic and fiscal reform.
The previous government has been acting in a caretaker role.

Kuwait has the most vibrant political system among Gulf Arab states, with a parliament able to pass, and block, legislation and question ministers. Senior government posts are occupied by members of Kuwait's ruling family.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Roberto Manuel wore two shirts, three jackets and four pairs of pants to brace himself for subzero temperatures in Matamoros, the Mexican city opposite Texas, where he lives in a flimsy tent while waiting to resolve an asylum claim in the United States. 
""It was cold last year, but not like this with ice,"" the 43-year-old said on Tuesday evening by phone from the encampment, where he is among about 1,000 migrants, most from Central America, hoping to be granted refuge across the border.
Manuel, from Nicaragua, has lived there a year and a half under former President Donald Trump's controversial Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program that makes asylum seekers wait in Mexico for U.S. court hearings.
He is hopeful that President Joe Biden will make migration policies more humane, ending the uncertainty of his life in limbo on the border so he can make plans to work with a friend in Miami. 
In fact, Biden's administration has said a new process will gradually begin in coming days to allow thousands of MPP asylum seekers to await courts' decisions within the United States, a policy change that should eventually empty the camp. But Manuel said he is fuzzy on the details. 
For now, there is just the stinging cold, even in his layers, which has plunged swathes of northern Mexico and the southern United States into chilling temperatures and left millions of people without power. 
""Everything froze - the water we cook with, even clothes became stiff with ice,"" Manuel recalled from the previous night, when sleet pummeled the plastic tarps slung over camping tents as extra protection from the elements.
Even in the daytime, icicles clung to tent roofs and shards of ice glittered on the ground, a video filmed by another camp resident showed.
""How are we surviving the cold? With the embrace of God, nothing else,"" said Sandra Andrade, 44, of El Salvador, narrating the video. 
Her daughters, ages 8 and 11, left the camp a few months ago to join their uncle in Boston, and Andrade said she was relieved they were spared the deep freeze. 
""If they had been here in this icebox, they would be crying from cold every night,"" she said in an interview. Even she has had trouble sleeping, kept awake by the noisy wind stirring up the flaps of tents and tarps. 
Now with Biden in office, Andrade said she hopes to be able to soon reunite with her daughters, although she worries the brutal cold snap could put a dent in the new plan. 

""If it's causing a slowdown in sending the vaccine, imagine a process like this,"" she said.

WELLINGTON/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - New Zealand said on Wednesday it will pull out its last six troops from Afghanistan by May, the first foreign government to confirm a withdrawal since peace talks began and coming at an uncertain period for the process as violence rises.
Three of the troops are deployed to the Afghanistan National Army Officer Academy and three to the NATO Resolute Support Mission Headquarters. 
""After 20 years of a NZDF presence in Afghanistan, it is now time to conclude our deployment,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement.
Despite New Zealand's small presence, experts said the announcement, which comes the same day NATO defence ministers are meeting to assess plans for Afghanistan, was an important symbolic milestone.
""At a moment when all key stakeholders ... are keen to know what the foreign troop posture will be, it's significant that the first NATO partner since the Doha deal has said it's leaving,"" said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Programme at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, adding it was a ""small propaganda victory"" for the insurgent Taliban.
The United States signed a troop-withdrawal deal in Doha last year with the Taliban that called for a reduction in violence by all sides. Peace talks have largely stalled in recent weeks.
New Zealand is considered a close partner of the alliance and a NATO official told Reuters they welcomed the ""the long-standing valuable contributions"" made by New Zealand.
NATO defence ministers this week are taking part in a virtual conference that will discuss what their plans are for Afghanistan as violence escalates.
Sources told Reuters last month that foreign troops plan to stay in Afghanistan beyond the May deadline envisaged by the troop-withdrawal agreement. A final decision is not expected until Washington completes a review of its plans.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter he welcomed the announcement. 
""We urge all countries that have exhausted their troops in a long and unwinnable war in Afghanistan to take similar steps,"" he said.
New Zealand had deployed more than 3,500 defence and other agency personnel to Afghanistan since 2001, with 10 New Zealanders killed.

David Frost served as Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator, both for the initial deal which took Britain out of the EU on January 31 2020 and for negotiations on a trade deal, which replaced a transition period at the end of the year.
The government had previously indicated that Frost would continue to advise the government on matters relating to the EU, but his appointment to Johnson's cabinet of top ministers was not expected.
His appointment will take effect from March 1, Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement.
Frost is a member of parliament's unelected House of Lords.
He paid tribute to Michael Gove, the senior minister who previously led the implementation the EU exit agreement and free trade deal.
Frost will take over from Gove as UK Chair of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee. This means he takes on the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels to make the complex parts of the trade deal relating to Northern Ireland work smoothly.
""I am hugely honoured to have been appointed Minister to take forward our relationship with the EU after Brexit,"" Frost said on Twitter.

""In doing so I stand on the shoulders of giants & particularly those of @michaelgove who did an extraordinary job for this country in talks with EU over the past year.""

At an estimated cost of more than 100 billion euros, the venture brings together Germany, France and Spain to forge a future weapons system that is seen as the heart of a deepening European defence cooperation.
Dassault Aviation , Airbus and Indra are supposed to build the aircraft, which is expected to be operational from 2040 with a view to replacing France's Rafale and Germany's Eurofighter warplanes over time. 
At the beginning of February, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron failed to settle the issue, thus leaving open when the next tranche of payments amounting to at least 5 billion euros in total can be released, according to insiders.
On Wednesday, envoys of the defence ministries of Germany, France, Spain as well as from Dassault, Airbus and Indra met at the DGA in Paris to try to clear the impasse, security and industry sources told Reuters. 
Part of the controversy revolves around intellectual property rights, and who should possess them in the end. 
Before moving ahead with the venture, Germany is trying to gain more concessions from France on the issue, insiders said, adding that Berlin would like to be able to use technologies co-developed with Paris for its own projects.
Disagreements run so deep that there are even considerations to build two demonstrators instead of just one, one source told Reuters.
A senior French parliamentary figure also expressed doubts about the project's viability, citing both diverging approaches and political constraints, such as Berlin’s refusal to participate in combat operations abroad.
""To be honest, it would be a lot easier for us to work with Britain because we share the same military culture,"" the MP told Reuters. Britain is running its own fighter jet program, Tempest, with Italy and Sweden.

The chance to become a police officer was a dream come true for Oleksandr, who according to his mother has only days to live.
Oleksandr lives with his mother and sister in the town of Chernivtsi, in a shelter for women and children. Marta Levchenko, who runs the shelter, had written a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post about Oleksandr's wish, asking for help to make it come true. 
""We knew that this child has a dream and is waiting for a miracle to happen,"" Levchenko said. 
""I am impressed that so many police officers from all over Ukraine replied to my Facebook post, they asked where the child lives. They sewed a uniform with a badge for Andriychuk."" 
On Monday, Oleksandr was surprised as a parade of police cars and vans drove up in the snow outside the shelter as he watched from a window. 
Officers stood in rows clapping and saluting the boy, gave him a toy police car and pinned a badge on his chest in a special ceremony. They loaded his wheelchair into a police van so that he could go on his first patrol.
""We are ready to do everything possible and not let him go because he is such a good kid,"" said Levchenko.

(Reuters) - Six mobile advertising companies said Wednesday they have formed a partnership to help marketers and app developers adjust to upcoming Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) changes that will affect how advertising works on iPhones. 
Apple will soon begin to prompt iPhone users to allow apps to use their data for personalized advertising, a move that has drawn backlash from tech rival  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which argues the changes will hurt the social media company's ad business.
The Post-IDFA Alliance will provide tips and best practices to help advertisers and developers ensure ads are placed in front of relevant consumers and the effectiveness of those ads can still be measured after the Apple changes are rolled out, said Mark Ellis, chief executive of mobile marketing company Liftoff, which is part of the alliance.
That will include videos, webinars, and other materials on topics such as understanding what data can be used in an ""Apple-friendly manner,"" Ellis said.

The new partnership also includes Fyber, Chartboost, Singular, InMobi and Vungle, which are companies that specialize in mobile advertising.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain on Wednesday proposed that the U.N. Security Council call for ceasefires to allow for COVID-19 vaccinations, a move that will be a key test of cooperation at the United Nations between China and new U.S. President Joe Biden's administration.
Britain's Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged a ""swift adoption"" by the 15-member council of a draft resolution calling for vaccination ceasefires, warning that 160 million people are at risk of missing out due to instability and conflict.
""Local ceasefires are going to be essential to enable lifesaving vaccinations to take place,"" Raab said. 
The U.N. Security Council took more than three months to back a call by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for a global pandemic ceasefire last year due to bickering between China and former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. 
""We need to resist the prejudice, respect science and reject disinformation and attempts to politicize the pandemic. In this regard, members of the Security Council must lead by example,"" China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the council on Wednesday.
He made no mention of the British initiative and instead pushed warring parties to implement ceasefires called for by the Security Council in the resolution adopted in July, while Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia signaled that another resolution is not needed. 
Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD) hopes the council can adopt a new resolution in ""the coming weeks."" 
'WILDLY UNEVEN, UNFAIR'
Long-simmering tensions between China and the Trump administration hit the boiling point over the pandemic, spotlighting Beijing's bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington's traditional leadership at the United Nations.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would pay by the end of the month more than $200 million it owes to the World Health Organization (WHO). Biden rescinded a Trump decision to withdraw from the Geneva-based body this year. 
Blinken said an ongoing WHO inquiry into the pandemic origins must be independent, based on science and facts and free from interference. The White House has raised concerns that China, where the virus first emerged in 2019, could alter the report. 
""To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one all countries must make available all data from the earliest days of any outbreak,"" Blinken said, without mentioning China.
The Trump administration accused Beijing of a lack of transparency that it says worsened the COVID-19 outbreak. China denied those assertions. 
Secretary-General Guterres appealed for a global immunization plan, urging the Group of 20 rich and big emerging powers to take the lead.
""We must ensure that everybody, everywhere, can be vaccinated as soon as possible. Yet progress on vaccinations has been wildly uneven and unfair,"" Guterres told the council. 

""Just 10 countries have administered 75% of all COVID-19 vaccines. Meanwhile, more than 130 countries have not received a single dose. Those affected by conflict and insecurity are at particular risk of being left behind.""

The Strasbourg-based court (ECHR) said it had ruled on Tuesday to ""indicate to the Government of Russia"" that it should with immediate effect free Navalny, whose arrest and jailing have sparked anti-Kremlin protests in Russia.
The ECHR, the international court of the Council of Europe, Europe's main human rights forum, said its decision to demand Navalny's release was motivated by a possible risk to his life. 
It said in a statement that information provided by Russia - a member of the Council of Europe - about the conditions in which Navalny was being held had been contested by the opposition politician. 
""This demand is baseless and unlawful, because it does not contain any reference to any fact or any norm of the law, which would have allowed the court to take this decision,"" Russian Justice Minister Konstantin Chuychenko said.
He was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying the decision was an unprecedented degree of meddling in the work of the Russian court system and that the demand was impossible to fulfil, as it had no basis in Russian law. 
Russia passed a law last year giving its national legislation precedence over international treaties and rulings from international bodies in cases when they conflict with the Russian constitution.
Navalny's allies had earlier published a letter from a member of the court containing its decision which a Navalny ally, Leonid Volkov, said was binding.
Navalny, 44, was detained after returning to Russia from Germany last month and jailed on Feb. 2 for violating the parole terms on what he says was a politically motivated charge.
He had been treated in Germany for a poisoning with what many Western countries say was a nerve agent in Siberia last August, and has blamed the attack on Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Kremlin has dismissed Navalny's accusations and questioned whether he was poisoned.
Several Western countries have called for his release and said they could impose sanctions against Russia over the case. 

Navalny's lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth's 99-year-old husband, was admitted to hospital on Tuesday as a precautionary measure after feeling ill with an ailment that is not related to COVID-19.
The prince, whose official title is the Duke of Edinburgh, walked unaided into the private King Edward VII Hospital in London after feeling unwell for a short period, a royal source said. 
The queen, 94, remains at Windsor Castle near London, where the pair have been staying during Britain's coronavirus pandemic. Both received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in January.
""The Duke's admission is a precautionary measure, on the advice of His Royal Highness's doctor, after feeling unwell,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.
""The Duke is expected to remain in hospital for a few days of observation and rest."" 
A royal source said Philip did not have a COVID-19-related illness and that it was not an emergency.
Within an hour of his arrival, camera crews and photographers from Britain, Australia, France and Germany had gathered outside the hospital where policemen stood guard.
""Really sorry to hear that His Royal Highness, the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital,"" British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said. ""Sending him my best wishes for a speedy recovery.""
A former naval officer renowned for his sometimes brusque manner and humour, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947, five years before she became queen. He is now by far the longest-serving consort of any British monarch.
The couple's marriage, the earlier-than-expected inheritance of the British throne, and family life with four children has been charted in recent years by the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) drama The Crown.
Philip is now rarely seen in public. He stepped down from official engagements in August 2017 after completing more than 22,000 solo events and thousands more alongside the Queen.
During the pandemic the royal family has visited hospitals and frontline workers, either online or in person, to thank them for their efforts. Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, visited staff in a Birmingham hospital earlier on Wednesday.
The royal family has also been in the news in recent days after Philip's grandson Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan announced they were expecting their second child, and that they had agreed to a sit-down interview with Oprah Winfrey.
Among the topics they will discuss are why the couple quit the royal family to spend more time in America last year.
The Greek-born Philip has had several stays in hospital over the last decade, including treatment for an infection in 2017 and hip replacement surgery. He was previously admitted to hospital at the end of 2019.

The Duke is due to turn 100 in June. The tabloid newspapers have reported that he does not want any public fuss.

Pablo Hasel, known for his radical leftist views, had missed a deadline last Friday to surrender to authorities to serve a nine-month jail term handed down in 2018 - a sentence that caused an uproar in Spain and led the government to announce it would make free speech laws less restrictive.
Police on Tuesday stormed a university building where Hasel had barricaded himself and arrested him, triggering rallies and riots in Barcelona and other Catalan cities. 
Some protesters set fire to trash containers, looted shops and clashed with police who used batons and foam projectiles on various occasions.
Police arrested 18 people, while 55 were injured, including 25 officers, officials said.
Protest organiser used social media to call for further rallies on Wednesday night to demand Hasel's release across Spain, including in Madrid. 
A source at Catalonia's interior department said police had ""strengthened sensitive areas"" to avoid more riots, but declined to give further details. 
During a news briefing, regional security chief Miquel Samper appealed to protesters to congregate peacefully. 

A police source said there was no plan to bolster security nationwide for the protests, however.

The European Union's top court ruled last year that the law ""introduced discriminatory and unjustified restrictions with regard to both the organisations ... and the persons granting them such support"" in breach of fundamental EU rights, including on protection of personal data and freedom of association.
The Commission, the EU's executive, is now preparing to launch further legal proceedings against Hungary because it has failed since the ruling to change the 2017 law, the three officials said on condition of anonymity. 
A decision by the Commission to trigger an ""infringement procedure"", which is used against member states seen to be violating the bloc's laws, was pending final approval on Wednesday, they said. 
The Hungarian government and Hungary's EU mission did not immediately reply to requests for comment. 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has rejected EU criticism of the law, and of other legislation which the Commission says undercuts democratic standards. 
If the decision is taken to launch an infringement procedure, Hungary will be sent a ""letter of formal notice"" and will have two months to respond. 
If Hungary does not comply within this period, the Commission can demand that the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) fine Budapest. 
The EU has long accused Orban of failing to meet democratic standards on the freedom of courts, media, non-governmental organisations and academics, and of violating the law with his stance on migration.

Orban dismissed the criticism in an interview with Reuters last September, saying he was a ""freedom fighter"".

Germany installed frontier checks on Sunday, drawing concerns about supply-chain disruptions. 
The restrictions along the normally open borders were prompted by alarm over outbreaks in the Czech Republic and Austria's Tyrol region of strains of the coronavirus that spread faster and cause more illness.
Long lines of trucks formed on the Czech-German border daily since Monday as German authorities only allowed in drivers and some commuters with negative coronavirus tests.
""What is happening on German borders is of course against the internal market and a great problem for us all,"" Babis told a news conference after leaders of the Visegrad Group of the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia met Michel in the Polish city of Krakow.
The region's industries are tightly integrated with Germany. Large volumes of goods from Hungary and Slovakia and further southeast also pass to Germany through the affected Czech and Austrian borders.
""We informed Charles Michel about it and asked for help,"" Babis told the televised news conference.
""The conditions for our drivers are extremely strict. I understand Germany but when the (border) situation was reversed in the first wave (of the pandemic), we were very flexible. We cannot cripple international freight, manufacturing and other production."" 

The Czech Republic reported 12,486 new cases of infection for Tuesday, the highest since Jan. 8, and the country's health minister warned hospitals across the country may overflow in two to three weeks unless the trend changes.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Peace talks for Afghanistan have not made sufficient progress to allow a withdrawal of foreign troops, German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said on Wednesday ahead of a virtual meeting with her NATO counterparts.
The Afghan government and Taliban militants began peace talks in Doha last September, but negotiations have largely stalled. 
NATO defence ministers will discuss on Thursday whether the Taliban is making good on a separate 2020 peace deal with the United States, which called for militants to curb attacks and for foreign troops to withdraw by May 1.
Washington is currently reviewing this deal.
""This (lack of progress in peace talks) means we will have to prepare for a changing security situation and a rising threat to both international troops and our own soldiers,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said in a statement.
Germany has contributed some 1,100 soldiers to NATO's mission, which numbers 9,600 personnel in total, training and assisting Afghan forces. The mission also includes some 2,500 U.S. military personnel.
Many fear that progress during two decades of foreign intervention in Afghanistan could quickly unravel in the event of NATO's forces withdrawing, threatening gains in areas from women's rights to democracy. 
In her statement, Kramp-Karrenbauer echoed comments by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said on Monday the Taliban must do more to meet the terms of the 2020 peace agreement with the United States.

Attacks in Afghanistan, including a bomb that killed the deputy governor of the capital Kabul in December, have prompted members of the U.S. Congress and international rights groups to call for a delay to the pullout agreed under former President Donald Trump.

""I attended today to pray for this pandemic to end and for all of us who have suffered,"" said Gener Lacerna after attending mass.
Instead of dabbing ash in the sign of a cross directly onto foreheads, nuns sprinkled ash on the tops of people's heads to minimise physical contact with those entering churches in a country where about 80% of the 108 million population are Catholic. 
People queued in orderly lines, each standing on evenly spaced markers, while those attending services sat on pews with big gaps in between them.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand warned users of Clubhouse on Wednesday not to break the law after the audio social media app emerged almost overnight as a platform for discussion of the monarchy, the latest example of the fast-growing app drawing the ire of governments in Asia.
Digital minister Puttipong Punnakanta said the Thai authorities were watching Clubhouse users, and political groups on the app were distorting information and potentially violating laws.
A large number of Thai users joined Clubhouse in recent days after Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a prominent Japan-based critic of the Thai palace, joined on Friday and started discussing the monarchy.
Clubhouse, launched last year, lets users host audio chats. It has surged in popularity in the past couple of months, especially after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk appeared on it last month.
""What needs to be spoken will be spoken. It is risky but it must be encouraged, as the more we speak about it the more such discussions become the norm,"" Pavin, who had gained more than 70,000 followers in his first five days on the app, told Reuters. ""These exercises help boost courage.""
Youth protests last year focused on demands for reforms to the royal system in Thailand, a subject long considered taboo.Since the protests started, at least 59 people have been summoned or charged under Thailand's ""lese majeste"" law against insulting or defaming the king.
AUDIENCE GROWS
The Thai government regularly uses a cyber crime law to prosecute critics of the monarchy on national security grounds. It has previously cracked down on such criticisms on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), YouTube and Twitter.
Pavin's audience grew from around 300 on Friday to over 12,000 on Tuesday night, when he discussed King Maha Vajiralongkorn in a room that quickly reached the app's maximum capacity. Other rooms criticising the Thai government and the use of the lese majeste law are also popular, with many exiled critics speaking about their experiences. 
The app's quick rise has drawn the attention of other governments in the region. Earlier this month, China blocked access to the app after a brief period when thousands of mainland users joined in discussions often censored in China, including about Xinjiang detention camps and Hong Kong's National Security Law.
Some Hong Kong pro-democracy activists have gained thousands of followers on the app, although users there appear so far to have stopped short of hosting public discussions about reviving protests that might attract Beijing's wrath. 
On Wednesday, Indonesia said Clubhouse had yet to register with authorities and could be banned if it failed to comply with local regulations.

Indonesia, which compels tech platforms to register, has already banned Reddit, Vimeo, and scores of pornography sites.

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets last month to urge Russia to free Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny ahead of the September election. The 44-year-old opposition politician was detained and later jailed for alleged parole violations upon his return to Russia. He had been treated in Germany for a nerve agent poisoning he sustained in Siberia last August.
The Kremlin has suggested that Navalny is a CIA asset who is being used by Western intelligence services to destabilise Russia, and Moscow has repeatedly told the European Union to keep out of its domestic affairs.
Russia has itself been accused of meddling in several elections abroad, including in the 2016 U.S. presidential vote.
""The citizens of Russia will make their choice (at the parliamentary elections), and we must defend this choice from any attempts of external interference,"" Putin said at a televised meeting with the leaders of the political parties represented in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament.
""We cannot allow any blows against Russia's sovereignty, against the right of our people to be the master on their our land,"" he said, without detailing which countries he was referring to.
Navalny said last year he thought Russia's intelligence services had poisoned him with a nerve agent because authorities saw him as a threat ahead of the parliamentary elections.
The Kremlin has rejected any suggestion that Putin or authorities had anything to do with Navalny's poisoning.
Some European countries have called for sanctions against Moscow over the Navalny case, including halting the construction of the undersea Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, designed to export gas from Russia to Germany by bypassing Ukraine.
Putin accused the countries that have called for sanctions against the project of trying to use Nord Stream 2 as a tool to punish Russia.
""Why is everyone circling around Nord Steam 2?"" Putin said.

""They (Western countries) want to force Russia to pay for their geopolitical project in Ukraine,"" he added, referring to the conflict that erupted in the country's east after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An Indian court on Wednesday cleared journalist Priya Ramani of criminal defamation charges brought by former union minister M. J. Akbar after she publicly accused him of sexual assault in 2018.
The verdict by a court in New Delhi has been hailed as a victory for India's #MeToo movement, in which Akbar - a veteran editor who founded many publications - was one of the highest profile figures to be accused.
He stepped down as minister of state for external affairs in 2018 after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct following Ramani's allegations. Akbar remains a member of the upper house, the Rajya Sabha.
Akbar filed the criminal defamation lawsuit against Ramani in October 2018, accusing her of having ""intentionally put forward malicious, fabricated and salacious"" allegations. He has denied similar allegations by other women.
""Even a man of social status can be a sexual harasser,"" the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey told the Delhi court as he acquitted Ramani.
Her decision to go public with her accusations against Akbar was lauded by Indian women's rights activists for lending strength to the country's #MeToo movement, which began in 2018.
""We won this,"" the #MeTooIndia handle run by journalist Rituparna Chatterjee posted on Twitter after the verdict. 

Several powerful men from the worlds of media, entertainment and the arts accused in it have faced fallout since then, including ousters. But activists say more needs to be done to encourage women to come forward to report sexual misconduct, and the movement has had little impact in India's remote and rural areas where sex crimes still largely go unreported.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's government has issued a decree establishing a China-style internet gateway that will allow online traffic to be controlled and monitored, prompting local concern that democratic freedoms could be under threat.
The 11-page decree announced on Wednesday seeks to facilitate and manage internet connections to help revenue collection, protect national security and maintain social order, culture and tradition.
The gateway's operator will support authorities with ""measures to prevent and disconnect all network connections that affect national income, security, social order, morality, culture, traditions and customs"". 
It comes as Prime Minister Hun Sen's government faces international criticism over a crackdown that has decimated civil society and the political opposition, resulting in a power monopoly for his party, and criminal charges and jail terms for many of its rivals. 
The gateway is similar to that of China, an important economic ally for Cambodia, which has seen its ties with the United States and European Union deteriorate recently. 
The decree gives service providers one year to connect to the gateway, but gave no timeframe for its launch.
It requires service providers to make users complete online forms with their correct identities and says failure to connect networks to the gateway would result in operating licenses being suspended and bank accounts frozen. 
Chak Sopheap, executive director of the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, said the law had implications for free speech, privacy, data protection and public information, and Cambodia's legal framework offered little protection for digital freedoms. 
""The last few years have seen a sharp increase in the number of citizens being threatened, harassed and even prosecuted for their use of the internet and for exercising their right to free speech,"" Chak Sopheap told Reuters. 

Government spokesman Phay Siphan there was no order to the internet in Cambodia and the decree was less intrusive than regulations in the United States and Britain.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants to see proof that Sheikha Latifa, one of the ruler of Dubai's daughters, is still alive after the BBC showed a video in which she said she was being held against her will in a barricaded villa, the foreign minister said on Wednesday.
""It's deeply troubling and you can see a young woman under deep distress,"" Dominic Raab said.
In the video, shown as part of the BBC's Panorama current affairs programme, Latifa, 35, said: ""I am a hostage and this villa has been converted into a jail."" 
She said she was making the video in the bathroom of the villa, the only room she could lock herself into, adding: ""All the windows are barred shut, I can't open any window.""
Asked whether he would support seeing some kind of proof from the United Arab Emirates that Sheikha Latifa was alive, Raab told Sky News television: ""Given what we've just seen, I think people would just at a human level want to see that she's alive and well."" 
Britain is concerned about the footage and the United Nations will be following up on the video, Raab told the BBC.
The Dubai government's media office referred questions about the video to Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum's law firm, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters could not independently verify when or where the video was recorded.
Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum drew international attention in 2018 when a human rights group released a video made by her in which she described an attempt to escape Dubai.
Last March, a London High Court judge said he accepted as proved a series of allegations made by Sheikh Mohammed's former wife, Princess Haya, in a legal battle, including that the sheikh ordered the abduction of Latifa. The sheikh's lawyers rejected the allegations.

KYIV (Reuters) - A trial began in Belarus on Wednesday of a former banking executive who was jailed last year after challenging President Alexander Lukashenko in an election that sparked mass protests against the veteran leader's rule. 
Viktor Babariko, the former head of Belgazprombank, faces up to 15 years in prison on corruption charges that his team says were fabricated to prevent him from standing as a candidate in last August's presidential election.
Wearing a face mask, his hands behind his back, the 57-year-old Babariko sat in a cage in the courtroom with other defendants, while dozens of supporters waited in freezing temperatures outside trying to get in. 
More than 33,000 people have been detained in a violent crackdown on protests following the election that Lukashenko's opponents say was blatantly rigged to prolong the rule of the president, who has been in power since 1994. Lukashenko denies electoral fraud. 
The crackdown prompted new Western sanctions on Minsk but Lukashenko, backed by diplomatic and financial support from neighbouring Russia, has refused to resign. 
""For many of us, this year has become a year of victory - victory over the slavery of our own soul,"" Babariko said in a statement before the trial, accusing the government of ""medieval repressions"". 
Political analysts had seen Babariko as the biggest electoral threat to Lukashenko until his arrest last June. Following his detention, his ally Maria Kolesnikova joined forces with two other women to lead the opposition campaign. 
Last week Lukashenko promised to enact political reforms but the pledge was followed this week by raids on the homes of human rights activists and journalists.
In a joint statement released on Wednesday, the United States, the European Union and Britain condemned the raids and the wider human rights situation in Belarus and urged authorities to immediately release all arbitarily detained people and to respect democracy and the rule of law.

Babariko's trial coincided with separate proceedings against two journalists from the Poland-based television channel Belsat in Minsk. They face prison terms for reporting live from the protests.

Hannah Ingram-Moore told BBC television the online messages were kept a secret, saying the abuse from ""a vile minority"" would have broken his heart.
Moore struck a chord with locked-down Britain by walking around his garden with the help of a frame to raise 38.9 million pounds ($54.04 million) for the National Health Service.
While he received tens of thousands of supportive messages there were some that mocked and abused him.
""It was as pretty horrific as it could be,"" said Ingram-Moore.
""I couldn't tell him because how do you rationalise to a 100-year-old man that something so incredibly good can attract such horror,"" she said.
""It really did hurt and it really is hard to deal with but we have dealt with it and they will not win, they will never make this amazing thing negative.""
With a quick wit, Moore brought a simple message of hope and self-sacrifice. He died on Feb. 2 after testing positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 22, and he was also fighting pneumonia. 
His passing drew condolences from Queen Elizabeth, the British parliament and President Joe Biden's White House. 

Calls for social media companies to block users who send abusive messages have grown in recent weeks after several soccer players in England were targeted with racist abuse.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - A Mumbai court on Wednesday granted bail to an associate of a 22-year-old climate activist whose arrest for promoting an action plan for farmers' protests has caused outrage across the country.
Police had sought the arrest of Nikita Jacob, a Mumbai-based lawyer, for allegedly working together with activist Disha Ravi on a ""tool-kit"" or a document that it said was used to foment violence during a mass protest by farmers in Delhi last month.
Ravi, an activist linked to Swedish climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg, was arrested over the weekend on charges of sedition and remains in police custody.
But Jacob petitioned a court in Mumbai to stop the police from carrying out her own arrest warrant.
""The court has granted her three weeks interim relief,"" Sanjukta Dey, Jacob's lawyer, told reporters outside the court.
""There is nothing in the tool kit about violence, it is only for creating awareness about farm laws, it's not for creating violence,"" Dey added.
Dey said that Jacob had already been questioned by police on the document and she was ready to cooperate with them in their investigations into the events of Jan. 26, when farmers stormed the historic Red Fort in the old quarter of Delhi while the country was marking the Republic Day.
Thunberg tweeted a link to the ""tool-kit"" in early February, drawing international attention to the farmers' campaign against the Indian government's move to deregulate agriculture produce markets and open them to private players. She later deleted that post.
Politicians, students and activists have held protests against the arrest of Ravi, a founding member of the local arm of Thunberg's Fridays for Future climate change movement. On Wednesday, the student wing of the main opposition Congress party staged a protest in Delhi demanding her release.

A lawyer for Ravi has declined to comment. Her arrest comes at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government faces allegations it is suppressing dissent.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China has dismantled dozens of structures and moved vehicles to empty out entire camps along a disputed Himalayan border, where Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in a face-off since last summer, satellite images released on Wednesday show.
The nuclear-armed neighbours last week announced a plan to pull back troops, tanks and other equipment from the banks of Pangong Tso, a glacial lake in the Ladakh region, that became a flashpoint in the prolonged border dispute.
Satellite imagery of some areas on the northern bank of Pangong Tso from Tuesday supplied by Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR) show that multiple Chinese military camps, which could be seen there in late January, have been removed.
""Similar action is happening from our side also,"" an Indian official in New Delhi, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.
India's defence minister Rajnath Singh told parliament that both sides had agreed to pull back troops in ""a phased, coordinated and verified manner"" around Pangong Tso, after which military commanders would discuss ending the standoff in other parts of the Ladakh frontier.
Tensions began rising along the high-altitude border in April, when India accused Chinese troops of intruding into its side of the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border. China denied the allegation, saying it was operating in its own area.
But the confrontation spiralled in June when 20 Indian soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops were killed during hand-to-hand clashes in Ladakh's Galwan region - the first such casualties along the 3,500 km (2,200 mile) long border in decades. 
Despite several subsequent rounds of diplomatic and military talks, India and China had been unable to settle on an agreement until February, making the ongoing first phase of the withdrawal critical.
""What is happening now is that wherever troops, especially north and south of Pangong Tso, were in eyeball-to-eyeball contact, they have taken a step back to reduce tensions and pave way for further de-escalation,"" the Indian official said.
Videos and images released by the Indian army earlier this week also showed Chinese troops dismantling bunkers and tents, and tanks, soldier and vehicles moving out as part of the disengagement process.
But some experts have cautioned that current withdrawal is only the first step in a potentially long-drawn out process.
""It is still nowhere near a full disengagement or an agreement on what we should be doing,"" India's former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon told The Wire news outlet.

""We need much more than just disengagement. We need a return to the positions before April last year.""

250,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 04:17AM ET</span>",Myanmar coup opponents in big show of rejection of military claims,"(Reuters) - Opponents of Myanmar's military coup, including celebrities, veteran activists and students, rejected on Wednesday an army assertion that there was public support for overthrowing elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, and said their campaign would not burn out.
Protesters are deeply sceptical of the junta's assurances, given at a news conference on Tuesday, that there would be a fair election and it would hand over power, even as police filed an additional charge against Suu Kyi.
The Nobel Peace laureate, detained since the Feb. 1 coup, now faces a charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law as well as charges of illegally importing six walkie talkie radios. At a hearing by video conference on Tuesday, her next hearing was set for March 1.
""We're showing here that we're not in that 40 million they announced,"" Sithu Maung, an elected member of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) told a cheering crowd at the Sule Pagoda, a central protest site in the main city of Yangon.
Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the ruling council, told the Tuesday news conference that 40 million of the 53 million population supported the military's action, which he said was in line with the constitution. The army alleges there was fraud in a Nov. 8 election won by Suu Kyi's party that had been expected to pave the way for democratic reform.
A protester who gave her name as Khin was scornful of that.
""What they said was totally untrue ... They said there was vote fraud but look at the people here,"" said Khin.
The coup that cut short the Southeast Asian country's unsteady transition towards democracy has prompted daily demonstrations since Feb. 6, some drawing hundreds of thousands of people.
The takeover has also drawn strong Western criticism, with renewed anger from Washington and London over the additional charge for Suu Kyi. Although China has taken a softer line, its ambassador in Myanmar on Tuesday dismissed accusations it supported the coup.
U.N. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said he feared the possibility of violence against the protesters and made an urgent call on any country with influence over the generals, and businesses, to press them to avoid it.
In Yangon and elsewhere, motorists responded to a ""broken-down car campaign"" spreading on social media, stopping their supposedly stalled cars, with bonnets raised, on streets and bridges to block them to police and military trucks.
""We want the truth ... and the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint,"" said Ko Ye, 26, whose taxi was part of the break-down protest at the Sule Pagoda.
The president was also detained on the day of the coup.
Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners group said more than 450 arrests had been made since the coup, many of them in night-time raids. Those arrested include much of the NLD's senior leadership.
The suspension of the internet at night has added to a sense of fear. 
BACK UNDER HOUSE ARREST 
Zaw Min Tun told the news conference, the junta's first since the coup, the military was giving a guarantee that at an election would be held and power handed to the winner. He gave no time frame, but said the army would not be in power for long.
The last stretch of army rule lasted nearly half a century before democratic reforms began in 2011.
Suu Kyi, 75, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest for her efforts to end military rule.
The United States was ""disturbed"" by reports of the additional criminal charge against Suu Kyi, State Department spokesman Ned Price said. Washington imposed new sanctions last week on the Myanmar military. No additional measures were announced on Tuesday. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also decried the new criminal charge, saying it was ""fabricated"" by the military.
The unrest has revived memories of bloody suppression of protests under previous juntas.
Police have opened fire several times, mostly with rubber bullets, to disperse protesters. A protester who was shot in the head in Naypyitaw last week is not expected to survive. 
A policeman died of injuries sustained during a protest in the city of Mandalay on Monday, the military said.
As well as the demonstrations in towns across the ethnically diverse country, a civil disobedience movement has brought strikes that are crippling many functions of government.
Activist Min Ko Naing, a veteran of 1988 protests that the military crushed, said the disobedience campaign was key this time.
""They think if the leader is arrested, nothing can be done, but that's not working anymore,"" he said in a taped message to the crowd.
Actor Pyay Ti Oo said opposition could not be doused.

""They say we're like a brush fire and will stop after a while, but will we? No. Won't stop until we succeed,” he told the crowd.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 17, 2021 04:16AM ET</span>",Trial of 'Hotel Rwanda hero' set to begin amid family's fears of injustice,"By Clement Uwiringiyimana
KIGALI (Reuters) - Paul Rusesabagina has faced down murderous militias and been feted in Hollywood. On Wednesday, the former hotelier, depicted as a hero in a movie about Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, will defend himself against charges of terrorism in a Kigali courtroom. 
His family say Rusesabagina, a harsh critic of President Paul Kagame, is in poor health and his trial is a sham. Rwanda's government says he has fomented violence and directed deadly attacks on its territory from exile. 
“We don’t expect a fair trial,” his daughter Carine Kanimba, told Reuters on Tuesday. ""This hearing will be a theatre.""
The trial has thrust a spotlight not just on Rusesabagina, but on Kagame, whom rights groups accuse of using authoritarian means to quash political opposition and extend his 21-year presidency. Several high profile political dissidents have been murdered abroad; the government has denied any involvement. 
Kagame denies any accusations of abuses and has enjoyed widespread support from Western donors for restoring Rwanda to stability, cracking down on corruption and boosting economic growth in the East African nation of 12 million.
Arrested in August, Rusesabagina faces 13 charges, including terrorism and forming an armed rebel group.
His daughter said that the charges against her father were fabricated and that he was denied his choice of defence lawyers. His defence team was appointed by the government of Rwanda, which has said he is free to change them. He also has one Rwandan lawyer appointed by the family, although international lawyers have not been allowed to join his team. 
Judiciary spokesman Harrison Mutabazi said Rusesabagina was being tried like any other citizen.
""We give justice with due process,"" he told Reuters on Tuesday. 
MOVIE HERO
Rusesabagina's case has attracted international attention partly because the Oscar-nominated 2004 film “Hotel Rwanda”, was based on his life.
The movie shows how Rusesabagina, played by Don Cheadle, used his connections as a hotel manager to save ethnic Tutsis fleeing slaughter by Hutus. 
An estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed during the genocide. Rusesabagina's father was Hutu; his mother and wife were Tutsi.
Rusesabagina later obtained Belgian citizenship and became a U.S. resident. He received the Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honour, in 2005. 
He became a vocal critic of Kagame and called for armed resistance to the government in a YouTube video in December 2018, saying that democratic change was impossible. The year before, Kagame won a national election with 99% of the vote. 
During pre-trial hearings, Rusesabagina told judges he was kidnapped from Dubai. Rwandan officials have suggested he was tricked into boarding the plane.
In a September pre-trial hearing, Rusesabagina told the court that he had contributed 20,000 euros ($24,000.00) to the National Liberation Front (FLN), the military wing of the Movement for Democratic Change, a political party which he co-chaired from exile. But he denied any wrongdoing. 
Rusesabagina will be tried alongside 20 other Rwandans whom prosecutors describe as fighters for the FLN. Most were captured after attacks in Rwanda’s southern province in 2018, said judiciary spokesman Mutabazi.
The European Parliament last week called on Rwanda to give Rusesabagina a fair trial and condemned what it called his enforced disappearance, illegal rendition to Rwanda and incommunicado detention. 
The resolution prompted a response from Rwanda's parliament late on Tuesday. 
""The Rwanda parliament rejects the European parliament's baseless assertion that Paul Rusesabagina will not receive a fair trial in Rwanda, and calls on the government of Rwanda to continue to ensure this right is also fully upheld for the victims,"" legislators said.

Under the deal, sanctions were lifted in return for Iran agreeing curbs to its nuclear programme. Since Trump ditched the deal and reimposed sanctions, Tehran has gradually breached the deal's terms.

Lai, detained while awaiting a bail hearing on Thursday, has been charged with colluding with foreign forces under a sweeping national security law that Beijing imposed on Hong Kong last year.
The fugitives could face potential charges in Hong Kong over mass anti-government protests in 2019, with Andy Li, whom the papers identified as the person Lai was suspected of helping, being investigated for suspected national security crimes.
Neither newspaper gave further details. It was unclear if the national security legislation extends to the assistance Lai is suspected to have given Li.
Police did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
The Chinese coast guard captured the 12 fugitives in August as they tried to flee Hong Kong in a boat believed to be bound for Taiwan. All were held virtually incommunicado in a mainland China prison until a trial late in December.
Ten were jailed for terms ranging from seven months to three years for illegally crossing the border or organising the crossing, while two minors were sent back to Hong Kong.
Lai was already the most high-profile person to be charged under the new security law, for statements made on July 30 and Aug. 18, in which prosecutors say he requested foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.
He was arrested in an August raid by about 200 police officers on the newsroom of his Apple Daily, known for its feisty and critical coverage of China and Hong Kong.
Beijing imposed the new law on the former British colony last June, after months of pro-democracy protests, to target anything China that considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces.
Punishment under the law can range up to life in prison.

Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent and erodes freedoms in the semi-autonomous financial hub. Supporters say it restores stability after months of unrest.

KABUL/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Unusually intense fighting in the winter by Taliban insurgents has spurred Afghan government preparations for more violence in the warmer spring, which international players fear will further endanger the nation's fragile peace process.
Nearly a year after Washington signed a troop-withdrawal deal with the Taliban that called for a reduction in violence by all sides, attacks by the group have escalated, according to General Scott Miller, the head of U.S. forces and the NATO-led non-combat Resolute Support mission.
""Taliban violence is much higher than historical norms,"" Miller told Reuters. ""It just doesn't create the conditions to move forward in what is hopefully a historic turning point for Afghanistan.""
Typically fighting lulls during the snowy winter months before the Taliban launch a ""spring offensive"" around March. 
Miller said that the fighting now was an indicator that not only would there be a spring offensive - a move many diplomats view as against the spirit of the Doha agreement - but that it could be more intense than before.
It comes as negotiations have largely stalled in Doha in recent weeks and Taliban leaders have left Qatar, a senior state department official said, leading to growing fears that talks could be on the brink of collapse.
""If the violence isn't reduced, it's going to make a peace process very, very difficult; it would be very difficult for any side to make the necessary compromises,"" Miller said.
PREPARATIONS UNDER WAY
The Afghan government has instructed security forces to carry out a comprehensive troop restructuring and design operations to prepare for a ""tough and hard"" spring offensive, two government sources told Reuters.
They added that Afghanistan's special forces from different institutions such as the military and police are being streamlined to operate under one command. Highly experienced commanders have been appointed to key areas, and security forces were planning to conduct more airstrikes to avoid losses on the ground.
An Afghan National Security Council spokesman said they were ""ready for any kind of war"", though they remained in ""active defence"" mode.
Four Taliban sources said that most of their commanders had in recent weeks cut short annual training sessions after being called back to the battlefield to prepare for intensive fighting. 
Three residents in areas dominated by the Taliban in north-eastern Afghanistan had noticed a pick-up in the group's activity in recent weeks, telling Reuters they had seen Taliban fighters moving en masse, holding meetings in mosques and beginning food and recruitment drives.
""In the past two weeks the topics Taliban preachers preach, especially on Friday prayers... have changed,"" said a tribal elder from Kunduz province who asked not to be named for security reasons. ""They preach about... fighting against invasion, and they openly invite people to join them. It's a clear message that they are preparing for another fight this spring.""
A member of what the Taliban considers its special forces told Reuters that the group was preparing to act when there was an announcement about foreign troops.
""If they don't leave Afghanistan on the preset date then the USA, NATO and the world will face a dangerous war, a war that never happened in the past 20 years,"" he said.
A Taliban spokesman did not reply to request for comment on the spring offensive.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is reviewing its plans for Afghanistan, including whether to stick to the May 1 deadline in the troop withdrawal agreement former President Trump's administration signed with the Taliban in February 2020.
Miller said his command recognised that foreign forces could be a target if the Taliban view the deal as breached.
Experts and diplomats see a vanishing window of opportunity for talks to survive, although sides say they are committed negotiating.

""Talks seem already very close to falling apart,"" said Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the Overseas Development Institute. ""The trouble is that (Washington) seems to grossly underestimate just how bad things could get and how quickly that could happen.""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Prosecutors asked an Australian court to set hefty penalties for media firms that pleaded guilty to breaching a 2018 suppression order on reporting of the conviction of former Vatican treasurer George Pell for child sexual assault.
Pell's conviction for abusing two choirboys was overturned last April after he was jailed for more than a year, but the media contempt of court case wrapped up only on Wednesday, more than two years after he was tried.
In 2018, County Court of Victoria Chief Judge Peter Kidd imposed an Australia-wide ban on all reporting of Pell's trial to protect against prejudicing jurors in a second case the cardinal was due to face the following year.
However, foreign media reported his conviction while the ban was in place, and Australian media subsequently ran stories saying a prominent unnamed person had been convicted of a major crime which they were unable to report on. Some referred to foreign reporting of the case.
After fighting what were originally 211 charges against 36 companies, reporters, editors, and broadcast presenters, 12 media companies last week agreed to plead guilty to 21 breaches of the suppression order. All other charges were dismissed.
The penalty for breach of a suppression order is up to nearly A$500,000 ($388,000) for companies.
At the penalty hearing at the Supreme Court of Victoria, the state prosecutor sought hefty penalties alleging that most of the outlets had acted in bad faith, having taken a ""calculated risk"" to run stories which breached an order that clearly stated nothing related to the trial should be reported.
The prosecutor also alleged the companies ran the stories to pressure Judge Kidd into amending his suppression order - which the media denied.
Lawyers for the companies, mostly owned by News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and Nine Entertainment Co, said those arguments were unfairly brought at the plea hearing.
""We're blind-sided by it. It's not the way in which the case has been put and it is an allegation of malice akin to an allegation of fraud,"" said Matthew Collins, representing Nine Entertainment and online news service mamamia.
News Corp and Nine's lawyers said penalties should be light as the media had shown remorse and contrition through their guilty plea and their apology to the courts, they had not intended to breach the suppression order and had agreed to pay A$650,000 to cover the prosecutor's costs.

The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said destroyer USS Russell ""asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the Spratly Islands, consistent with international law."" 
China claims sovereignty over the entire archipeligo, but Brunei, Malaysia, The Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have lodged competing claims for some or all of the islands. 
China's extensive territorial claims in the resource-rich waters have become a hot button issue in an increasingly testy Sino-U.S. relationship. The two countries are at odds over trade, the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hong Kong, Taiwan and accusations of human rights abuses against Uighur Muslims.
Washington has denounced what it called Beijing's attempts to bully neighbours with competing interests. China has repeatedly denounced what it called U.S. efforts to foment unrest in the region and interfere in what it regards as its internal affairs. 
The U.S. ship's pass by the Spratly Islands follows a joint exercise by two U.S. carrier groups in South China Sea and another warship sailing near Chinese-controlled Paracel islands earlier this month. Those actions had suggested that the Biden administration was not about to scale back operations challenging Beijing's claims after the ramp-up seen during the Trump administration.

Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said officials were on the verge of announcing the deal in December when BioNTech pulled the plug. 
While he did not directly say China was to blame, Chen implied there was a political dimension to the decision and that he had been worried about ""outside forces intervening"", hence his caution in discussing the planned deal publicly.
""Certain people don't want Taiwan to be too happy,"" he added, without elaborating, in a radio interview.
China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly sparred with the island over the coronavirus pandemic. 
Taiwan has been angered by China's assertion only it can speak for the island on the international stage about the subject, while Taiwan has accused China of lack of transparency.
BioNTech signed a deal with Chinese firm Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd to exclusively develop and commercialize COVID-19 vaccine products developed by using BioNTech's mRNA technology in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. 
In return it agreed to pay up to $85 million in licensing fees and invest $50 million for a stake in the German firm.
BioNTech's development and distribution partner for the rest of the world is U.S. firm  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) 
Chen said BioNTech had not asked them to speak to Fosun, and the deal with BioNTech had not been ""torn up"", only that it was ""pending"".
BioNTech and Fosun did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China's Taiwan Affairs Office declined immediate comment. China is currently observing the week-long Lunar New Year holiday.

Taiwan announced late in December said it had agreed to buy almost 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, including 10 million from UK drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), with the rest coming from the COVAX global vaccine programme and an unnamed company.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New York judge on Tuesday dismissed a misdemeanor charge against a white New York City woman who became an internet video sensation last spring when she falsely claimed a Black man threatened her in Manhattan's Central Park, prosecutors said.
Amy Cooper was arraigned in New York in October on a charge of falsely reporting an incident in the third degree, a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail. Prosecutors said she also falsely accused the man of trying to assault her.
At a hearing on Tuesday, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon asked the judge to drop the charge after reporting that Cooper had completed five therapy sessions that focused on not using racial identities ""to harm ourselves or others,"" according to a statement released by her office.
Illuzzi-Orbon also said Cooper had no prior arrests and that the man she falsely accused declined to cooperate with prosecutors.
Cooper's attorney, Robert Barnes, said on Twitter that the case was dismissed after ""a thorough & honest inquiry."" 
The now famous incident erupted when Cooper took her dog to New York's Central Park on May 25, and a birdwatcher, Christian Cooper (no relation) asked her to follow park rules and put the dog on a leash.
""I'm going to call the cops,"" Amy Cooper tells Christian Cooper on a video. ""I'm going to tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life."" https://twitter.com/melodymcooper/status/1264965252866641920
After Tuesday's hearing, Christian Cooper told CNN that the significance of the incident pales in comparison to Washington, D.C., with its majority non-white population, not having the full representation of statehood.
""That gross racial injustice could be fixed by Congress now, today, and that's what people should be focused on -- not last year's events in Central Park,"" he said.

Video of the incident, which was viewed more than 30 million times by the next day, drew outrage, coming on the heels of several other widely seen incidents of white people calling police on Black people without cause.

The fire occurred during an equipment maintenance at the Caojiawa gold mine in the city of Zhaoyuan, the Xinhua news agency reported.
An explosion in January at a separate gold mine in the same province killed at least 10 miners and the provincial government later followed up by launching safety inspections focusing on the non-coal mining and metal processing sectors.

TOKYO (Reuters) - After a sexism row sparked by Tokyo Olympics chief's saying women talked too much at meetings, Japan's ruling party wants women at key meetings - but only if they don't talk.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed a new plan that allows five female lawmakers to join the party's key meetings as observers.
Toshihiro Nikai, the party's 82-year-old secretary general, said on Tuesday that he heard criticism that the party's board is male-dominated, but added that the board members are elected.
But it is important for the party's female members to ""look"" at the party's decision-making process, he said.
""It is important to fully understand what kind of discussions are happening. Take a look, is what it is about,"" Nikai said at a news conference late on Tuesday. 
Those female observers can't speak during the meetings, but can submit opinions separately to the secretariat office, the daily newspaper Nikkei reported.
Yoshiro Mori, the head of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic organising committee, resigned last week after derogatory comments about women speaking too much at meetings and making them too long triggered backlash at home and abroad.
The 83-year-old former prime minister's remarks are one of the examples that show how deep rooted sexism is in Japanese society.
Japan is ranked 121st out of 153 countries on the World Economic Forum's 2020 Global Gender Gap Index - the worst ranking gap among advanced countries - scoring poorly on women’s economic participation and political empowerment.
This week, a group of female lawmakers at the Liberal Democratic Party asked Nikai to increase the ratio of women in key posts at the party.
But requiring female observers at meetings to remain quiet has drawn criticism that the party is out of touch. 
Opposition lawmakers mocked it as a ""field trip"", while Twitter users say the party's male-centric view has not changed since the Mori controversy.
""People will just put women on them as a kind of PR exercise,"" Belinda Wheaton, a cultural sociologist at the University of Waikato in New Zealand, told Reuters. 
""I think it's probably time to be asking questions as to why it is that we feel that men in their 70s or 80s are able to fulfil these roles better versus a man in their 40s or 50s, or a woman,"" Wheaton said.

Also making the rounds on social media were comments by Kengo Sakurada, head of a powerful Japanese business lobby, who said Japan's glass ceiling was ""partly women's fault"".

MILWAUKEE, Wis. (Reuters) - China will pay a price for its human rights abuses, U.S. President Joe Biden warned on Tuesday, responding to queries at a televised event on the Asian nation's handling of Muslim minorities in its far western region of Xinjiang.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has drawn global criticism for holding the minority Uighurs in internment camps and other human rights abuses.
""Well, there will be repercussions for China and he knows that,"" Biden said of Xi, when pressed on the issue at the town hall event televised on broadcaster CNN.
The United States will reassert its global role in speaking up for human rights, Biden said, adding that he would work with the international community to get China to protect them. 
""China is trying very hard to become a world leader and to get that moniker and be able to do that they have to gain the confidence of other countries,"" Biden said on his first official trip since taking office as president in January.
""As long as they are engaged in activity that is contrary to basic human rights, it is going to be hard for them to do that,"" he added.
In a two hour phone call with Xi this month, Biden emphasized the U.S. priority of preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific region, where the United States and China are major strategic rivals.

He also voiced concern about Beijing’s ""coercive and unfair"" trade practices and rights issues, such as its Hong Kong crackdown, the Xinjiang internments, and increasingly assertive actions in Asia, including toward Taiwan, which China claims as its own.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's wife, Ri Sol Ju, appeared in state media for the first time in more than a year on Wednesday, joining her husband at a concert on one of the country's biggest holidays. 
The official ruling Worker's Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun released photos of the pair at the event to mark the birthday of Kim's late father and former leader Kim Jong Il. 
Ri had often accompanied Kim to major public events, but had not been seen since January last year at an event for the Lunar New Year holiday, stoking speculation over her health and potential pregnancy. 
South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS) told lawmakers on Tuesday that Ri appeared to have refrained from outside activities to head off coronavirus infections but was ""playing well with their kids.""
The NIS believes Ri and Kim have three children. Little is publicly known about the trio.
North Korea has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, but the NIS has said an outbreak could not be ruled out as the country had active exchanges with China, where the virus first emerged, before closing the border early last year.
Ri and Kim smiled as they watched the concert at Mansudae Art Theatre in the capital of Pyongyang. Unlike several previous events, nobody in the photographs published by Rodong Sinmun were wearing masks or maintaining social distancing measures. 

The newspaper also reported that Kim visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, which houses the embalmed bodies of his father and grandfather, to lay wreaths for the anniversary, called the Day of the Shining Star.

(Reuters) - With the Beijing Winter Games less than a year away, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) are looking closely at human rights abuses in China, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday as calls to move the 2022 Games continue to grow.
""In regards to the Olympics, we continue to be very, very vocal in standing up for human rights around the world and calling out human rights abuses, as I have personally in the past directly with Chinese leadership, among many others,"" Trudeau told reporters during his daily press briefing.
""We know that the International Olympic Committee, the Canadian Olympic Committee, the Canadian Paralympic Committee and others are looking very closely at this issue and we will certainly continue to follow carefully.""
While Trudeau offered a measured response to what is becoming an increasingly tricky position, Conservative leader Erin O'Toole and Green Party leader Annamie Paul were more direct.
O'Toole told reporters on Tuesday it was not appropriate for China to host the world's biggest sporting event in light of its human rights abuses, calling the country's treatment of the Uighur minority in its Xinjiang region a genocide.
China has been widely condemned for its complexes in Xinjiang, which it describes as ""vocational training centers"" to stamp out extremism. It denies accusations of abuse.
Paul, meanwhile, urged the Canadian government to support the relocation of the 2022 Winter Olympics set for Feb. 4-20 and for the country to step in as a replacement venue.
""What more evidence does your government need to see before it concludes whether or not a genocide is occurring in China,"" said O'Toole calling out the Trudeau Liberals during his morning briefing. ""And given we're even discussing the possibility of a genocide, is Beijing an appropriate venue for the Olympics?""
China's human rights record has for years been a source of dispute with Western governments. China routinely dismisses Western complaints about its rights record.
NO BOYCOTT
With the possibility of a federal election in Canada later this year, O'Toole could be in a far stronger position to decide on the country's participation in the 2022 Winter Games if elected Prime Minister.
None of the three party leaders, however, mentioned a boycott.
The COC earlier in February came out strongly against boycott rumblings, saying such a move would only punish athletes and do nothing to force a change in China's human rights record or bring home two Canadian men detained in the country for more than two years.
China’s detention of businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig has become a sore point with Canadians, a July poll finding more than half of those questioned believed Ottawa should take more aggressive action to secure the release of the two men who face spying charges.
Canada views their detention as retribution for the arrest of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.
""It is in fact the federal government that ultimately decides whether our nation's athletes will take part in an Olympics,” Paul said in a statement.
""While the Green Party also believes strongly in the power of sport, China has proven itself to be highly resistant to liberalising human rights. 
""The Green Party believes Canada should consider whether it would be feasible to offer itself as an alternative venue for the 2022 Olympics.""

Canada has twice hosted the Winter Olympics, 1988 in Calgary and 2010 in Vancouver.

Houseboats in high demand as Germans book holidays close to home","BERLIN (Reuters) - As arctic temperature froze rivers and lakes in northern Germany, workers at houseboat charter companies were already gearing up for what they expect to be a busy summer season.
Cross-border travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic last summer prompted a run on domestic tourism, including on floating accommodation. Many expect that 2021 will be no different.
""I think that big trips abroad and flying will still not be the dominant type of vacation for people this summer,"" Dagmar Kuhnle, spokeswoman at the Kuhnle Tour houseboat charter company in the northeastern Mecklenburg lake district, told Reuters.
Family-run Kuhnle expanded its fleet to 160 boats from 120 just before the pandemic reached Germany last spring and promptly lost two months of business due to a coronavirus lockdown in April and May.
Once travel became possible again, nearly all of its boats were booked out, and bookings are looking good for the coming season as well, Kuhnle said.
The big question for charter companies like Kuhnle remains when the season will start. 
Aquare Charter, which offers bungalow boats in the eastern state of Brandenburg, said it was fully booked for this summer and would start renting out boats from March 18 if restrictions on overnight stays for tourists are lifted.
""It is of course not clear if it will work out or not,"" Philipp Sommer, a manager at Aquare Charter, said.
The government last week dampened hopes that economy could reopen soon, targeting an infection rate of no more than 35 new cases per 100,000 people over seven days, down from 50 previously. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi)
On Monday, that number was 59, having fallen from a high near 200 in late December. It was last below 50 in October.
Given the government's caution, Kuhnle Tour is cutting the hours of 10 employees starting next week.

""We don't see the end of pandemic in sight. We have somewhat corrected our optimism,"" Kuhnle added.

""The path to diplomacy is open right now. Iran is still a ways away from being in compliance (with the deal). So we'll have to see what it does,"" Blinken told National Public Radio according to a transcript provided by the broadcaster.
Asked if there was any move under way to resume direct diplomacy, Blinken pointed to U.S. President Joe Biden's public stance that if Iran resumes compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal the United States would do so too.
""The president's been very clear publicly, repeatedly, about where we stand. And we'll see what, if any, reaction Iran has to that,"" he said.
The interviewer noted Blinken had not directly answered the question and asked: ""but you're not ruling out that direct diplomacy might be somewhere in the future here?""
Blinken responded: ""Well, at some point, presumably, if there's going to be any engagement on this, that would have to require diplomacy. That's what we're in the business of.""
In 2018, former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the nuclear deal, which limited Iran's uranium enrichment activity to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear arms - an ambition Iran has long denied having - in return for the easing of U.S. and other sanctions.
When Trump left the deal, which Iran struck with six major powers, he reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran's economy.
In response, Tehran has breached the deal's key limits, enriching uranium to 20% - above a 3.67% cap but below the 90% needed for weapons - expanding its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, and using advanced centrifuges for enrichment. 

Iran has told the U.N. nuclear watchdog it will scale back cooperation with it in a week, ratcheting up protests against U.S. sanctions still choking its economy.

268,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 03:40PM ET</span>",Iran tells IAEA it plans to scale back cooperation in a week,"By Francois Murphy
VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has told the U.N. nuclear watchdog it will dramatically scale back cooperation with it in a week, a report by the agency to its member states showed on Tuesday, ratcheting up protests against U.S. sanctions still choking its economy.
Iran has accelerated its breaches of its 2015 nuclear deal with major powers in recent months, partly as demanded by a law passed in response to the killing in November of its top nuclear scientist, which Tehran has blamed on its foe Israel.
The breaches began in 2019 in response to a U.S. withdrawal from the deal under then-President Donald Trump, and Iran is now locked in a standoff with President Joe Biden's administration over who should move first to save the accord.
""Iran informed the IAEA on 15 February that the country will stop implementing voluntary transparency measures under the JCPOA as of 23 February, including the Additional Protocol,"" an International Atomic Energy Agency statement said. JCPOA stands for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal's official name.
Under the deal, Iran is applying the Additional Protocol, which grants the IAEA the power to carry out short-notice inspections at locations not declared to it. It is in addition to core obligations under a country's so-called Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA. Iran has signed but not ratified it.
The IAEA gave more details on what Iran had told it, however, in a report to its member states on Tuesday seen by Reuters. It listed seven other ""transparency measures"" that Iran said it plans to stop implementing, some of them worded very similarly to section headings in the text of the deal.
""Use of modern technologies and long term presence of IAEA"" was one item, which is a close match for a section of the deal that increased the number of designated IAEA inspectors for Iran and required Tehran to allow the use of technologies like online measurement of uranium enrichment and electronic seals, which enable remote, real-time monitoring of activity by the agency. 
""Transparency measures related to enrichment"" was another, resembling a section of the deal that says Tehran will grant the agency ""regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at Natanz"", Iran's main uranium enrichment site.
""Given the serious impact of the above-mentioned measures being implemented"", IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi reminded Iran of an offer to visit to ""find a mutually agreeable solution for the agency to continue essential verification activities"", the report added, referring to a letter sent by Grossi to Tehran on Tuesday. 

Germany has warned Iran against obstructing IAEA inspections, saying it would be ""completely unacceptable"" and urging it to desist to give diplomacy a chance, a diplomatic source in Berlin told Reuters on Tuesday.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa plans to share 1 million AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine doses with other African countries, a senior official said, as a medical association said the first shots from rival Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) could arrive on Tuesday.
The country paused the rollout of AstraZeneca doses this month, after preliminary trial data showed they offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the country's dominant coronavirus variant. 
It has been consulting with scientists about what to do with the AstraZeneca vaccine, switching to a plan to start inoculating healthcare workers with J&J's alternative in a research study. The South African Medical Association (SAMA) said if the first shots arrived on Tuesday as expected, then vaccinations could start on Wednesday. 
Eighty thousand J&J shots are expected initially, and up to 500,000 health workers could be immunised in total in the study. 
SAMA chairwoman Angelique Coetzee said vaccinations would happen at hospitals in each of the country's nine provinces. Roughly two-thirds of the doses would go to public-sector health workers, and one-third to those in the private sector.
Anban Pillay, deputy director-general at the Department of Health, said South Africa planned to share the 1 million AstraZeneca doses it received at the start of the month from the Serum Institute of India via the African Union (AU).
""The doses are going to be shared with countries on the continent ... via the AU,"" Pillay told Reuters, adding that the government would look to recover money spent on the AstraZeneca vaccine but was still finalising how to do that.
He said it was not true that South Africa had asked the Serum Institute to take back the doses, as reported by Indian newspaper The Economic Times. 
Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said some African countries had already expressed an interest in acquiring South Africa's AstraZeneca doses. He said vaccinations were due to begin this week and that President Cyril Ramaphosa would announce the date and time of the first shot.
""I can also say that we have actually secured enough doses to vaccinate all the people who will need to be vaccinated in South Africa,"" Mkhize told lawmakers, without saying how he arrived at that calculation.
The government had initially planned to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of the population, to achieve some level of herd immunity, but it is not clear whether that target still stands.
CONTAGIOUS VARIANT
The AU's disease control body said last week it was not ""walking away"" from AstraZeneca's vaccine but would target its use in countries that have not reported cases of the more contagious 501Y.V2 variant first identified in South Africa late last year. 
The AU said six countries other than South Africa had confirmed the variant was circulating, but there are concerns it has spread elsewhere. 
AstraZeneca says it believes its two-dose vaccine protects against severe COVID-19 and that it has started adapting it to be more effective against the 501Y.V2 variant.
J&J's vaccine is administered in a single shot, an advantage given how complex a logistical exercise the mass vaccination campaign will be.
The health ministry said on Tuesday that the manufacturers of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine had submitted documentation to local medicines regulator SAHPRA for registration.

It added that scientists were conducting analyses on Sputnik V, following concerns about the effects of its Ad5 component on communities with a high prevalence of HIV.
South Africa has one of the highest HIV burdens globally.
SAHPRA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - A rocket attack on U.S.-led forces in northern Iraq killed a civilian contractor on Monday and injured a U.S. service member, the U.S. coalition in Iraq said, in the deadliest such attack in almost a year.
The rockets landed in and around a military air base operated by the coalition at Erbil International Airport.
The attack, claimed by a little-known group that some Iraqi officials say has links with Iran, raises tensions as Washington explores some degree of detente with Tehran. 
The coalition spokesman tweeted on Tuesday that the dead contractor was not American, but did not elaborate. He said three 107 mm rockets had landed inside the base.
Of the nine other people hurt, eight were civilian contractors and one a U.S. service member, a coalition spokesman said. A U.S. official who declined to be named said the U.S. serviceman had concussion.
In Washington, the White House said the United States was still working to determine who was responsible for the attack.
When pressed on possible retaliation against those found responsible, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the president ""reserves the right to respond in the time and the manner of our choosing.""
""But we'll wait for the attribution to be concluded first before we take any additional steps... I will convey to you that diplomacy is a priority with this administration,"" Psaki added. 
The attack comes just three weeks before a March 5-8 visit to Iraq by Pope Francis, which is due to include Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States was ""outraged"" by the attack.
In a statement, Blinken said he had contacted Kurdistan Regional Government Prime Minister Masrour Barzani to ""pledge our support for all efforts to investigate and hold accountable those responsible"". Blinken spoke to Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi on Tuesday.
In a call with his Iraqi counterpart, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin condemned the attack, the Pentagon said. 
""The Iraqi people deserve a secure and stable Iraq, and the United States remains committed to supporting our Iraqi partners in their efforts to defend Iraq’s sovereignty,"" a Pentagon readout of the call said. 
Powerful paramilitary groups aligned with Iran in Iraq and Yemen have launched attacks against the United States and its Arab allies in recent weeks, including a drone attack on a Saudi airport and a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
Iraq's government under al-Kadhimi has sided with the United States but has found it hard to bring the groups under control.
Most of the incidents have caused no casualties, but they have kept up pressure on U.S. troops and U.S. allies in the early days of Joe Biden's presidency. 
Biden's administration is weighing a return to the 2015 big power nuclear deal that aimed to curb Iran's nuclear programme, which his predecessor Donald Trump abandoned in 2018.
Iran says it will only resume compliance with the deal if Washington lifts crippling sanctions.
U.S.-Iran tension has often played out on Iraqi soil.
A U.S. drone strike that killed Iran's military mastermind Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in January 2020 sent the region to the brink of a full-scale confrontation.
A rocket attack on a base in northern Iraq last March killed three military personnel - one Briton and two Americans.

A group calling itself Saraya Awliya al-Dam claimed responsibility for the Erbil attack, saying it was aimed at the ""American occupation"" in Iraq, but provided no evidence.

271,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 03:00PM ET</span>",U.S. urges Yemen's Houthis to stop military operations,"By Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States urged Yemen's Houthi movement on Tuesday to halt an offensive on the government-held city of Marib and join international efforts to find a political solution to the more than six-year civil war.
The advance by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement on the last government-held city in Yemen's north threatens to complicate a new drive by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to intensify diplomacy to end the conflict and increase aid deliveries as the country's humanitarian crisis deepens.
State Department spokesman Ned Price called on the Houthis to halt the Marib attack, cease all military operations, end cross-border strikes on Saudi Arabia and participate in a U.N.-led peace process.
The conflict pits the Houthi movement against Yemen's internationally recognized government and a Saudi-led coalition.
""The Houthis’ assault on Marib is the action of a group not committed to peace or to ending the war afflicting the people of Yemen,"" Price said in a statement.
The assault will only worsen the world's most serious humanitarian catastrophe, he said, noting that a U.N. agency estimates that Marib hosts about 1 million people displaced from other areas by fighting.
""Marib is controlled by the legitimate government of Yemen. This assault will only increase the number of internally displaced persons and exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.""
Price urged the Houthis to ""constructively participate"" in U.N.-led peace efforts and ""engage seriously"" with the recently appointed U.S. special envoy for Yemen, Timothy Lenderking.
Lenderking, addressing his first State Department briefing since his appointment earlier this month, said the United States is working with regional officials to ""create the right conditions for a ceasefire and to push the parties to a negotiated settlement"".
U.S. officials have been ""very aggressively"" using back channels to pass messages to the Houthis, said Lenderking, who held talks in the region last week with top officials.
Iran, he said, has played ""a very negative role"" in the conflict by training, supplying and equipping the Houthis ""to conduct attacks on civilian targets in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Gulf.""
Tehran, however, now has ""an opportunity"" to support the renewed diplomatic drive for peace, he said. 
Biden appointed the veteran U.S. diplomat as part of a new U.S. approach to ending the war that also involves halting support for offensive operations by the Saudi-led coalition.
The Biden administration on Tuesday also revoked the foreign terrorist organization and specially designated global terrorist designations of the Houthis, imposed by former President Donald Trump's administration on its last full day in office.
Despite the U.S. moves, the Houthis have pressed the assault on Marib and continued cross-border strikes on Saudi Arabia.

Lenderking said that while Washington and Riyadh are working out how U.S. arms sales to the kingdom would be impacted by the new U.S. policy, ""we're not going to allow Saudi Arabia to be target practice. So Saudi Arabia needs to have the ability to defend itself.""

""Any incident that happens in your area then you are accused until the opposite is proven? Is this something that is practiced in the whole wide world? Where else is this logic present?"" Nasrallah said in a televised speech. 
Activist Lokman Slim was shot and found dead in his car in south Lebanon earlier in February, marking the first killing of a high-profile activist in years.
He was a critic of the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. His sister has suggested he was murdered because of those views.
Hezbollah has previously condemned the killing. 
A filmmaker and publisher, Slim had spoken out against what he called Hezbollah's intimidation tactics and attempts to monopolise Lebanese politics.
Nasrallah was also critical on Tuesday about blame pointed at the group for involvement in the Aug. 4 Beirut blast that killed 200 people. 
""Hezbollah is guilty until proven otherwise - what kind of a rule is that? ...Beirut port - you, Hezbollah, blew up Beirut port until the truth about the explosion is revealed,"" he said. 
The judicial investigation into the blast is still under way in Lebanon with judge Fadi Sawan having charged caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab, whose cabinet quit after the blast, and three former ministers with negligence. 
Sawan is due to interrogate one of the three former ministers, Youssef Finianos, a Hezbollah ally sanctioned by the United States for his links to the group that Washington considers a terrorist organisation. 
""Our information says that the technical investigation ended and the army sent it to the judge...we asked that day the army and internal security to reveal the results of that investigation ....we are repeating our call for this and we insist on it."" 
The explosion, one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts in history, added further strains to a country struggling with its worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.

It was caused by a massive quantity of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely for years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden plans to shift U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia and will conduct diplomacy through Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz rather than his powerful son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the White House said on Tuesday.
The announcement by White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki was an abrupt reversal in U.S. policy from Biden's Republican predecessor, President Donald Trump, whose son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner maintained steady contact with the crown prince.
""We've made clear from the beginning that we are going to recalibrate our relationship with Saudi Arabia,"" Psaki told reporters.
While her comments about the crown prince were likely to be seen as a snub, Psaki moved to clear the air on another controversy in the region, saying Biden would soon have his first phone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The crown prince, widely referred to as MbS, is considered by many to be the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia and next in line to the throne held by the 85-year-old King Salman. His prestige suffered a blow after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the hands of Saudi security personnel seen as close to the crown prince.
The Biden White House has been pressuring Saudi Arabia to improve its record on human rights, including the release of political prisoners such as women’s rights advocates from jails.
The Trump White House had found MbS the leader to deal with in Saudi Arabia and worked with him on a variety of areas, such as resolving a rift between Qatar and other Gulf nations.
As for questions about whether Biden would speak to the crown prince, Psaki said Biden is returning to ""counterpart to counterpart"" engagement.
""The president's counterpart is King Salman and I expect at an appropriate time he will have a conversation with him. I don’t have a prediction on the timeline for that,"" she said.
Psaki said Saudi Arabia has critical self-defense needs and the United States will work with the Saudis on this ""even as we make clear areas where we have disagreements and where we have concerns. And that certainly is a shift from the prior administration.""
Trump was a close ally of Netanyahu and moved U.S. relations to a strong pro-Israel position with little to no contact with the Palestinians.
Psaki said Biden's first call with a leader in the region will be with Netanyahu and it will be soon. Critics had accused Biden, a Democrat, of snubbing Netanyahu by not having spoken to the leader of the top U.S. ally in the Middle East.

""Israel is of course an ally. Israel is a country where we have an important strategic security relationship, and our team is fully engaged, not at the head of state level quite yet but very soon,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Mohamed Noor faces 10 days in COVID-19 quarantine in a hotel room near London's Heathrow Airport after falling foul of new border controls because of a flight delay. 
""I don't have a book. I don't have a Koran. I don't have nothing here,"" Noor, a 55-year-old Muslim, said by phone after his arrival on Monday, a day later than planned, landed him with a 1,750-pound ($2,400) bill. 
In another hotel nearby, 61-year-old Sole, who declined to give her surname, said she realised too late that the new rules would kick in before she returned from visiting friends in Chile.
""We are like captives in these rooms,"" she said. 
Britain says the measures, effective since Monday, are needed to protect its COVID-19 vaccination programme and guard against new coronavirus variants.
People returning from any of 33 ""high-risk"" countries where travel to Britain is banned must pay 1,750 pounds for a 10-day quarantine hotel package.
After being taken by bus to government-contracted hotels, they must spend most of the time in their rooms and have meals delivered to their door. 
Noor, a postal driver, was visiting Somalia after his brother died and feels he is being punished for going to look after his mother. He spent four hours at the airport arguing his case and says he will refuse to pay.
""My family was waiting outside the airport and you can't see them. My 11-year old son was waiting,"" he said. 
Sole plans to spend the time talking to friends, watching television and doing online classes and yoga. 
She also feels she is being punished after taking a holiday following a stressful year working in a hospital where she has treated COVID-19 patients. 
""Why has this happened? The new variant is in South Africa and it's going to spread anyway,"" she said.

Mexico had not finished producing doses of the vaccine from the shipments of active ingredient that already arrived to the country because its health regulator had to first inspect a local lab and certify that the batches were pure and without defects, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said.
He said COFEPRIS, the regulator, had made 185 ""observations"" during a visit to local manufacturer Laboratorios Liomont, which previously made flu jabs and is expected to start shipping the doses by early April. 
""They almost had to make another factory,"" Ebrard, speaking at a regular government news conference, said about Liomont. ""You are talking about health, life ... so you do have to be very strict in any medicine, with a vaccine more, and even more when the vaccine is so recent.""
In partnership with the Mexican and Argentinean governments, AstraZeneca plans to produce millions of doses of the vaccine, developed with Oxford University, for distribution throughout the region. The plan has significant funding from the foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. 
Liomont and a spokesperson for Mexico's health ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Mexico has received at least two shipments of the vaccine's active ingredient, which were to be packaged locally for about seven million doses that are not yet ready, according to government data. 
Looking to speed up its vaccine campaign, which is now focused on older adults, Mexico also imported on Sunday the first 870,000 doses of a planned two million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine from India. 
Shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine also restarted after global delays, with a flight landing on Tuesday in Monterrey and another due later in capital Mexico City. The government said Tuesday's shipments would provide about 494,000 doses. 

Argentina's President Alberto Fernandez would visit Liomont's plant during an upcoming trip to Mexico, Ebrard said.

""We support the vaccination certificate but not as the only way to recuperate mobility, rather, as one of the means within a portfolio of measures including social distancing, pre-travel tests, mask-wearing,"" the source said.
The government has no plans to introduce quarantines on foreign visitors, and was also counting on a wider agreement to be hammered out between Europe and Britain to remove restrictions on non-essential travel, the official added. 
Over 2020, as global travel was dramatically curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic, foreign tourism to Spain - one of the world's most visited countries - fell 80% to just 19 million visitors, a level not seen since 1969.

The industry's contribution to gross domestic product tumbled to between 4% and 5%, according to estimates from Funcas think-tank analyst Maria Jesus Fernandez, from a 12% share in 2019.

""I am available to work with all those who want it under the banner of 'Patriot and European', so as not to leave this theme to others,"" Barnier told centre-right lawmakers in a closed-door meeting, according to a participant. 
The faction was presented as a ""working group"" within the centre-right Les Republicains party, the participant said. 
Barnier's office did not return a request for comment.
More than a year before the first round of the 2022 presidential election, none of the former mainstream centre-left and centre-right parties, who were shut out by centrist Emmanuel Macron's victory in 2017, have chosen a candidate.
Each camp is abuzz with rumours, and sources on the right cite Barnier, but also ex-ministers Xavier Bertrand and Valerie Pecresse, as well as senator Bruno Retailleau as possible candidates for the main centre-right party, Les Republicains.
A possible bid by Barnier, a 70-year old former French foreign minister, is being closely watched by Macron's camp, as he would eat at the pro-European, centre-right electorate the president is targeting. 
""There's a Biden moment. Grey hair could become fashionable,"" a minister told Reuters on condition of anonymity, when asked about Barnier.
Barnier said on French radio in December he saw himself serving his home country in some capacity following his work on negotiating Britain's exit from the EU, without elaborating.
A diplomat in Brussels told Reuters he was ""actively evaluating his chances"" for the presidential election, which current polls show Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen as likely to reach the second round. 
On the left, sources in Macron's government say Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo is also mulling a presidential bid. The Spanish-born 61-year old Socialist is no longer ruling out running for president in interviews.
""Hidalgo is going to go for it. Her team is ready for battle,"" one official told Reuters.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A district of Venezuela's capital Caracas on Tuesday installed a new well to supply water to dozens of apartment buildings, as widespread shortages in the crisis-stricken country complicate hand-washing amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Water shortages have long affected the municipality of Chacao in eastern Caracas - as well as other areas across the South American country - due to years of underinvestment, lack of maintenance and a shortage of qualified personnel amid an economic collapse that has deprived governments of funds.
That has made it difficult for Venezuelans to comply with their own government's public health guidance to regularly wash hands to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Venezuelans with means have for years responded to water shortages by privately financing underground wells to serve their apartment buildings or houses. The Chacao well, built at a cost to the municipality of some $30,000 will serve around 15,000 people in 42 buildings.
""In a normal country this would not be necessary, but here we are doing it because Chacao does not give up,"" Gustavo Duque, Chacao's mayor, told a crowd of around 100 residents who had come to witness the inauguration of the well. 
Chacao has built a total of nine wells in the past three years. The wells draw water from underground sources that would normally flow into the Guaire river, which cuts through Caracas. 
Maria Cortez, a 69-year-old Chacao resident who had come to witness the inauguration, said her building had only supplied residents with water once a week once shortages began to worsen in 2014. Her building was among the first to benefit when Chacao began building municipal wells in 2018. 

""Now, we always have [water],"" Cortez said.

The legislation did not single out any particular religion, but it cracked down on practices such as forced marriage and virginity tests.
It included tough measures against online apologists for acts of violence, stricter surveillance of religious associations, and tighter restrictions on educating children outside mainstream schools.
France's Muslim population is estimated to number about five million people, many whose family origins lie in Algeria or other parts of its former empire.
The country has suffered a wave of Islamist militant attacks in recent years, and tackling religious extremism, French identity and domestic security will be big issues in next year's presidential election. 
Presented to parliament on the 115th anniversary of the law that enshrined the separation of state and religion in France, the bill has been branded by some on the left as an attack on Islam and as too weak by the far-right and some conservatives.
The legislation represented a ""powerful offensive"" by the secular state, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. ""It's a tough text...but necessary for the Republic,"" Darmanin told RTL radio ahead of the vote.
The bill passed by 347 votes to 151 in parliament's lower house, where President Emmanuel Macron's centrist ruling party and its allies hold a majority. The legislation now moves to the Senate, where the centre-right opposition dominates.
The debate around the law became more charged after the Oct. 16 beheading of a schoolteacher, Samuel Paty, by a teenage Islamist who said he wanted to punish him for showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on free speech.
Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has accused Darmanin of not tackling radical Islam head on.
""You are restricting everyone's freedom to try to modify the freedoms of a few Islamists,"" she told Darmanin in a debate last week, referring to the curbs on home-schooling.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States said on Tuesday that creating a conducive environment for elections in Iraq later this year includes tackling Iran-backed militias, Iran's destabilizing activities in the country and remaining Islamic State elements.
Acting U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Richard Mills told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Iraq that one of the highest barriers to creating a conducive environment for credible, peaceful and inclusive elections ""is the presence of armed militias, violent extremists and spoilers.""
""A conducive environment means that we must address Iran-backed militias and Iran's destabilizing activities in Iraq, as well as the remaining ISIS (Islamic State) elements,"" Mills told the 15-member council. 
""These groups undermine the public's trust in the government, and in the October 2021 elections. They're killing Iraqi citizens and depriving Iraq of much-needed economic relief and foreign investment. No one is immune,"" he said. 
A rocket attack on U.S.-led forces in northern Iraq on Monday killed a civilian contractor and injured a U.S. service member. The attack was claimed by a group that some Iraqi officials say has links with Iran.
The United States has about 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. 
""Such reckless attempts to inflame tensions pose grave threats to Iraq's stability. Close collaboration between Baghdad and Erbil, to bring the culprits to justice, is now of the greatest importance,"" U.N. Iraq special envoy Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert told the Security Council on Tuesday. 
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration pledged to be a steady, reliable partner for Iraq, Mills said. 
""Among its top priorities, the United States will seek to help Iraq assert its sovereignty in the face of enemies at home and abroad, by preventing an ISIS resurgence and working toward Iraq's stability,"" he said. 

""For the United States this means supporting Iraq's efforts to hold credible inclusive and peaceful elections,"" Mills said.

Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum drew international attention in 2018 when a human rights group released a video made by her in which she described an attempt to escape Dubai.
Last March, a London High Court judge said he accepted as proved a series of allegations made by Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum's former wife, Princess Haya, in a legal battle, including that the sheikh ordered the abduction of Latifa. The sheikh's lawyers rejected the allegations.
""I am a hostage and this villa has been converted into a jail,"" Latifa, 35, said in the video published by the BBC as part of a Panorama programme airing on Tuesday.
""All the windows are barred shut, I can't open any window."" She said she was making the video in the bathroom of the villa, the only room she could lock herself into.
Reuters could not independently verify when or where the video was recorded.
The Free Latifa campaign, which has lobbied for her release, said it had managed to smuggle a phone to Latifa.
David Haigh, one of the campaign's co-founders and her lawyer, called for Latifa's immediate release and an end to ""a horrendous period of parental and human rights abuse that has significantly damaged the reputation of the UAE.""
The Dubai government's media office referred questions about the video to Sheikh Mohammed's law firm, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
David Pannick, a lawyer in London representing Sheikh Mohammed in the legal battle with Princess Haya, said: ""As one of the lawyers in current legal proceedings, I cannot comment.""
Appearing alert and speaking calmly, Latifa said in the video that there were police officers stationed outside and inside the villa. ""I just want to be free,"" she added.
In December 2018, the UAE foreign ministry said Latifa was at home and living with her family, after rights groups called on authorities in the Gulf Arab state to disclose her whereabouts and condition.

In a fierce parliamentary debate two days after Ankara broke news of the killings in a cave in Iraq's Gara region, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu rejected opposition criticism and said Turkey ""did everything we could to bring our martyrs back alive"".
The captives, including police and military personnel, were mostly seized by outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants in 2015 and 2016. Ankara said they were executed during an offensive against the PKK in the area that Erdogan later indicated also aimed to rescue them.
On Wednesday, the day the offensive was launched, Erdogan promised he would soon announce some unspecified ""good news"". 
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), demanded the government declare who should take responsibility ""for the failure of the operation launched to rescue our 13 citizens"", and he criticised Erdogan for undermining the secrecy of the offensive.
""The blood of our 13 brothers is on the ground. They could have been brought back to Turkey,"" he said. The military ""carried out an offensive with drums and trumpets. Tayyip Erdogan is responsible for our 13 martyrs,"" Kilicdaroglu added. 
Relying mostly on air and drone strikes, Turkey has in recent years carried out several operations in northern Iraq against the PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union.
Aytun Ciray, a lawmaker from the opposition Iyi Party, asked Akar on Tuesday why the rescue mission was treated like other offensives, saying air strikes would have alerted militants.
Briefing parliament on the operation, Akar said no ground support was available due to the mountainous terrain, insisting that secrecy was preserved in advance of the operation. 
He said the captives were killed at the time Ankara launched air strikes in the region, which he said the military had been scouting for months. Akar added that the 13 captives were found dead when forces entered the cave where they were being held.

The pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP), under fire from the government and its nationalist ally who accuse it of links to the PKK, accused the government of failing to act in time. The HDP denies having any militant ties.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will present reform plans on Wednesday to modernise the alliance after four years of friction with Washington and to face challenges including China's military rise and Russia as an adversary.
After confrontational rhetoric between Washington and its allies during the Donald Trump presidency, Stoltenberg will set out eight areas where NATO could modernise over the medium term, from climate change to more sustainable funding of military operations, two senior officials told Reuters.
The reform proposals, which NATO leaders are expected to consider at a summit in Brussels planned for later this year, aim to convince Trump's successor Joe Biden to strongly back NATO and to mollify allies frustrated with what they say is the alliance's failure to coordinate at the political level.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in late 2019 that NATO was ""experiencing brain death"" after alliance member Turkey launched an offensive on U.S.-backed rebels in Syria.
""We have a unique opportunity to re-energize and to strengthen the transatlantic bond,"" Stoltenberg told reporters on Monday, referring to the ""NATO 2030"" reform process. 
The proposals include updating NATO's official master strategy document, its ""Strategic Concept"", which could consider growing Chinese military capabilities and Russian strategic competition.
Stoltenberg will propose more political discussion at NATO to allow for frequent meetings of foreign, interior ministers and national security advisers, and ways to reduce both the security impact of climate change and military carbon emissions.
Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, will also suggest that allies fund collectively more of their deterrent operations on allied territory, rather than the current system that a single ally bears all the costs of a deployment.
That money, which could go into an enlarged common NATO military budget, would also be counted in the alliance's annual defence spending target of 2% of economic output, so as to avoid an additional burden on allies, the two NATO officials said. 
""The Secretary General is thinking about how can we make this more sustainable and ultimately fair, because these are activities that are essential to our security. We need to find a way to change the way we fund them,"" one NATO official said.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 to confront the threat of the communist Soviet Union but found renewed purpose after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.

NATO is now under pressure to help solve some of the world's most intractable crises and Washington has pushed it to consider its position on China, a growing military power.

GAZA (Reuters) - Gaza's top Islamic judge agreed on Tuesday to revise a recent court ruling that bars women from travel without permission from a male guardian such as a husband or father. 
The restriction, imposed on Sunday by the Higher Sharia Council in Islamist Hamas-run Gaza, had drawn criticism from rights groups which said it violated Palestinian laws against gender-based descrimination.
Protests also erupted outside the office of the council's Hamas-appointed chairman, Hassan Jojo, who had signed the edict into law.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Jojo said: ""We have agreed to redraft this ruling."" He did not say if the language banning female travel without a male guardian's approval would be removed.
Hamas leaders have repeatedly denied any intention to impose Islamic law on the Gaza Strip's 2 million residents. 
The Independent Commission for Human Rights (ICHR), a Palestinian rights group with offices in Gaza and the West Bank, said Sunday's ruling ""violates women's dignity and rights and places them at an inferior level"" in society.
ICHR also noted Palestinian laws bar discrimination ""on the basis of race, gender, colour, religion, political opinion or disability"".
Reham Owda, a Palestinian political analyst and womens' rights expert, said the ruling might have aimed at stemming a recent increase in Gaza women seeking work outside the small coastal territory, where employment is 49%. 
""The government in Gaza wanted to limit (travel) and restrict the movement of women who are ambitious from leaving in search of study or jobs, and escape the Israeli blockade,"" Owda said. 

Israeli and Egypt maintain restrictions on the Mediterranean enclave, citing security concerns arising from Hamas rule.

The gas-rich region of Marib has been a refuge for hundreds of thousands of people fleeing violence during Yemen's six-year-old war, expanding its main city rapidly. 
A frontline is now roughly 30 km (18 miles) away to the city's west, a government official told Reuters, and humanitarian concerns are growing.
""An assault on the city would put two million civilians at risk, with hundreds of thousands potentially forced to flee - with unimaginable humanitarian consequences,"" U.N aid chief Mark Lowcock said on Tuesday, urging de-escalation.
The recent push towards Marib by Houthi forces, who control Yemen's most populous areas, comes alongside intensified drone attacks into Saudi Arabia by the Iran-aligned group. Riyadh, which leads a coalition fighting the Houthis, said one attack started a fire in a civilian aircraft at an airport in southern Saudi Arabia on Wednesday.
These escalations have coincided with a fresh push by the U.N. and the United States to end the war, which the United Nations says has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis. This push includes Washington revoking a terrorist designation of the Houthis introduced by former President Donald Trump's administration in January. 
U.N. Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths has said the resumption of Houthi hostilities near Marib was extremely concerning at a time of renewed diplomatic momentum.
The United States State Department on Tuesday urged the Houthis to stop their advance on Marib and turn to negotiations. 
EXPLOSIONS 
Houthi offensives in recent days have hit camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs), causing people to flee, Yemen's information minister said.
Najeeb Al-Saadi, director of the government's IDP camp management unit, told Reuters Houthi forces on Monday hit four camps to Marib city's east. Two locations were totally evacuated, he said. 
Residents in Marib city, which lies to the east of the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa, told Reuters on Tuesday they have heard the sound of explosions this week, more strongly at night, and that planes belonging to the Saudi-led coalition are a constant sight overhead. 
Yemen is divided between the internationally recognised government based in the south - supported by the Saudi-led coalition - and the Houthi movement headquartered in the north. The Houthis ousted the government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014.
Yemen's frontlines have largely been in stalemate for years but a major Houthi gain in Marib would leave the group in control of what historically was known as North Yemen. Marib city is also the last line of defence before Yemen's biggest gas and oil fields, which are in government hands.
The U.N.'s International Organisation for Migration (IOM)says 106,449 people have been displaced by fighting which has been bubbling along the Marib frontlines for a year.

It warned an additional 385,000 people could be displaced with a major frontline shift. There are 125 displacement sites around Marib, IOM says.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Hanan Ashrawi, the most famous woman in Palestinian politics, will not be running in the first elections for 15 years, opting instead to mentor a new generation of political leaders.
Over three decades in public office, the veteran negotiator and women's rights advocate was one of the highest-profile Palestinian officials, especially to international audiences.
In December she resigned from her senior post in the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), citing a need for reform and criticising what she called a lack of opportunities for women and young people.
Now that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has announced parliamentary and presidential elections for later this year, 74-year-old Ashrawi says she will not change her mind.
""I want to set an example that people can leave office,"" she told Reuters.
""I have been supporting and mentoring many young men and women in different capacities... it's important that I do that in a variety of ways, and I am,"" she said between back-to-back meetings with diplomats at MIFTAH, her civil society organization to promote global dialogue and democracy.
Ashrawi, who was elected to the Palestinian parliament in 2006, declined to say who she was mentoring.
VETERAN NEGOTIATOR
Born in Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Ashrawi was an English professor when she became a familiar face on television during the first Palestinian uprising of the late 1980s, advocating her people's quest for statehood.
She was catapulted onto the international arena when Yasser Arafat chose her as the spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the first public face-to-face talks between Palestinians, Israelis and Arab nations brokered by the United States and Russia at the Madrid Conference in 1991.
Ashrawi said she did not find ""locking horns"" with Israelis especially difficult, but that it took a while to ""gain the respect, albeit the grudging respect, of the men with whom you work.""
She recalled her early days of activism, saying she was beaten by Israeli soldiers at protests where she feared for her life, years before coming face-to-face with Israeli officials at the negotiating table.
Ashrawi has been veiled in her criticism of the Palestinian leadership but indicated that even as a member of the PLO's Executive Committee, she felt marginalised.
When she quit, Palestinian political analyst Nour Odeh was among those who praised Ashrawi for her contribution, calling her an ""inspirational, powerful and grand woman"". Others have been more critical, suggesting Ashrawi could have done more at an earlier stage to help women rise through the political hierarchy. 
Ashrawi said her generation faced ""real difficulty"" opening up a male-dominated world. ""The battle is not to gain the individual respect, but to open up the vista for other women. That's where the real test is,"" she said.
""The worst thing for me is to be in a position where you feel you're not making a difference, where you are not in a position where you can really affect change,"" said Ashrawi.

""Whatever you do, you have to make a difference.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - For Bahraini activist Maryam al-Khawaja, who lives in self-imposed exile in Kansas City, the pandemic at least had a silver lining. Authorities at home allowed her to speak to her jailed father online because personal prison visits were banned.
""I had the chance to see his face for the first time since 2014,"" she told Reuters.
It was an unexpected moment of joy, yet also a reminder of the toll Bahrain's uprising 10 years ago has taken on her family.
Her father, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, is former president of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights who is now serving a life sentence for his role in Bahrain's pro-democracy movement.
As so-called ""Arab Spring"" protests swept Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and Syria a decade ago, Bahrain was the only Gulf country to see mass upheaval. 
Tens of thousands took to the streets to demand reforms. Violence spread as members of the Shi'ite Muslim majority rose up against the Sunni royal family. Martial law was declared, and, with the help of Saudi forces, Bahrain cracked down on dissent.
Abdulhadi al-Khawaja was among thousands of activists, opposition members and journalists that rights groups say were jailed in the Sunni-ruled island state, headquarters to the U.S. Navy's Fifth fleet.
In November 2011, a Bahrain state-appointed fact-finding commission found that security forces used excessive force to suppress pro-democracy rallies, including torture and coerced confessions.
It said 35 people, mostly protesters, died, 3,000 were detained, over 4,000 lost jobs, and hundreds were maltreated in detention.
The Bahraini government did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Khawaja said her father looked thinner than the last time she saw him in person, when she herself was detained in Bahrain and they were allowed a family visit. His face was also altered by a jaw shattered during his detention, she added.
When the 33-year-old saw news footage of George Floyd pleading ""I can't breathe"" as a U.S. police officer knelt on him last year, it brought a sense of déjà vu. She said her father uttered the same in 2011 as Bahraini police dragged him down the stairs.
'SO MUCH TO LOSE'
Ala'a al-Shehabi, now an academic at University College London, recounted the initial sense of hope during a peaceful march to the royal palace in al-Safriyah, outside the capital Manama, in 2011.
""We were standing at the gate of the palace, and that gate felt like the only thing that stood between us and a political transformation in Bahrain,"" Shehabi recalled.
""We thought we didn't have anything to lose. It turned out we had so much to lose.""
Long before the tumult of ten years ago, the opposition had complained of discrimination against Shi'ites in the workplace and public services, and demanded a constitutional monarchy with a government chosen by an elected parliament.
The government denies discrimination and accuses Shi'ite power Iran of stoking unrest, a charge Tehran denies. Since 2011, Bahrain has seen sporadic clashes between protesters and security forces, who have been targeted by bomb attacks.
In a bid to heal deep rifts, Bahrain's leadership in July 2011 launched a national dialogue, and in 2012 King Hamad al-Khalifa announced constitutional amendments, giving parliament more powers of scrutiny.
But reconciliation talks failed to defuse tensions. Authorities dissolved the main opposition parties and later banned their members from legislative elections.
Mass trials, condemned by human rights groups, followed, thousands of people were imprisoned and some fled abroad.
The government denies deliberately targeting the opposition, saying it acted as it did to preserve Bahrain's national security.
Sayed Ahmed al-Wadaei, a human rights activist who fled to London, tasted liberty early in the uprising when tens of thousands of Bahrainis joined the funeral of a protester who had been shot and killed.
""I felt real freedom that day, we could say whatever we wanted,"" said Wadaei, whose citizenship was revoked in 2015 when he organised a protest against King Hamad as he visited Britain.
In 2019, the king reinstated nationality to hundreds of Bahrainis stripped of citizenship. The list, reviewed by Reuters, did not include major opposition and activist figures.
Ali Al-Aswad, a former MP from the main dissolved al-Wefaq opposition group who has been sentenced in absentia to life in prison, said reconciliation in Bahrain hinged on outside powers defusing tensions in the region.
""I believe there won't be any solution to Bahrain's unrest without broader regional and international steps to ease tensions, be it between Iran and Saudi Arabia or between the U.S. and Iran,"" said Aswad, who has been residing in London since 2011.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Disha Ravi, the 22-year-old Indian environmental activist accused of sedition over a document backing protesting farmers, is as committed to protecting animals from harm as she is to saving the Earth from climate change, her friends say.
Profiled in British Vogue last September, she also - in common with many of her Gen Z peers - likes memes, the Kardashians and Harry Potter, according to her social media profile.
Ravi, a vegan and a member of Greta Thunberg's Fridays for Future (FFF) movement, has been detained by Delhi police for questioning over involvement in an online campaign guide that the Swedish climate activist promoted in support of farmers protesting India's agricultural reforms.
The accusation of sedition has triggered demonstrations in the capital and her southern home city of Bengaluru, and disbelief among Ravi's friends.
""She is extremely nice and accommodative, but takes her commitments (and passions) seriously,"" said a male friend from Bengaluru who got to know her through FFF protests.
She is meticulous about following safety guidelines at protests, ""urging us all to not obstruct traffic, or do anything that would inconvenience others,"" he said.
""It was hard for me to believe she is in this situation, because she is a very friendly, law-abiding person.""
Opposition politicians and activists have labelled her treatment as an escalation of a government clampdown on dissent. A lawyer for Ravi declined to comment.
One Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) photo shows Ravi, who has been working for a vegan food company in Bengaluru, with a kitten. ""I hope I give off the aura to all animals that I am their ally and friend,"" she says in a posting accompanying it. 
Other online photos show her planting trees, or taking part in clean-up drives around the city. 
""The climate crisis is already here. Those in power have congratulated us countless times because 'we're going to change the future',"" Ravi wrote in an opinion piece for the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) foundation that she co-authored https://news.trust.org/item/20200917201445-4iew6 in September. 
""They choose to ignore that the climate crisis is a problem we are facing today.""
Ravi could not be reached for comment by Reuters for this profile and the friends who spoke about her did so on condition of anonymity for fear of making her situation worse. 
She is accused of creating and sharing an online document with an action plan in support of the farmers, part of a police investigation into how a group of farmers stormed Delhi's Red Fort last month in one of the few violent incidents during the months-long protest.
Senior lawyers and lawmakers have criticised the sedition move, with a former Supreme Court judge saying https://www.ndtv.com/video/news/reality-check/standard-protest-kit-sedition-575901 the contents of the document neither made mention of violence nor incited violent behaviour. 

More protests were planned in New Delhi and Bengaluru on Tuesday to demand Ravi's release.

More than 5,000 protesters chanted: ""A civilian state, not a military state"" and ""The gang must go"" as they waved Algerian flags. 
Tuesday's protest was held to mark the second anniversary of the start of demonstrations in 2019, which began in Kherrata, east of the capital Algiers, before spreading across the country. 
""We came to revive the Hirak that was stopped for health reasons. They didn't stop us. We stopped because we care for our people. Today coronavirus is over and we will get the Hirak back,"" said Nassima, a protester. 
The Hirak movement demanded a complete removal of Algeria's entrenched political elite and continued to mobilise tens of thousands of protesters every week even after Abdelaziz Bouteflika stepped down from the presidency. 
His successor, Abdelmadjid Tebboube, elected in December 2019 in a vote that Hirak supporters dismissed as a charade, has publicly praised the movement while seeking to move past it with limited concessions including tweaks to the constitution. 
The weekly mass protests stopped a year ago when the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lockdown to Algeria. 
While the protest movement has no clear leadership, its supporters have repeatedly discussed online how to rekindle its presence on the streets as an active force to press for change. 

""It is a revolutionary process for a very precise goal, which is the departure of the regime, the whole regime with all its components,"" said Hamid, a protester.

SANAA (Reuters) - Bakers in the Yemeni capital Sanaa have swapped diesel and gas for firewood due to fuel shortages to keep making bread in a country where hunger is widespread after years of war. 
Each day workers unload tonnes of wooden logs from trucks that have travelled hundreds of miles from Yemen's remote mountains to Sanaa's biggest wood market.
The growing firewood business is a stark reminder of Yemen's environmental problems which have been eclipsed by war and disease. It also puts more pressure on forests already damaged by the cultivation of the chewable stimulant qat. 
""We used diesel before, then we moved to gas because of the blockade...then gas was cut off, so we moved to firewood,"" said Ali al-Shebeely, a bakery owner in Houthi-controlled Sanaa. 
The Iran-aligned Houthis accuse their Saudi-led coalition foe of waging economic warfare on the territories they hold by holding up commercial vessels in the Red Sea port of Hodeidah, including fuel tankers.
The group took over Sanaa and most major cities in 2014 after ousting the Saudi-backed government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The ensuing war has led to a major humanitarian crisis.
""Demand for firewood has increased sharply with fuel and gas shortages and the blockade imposed on Yemen,"" said Abdulrahman Yahya, a wood trader in Sanaa. 
Both firewood and bread prices have risen.
Baker Tawfiq Abdulmughni said: ""We used to buy a truckload for 130,000 riyals ($500). Now it's for 250,000 ($1,000).""
Under pressure from authorities, bakers have been reducing the size of bread instead of raising prices. 
In al-Namri bakery in the UNESCO-listed old neighbourhood of Sanaa, workers prepared famous Yemeni Kodam and Rotti breads, while feeding the wood-fired oven with oak logs. 
In the market, huge piles of firewood were stacked on the red brown soil, waiting for buyers. 
""I call on the world to end the blockade on Yemenis, so they can live like everyone else in the world,"" said Matar Ali Nagy, a Sanaa resident as he bought bread. 

""We are under siege here in Yemen.""

294,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 09:57AM ET</span>","'Hard to bring tears out:' Stunned by pandemic, some Americans struggle to grieve","By Maria Caspani
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fiana Tulip lost her mother to COVID-19 on the Fourth of July. Like so many others, she was not able to see her or say goodbye. 
For Tulip, 41, that was the only beginning of an avalanche of personal and financial loss and hardship brought on by a pandemic that has now claimed the lives of nearly half a million people in the United States alone. The heavy emotional toll was just too much to process, short-circuiting her ability to grieve. 
""There's sometimes situations where people do have to delay their grief, there isn't enough space, emotionally, to do it,"" Sonya Lott, a psychologist who specializes in prolonged grief, said.
""If you can somehow keep moving, that helps you to survive for some time, but eventually that crashes,"" she said. ""The grief doesn't go away.""
COVID-19 has now killed more Americans than World War Two. January alone was the pandemic's deadliest month - nearly 96,000 people lost their lives, according to a Reuters analysis of public health data. 
Even for those Americans who have grown numb after a year of grim statistics, the 500,000-death milestone is a startling reminder of the monumental loss the pandemic is leaving in its trail. Even so, only stories like Tulip's can reveal the full scope of the tragedy.
Shortly after the passing of her mother, a respiratory therapist in Texas, Tulip's husband lost his job. She was getting sporadic work as a personal trainer but not nearly enough to support her family. 
They suddenly had to worry about their finances and future job prospects in expensive New York City where they live in a one bedroom apartment with their 17-month-old daughter Lua. 
In the following months, she suffered two miscarriages while the virus took her uncle and another relative. Tulip said that, tragedy after tragedy, she has not been able to find time and space to grieve everything she has lost. 
""I was a pretty emotional person and since my mom died it is very hard to bring tears out,"" Tulip, who has now regained full employment working as a communications professional and is supporting her family, told Reuters earlier this month. ""I just don't have time, and it sounds so heartless and callous. ... I just don't have time to sit with it.""
'TSUNAMI' OF GRIEF
Some experts are worried about the long-term consequences of delayed grief and, more broadly, about the long-lasting effects the pandemic is going to inflict on the nation.
""We need to be concerned,"" said Lott. ""We're looking at a tsunami of not just grief but depression, anxiety... all types of physical conditions because of the amount of stress that people are under individually and collectively as a result of the pandemic.""
COVID-19 has affected the lives of Americans in myriad ways, whether it is the loss of loved ones, unemployment or childcare.
This ""multitude"" of losses not limited to death creates greater vulnerability for prolonged grief disorder, a condition in which grief continues to be persistent, intense, and interferes with an individual's daily functioning a year after the death of a loved one, Lott said.
The pandemic also took away many of the resources that people typically tap into to deal with hardship. It made it difficult if not impossible to tend to a loved one in the hospital, to attend a funeral or to simply hug and find comfort in the presence of others.       
'KEEP CHUGGING'
The last correspondence Tulip had with her mother was a series of text messages. ""I am super weak, I need to shower. The cough is hurting me,"" her mother texted her the day before she succumbed to the virus. 
""Just rest. No need to get up,"" Tulip texted back. 
For Veronica Espinosa, the sudden death of her father left her unable to fully process his loss.
Her father died of COVID-19 shortly after Thanksgiving last year in a Miami-area hospital. His condition deteriorated in a matter of days, and Espinosa, an only child whose mother does not speak English, was able to see him briefly before he died.
However, she was heartbroken she could not be by his side when he passed. ""He died alone, we couldn't be there,"" she recalled tearfully during an interview earlier this month.
As she grieved, other worries weighed on the 37-year-old teacher. Her husband contracted COVID-19 and his home inspection business took a hit, putting on her the burden of providing for them and their young son.
Espinosa is looking ahead to the end of the pandemic with a mix of apprehension and hope.
""I think that once this starts to die down, it puts things into perspective and you're going to be able to think more,"" she said. ""The bad thing is you're going to be flooded with emotions.""
Tulip is also bracing for what lies ahead.

""I have no doubt that will hit me hard whenever it does,"" she told Reuters. ""So many things will but until then I'll keep chugging.""

More contagious mutations are spreading fast in the EU and across the world, with the so-called British variant seen by experts as likely to become prevalent on the continent.
In new contracts with vaccine manufacturers, the EU is adding clauses that explicitly cover variants, three EU officials involved in talks with the companies told Reuters.
Vaccine makers are testing their shots against variants and are also working on tweaks that could make them more effective against virus mutations.
One official said the clauses would allow the EU not to buy vaccines that are not effective against widespread variants, and to order upgraded versions instead. However, the source said clauses were vague on the definition of variants and the actual legal power they would give the EU.
The three officials said that an anti-variant clause was included in a second contract finalised earlier in February with  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech for the supply of 300 million additional doses of their COVID-19 vaccine.
Pfizer and the European Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Studies have shown the Pfizer vaccine can be effective against the British and the South African variants. The company is also working on a booster shot that would be tailored against variants.
The EU now wants to add these clauses in new supply deals and is considering whether to upgrade its existing contracts, the officials said. 
The bloc is negotiating new supply agreements with  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX), Valneva and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) to increase its vaccine reserve beyond the nearly 2.3 billion doses which it has already secured from six pharmaceutical firms.
On Wednesday, the EU Commission will present a series of measures to boost the EU preparedness against variants, including new funds to help sequence the genome of the new coronavirus and spot variants.

Most EU countries have so far done little or no sequencing at all.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top faith leaders from across the United States on Tuesday urged President Joe Biden to immediately withdraw a lawsuit filed by his predecessor to block $2.3 billion in supplemental income payments to some 300,000 aged, blind and disabled Puerto Ricans.
Catholic Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez of San Juan, the head of Catholic Charities USA, and leaders from other churches called on Biden to use executive orders and back congressional action to attract more pharmaceutical and other manufacturing jobs to the Caribbean island, a U.S. territory of 3.2 million people hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Biden administration should also free up more disaster relief aid for the island and expand federal programs such as the Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicare, the signers said.
""Nearly 60% of Puerto Rico's children, U.S. citizens, live in poverty and would benefit from these measures,"" they wrote in the letter, which was delivered to the White House on Tuesday.
The pandemic cut revenues and raised costs at a time when Puerto Rico was already reeling from bankruptcy, severe earthquakes and two devastating 2017 hurricanes, Irma and Maria.
The signers welcomed the release of some hurricane recovery funds by the Biden administration, but said some $50 billion more was needed.
Biden campaigned against what he called the ""current untenable situation"" in Puerto Rico, vowing to step up federal disaster aid, end discriminatory practices, and rebuild the island's ""significantly deficient infrastructure.""
But his administration has not yet scrapped a lawsuit filed by the Justice Department under former President Donald Trump to block an April 2020 federal appeals court ruling that allows all eligible Puerto Ricans to apply for supplemental Social Security benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program.
The benefits had been available to any U.S. citizen living in any of the 50 states, Washington, D.C., and the Mariana Islands, but not Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.
Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, said the letter was intended to galvanize action by the Biden administration to help Puerto Ricans, who have faced ""crisis after crisis, disaster after disaster"" over the past decade.

No comment was immediately available from the Justice Department.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will increase the number of its COVID-19 vaccination sites by up to five times after administering nearly 9 million shots in a month, a government official said on Tuesday, amid concerns about the speed of coverage in the country.
Having reported the highest number of coronavirus infections after the United States, and with the world's biggest vaccine-making capacity, India says it has been the fastest to reach many inoculation milestones.
However it is vaccinating only around 300,000 front-line workers a day, a total that will have to increase sharply to meet the government's target of covering 300 million of its 1.35 billion people by August, experts say.
The ongoing vaccination of front-line workers such as nurses and doctors has taught India how to scale up the campaign, Vinod Kumar Paul, who heads a government panel on vaccine strategy, told a news conference.
""This learning will be of great use,"" he said, hours after taking the second dose of a government-backed vaccine. ""We are currently running 10,000-11,000 immunisation sessions. We will do four to five times of that when we start the next phase; wait for the pace to pick up.""
India will begin immunising the public from next month, starting with those over 50 or with medical conditions.
The country has covered 60% of its nearly 10 million healthcare workers since starting the drive on Jan. 16, though as many as 11 of its 36 states or federally controlled territories have not even reached the halfway mark.
""These are not very unsatisfactory figures,"" Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said. ""We agree that like in any other field, there is a scope for improvement.""
India is using a home-grown vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, and another licensed from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University. Other vaccines are in the queue, including Russia's Sputnik V and products from Cadila Healthcare,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).
India, which makes 60% of the world's vaccines, has also exported COVID-19 shots to 24 countries as part of a diplomatic push.
Some Indians, however, wonder why the government is not expanding coverage at home when it has shipped 17 million doses - including around 6 million as gifts to partners such as Bangladesh and Nepal. For its own campaign, New Delhi has so far only ordered 31 million doses.
""I love my neighbours and friends, but should I love them at my expense (literally) and to my detriment?"" Happymon Jacob, who teaches diplomacy at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said on Twitter.

India's COVID-19 cases rose by 9,121 in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 10.93 million. Deaths rose by 81 to 155,813.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - The World Health Organization has asked six African countries to be alert for possible Ebola infections, as Guinea on Tuesday reported new cases and Democratic Republic of Congo said its new infections were a resurgence of a previous outbreak. 
Guinea declared an outbreak of the virus on Sunday in the first return of the disease there since the 2013-2016 outbreak, while Congo has confirmed four new cases this month.
Health authorities have rushed to respond to the cases in Guinea, anxious to prevent a repeat of the last outbreak in West Africa, which killed more than 11,300 people, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in the worst Ebola epidemic on record. 
""We have already alerted the six countries around, including of course Sierra Leone and Liberia, and they are moving very fast to prepare and be ready and to look for any potential infection,"" the WHO's Margaret Harris told a Geneva briefing on Tuesday. 
Guinea's neighbours include Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
Guinea has so far recorded up to 10 suspected cases of Ebola and five deaths. Since declaring the outbreak on Sunday, it has identified 115 contacts of the known cases in the southeastern city of Nzerekore and 10 in the capital Conakry, the health ministry said on Tuesday. 
Gene sequencing of Ebola samples from both Congo and Guinea is being carried out to learn more about the origins of the outbreaks and identify the strains, according to the WHO.
As a result, Congo has confirmed that its latest cases are not linked to a new Ebola variant but represent a resurgence of its tenth outbreak, the second-largest on record that caused more than 2,200 deaths in 2018-2020.
""As for the infection, we're not yet able to identify its origin,"" said provincial health minister Eugene Nzanzu Salita, referring to how the first person to fall sick in this resurgence caught the virus.
Since the devastating epidemic in West Africa, the development of vaccines and treatments has greatly improved survival rates and containment efforts.
Further spread of the disease could cripple the regions' under-funded health systems which are also battling the coronavirus pandemic. Ivory Coast, Mali and Sierra Leone have launched plans to stop any potential spread and reinforced border controls.

The Ebola virus can cause severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids. It has a much higher death rate than COVID-19, but unlike the coronavirus it is not transmitted by asymptomatic carriers.

Turkey said on Sunday militants from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) killed the captives, including police and military personnel, as it was carrying out a military operation against the group.
Erdogan also repeated Ankara's complaint that it had not received enough international solidarity.
""Whether you speak up or not, we know our duty. We will not give the terrorists a chance,"" Erdogan told supporters from his AK Party in the Black Sea province of Trabzon.
""We will expand our operations into areas where threats are still dense,"" he added. ""We will stay in the areas we secure as long as necessary to prevent similar attacks again.""
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, has waged a decades-old insurgency in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
In the past two years, Turkey has launched several cross-border operations to fight the PKK in northern Iraq, where the group has its stronghold in the Qandil mountains.
On Monday, the United States told Ankara that it blamed the PKK for killing the 13 Turks, after Turkey called an earlier U.S. statement on the killings ""a joke"" and summoned the U.S. ambassador.

Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar, briefing parliament on the operation after opposition parties criticised the government for failing to rescue the Turks, said the offensive was launched without ground support due to the harsh conditions in the mountainous region.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO defence ministers are set to expand the military alliance's training mission in Iraq once the coronavirus pandemic eases, senior officials and diplomats said, potentially cementing a broader role for the Atlantic alliance in the Middle East. 
Ministers are set to agree plans on Thursday during a video conference, potentially taking the mission from its current maximum of some 500 troops to around 4,000 or 5,000, four diplomats said. 
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Monday he expected defence ministers to agree to an expanded mission, with more allied personnel working in more security institutions across Iraq.
""The mission will expand gradually, in response to the situation,"" he said. 
NATO has had a non-combat, ""train-and-advise"" mission in Baghdad since October 2018 but plans to expand it were delayed, in part, by COVID-19 and also due to concerns about regional stability after a U.S. drone killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad on Jan. 3. 2020.
Earlier expansion plans were mainly in response to a demand by then-U.S. President Donald Trump for NATO to do more in the Middle East. This time, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief and U.S. ally who took office in May, is eager to have a greater NATO presence in the country at a time of rising insecurity, diplomats said.
A rocket attack on U.S.-led forces in northern Iraq killed a civilian contractor on Monday and injured a U.S. service member, in the deadliest such incident in almost a year.
Paramilitary groups aligned with Iran in Iraq and Yemen have launched attacks against the United States and its Arab allies in recent weeks, including a drone attack on a Saudi airport and a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
NATO will likely take over some of the training activities carried out by the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State. The allied mission, involving allies including Britain, Turkey and Denmark and led by a Danish commander, is seen as more acceptable to Iraqis than a U.S. training force, diplomats said.

Currently, the NATO mission only trains and advises members of the Iraqi security institutions and forces who are under the direct control of the Iraqi government.

Police searched the homes of 25 members of the independent Belarusian Association of Journalists (BAJ) and the human rights organization Viasna-96, Viasna-96 said. 
The authorities in a statement connected the searches to an investigation into what they said was the financing of the protests by ""organisations positioning themselves as human rights defenders"".
More than 33,000 people have been detained in a violent crackdown following an election last August that Lukashenko's opponents say was blatantly rigged to hand the president a sixth term in office since 1994. He denies electoral fraud. 
The crackdown has prompted new Western sanctions but Lukashenko has refused to resign, counting on diplomatic and financial support from traditional ally Russia, which sees Belarus as a buffer state against the European Union and NATO.
""They are looking for 'criminals' among those who help political prisoners and write about the struggle of Belarusians for freedom,"" wrote exiled opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya about the raids. 
""They look for 'criminals' in their parents' homes. But in search of criminals, they should look into the offices of the riot police, the GUBOPiK (interior ministry directorate) and all those responsible for the repression.""
The raids came on the same day as the ongoing trial of two journalists from the Poland-based television channel Belsat in Minsk, who face up to three years in prison for reporting live from the protests.

Lukashenko held a two-day ""People's Assembly"" last week to discuss political reforms, which his opponents dismissed as a sham exercise to keep him in power.

Guinea's ministry of health said it has identified 115 contacts of the known cases in the city of Nzerekore in the country's south east and 10 in the capital Conakry since the outbreak was confirmed on Sunday. 
Unlike the deadliest known outbreak, which tore through West Africa from 2013-16, Guinean authorities have said they are better prepared to stop the spread of the virus.
The Ebola virus causes severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids.
The 2013-16 outbreak killed 11,300 people, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday warned the outbreaks in Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo represented a regional risk.
Fearing a spread of the disease that could cripple their under-funded health systems which are also battling the coronavirus pandemic, neighbours Ivory Coast, Mali and Sierra Leone said on Monday that they have launched plans to stop any potential spread and reinforced border controls. 

The second-deadliest known outbreak was declared over last year in Democratic Republic of Congo, but it recorded a resurgence of the disease on Feb. 7.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Students chanted slogans outside the Delhi police headquarters on Tuesday demanding the release of a 22-year-old environmentalist accused of sedition for an online document in support of farmers' protests.
Police say Disha Ravi, a leader of the local arm of climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg's advocacy group, created and shared a ""toolkit"" or an action plan that was used to foment violence in Delhi last month during the protests.
Her supporters have denied she did anything illegal and said the toolkit was an information pack about the protests, which erupted late last year to demand a rollback of three new agricultural laws, and was not designed to incite violence.
""The way the police took her away is illegal,"" said Prasenajit Kumar, a leader of the student group which tried to march to the front gates of the police headquarters. 
Riot police were on standby and the protesters were pushed back.
Her arrest in her hometown of Bengaluru on Sunday has stoked outrage and comes at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government faces allegations it is suppressing dissent. 
The government denies the charge and says people are free to protest if it is done peacefully.
Police said her detention was part of the investigation into the violence that took place on Jan. 26, Republic Day, when thousands of farmers tore down barricades and reached the historic Red Fort and raised a religious flag there. 
""As far as Disha's arrest is concerned, it was done as per the procedures. Law doesn't differentiate between a 22-year-old and a 50-year-old,"" Delhi police commissioner S.N. Srivastava said.
A lawyer for Ravi has declined to comment. Thunberg said on Monday that she had no comment on Ravi's arrest.
Police also have arrest warrants for two of Ravi's two associates, Nikita Jacob and Shantanu Muluk.
Jacob, a Mumbai-based lawyer, has petitioned a court, seeking to block her arrest. The court was due to hear her petition later on Tuesday. 
She said in her petition that she was trying to raise awareness about the plight of farmers protesting against deregulation of the produce market. There was no question of inciting violence, she said. Muluk could not be immediately reached for comment. 

Thousands of farmers remain camped on the outskirts of New Delhi. The government says the new laws open up opportunities to farmers by allowing them to directly sell produce to private buyers such as large retailers.

The son, also called Ferdinand Marcos but popularly known as ""Bongbong"", alleged he was unfairly robbed of victory after losing the vice presidential election to lawyer Leni Robredo by about 260,000 votes, claims Robredo denied.
In a statement, the court said its 15 judges had unanimously dismissed the petition, but did not specify the reasons.
Robredo welcomed the decision and told a news conference it ""will allow us to focus on the more important work of serving our people."" 
Vic Rodriguez, a spokesman for Marcos, said he could not make a statement until they had seen the ruling. 
Unlike many countries, elections for the Philippine president and vice-president are held separately and the two can be political rivals.
The court's decision comes as political manoeuvring builds ahead of elections next year to succeed President Rodrigo Duterte, with Robredo expected to be a presidential candidate.
Duterte said on Monday that Robredo was not qualified to run for president after she likened to extortion his decision to demand payment from the United States in exchange for keeping a two-decade-old troop-deployment agreement.
Marcos has been trying to rebuild his family's tainted image and Duterte had previously stated he wanted him to be his vice president, though it is unclear if he will run next year. 
Duterte has not named a preferred successor and his widely popular daughter, Sara, recently told Reuters she would not seek the presidency.

Sara, 42, who succeeded him as mayor of Davao City, came top in a recent opinion poll that asked the public to choose a preferred candidate from a list of possible contenders for the 2022 elections.

308,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 05:51AM ET</span>",Prosecution seeks hefty slander fine for Kremlin critic Navalny,"By Polina Nikolskaya
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state prosecutors on Tuesday asked a court to fine Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny 950,000 roubles ($13,000) for slandering a World War Two veteran, a charge he calls politically motivated.
President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic was jailed this month for almost three years for parole violations that he said were trumped up. The West has condemned the case and is discussing possible sanctions on Russia.
The judge said the verdict would be announced on Saturday - the same day that Navalny is due to appeal against his imprisonment.
The 44-year-old anti-corruption activist is accused of defaming a veteran who took part in a promotional video backing constitutional reforms last year. The reform, approved in a referendum, will let Putin run for two more terms in the Kremlin after 2024 if he wants to.
Navalny, who returned to Russia last month from Germany, where he had been recovering from a near-fatal poisoning with a military-grade nerve toxin in Siberia, described the people in the video as traitors and corrupt lackeys. 
Veterans of what Moscow calls the Great Patriotic War are widely revered in Russia, and criticising them is regarded as socially unacceptable and insulting.
Navalny has said his comment was not directed specifically at the veteran, and that the authorities are using the charge to smear his reputation.
At the hearings, he has clashed with the judge in heated exchanges and been told he could be removed from the court.
He used his closing arguments to call the case a legal nonsense. He then said it was pointless to discuss legal matters with the court and asked the judge and prosecutor if they knew a good recipe for pickled gherkins. 
As the state prosecutor addressed the court to recommend a sentence, Navalny interrupted her to joke: ""Execution?""
Navalny has refused in court to offer an apology to the veteran, who he said was being exploited for political ends. 
In her closing arguments, the prosecutor said: ""I understand perfectly well that such a punishment (a fine) for the defendant will not repair the damage caused to the victim ... 
""And on behalf of the state prosecution and myself personally, I want to ... apologise (to the veteran) for such fellow citizens as the defendant."" 
It had been unclear before Tuesday whether state prosecutors would seek a custodial sentence on top of a fine. 

Navalny's arrest and jailing sparked nationwide street protests in Russia, but his allies say they have now paused serious demonstrations until the spring.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Two men accused of leading Christian-dominated militias in widespread attacks on Muslims in the Central African Republic (CAR) on Tuesday rejected all charges against them at the start of their trial at the International Criminal Court.
Alfred Yekatom, a former militia commander also known as “Rambo”, and Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona, a former African soccer executive whom prosecutors say was a senior leader of the so-called anti-Balaka militias in 2013 and 2014, pleaded not guilty to charges of war crimes.
""I do not recognize myself at all in the charges against me, I am not guilty,"" Yekatom, 46, said.
Ngaissona, 53, has been charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, persecution and torture.
Prosecutors said Ngaissona was an integral part of the anti-Balaka movement.
""He knew the group he was helping to arm, finance, instruct and organise, known by September 2013 as the anti-Balaka, would inevitably target the Muslim civilian population of western CAR. He knew the vengeance within them,"" prosecutor Kweku Vanderpuye told the court. 
Yekatom faces similar charges to Ngaissona along with additional ones for his alleged use of child soldiers.
The Central African Republic has been mired in violence since a coalition of mostly northern and predominantly Muslim rebels known as ""Seleka"", or “alliance” in the Sango language, seized power in March, 2013. Their brutal rule gave rise to the opposing anti-Balaka Christian militias.
After initial criticism that its investigation into the CAR was one-sided, with only anti-Balaka leaders in the dock, the ICC in January announced it had detained alleged Seleka leader Mahamat Said Abdel Kain.
The trial begins against a backdrop of fighting between the CAR army, backed by United Nations, Russian and Rwandan troops, and rebels from both militia groups who have formed an alliance with the aim of seizing the capital and overturning a Dec. 27 vote in which President Faustin-Archange Touadera was declared the winner.

The CAR government on Feb. 5 extended a state of emergency for six months amid the continuing hostilities.

310,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 05:47AM ET</span>",Myanmar military guarantees new election; protesters block train services,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's military junta guaranteed on Tuesday that it would hold an election and hand over power, denied its ouster of an elected government was a coup or that its leaders were detained, and accused protesters of violence and intimidation.
The junta's justification of its Feb. 1 seizure of power and arrest of government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others came as protesters again took to the streets and after a U.N. envoy warned the army of ""severe consequences"" for any harsh response to the demonstrations.
""Our objective is to hold an election and hand power to the winning party,"" Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, spokesman for the ruling council, told the junta's first news conference since overthrowing Suu Kyi's government.
The military has not given a date for a new election but it has imposed a state of emergency for one year. Zaw Min Tun said the military would not hold power for long.
""We guarantee ... that the election will be held,"" he told the nearly two-hour news conference, which the military broadcast from the capital, Naypyitaw, live over Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), a platform it has banned.
Asked about the detention of Nobel prize winner Suu Kyi and the president, Zaw Min Tun dismissed the suggestion they were in detention, saying they were in their homes for their security while the law took its course.
He also said Myanmar's foreign policy would not change, it remained open for business and deals would be upheld.
The military will be hoping its reassurances will dampen the campaign of daily opposition to its rule and to the ousting Suu Kyi and her government.
As well as the demonstrations in towns and cities across the ethnically diverse country, a civil disobedience movement has brought strikes that are crippling many functions of government.
The unrest has revived memories of bloody outbreaks of opposition to almost half a century of direct army rule that ended in 2011 when the military began a process of withdrawing from civilian politics.
But violence has been limited this time though police have opened fire several times, mostly with rubber bullets, to disperse protesters.
A woman who was shot in the head in Naypyitaw last week is not expected to survive. Zaw Min Tun said a policeman had died of injuries sustained during a protest.
He said the protests were starting violence while the campaign of civil disobedience amounted to the illegal intimidation of civil servants, and warned that the military's repsonse would be within the law.
""We will wait patiently. After that, we will take action according to the law,"" Zaw Min Tun said.
The army has given itself extensive search and detention powers and has published penal code amendments aimed at stifling dissent with tough prison terms.
TRAIN BLOCKED
On Tuesday, protesters milled onto a sun-baked stretch of railway track waving placards in support of the disobedience movement and blocking train services between Yangon and the southern city of Mawlamyine.
""Release our leaders immediately,"" and ""People's power, give it back,"" the crowd chanted in live images broadcast by media.
Crowds also gathered in two places in the main city of Yangon - at a traditional protest site near the main university campus and at the central bank, where protesters called for staff to join the civil disobedience movement.
About 30 Buddhist monks protested against the coup with prayers in Yangon, while hundreds of protesters marched through the west coast town of Thandwe.
The army took power alleging that its complaints of fraud in a Nov. 8 general election, in which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party had won a landslide, were being ignored.
The electoral commission had dismissed the army's complaints.
Suu Kyi, 75, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest for her efforts to end military rule.
She faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios and is being held on remand until Wednesday. Her lawyer said on Tuesday police had filed a second charge of violating a Natural Disaster Management Law.
The coup has prompted an angry response from Western countries and the United States has already set some sanctions against the ruling generals. 
Zaw Min Tun said sanctions were expected, but later said the junta would maintain friendship with the international community, which had recognised the new leadership.
U.N. Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener spoke on Monday to the deputy head of the junta in what has become a rare channel of communication between the army and the outside world, urging restraint and the restoration of communications.
""Ms Schraner Burgener has reinforced that the right of peaceful assembly must fully be respected and that demonstrators are not subjected to reprisals,"" U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said at the United Nations.

""She has conveyed to the Myanmar military that the world is watching closely, and any form of heavy-handed response is likely to have severe consequences.""

Preparations for the delayed Summer Games have been marred by a firestorm over comments made this month by Mori, who eventually stepped down on Friday.
In its first meeting on Tuesday, the Tokyo 2020's candidate selection committee agreed on five requirements for a new leader, including a deep understanding of gender equality and diversity and the ability to actualise those values during the Games, the organisers said in a statement.
Among other qualities required are an international profile and experience on the global stage.
""The committee will make its selection of candidates for Tokyo 2020 president in accordance with these five criteria as swiftly as possible,"" the organisers said.
The resignation of the 83-year-old former prime minister has further eroded confidence in the organisers' ability to pull off the huge sporting event during a coronavirus pandemic. Public opinion polls in Japan show many no longer want the event held there at all.
Mori drew more fire by asking the mayor of the Olympic Village, 84-year-old Saburo Kawabuchi, to take over the job, prompting demands that a younger and/or female candidate be found, rather than another octogenarian male.

Seiko Hashimoto, an incumbent Olympic minister and seven-time Olympian, is among potential candidates to replace Mori, local media said. Several Olympic medallists and a former Olympic minister can emerge as contenders, media reported.

312,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 16, 2021 05:26AM ET</span>","Ten years on, Libyan revolutionaries live with wounds and unfulfilled dreams","MISRATA, Libya (Reuters) - As revolution swept their region in 2011, three young Libyans joined mass protests against Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade rule. They now live divided by Libya's frontlines, their futures irrevocably shaped by the uprising.
The first demonstrations against Gaddafi's rule began in the eastern city of Benghazi on Feb. 17, 2011. A decade on, Libya is still split between rival factions, and shell and shrapnel holes scar its cities. 
The United Nations has backed a new effort to unite Libya's warring sides through an interim government and national elections at the end of the year. But many Libyans remain sceptical.
'BULLET IN THE LEG'
Usama Ali al-Aguri, a graduate from Benghazi, was unemployed in 2011 and at the time decried what he called the ""injustice that we suffered and heard of from our fathers and grandfathers"".
As the fighting spread through the summer of 2011, he joined the assault on Tripoli. When he and a comrade went to reconnoitre an attack, Gaddafi's forces spotted them. 
""There was massive shooting at us. I got a bullet in my leg,"" he said. His comrade was killed. He ended up in a wheelchair, paralysed from the waist down. 
He condemns many of those who emerged as leaders in 2011. ""The revolution has been stolen from the honourable people now in their graves,"" he said. 
As the country fell further apart, he joined many others from the east in backing Khalifa Haftar, head of the eastern military forces whose push to capture Tripoli failed last year.
Aguri said his injury changed his life. Now 34, he lives for his two children, he said, and for work he goes each morning to the cattle market to buy and sell livestock. 
FACE OF THE UPRISING
Hisham al-Windi came from a family that did well under Gaddafi - his father was a diplomat. But after taking part in protests, he learned he was wanted by police and fled to Tunis.
Travelling to the south of Tunisia, he crossed through a border post held by the rebels and joined their battle in the western mountains. ""I was several months in the fight,"" he said. 
Windi was among the first fighters to storm Gaddafi's Tripoli compound. Wandering through the rooms where the leader had lived, he found an item known to all Libyans - his brocaded military hat. 
Interviewed that day on television wearing the hat, Windi voiced his hopes for the future, briefly gaining international recognition as a face of Libya's uprising. 
""I wanted to say first that Libyans were not as bad as people thought. And I was also saying 'Gaddafi is finished and we need to rebuild',"" he said. 
He now works in Tunis and is hopeful for change. 
""People say to me: 'you took part in this disaster. How do you like it now?' Well of course I don't. But it doesn't mean you have to choose between Gaddafi and chaos. Revolution is a process. We must build a new Libya that we deserve,"" he said. 
LACK OF PROGRESS
In Misrata, Malek Salem al-Mejae, then aged 20, began to fight in 2011 when his city came under attack by Gaddafi's forces.
That July, he, too, was wounded, losing a leg.
""I was in the back of the truck. A missile fell behind us,"" he said. ""Some of my friends were killed. I received treatment in Tunisia, then returned to Libya.""
He had hoped to see far greater progress in Libya than he has in the last decade, and blames Libya's post-revolutionary leaders for the country's failure to unite.

""Unfortunately the situation is as you see it after 10 years of wars. The politicians, who were entrusted with the task, were not up to the standard.""

Last week, several private TV and radio stations and web portals in Poland took themselves off air in protest against the tax, which they said would threaten the industry's independence and its diversity of views.
Critics say Poland is following the example of central European ally Hungary in trying to increase government control over the media. Much of Poland's independent media is funded through advertising or subscription. 
The government says the tax is needed to help raise funds for healthcare and culture, both hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, as well as to target internet giants overseas making advertising revenue in the country. 
A Ministry of Finance spokeswoman told Polish state news agency PAP on Tuesday that businesses could still submit their opinions until the end of the day. 
""We will after these consultations draft a new bill that acknowledges these concerns and then we will present it for the next steps in the (legislative) process,"" government spokesman Piotr Muller told a news conference.
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party's junior coalition partner, the centrist Accord, had said it could not support the current draft, in part due to the effect it would have on businesses. 
The other coalition partner, the right-wing United Poland, has said it supports the general direction of the proposals but will comment on it fully in the coming days. 
Muller said businesses had told the government they were worried about setting a fair taxation threshold. Previously, government officials said the tax would be set at between 2% and 15% of advertising income, depending on the size of the firm. 
Polish web portal Onet, owned by Ringier Axel Springer, said it could be paying 10-20 million zlotys ($2.7-5.4 million) extra a year due to the new tax.

On Monday, Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the tax would be ""fair and progressive and designed so all of the biggest firms have the biggest input into our economic life"".

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel held out the possibility on Tuesday that it would not engage with U.S. President Joe Biden on strategy regarding the Iranian nuclear programme, urging tougher sanctions and a ""credible military threat"" against its arch-enemy.
The remarks by Israel's envoy to Washington came at a touchy juncture for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Up for re-election next month, he has revived his hard line on Iran while not yet having any direct communication with Biden.
The new administration has said it wants a U.S. return to a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran - which former President Donald Trump quit, restoring sanctions - if the Iranians recommit to their own obligations. Washington has also said it wants to confer with allies in the Middle East about such moves.
""We will not be able to be part of such a process if the new administration returns to that deal,"" Ambassador Gilad Erdan told Israel's Army Radio.
Netanyahu aides have privately questioned whether engaging with U.S. counterparts might backfire, for Israel, by falsely signalling its consent for any new deal that it still opposes.
Israel was not a party to the 2015 deal. It has powerful advocates within the U.S. Congress, however, and Netanyahu's threats to take unilateral military action on Iran if he deems diplomacy a dead end also figure into big-power planning.
""We think that if the United States returns to the same accord that it already withdrew from, all its leverage will be lost,"" Erdan said. 
""It would appear that only crippling sanctions - keeping the current sanctions and even adding new sanctions - combined with a credible military threat - that Iran fears - might bring Iran to real negotiations with Western countries that might ultimately produce a deal truly capable of preventing it breaking ahead (to nuclear arms).""

The Biden administration has said it wants to strengthen and lengthen constraints on Iran, which denies seeking the bomb.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police have arrested a 22-year-old activist linked to Swedish climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg and charged her with sedition, saying she created and shared an online document to support the ongoing monthslong farmers protest.
Disha Ravi, who was detained in the southern city of Bengaluru on Sunday and then moved to the capital New Delhi, is currently in police custody.
Her arrest has ignited a firestorm of criticism from opposition politicians and other activists who said it was an escalation in the government's efforts to silence dissenters.
WHAT IS RAVI ACCUSED OF? 
Ravi is accused of creating and sharing an online document, which Delhi police says contained ""time-bound action plans"" used to foment violence in the capital last month.
Tens of thousands of farmers have been camped on the outskirts of Delhi since late last year, protesting against three new farm laws enacted by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government.
On Jan. 26, a group of protesting farmers attempted to enter the heart of the city, clashing with police and storming the historic Red Fort complex.
The police allege that plans for such actions were formulated in the online document described as a ""toolkit"" that Ravi created and shared with Thunberg.
A lawyer for Ravi declined to comment.
Thunberg, who tweeted a link to the document and later deleted it, said on Monday that she had no comment on Ravi's arrest.
WHAT IS THE TOOLKIT?
In a briefing on Monday, Delhi Police said the ""toolkit"" document contained details of a social media campaign and on-ground action to be conducted in January, including the protesters entering the capital city.
""The main aim of the toolkit was to create misinformation and disaffection against the lawfully enacted government,"" Delhi Police official Prem Nath told reporters. 
""The toolkit sought to artificially amplify the fake news through various tweets which they have created in the form of a tweet bank,"" he said.
On Feb. 4, Delhi Police said it filed a case against authors of the document, accusing them of sedition, provocation with intent to cause violence and promoting enmity between different groups, among other charges.
An archived version of the document reviewed by Reuters shows it contained guidelines on how to participate in and organise protests, mainly focused on creating international awareness of the farmers' agitation.
WHO ELSE IS ALLEGED TO BE INVOLVED? 
Police said it had investigated multiple screenshots of the document and searched the home of lawyer Nikita Jacob in the western city of Mumbai.
The initial investigation showed that Ravi, Jacob and another associate, named only as Shantanu, created the document, police said.
Police said the three had also been in touch with supporters of the movement for an independent Sikh homeland called Khalistan.
""The document that they drafted had secessionist and pro-Khalistani content embedded into it through links and texts,"" Delhi police said in a briefing note.

In a bail application submitted to a Mumbai court, Jacob's lawyer said her client had been researching and circulating information to ""encourage peaceful participation"" with protesting farmers and had no motive to incite violence.

The incident caused no casualties, the coalition statement carried by Ekhbariya TV said. The explosive-laden drone had been fired towards Abha airport, which is in southern Saudi Arabia near the Yemen border. 
The Houthis say they have launched attacks which have struck an airport or military air base in southern Saudi Arabia almost every day for the past 10 days. 
The coalition says it intercepts and destroys most of them, but last Wednesday Riyadh said one attack had caused a fire in a civilian aircraft at Abha airport.
The coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis who control the capital and most populous areas. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war, which the United Nations says has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis.

Dmitriev, 65, was found guilty in July of sexually abusing his adopted daughter, a charge he denied.
He was due to be freed in November due to time served. But a court in Russia's northwestern Karelia region in September abruptly added a decade to his sentence and said he would be held in a high-security penal colony. 
His lawyer and supporters say the case against him is retribution for him helping expose Stalin's 1937-38 Great Terror, in which nearly 700,000 people were executed, according to conservative official estimates.
Dmitriev found a mass grave after the Soviet breakup containing thousands of bodies of people held in Stalin's Gulag network of prison camps.
Memorial, a rights group where Dmitriev works, has said the accusations against him were groundless.
Fellow historians, rights activists and leading cultural figures say Dmitriev was framed because his focus on Stalin's crimes was politically untenable in a modern Russia where the dominant state narrative is of a great nation rising from its knees. 
The U.S. embassy condemned the long jail term handed to him in September, describing it as a setback for human rights and historical truth in Russia.

""I see much greater volume in March and April - tens of millions of doses coming through,"" he said.

Avijit Roy, a U.S. citizen of Bangladeshi origin, was hacked to death https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bangladesh-blogger/bangladesh-rallies-for-free-speech-after-u-s-bloggers-murder-idUKKBN0LX15X20150301 by machete-wielding assailants in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. His wife and fellow blogger Rafida Ahmed suffered head injuries and lost a finger. 
“Charges against them were proved beyond any doubt. The court gave them the highest punishment,” public prosecutor Golam Sarwar Khan said after the verdict, amid tight security at the Special Anti-Terrorism Tribunal in the capital, Dhaka.
The court also jailed one man for life in the attack, Khan said.
He said the six men convicted on Tuesday belong to the al Qaeda-inspired domestic militant group Ansar Ullah Bangla Team, which police say was behind the murders of more than a dozen secular activists and bloggers.
Syed Ziaul Haq, a sacked army major believed to be the leader of the group and who masterminded the killing, and one other member of the group were tried in absentia and received death sentences, Khan said.
Nazrul Islam, defence lawyer for the six men, said they would appeal against the sentences in the higher court.
Muslim-majority Bangladesh saw a string of deadly attacks between 2013 and 2016 targeting bloggers, secular activists and religious minorities, claimed by Islamic State or al Qaeda-aligned groups.
The most serious attack came in July 2016, when gunmen stormed a cafe in the diplomatic quarter of Dhaka and killed 22 people, most of them foreigners. 
After the cafe siege, more than 100 suspected militants were killed and hundreds more were arrested as the government cracked down on Islamist groups to preserve its image as a moderate Muslim nation.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Flora Marcelo wrote her appeal on a white wall outside the U.N. human rights office in Mexico City, using a finger dipped in her own blood: ""Justice for the disappeared."" 
At least five women joined Monday's protest, some drawing their blood with the help of a catheter, to bring attention to the plight of children and other relatives who have gone missing or been killed amid the violence of Mexico's long drug war.
Marcelo, 36, has spent weeks camped outside government offices along with dozens of other women in a bid to highlight their cases. This protest was a ""desperate"" measure, she said. 
""They don't listen to us, and I want justice for my daughter,"" Marcelo said as blood flowed from her arm through a slender plastic tube. 
Mexico has registered nearly 80,000 missing people, most of them victims of gang-related violence since the start of a ""war on drugs"" in 2006. Officials say around half of those could be unidentified bodies in morgues that are under-funded and ill-equipped to deal with the avalanche of homicides.
Despite a new legal framework and the establishment of a national search commission, the number of missing keeps rising. Support groups of family members, mostly mothers, have formed to search in clandestine graves scattered across the country. 
Marcelo's 13-year-old disappeared in October from their home in Guerrero, one of Mexico's most violent states. Several days later, her body was found, dismembered. Marcelo discerned it was her daughter from the clothes discovered nearby.
Montserrat Ramirez, also from Guerrero, said her husband disappeared in April. 

For Ana Maria Maldonado, more than 10 years have passed since her son went missing in Mexico City. She now wears a pin bearing his photo and the words, ""Have you seen... ?""

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison apologised on Tuesday to a woman who alleged that she was raped in parliament two years ago for the way her complaint was handled at that time, ordering a probe into the government's workplace culture.
The woman told an online news publication and Channel 10 on Monday that she had been raped in the office of the current Defence Minister Linda Reynolds in March 2019 by unnamed colleague who also worked for Morrison's ruling Liberal party.
She said she spoke with police in early April of that year, but decided against making a formal complaint due to concerns that it would damage her career prospects.
It is unclear whether she has now lodged a formal complaint to police. 
Going public with the allegation, the woman gave her name to media, but Reuters refrains from publishing the names of rape victims. 
Police in the capital confirmed they had spoken to a complainant in April 2019, but she chose not to make a formal complaint. Police did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether a formal complain has since been made.
The woman said she told senior staff in Reynolds’ office of the alleged attack. She said she was then asked to attend a meeting in the office where she alleges she had been assaulted.
Reynolds on Monday confirmed she had been told of the complaint in 2019, though she denied the woman was pressured against making a police complaint. 
Morrison on Tuesday apologised to the woman and promised an investigation. 
""That should not have happened, and I do apologise,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra. ""I want to make sure any young woman working in this place is as safe as possible.""
Reynolds echoed Morrison in apologising a few hours later.
""Saying sorry is often the hardest thing for those of us who work in this place to say,” Reynolds told lawmakers.
""But can I say today, sorry is the easiest word for me to say.""
Reynolds was the Defence Industry Minister at the time of the alleged rape, and became Defence Minister two months later.
Morrison said he has appointed Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet official Stephanie Foster to review the process in dealing with workplace complaints, while a backbench lawmaker will investigate workplace culture.
The Liberal party has been dogged by allegations of improper behaviour towards women.
In 2019, female backbench lawmakers said they felt bullied to support a move to oust then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, while a former female Liberal staff member last year made an official complaint of improper behaviour by then immigration minister Alan Tudge. 

Tudge has denied the allegation.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military said on Tuesday it had captured a North Korean man who crossed the heavily fortified border between the two countries and was investigating whether he tried to defect. 
The man was found about 4:20 a.m. (1920 GMT Monday) near a checkpoint on the eastern end of the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the rival Koreas, and was taken into custody after a three-hour search, the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said. 
""He is presumed to be a North Korean and we're conducting an investigation into details, including how he had come down and whether he wished to defect,"" the JCS said in a statement. 
There was no unusual movement across the border but the military is reviewing its security posture in the region, it added. 
The rare border crossing came as North Korea's prolonged lockdowns rolled back the number of defectors arriving in South Korea to an all-time low last year.
Some 200 North Koreans settled in the South last year, down around 80% from 2019, Unification Minister Lee In-young has said, citing the reclusive state's shutdown of its frontiers in January 2020. 
The last publicly known case was in November when a North Korean man defected to the South via the eastern DMZ.
Cross-border ties soured after denuclearisation talks between Pyongyang and Washington stalled in 2019. 
A spat simmered in September after North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who went missing at sea, fanning public and political uproar in the South.
In July, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared an emergency and sealed off a border town after a person with COVID-19 symptoms illegally crossed the border into the North from the South.
North Korea has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, though Seoul officials have cast doubt on there being zero cases citing the country's active exchanges with China, where the virus first emerged, prior to its border closure.

The 2019 protests, fuelled by a perception Beijing was curbing the wide-ranging freedoms promised to the former British colony upon its return to Chinese rule in 1997, plunged the semi-autonomous city into its biggest crisis since the handover.
The rally in August 2019 was estimated to have drawn more than 1 million people, despite heavy rain, and provided a respite from the clashes between protesters and police seen often at demonstrations in the months before and after.
Former pro-democracy politician and activist Au Nok-hin pleaded guilty to organising and knowingly taking part in an unauthorised assembly, while Leung Yiu-chung, another activist, pleaded guilty to participating in an illegal assembly.
Leung and Au will hear the verdict on March 22.
The other seven activists on trial, including prominent Beijing critic Lai, Democratic Party founder Martin Lee, and veteran activists Lee Cheuk-yan, and Leung Kwok-hung, known as Long Hair, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
The latter two shouted ""Object to political prosecution!"" when making the plea.
Beijing has responded to the 2019 protests by imposing a sweeping national security law in June last year, punishing anything China deems as secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Since the introduction of the law, the government has disqualified opposition politicians and jailed activists, while authorities have banned slogans, songs and pro-democracy political activity in schools.

Lai has been in custody since December and is scheduled for another court appearance on Thursday for his appeal against an earlier decision to deny him bail in relation to charges of colluding with foreign forces.

WELLINGTON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Tuesday accused Australia of abdicating its responsibilities by ""unilaterally"" cancelling the citizenship of a woman detained in Turkey and accused of having links to the Islamic State.
Turkish authorities on Monday said they had caught three New Zealanders, two children and a 26-year-old woman alleged to be a member of Islamic State, trying to enter Turkey illegally from Syria.
The woman had held New Zealand and Australian citizenships, but the Australian government cancelled her citizenship, Ardern told reporters in Wellington.
The 40-year-old leader said Australia had ""abdicated its responsibilities"" by unilaterally cancelling the citizenship, forcing New Zealand to shoulder the responsibility for the woman, who has not lived in New Zealand since she was 6.
""New Zealand, frankly, is tired of having Australia exporting its problems,"" Ardern said. ""If the shoe were on the other foot we would take responsibility, that would be the right thing to do and I ask Australia to do the same."" 
Australian Prime Minister Morrison in a news conference in Canberra said: ""My job is Australia's interests. That's my job. And it's my job as the Australian Prime Minister to put Australia's national security interests first. I think all Australians would agree with that.""
He said he was scheduled to speak with Ardern today but added that legislation passed in parliament automatically cancels the citizenship of a dual citizen accused of being engaged in terrorist activities. 
The woman's case has been known to Australian and New Zealand authorities for some time. Ardern said that after Australia stripped her of her citizenship, she told Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison that the decision was wrong.
""I never believed the right response was to simply have a race to revoke people's citizenships ... they did not act in good faith,"" she said.

Ardern said her government has an obligation to its citizens regardless of the circumstances or offences committed, and that decisions would be driven by the fact that two small children ""who did not make the choice of being born in a war zone"" were involved.

TSURUGA, Japan (Reuters) - It was Manabu Yoneshima's dream to cap his medical career by running in the Tokyo Olympics torch relay, a festive occasion he had been training for during nights and weekends. 
Instead, Yoneshima has postponed his retirement and his lifelong goal to run the torch relay has been replaced by feelings of guilt as he and his colleagues battle the resurgent virus.
""Is it really right that I, as someone managing the hospital fighting the coronavirus, run as a torchbearer and get a nice memory out of it, when everyone else is struggling and putting up with the pandemic?"" asked Yoneshima, who manages the Municipal Tsuruga Hospital, 330 km (205 miles) west of Tokyo. 
""Medical workers are still going through tough times and ordinary people are not dining out and restricting their activities,"" the 65-year-old doctor told Reuters.
With limited staff and equipment, his hospital, the only general hospital in the rural town of Tsuruga with a population of 66,000, is still grappling with the pandemic. 
It has so far treated dozens of COVID-19 cases, fewer than in other parts of the country, but with a shortage of beds and a flood of elderly patients, his staff are in a constant state of anxiety. 
Yoneshima said staffing problems will only get worse once vaccinations start as early as later this month, diverting staff from their usual roles.
Although Tokyo and nine other prefectures are under a state of emergency through March 7, the Olympic torch relay is set to begin on March 25, but will include anti-virus measures like smaller celebrations and social distancing. Some 10,000 runners are expected to take part.
Despite his doubts, Yoneshima is still planning to run.
Most days, he spends hours making his rounds at the hospital and presiding over coronavirus meetings. In the evenings when he has time, he changes into a tracksuit and slips into an empty room to use a treadmill. On weekends, he tries to run 7 km (4.4 miles). 
Yoneshima was elated when he was picked to run in the relay. Now, he feels torn. 
He worries that his participation may prompt questions about why he's not helping his colleagues at the hospital instead. 
Most Japanese are opposed to holding the Olympics this summer, polls show, concerned that an influx of foreign athletes could further spread the virus.
Some of Yoneshima's staff are also skeptical about the Games, but remain supportive of him.
""I honestly don't think we can have the Olympics,"" said Emi Tanaka, a nurse at Yoneshima's hospital. To reduce infection risks, nurses who treat coronavirus patients have had to stay in hotels, separated from their families.
However, Tanaka said she wanted Yoneshima to run to encourage the hospital with his positive spirit.
""I hope it will be one step forward that can link us together,"" she said.
Preparations have also been marred by a firestorm over sexist comments this month by the president of the Tokyo organizing committee, Yoshiro Mori, who stepped down on Friday. 
Hundreds of volunteers dropped out in protest after his remarks, while a celebrity torchbearer also publicly quit after Mori declared organisers were determined to hold the Olympics ""regardless of how the coronavirus (situation) looks"".
Officials worried about the fallout emailed torch runners last week, apologising for Mori's comments and reiterating that the relay will go ahead as planned, according to an official email seen by Reuters.
While the controversy may drag on, Yoneshima still plans to take part.
""If we have the Olympics, I want to run,"" he said.

""People may think differently. But I think my torch relay can give hope to medical workers and allow us to run towards a hopeful future.""

President Joe Biden, a former vice president himself under Barack Obama, has had Harris at his side for multiple events during his early White House tenure, indicating he wants her to have a key role in implementing his political and policy agenda. 
The call with Macron, leader of a G7 nation, shows Harris is taking a role in foreign policy as well, an area in which the former U.S. senator from California has significantly less experience than Biden.
""Vice President Harris and President Macron agreed on the need for close bilateral and multilateral cooperation to address COVID-19, climate change, and support democracy at home and around the world,"" the vice president's office said in a statement.
""They also discussed numerous regional challenges, including those in the Middle East and Africa, and the need to confront them together,"" the statement said.
Harris also spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this month in her first call as vice president with a foreign leader.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo acknowledged on Monday that his office should not have withheld data on COVID-19 nursing home deaths from state lawmakers, the public and press - falling short of an apology a senior aide made to lawmakers last week.
Cuomo said at a press conference that ""lessons were learned' in not releasing the data and that things ""should have been done differently.""
""The last thing I wanted to do was aggravate a terrible situation,"" said Cuomo, a third-term Democrat. ""There were people's requests, press requests that were not answered in a timely manner.""
More than 15,000 people have died in New York state's nursing homes and long term care facilities from COVID-19, but as recently as last month, the state reported only 8,500 deaths.
The numbers, while accounted for in the full state death totals to the state, were not ascribed to nursing homes for residents who died in hospitals rather than within the facilities.
Requests from state lawmakers and the U.S. Department of Justice were made in August for full accounting, along with numerous requests from the media, Cuomo acknowledged.
He said at the press conference that the state prioritized answering the Justice Department first, and other requests went unanswered.
Angered by what they perceived as a cover-up, last week Democratic and Republican lawmakers said they are reconsidering their decision to grant Cuomo emergency powers to contend with the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""This is a betrayal of the public trust,"" Andrew Gounardes, a Democratic state senator, wrote on Twitter. ""There needs to be full accountability for what happened.""
A senior aide for Cuomo apologized on Friday to state lawmakers for the governor's office withholding requested data showing the death toll in nursing homes from COVID-19.
Cuomo said of the issue, ""We have to learn from it, we have to correct it.""

He also said, ""We were managing a pandemic. The number one priority was saving people's lives every day.""

GENEVA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three months after the Trump administration rejected her, former Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala received unanimous backing on Monday to become the first woman and first African director-general of the World Trade Organization. 
A self-declared ""doer"" with a track record of taking on seemingly intractable problems, Okonjo-Iweala will have her work cut out for her at the trade body, even with Donald Trump, who had threatened to pull the United States out of the organisation, no longer in the White House.
As director-general, a position that wields limited formal power, Okonjo-Iweala, 66, will need to broker international trade talks in the face of persistent U.S.-China conflict; respond to pressure to reform trade rules; and counter protectionism heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
""What it (the WTO) needs is someone who has the capability to drive reform, who knows trade and who does not want to see business as usual. And that is me,"" she said on Monday.
Earlier she told Reuters in an interview that her top priority would be to ensure the trade body does more to address the COVID-19 pandemic, calling the disparities in vaccine rates between rich and poor countries ""unconscionable"" and urging members to lift export restrictions on medical items. 
She also expressed confidence that her priorities were aligned with Washington's.
""I think our interests and priorities are aligned. They want to bring the WTO back to (its) purpose,"" she told Reuters. 
The U.S. delegate said that Washington was committed to working closely with her and would be a ""constructive partner"".
China's delegate pledged ""full support"" for her.
EU trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis said he looked forward to working closely with her to drive ""much-needed reform of the institution"".
A 25-year veteran of the World Bank, where she oversaw an $81 billion portfolio, Okonjo-Iweala ran against seven other candidates by espousing a belief in trade's ability to lift people out of poverty.
She studied development economics at Harvard after experiencing civil war in Nigeria as a teenager. She returned to the country in 2003 to serve as finance minister and backers point to her hard-nose negotiating skills that helped seal a deal to cancel billions of dollars of Nigerian debt with the Paris Club of creditor nations in 2005.
""She brings stature, she brings experience, a network and a temperament of trying to get things done, which is quite a welcome lot in my view,"" former WTO chief Pascal Lamy told Reuters last week. ""I think she's a good choice.""
Key to her success will be her ability to operate in the centre of a ""U.S.-EU-China triangle"", he said. 
The endorsement of the Biden administration cleared the last obstacle to her appointment and she is due to begin March 1.
SWEET BUT STRONG
Okonjo-Iweala, who goes by 'Dr. Ngozi', becomes one of the few female heads of a major multilateral body. When she joins the WTO's Geneva lakeside headquarters her portrait is set to be hung beside others of men, mostly white and from rich countries. 
The Trump administration's main criticism of her was that she lacked direct trade experience compared to her main South Korean rival and even supporters say she will have to quickly get up to speed on the technicalities of trade negotiations.
She has rejected this, saying that she has plenty of experience of trade, plus other expertise.
Asked about how she took the Trump rejection, she replied: ""When things happen you take them in your stride and move on"".
Raised by academics, the mother-of-four earned a reputation for hard work and modesty amid the pomp of Nigeria's governing class, acquaintances say. 
""She is persistent and stubborn,"" said Kingsley Moghalu, former deputy governor of Nigeria's central bank who worked with her when she was the country's first female finance minister.
Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari welcomed her election, saying it brought ""more joy and honour to the country'. 
Her appointment also was welcomed by people in the streets of Nigeria's capital Abuja where Ibe Joy, who works in marketing, said Okonjo-Iweala's achievements were an inspiration to young women. ""If she can do it, we all can do it,"" said Joy.
REFORMING THE UNREFORMABLE
The 26-year-old WTO that Okonjo-Iweala inherits after a six-month leadership gap is partially paralysed, thanks to the Trump administration which blocked appointments to its top appeals body that acts as the global arbiter of trade disputes.
But even before Trump, negotiators had struggled to clinch deals that must be agreed by consensus, with the United States and other developed WTO members arguing that developing countries, notably China, cannot cling on to exceptions and that rules need to change to reflect China's economic growth.
Okonjo-Iweala, who is a special envoy for the World Health Organization on COVID-19 and, until recently chair of the board of global vaccine alliance Gavi, said on Monday she wanted to build a framework on pandemic response ""so that next time we don't waste time trying to figure out how to respond"".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called Okonjo-Iweala the ""WTO's perfect chief"". 
The WTO currently faces deadlock over an issue of waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 drugs, with many wealthy countries opposed.
High on the to-do list will also be fisheries subsidies, the subject of the WTO's main multilateral talks that missed a deadline to conclude by end-2020. She told journalists on Monday she thought a deal on this was ""within reach"".
Asked about the challenges ahead, she joked that a book she wrote about fixing Nigeria's broken institutions could well apply to today's WTO: 'Reforming the Unreformable'.

""I feel I can solve the problems. I'm a known reformer, not someone who talks about it,"" she told Reuters in an earlier interview. ""I've actually done it"".

Duterte said last week the United States should pay more if it wants to maintain the two-decade old Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which he unilaterally cancelled last year in an angry response to an ally being denied a U.S. visa.
""If we have very strong ties with a very strong ally then I think it also comes with a higher amount of financial assistance to be given,"" presidential spokesman Harry Roque told a regular briefing.
Roque cited a study by the Washington-based Stimson Center, which showed the Philippines received $3.9 billion in U.S. counter-terrorism support from 2002-2017 compared to the $16.4 billion for Pakistan over the same period.
""We got $3.9 billion. Is that a huge amount? That's loose change compared to what other countries were getting,"" he said. 
The militaries of the two countries enjoy close ties, forged during decades of joint exercises that have boosted the capability of Philippine forces while giving the United States an important foothold in a region where China's power and influence is growing. 
Defence officials from both countries are trying to salvage the VFA, which underpins the Mutual Defense Treaty and an Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement. Duterte has threatened to scrap all of them.
The U.S. embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In December, it said the Philippines received the most U.S. military assistance in the Indo-Pacific region, having received 33 billion pesos ($689 million) worth of hardware. 
Roque said Duterte was upholding the national interest and not committing extortion, as some critics, including vice president Leni Robredo, have said. His demand was for compensation, because the rotating U.S. troop presence put the Philippines at risk. 
Duterte schooled Robredo about foreign policy making, saying the power to determine and shape foreign relations rests with the president.
""It is not money I am asking for ... we should be provided with arms and armaments that could place us at equal footing with countries at war with us,"" Duterte said in a late night-televised address. 
He told Robredo, who was elected separately to him and is expected to be the opposition's presidential bet in next year's elections: ""You are not qualified to run for president. You do not know your role in government.""

Robredo's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea is tracking down people who potentially had contact with Ebola patients and will rush vaccines to the affected area as soon as possible following at least three deaths from the disease, Health Minister Remy Lamah said on Monday.
Lamah said that unlike during the deadliest known outbreak, which tore through West Africa in 2013-2016, Guinea had the means to halt the resurgence of the virus.
The Ebola virus causes severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids.
""In 2013, it took us months to understand that we were dealing with an Ebola epidemic, while this time, in less than four days, we were able to do analysis and have the results. Our medical teams are trained and seasoned. We have the means to quickly overcome this disease,"" Lamah told Reuters. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday warned the outbreaks in Guinea and Congo represented a regional risk.
The WHO representative in Guinea, Georges Ki-Zerbo, said he has requested authorisation to obtain as many vaccines doses as possible.
He added that there were some constraints in getting the vaccines to Guinea quickly, but authorities were working on the issues so that the vaccines could be available by next week for a targeted vaccination campaign.
International organisations including the International Committee of the Red Cross, Medecins Sans Frontieres and medical charity ALIMA said they were sending rapid response teams to the region to assist.
The 2013-2016 outbreak killed 11,300 people, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The second-deadliest known outbreak was declared over last year in Democratic Republic of Congo, but it also saw a resurgence this month.
An Ebola vaccination campaign started in eastern Congo on Monday.
""There is hope that with new tools and the experience and lessons learned, this could maybe work better this time,"" said Ki-Zerbo, underlining the need to involve local communities and listen to them.
Neighbouring Sierra Leone has sent workers to watch border entry points in coordination with Guinea authorities, a health ministry spokesman said.
The outbreak started after the funeral of a nurse who was buried in southeast Guinea on Feb. 1. She is thought to have had Ebola and seven people who attended her funeral have tested positive for Ebola, with three dying, authorities said.

""What worries us the most is the dangerousness of the disease given what we experienced five years ago. We do not want to relive such a situation,"" Lamah said.

Johnson said he would be keen to agree a global treaty on pandemics where countries agreed to share data, amid British and U.S. concern over access given to a World Health Organization (WHO) mission to China.
Asked by Reuters about any action he wanted to improve transparency, Johnson said: ""I think what the world needs to see is a general agreement on how we track data surrounding zoonotic pandemics... and we want a joint agreement on transparency.""
""I think one of the attractive ideas that we have seen in the last few months has been a proposal for a global treaty on pandemics, so that signatory countries make sure that they contribute all the data they have and we are able to get to the bottom of what's happened and stop it happening again,"" he said at a news conference.
""That is the sensible thing to do.""
European Council President, Charles Michel, wrote on Twitter that he welcomed ""the support of @BorisJohnson to work together on a pandemic treaty in order to improve global preparedness, resilience and recovery."" 
As part of Britain's presidency of the Group of Seven (G7) rich nations, Johnson wants to lead efforts on a global approach to pandemics, including an early warning system. But a weekend statement ahead of a call of G7 leaders on Friday did not go into detail about any treaty on transparency. 
The COVID-19 outbreak, which was first detected in China in late 2019, has killed 2.4 million people, tipped the global economy into its worst peacetime slump since the Great Depression and upended normal life for billions of people.
Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday he shared U.S. concerns about the level of access given to a World Health Organization COVID-19 fact-finding mission to China, while Johnson has said he supports U.S. President Joe Biden in the need for more data from the investigation.
Asked by Reuters who he held responsible for any lack of transparency on the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson said: ""I think it's fairly obvious that most of the evidence seems to point to the disease having originated in Wuhan.""

""Therefore I think we all need to see as much as we possibly can about how that might have happened, the zoonotic questions that people are asking. I think we need as much data as possible,"" he said.

Five opposition parties submitted the no-confidence motion last week saying the government was inefficient in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic and being undemocratic, including by jeopardising media freedom.

LONDON (Reuters) - Zari Tadayon, who flew into Britain on Monday from Dubai, will have to spend her 69th birthday alone in a Radisson Blu hotel room in COVID-19 quarantine.
Tadayon, who hails from Greece but has pre-settled status and her family in Britain, flew to Dubai on Jan. 22 to deal with some legal matters before Britain brought in its hotel quarantine policy for certain countries including the United Arab Emirates.
Those wishing to return to Britain from a list of high-risk countries have to pay 1,750 pounds ($2,400) for a 10-day quarantine in a hotel.
""It's disappointing - it's quite disappointing,"" Tadayon told Reuters from the Radisson Blu at Heathrow. ""I'm not sure if I am allowed out - nobody explained anything to me.""
She will celebrate her birthday on Tuesday alone in her room. 
""I can't even see my children on my birthday,"" Tadayon said.
""The cost is quite high - I wasn't prepared for this forced expense. I could have given it to my children or celebrated my birthday nicely with my family for half of that amount or even a quarter of that amount.""
Tadayon said she had to wait for several hours on entry into the country because of teething problems with the quarantine policy.
""The officers at the immigration were not very sort of up-to-date about what they should be doing - we just waited and waited for a hotel,"" she said.
She spoke to Reuters while eating a spinach salad and some roast chicken with potatoes. She said that for medical reasons she would have preferred to isolate at home.
""I was in Dubai for three weeks - I needed to attend to some legal matters which were very important. I was not there for a beach holiday.""

Asked what she would do for 10 days, she said: ""I don't know. I don't have any books with me as I was not prepared. Maybe watch TV and chat with friends and family online. What else can you do?""

The White House on Friday denied that Biden was snubbing Netanyahu by failing to include him so far in an early round of phone calls to foreign leaders since taking office on Jan. 20.
Netanyahu dismissed any notion that Biden was intentionally excluding him, telling Israel's Channel 12 television channel: ""He'll call ... We have had very strong friendly relations for nearly 40 years, dating from the time I came to Washington as an Israeli diplomatic representative and he was a young senator from Delaware.""
There has been speculation that the Democratic president could be signalling displeasure over Netanyahu's close ties with former President Donald Trump, who called the right-wing leader two days after his inauguration in 2017.
""We also have many things we agree on and the alliance is very strong,"" Netanyahu said. ""But there are also differences, on the issue of Iran and on the Palestinian issue as well.""
Netanyahu may find the alliance tested if Washington restores U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew, and opposes Israeli settlement building on occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood.

On Friday, the White House said Biden and Netanyahu would speak soon, but gave no date.

The incident, which occurred on Feb. 11 in the North West Region, one of the country's English-speaking regions where separatist insurgents have been battling government forces since 2017, is the latest in a series of atrocities and suspected rights abuse in the drawn-out conflict.
What began as peaceful protests over marginalisation in Cameroon's two English-speaking regions by the majority French-speaking government in 2016 has degenerated into a violent insurgency pitting separatist groups against Cameroon's army. 
Over 3,000 people have been killed in the conflict and nearly a million have been displaced, with both sides regularly accused of committing atrocities.
The ministry said the man in the video was suspected of helping separatist fighters. Reuters has not verified the video.
The video widely shared and decried on social media shows a shirtless man lying on the floor. A soldier steps on his back to keep him steady, then flogs him with the flat side of a machete, while another soldier wets the man's buttocks.
Another video sequence shows a soldier standing on the victim's ankles as he lies on the ground. The soldier then uses the flat end of the machete to beat the soles of the victim's feet as he screams, while another soldier slaps him. 
The video later shows the unresponsive man lying face down, head in a gutter. A soldier prods him with the muzzle of his rifle, while another soldier says off camera that they should hold off because they do not know if the victim is a separatist fighter.
""The concerned (soldiers) have been detained on the instructions of the defence minister,"" the statement said.

Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man whose May 25 arrest was captured on video, pleaded for his life and said he could not breathe as Derek Chauvin, a white officer, knelt on his neck. His death sparked protests against police brutality in the United States and abroad and renewed debate about racism.
The department issued a statement over the weekend acknowledging it was investigating an employee complaint about an image allegedly authored by a department employee, but said it had yet to find any postings. 
The image of Floyd with the caption ""You take my breath away"" in a ""valentine format"" was circulated among department members, chief Michel Moore confirmed to the Los Angeles Times on Saturday. 
Moore told the Times that the officer who made the complaint would be interviewed on Monday and that the department was working to determine how and where the image may have come into the workplace. 
""People will find my wrath"" if confirmation that officers were circulating the image is found, the chief told the Times. 
In a statement Crump, a civil rights lawyer, demanded accountability and an immediate apology to Floyd's family.
""The Floyd family is understandably outraged. This is beyond insult on top of injury – it’s injury on top of death. The type of callousness and cruelty within a person’s soul needed to do something like this evades comprehension – and is indicative of a much larger problem within the culture of the LAPD,"" he said.
The Los Angeles Police Department on Monday did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 

Chauvin’s trial is scheduled to begin on March 8 and the other three officers charged in the wake of Floyd's death will be tried in August, according to court papers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan will break their silence in their first interview since they quit Britain's royal family when they sit down with Oprah Winfrey next month.
Harry and Meghan, who announced they are expecting their second child on Sunday, shocked senior royals last year by announcing plans to step back from their royal roles. 
CBS said the interview will be broadcast on March 7. 
""Winfrey will speak with Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, in a wide-ranging interview, covering everything from stepping into life as a Royal, marriage, motherhood, philanthropic work to how she is handling life under intense public pressure,"" CBS said in a statement. 
""Later, the two are joined by Prince Harry as they speak about their move to the United States and their future hopes and dreams for their expanding family.""
Harry and Meghan married in a glittering ceremony in 2018 that captured the world’s attention but later gave up their official royal roles following disagreements with other family members and in the face of huge media attention.
The couple moved to Southern California with their infant son Archie last year and have signed a multiyear production deal with Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), a major step in their plan to make a living for themselves outside the royal family.
Their relationship with the British press swiftly soured and the couple have launched legal cases against several newspapers.
Last week, Meghan won a privacy claim against Associated Newspapers after its Mail on Sunday paper had printed extracts of a letter she wrote to her father in August 2018.
Winfrey, one of America’s richest and most influential women, in 2011 ended her top-rated daily television talk show, where she interviewed presidents and celebrities.
Buckingham Palace declined to comment. 

A royal source said that as Harry and Meghan are no longer working members of the royal family, any decisions they take with regard to media commitments are up to them. They are under no obligation to inform the royal household of such plans, the source said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and the United States are in talks on a possible prisoner swap that could secure the release of Paul Whelan, a former U.S. marine jailed for spying, within two to three months, his lawyer told Reuters on Monday. 
Russia convicted Whelan, who holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports, of spying last June and sentenced him to 16 years in jail. He denied spying and said he was set up in a sting operation. Washington demanded his release.
Moscow said that Whelan had been caught red-handed with classified information in a Moscow hotel room where agents from the Federal Security Service detained him on Dec. 28, 2018.
Whelan's Russian lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said that talks on an exchange were now taking place between Russian and U.S. security services. 
""I speak with the siloviks (Russia's security services). They say that negotiations are under way. The question with an exchange will be resolved,"" he said. 
""As far as I understand some kind of initiative has appeared, I think the American side has begun initiating talks...specifically under Biden,"" he said. 
Zherebenkov has said in the past that he believed Moscow wanted an exchange deal that could include Whelan. It has not been previously reported that talks with U.S. President Joe Biden's administration were happening. 
""According to my information, negotiations are underway and the question of a handover will be resolved in the coming two to three months,"" he added. 
The U.S. Embassy did not reply to a request for comment. 
Zherebenkov said he was not in a position to say if the talks were broaching the case of Trevor Reed, another former U.S. marine who was jailed by Russia for nine years in July for endangering the lives of two Moscow policemen.
Washington has protested both Whelan and Reed's (NASDAQ:REED) cases, describing the latter's trial as ""theater of the absurd"" and lacking serious evidence. 
Russia's Foreign Ministry said on Jan. 27 that Reed and Whelan were wrongly presented in the West as innocent victims and had been convicted of crimes in Russia. It said talk of their exchange was being used to exert pressure on Moscow. 
Zherebenkov said there were various views in Moscow as to which Russians held in custody by the United States could be exchanged for Whelan. 

He named arms dealer Viktor Bout and Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was convicted of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine. Russia has long sought their release. He also suggested unnamed Russian entrepreneurs and people he described as computer programmers.

WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration will use a NATO defense gathering this week to begin what is expected to be a years-long effort to rebuild trust with European allies shaken by Donald Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy.
U.S. officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity ahead of the event, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would emphasize U.S. commitment and appreciation for the trans-Atlantic alliance after Trump's open hostility.
The NATO defense ministers' meeting, to be held virtually on Feb. 17-18 https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/events_181298.htm?selectedLocale=en, is the first major European event since Biden's swearing-in on Jan. 20. Biden will deliver remarks at a virtual gathering of the Munich security forum https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-usa-security/plans-afoot-for-biden-to-join-virtual-munich-security-conference-source-idUSKBN2AB1FU?il=0 on Feb. 19.
After years of Trump's public ridiculing of NATO allies such as Germany who failed to reach defense spending targets, Biden's Pentagon will, without abandoning those targets, focus on progress made toward bolstering NATO's collective defense, officials said. 
""Trust is something that can't be built overnight, is something that takes time. It takes more than words. It takes action,"" said a U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's objectives for the NATO meeting.
To underscore Biden's views on NATO, the White House even took the rare step of releasing a video https://youtu.be/o9E1S3UPRFY on Jan. 27 of the U.S. president's first conversation with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in which he used the word ""sacred"" to describe the U.S. commitment to collective defense.
Still, Biden could face an uphill battle in Europe, which saw Washington upend its commitments under Trump, including pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord.
Trump's portrayal of NATO as an organization in crisis, dragged down by laggard members, has left many European allies feeling worn down. 
""There’s an exhaustion in European security circles from Trump and his unpredictability,” said a European NATO diplomat. 
""We’ve just spent four years not talking to each other and the world is very different from four years ago. Biden needs to do a big repair job in Europe.""
Portugal’s Defence Minister Joao Gomes Cravinho, underscoring wariness about the United States, told the European Parliament on Jan. 28 that the Trump years were an “ideological experiment” that had “devastating effects in terms of the credibility of the United States and its strength internationally.""
The deadly Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol in which pro-Trump followers tried to keep him in power, has also done severe damage to America's global image as a beacon of democracy, political analysts said.
RELIABLE ALLY?
One of Biden's biggest challenges will be convincing allies there won't be a return to another Trump era, or something akin to it, perhaps four or eight years down the line.
""That's a legitimate fear and a legitimate concern,"" said Rachel Rizzo, an adjunct fellow at the Center for a New American Security focusing on European security and NATO. 
She added it will be a ""slow process"" to prove the United States can be a reliable ally.
French President Emmanuel Macron has gone so far as to say Europe needs its own sovereign defense strategy, independent of the United States https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-france-macron/macron-europe-needs-its-own-sovereignty-in-defence-even-with-new-u-s-government-idUSKBN27V0RN. Still, eastern European allies such as Poland – fearful of Russia - say European defense plans should only complement NATO, not replace it. 
The NATO defense ministerial is expected to broach a range of issues, including efforts to end the two-decade-old war in Afghanistan. 
The ministerial is also expected to include discussion of the so-called ""2 percent target"" which requires NATO members spend 2 percent of gross domestic product on defense by 2024. 
Germany, Italy and Spain will all miss the 2024 target, according to initial projections released by NATO in October. Germany has pledged to reach the NATO spending target by 2031, and its failure angered Trump, who ordered a pullout of some 12,000 troops from Germany, declaring: ""We don’t want to be the suckers any more.""
Asked about the target, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) said he expected Austin to emphasize that many allies were meeting the target and others were ""striving to get there.""
""I think you'll see a supportive message from the secretary about how relevant NATO is,"" said Kirby, a retired Navy admiral.
Another U.S. official said that even with economic stress on budgets because of COVID-19, the expectation was still for allies to hit 2 percent of their GDP, with Washington likely to make the argument that the health crisis should not be allowed to turn into a security crisis.
""But you'll hear a substantially different tone and a lot more emphasis on different capabilities,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

""It won't be instrumentalized as a political weapon to beat up allies.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday it will block snap inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog from next week if other parties to the 2015 nuclear deal do not uphold their obligations, a challenge to U.S. President Joe Biden's hope of reviving the accord.
""If others do not fulfil their obligations by Feb. 21, the government is obliged to suspend the voluntary implementation of the Additional Protocol,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said.
""It does not mean ending all inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog...All these steps are reversible if the other party changes its path and honours its obligations,"" he said, alluding to the United States.
Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency wrote on Twitter on Monday that Tehran has informed U.N. watchdog about its plan next week to end sweeping inspection powers given to the agency under the nuclear pact.
Under legislation enacted by hardline Iranian lawmakers last year, the government is obliged on Feb. 21 to limit IAEA inspections to declared nuclear sites only, revoking its short-notice access to any location seen as relevant for information-gathering, if other parties did not fully comply with the deal. 
The Biden administration aims to return the United States to the deal, which his predecessor Donald Trump abandoned in 2018. Under the deal, Iran agreed to curbs on its uranium enrichment programme in return for the lifting of sanctions.
After Trump quit and reimposed sanctions, Iran began violating some of the deal's limits on sensitive uranium enrichment. Washington and Tehran now disagree over how best to restore the accord, with both sides demanding the other side act first to return to compliance.
Despite Iran's public hard line that Washington must take the first step, however, several Iranian officials told Reuters last week that the mounting economic pain of U.S. sanctions may push Tehran to show flexibility on terms for restoring the nuclear deal. 
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said last week Doha was in consultations to help salvage the deal, and Iranian state media said he would meet Iran's president and foreign minister in Tehran on Monday.
""We welcome efforts by friendly countries like Qatar ... There have been consultations between Tehran and Doha at various levels,"" Khatibzadeh said.
Iran has long denied striving to develop nuclear weapons through uranium enrichment, though its intelligence minister said last week persistent Western pressure could push Tehran to fight back like a “cornered cat” and seek nuclear weapons. 

But Khatibzadeh rejected this, citing a religious decree issued in the early 2000s by the Islamic Republic’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, banning the pursuit of nuclear arms.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian politicians and activists on Monday condemned the arrest of a 22-year-old climate campaigner accused of sedition for helping edit an online document that Sweden's Greta Thunberg had promoted in support of farmers protesting in the country. 
Thunberg had shared a ""toolkit"" or an action plan on Twitter which listed ways to help Indian farmers, who have been protesting agricultural reforms https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-farms-protests-idUSKBN2A30QI they fear will ruin their livelihoods. 
Over the weekend, police brought Disha Ravi, a leader of the Indian arm of Thunberg's climate crisis-related Fridays for Future movement, to the capital from her home in the southern city of Bengaluru to question her. Thunberg said she had no comment on the detention of Ravi. 
Police said the arrest was part of an investigation into how a group of farmers stormed the historic Red Fort on the occasion of India's republic day last month. 
""The main aim of the 'toolkit' was to create misinformation and disaffection against the lawfully enacted government,"" Delhi police official Prem Nath told reporters.
Police have registered a case of sedition and criminal conspiracy. The colonial-era sedition law carries a penalty of life sentence. 
""The toolkit sought to artificially amplify fake news through various tweets which they have created in the form of a tweet bank. And they sought the public to participate in the action on Jan 26 that was the Republic Day of India,"" Nath said.
The crackdown comes as Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government faces allegations it is suppressing dissent. The government denies the charge and says people are free to protest if it is done peacefully. 
Thousands of farmers overwhelmed police and reached the Red Fort complex in the old quarter of Delhi last month after tearing down barricades and driving tractors through roadblocks.
Police said they were also looking to detain two associates of Ravi in a widening probe.
FEAR
Ravi could not be reached while in custody and her family was not immediately available for comment. Her tight circle of friends in Bengaluru said they were terrified over what she was going through and for themselves in case they will be dragged into the probe. 
Ravi worked for a vegan food company in the city and was enthusiastic about environmental issues, her friends said, speaking on condition that they be not identified. On social media, her posts relate to climate change, helping animals and her love of Harry Potter books. 
""The Indian state must be standing on very shaky foundations if Disha Ravi, a 22 year old student of Mount Carmel college and a climate activist, has become a threat to the nation,"" P.Chidambaram, a leader of the main opposition Congress opposition said. 
A group of people gathered in Bengaluru and held placards seeking her release. 
Activists have planned more protests across the country over the next few days and the hashtag #IndiabeingSilenced was trending on Twitter. 
On Sunday, a Delhi court ordered that Ravi be held in police custody for five days.
""This is their way of trying to scare away youngsters from raising their voice about anything. This sends a message to all young people out there that, you know, shut up and stay at home or this is what is going to happen to you,"" said Leo Saldanha, a member of the Environment Support Group in Bengaluru.

Bhavreen Kandhari, a member of Thunberg's movement in India, said the organisation was awaiting clarity from the police before making any statement.

The Turkish government said on Sunday that fighters from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) had executed police and military personnel who had mostly been seized in 2015 and 2016. The killings took place during a military operation.
The 718 people detained on Monday in 40 provinces across the country included provincial and district chairs from the pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), parliament's third-largest, the ministry said. 
Opposition parties have accused the government of moving too slowly to free the captives.
The political fallout could raise the stakes in what analysts say are efforts by President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party to create a rift between the HDP and other opposition parties that cooperated in municipal elections in 2019 to hand Erdogan defeats. 
Members of the HDP, the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) and the Iyi Party said the government had not acted even though they had previously raised the issue of the captured Turks in parliament. 
Omer Faruk Gergerlioglu, an HDP lawmaker, said negotiations had allowed for rescues in previous cases but the government had not considered such an option this time.
""There could have been a solution but this happened due to the government and the ruling party's general policies,"" he told Reuters. ""They are not considering a solution or peace right now, therefore they did not attempt such an option.""
Erdogan rejected the criticism and said on Monday that Ankara had worked very hard to rescue the captives. He said the latest cross-border operation into Iraq, launched Feb. 10, had this goal. 
Erdogan's government, sliding in some opinion polls, has accused the HDP of links to the PKK and repeatedly detained or arrested its members. It has critisised the CHP for working with the HDP. 
Erdogan's communications director said on Twitter on Sunday: ""PKK and HDP are one and the same"".
The HDP denies this and responded: ""Nobody can clean the blood and tears they are responsible for by attacking the HDP."" 
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, has been waging an insurgency in the mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
Turkey's recent fight against the PKK has increasingly focused on northern Iraq, where the group has its stronghold in the Qandil mountains.

""We see that there is still a need for the Taliban to do more when it comes to delivering on their commitments ... to make sure that they break all ties with international terrorists,"" Stoltenberg said.
Attacks in Afghanistan, including a bomb that killed the deputy governor of the capital Kabul in December, have prompted members of the U.S. Congress and international rights groups to call for a delay to the pullout agreed under former President Donald Trump.
NATO has 9,600 troops in Afghanistan, including 2,500 Americans, training and assisting Afghan forces.
Many fear that progress during two decades of foreign intervention in Afghanistan would quickly unravel, threatening gains in areas from women's rights to democracy. U.S. lawmakers have warned that withdrawing all troops could lead to civil war. 
This week's defence ministers' meeting, which will take place by video conference on Wednesday and Thursday, was initially set decide on whether to go ahead with a troop pullout. The administration of new U.S. President Joe Biden faces calls to seek a six-month delay.
Four senior NATO officials told Reuters on Jan. 31 international troops would stay beyond the May deadline, despite Taliban calls for a full withdrawal.

""Our common goal is clear: Afghanistan should never again serve as a haven for terrorists to attack our homelands,"" Stoltenberg said. ""While no ally wants to stay in Afghanistan longer than necessary. We will not leave before the time is right.""

350,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2021 10:57AM ET</span>","Hundreds in Serbia mourn medics, demand better COVID protection","BELGRADE (Reuters) - Hundreds of people held a minute's silence in front of Serbia's government building on Monday to pay their respects to doctors and nurses killed by COVID-19 and to demand more is done to protect health workers.
People placed white roses at the entrance to the building and lit candles.
Of the 4,245 people who have died in Serbia from COVID-19, around 2.5% or 105 were doctors, according to official figures. 
The Union of Doctors and Pharmacists, which organised the protest, says the death toll among doctors is higher than in other countries in the region. 
""For a small country such as Serbia, this is a huge number of people we have lost because of bad organisation,"" said Ferenci Tot, a respiratory diseases specialist, who was among the protest organisers.
In neighbouring Croatia only one doctor has died from COVID-19, in Albania 24 doctors have died and in Bosnia 23 doctors, according to local media reports.
Doctor Dejan Zujovic, a pulmonologist who has worked in COVID-19 red zones in Belgrade, said long working hours and poor protection equipment were the main reasons for such a high death rate among doctors.
""People do not go on holidays, they are exhausted and their immunity suffers,"" he said. 
Government officials have said they will investigate the deaths of medical workers but little has been done so far. 
The head of the government's Crisis Committee, Predrag Kon, drew public criticism when he said doctors and nurses became infected while having coffee rather than while working with patients.

To prevent further deaths, hours spent in COVID-19 red zones should be limited to six a day, with a one-month time limit on rotas, said Doctor Gorica Djokic, a secretary general of the Union of Doctors and Pharmacists.

Pablo Hasel had until last Friday to surrender and serve his nine-month sentence, which has caused an uproar across Spain and led the government to announce it would ease restrictions on free speech, even if not in his particular case.
""We are trying to raise awareness of what is happening ... This is a very serious attack on our freedoms, not just on me,"" Hasel, who is known for his radical leftist views, told Reuters.
Hasel's lyrics and tweets, which included references to banned guerrilla groups, compared a court to Nazis and called former king Juan Carlos a mafia boss, were found by a court to have encouraged violence and insulted the monarchy.
He and around 20 supporters used a chain with a padlock to shut the main entrance to one of the buildings of Lleida university in the region of Catalonia where they took refuge. Police have yet to show up.
""We don't know if they are coming in half an hour or a few days,"" he said, adding that he faced two years behind bars because he was not planning to pay the fine that was part of his sentence.
In a sign of support, local artist Cinta Vidal has painted graffiti in a town near Barcelona depicting a singing Hasel being painted over by former king Juan Carlos with a roll brush.

""It is not acceptable that an artist should go to prison for expressing his ideas,"" said Vidal, 38.

ROME (Reuters) - Allies of new Prime Minister Mario Draghi criticised on Monday one of his government's first moves - a decision to unexpectedly extend a shutdown of Italy's ski resorts just hours before the slopes had been due to re-open.
After a months-long closure due to the coronavirus pandemic, Italian ski operators were poised to re-start their ski lifts on Monday, only to see their hopes dashed on Sunday evening when the health ministry said it would maintain the lockdown.
Health experts said the decision was necessary because of the growing spread of the more contagious British variant of the virus. Tour operators and some of the biggest parties in Draghi's new unity government complained that the announcement had come far too late. 
""We need to communicate in a timely fashion...Let's change tack,"" said Matteo Salvini, whose rightist League party has quit opposition ranks to join Draghi's administration, which was only sworn into office on Saturday.
The centre-left Democratic Party (PD) was also unhappy. 
""We are not questioning the ongoing health emergency, but they can't just shut things down hours before their reopening,"" PD Senate leader Andrea Marcucci said in a statement.
Almost all ministers from the previous government have been replaced, but Health Minister Roberto Speranza has remained in place. He informed Draghi before announcing the ski decision, a political source said. 
Ski operators were stunned to hear the ban on recreational skiing had been pushed back until March 5 - close to the end of the traditional season.
""The timing of this move is completely absurd. We worked for two weeks, day and night, to guarantee a safe re-opening in line with the regulations,"" Michele Bertolini, head of the Ponte di Legno Alpine ski resort, told Reuters TV.
Most ski slopes are located in the northern regions, the worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Tour operators say they risk losing billions of euros as a result of the shutdown.
""We had bookings, staff, everything ready to restart. Guests who were already here,"" said Alessandro Guerini, head of the local hoteliers' association in Ponte di Legno.
Although the number of daily COVID-19 cases in Italy has fallen from a high of some 40,000 in mid-November to under 15,000 now, the infection rate is edging higher and several hundred people continue to die each day.
Italy's official death toll stands at 93,577 - the second highest in Europe after Britain and seventh highest worldwide.

353,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 15, 2021 10:25AM ET</span>",Former soccer executive on trial at ICC for Central African Republic violence,"By Stephanie van den Berg
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Two men accused of leading Christian-dominated militias in widespread attacks on Muslims in the Central African Republic (CAR) go on trial on Tuesday at the International Criminal Court.
Prosecutors say that Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona, a former top African football executive, was a senior leader and national coordinator of the so-called anti-Balaka militias in 2013 and 2014.
Ngaissona, 53, has been charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murder, rape, persecution and torture.
Co-accused Alfred Yekatom, 46, a former militia commander also known as ""Rambo"", faces similar charges to Ngaissona with additional counts for his alleged use of child soldiers. 
Both men have said they are innocent.
The Central African Republic has been mired in violence since a coalition of mostly northern and predominantly Muslim rebels known as Seleka, or “alliance” in the Sango language, seized power in March 2013. Their brutal rule gave rise to the opposing “anti-Balaka” Christian militias.
After initial criticism that its investigation into the CAR was one-sided, with only anti-Balaka leaders in the dock, the ICC in January announced it had detained alleged Seleka leader Mahamat Said Abdel Kain. 
The trial starts against a backdrop of fighting between the CAR army, backed by United Nations, Russian and Rwandan troops, and rebels from both militia groups who have now formed an alliance with the aim of seizing the capital and overturning a Dec. 27 vote in which President Faustin-Archange Touadera was declared the winner.
On Feb. 5, the CAR government extended a state of emergency for six months amid the continuing hostilities.
Ngaissona was detained in Dec. 2018 while in France on official business, his lawyer told judges at the time. A French court approved his extradition on Dec. 31.

Ngaissona was controversially elected in 2018 as top executive of the Confederation of African Football (CAF), the game's governing body in Africa, but is no longer listed as a member on the CAF website.

Ties between Russia and the West, already at post-Cold War lows, have come under renewed pressure over the fate of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, whose jailing and treatment by Moscow have raised the prospect of further sanctions on Russia. 
Last week Lavrov said Moscow would be ready to sever ties with the European Union if the bloc hit it with painful economic sanctions, a statement that Germany described as disconcerting and incomprehensible.
At talks with Finland's foreign minister on Monday, Lavrov laid the blame for the bad state of ties on Brussels. 
""Relations have been consistently torn apart by the European Union,"" Lavrov was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency. ""The carcass of these relations was consciously destroyed at the initiative of Brussels.""
Pressure for sanctions has grown since Russia infuriated European countries this month by expelling German, Polish and Swedish diplomats without informing the EU's foreign policy chief, who was in Moscow for a visit at the time. 
Lavrov on Monday said: ""The EU has consistently destroyed all mechanisms without exception.""
However, he said, this did not mean Russia would pull back from its relations with individual member states.

""Don't confuse Europe with the European Union. When it comes to Europe, we are not going anywhere,"" Lavrov said. ""We have many friends in Europe.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian universities are facing a financial crunch amid the COVID-19 crisis, as a drop in foreign enrollment and shuttered campuses dent the bottom line and the country's slow vaccine rollout weighs on the next school year.
Public universities have become increasingly dependent on foreign students, who pay far higher tuition than domestic students, to boost their profits. International enrollment jumped 45% over the last five years, advocacy group Universities Canada said, but it fell 2.1% this year amid coronavirus restrictions.
International students at Canadian universities https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-EDUCATION/STUDENTS/xlbvgdorqpq/chart.png
That decline, coupled with a sharp fall in revenues from campus services like conferences, dorms, food halls and parking, has hit the schools hard. Canada's slow vaccine campaign - it currently lags well behind global peers on inoculations - and the emergence of new variants, could extend the slump in enrollment and campus revenues into the next year school, experts warn.
""Overall, we are expecting universities to post consolidated deficits this year,"" said Michael Yake, a senior analyst with rating agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO).
It is still too soon to know the final impact of COVID-19 on the current year. The University of British Columbia, for example, is projecting a deficit of C$225 million ($177.2 million) this year compared with a C$60 million surplus budgeted pre-COVID-19. And the uncertainty will continue.
""We're not assuming the vaccine is going to be in place for the fall,"" Yake added. ""Even if in Canada the vaccines are available, that doesn't means it's going to be available for the international students.""
BIDEN EFFECT
While most of Canada's universities are well positioned to weather the COVID-19 storm, an unexpected move by Laurentian University in Ontario to file for creditor protection this month has sparked concerns. Experts says that while Laurentian's situation is unique, other schools also face cost pressures and some may be too reliant on foreign tuition. 
International students brought in almost C$4 billion in annual revenue for Canadian universities in 2017/18, the most recent data from Statistics Canada showed. On average, they pay five times the tuition of domestic students and account for nearly 40% of all tuition fees. 
Tuition at Canada's Top 5 universities https://graphics.reuters.com/CANADA-EDUCATION/TUITION/jbyvrdrewve/chart.png
At Canada's top three ranked universities, foreign students make up at least a quarter of the student body. Many stay in Canada after graduation and contribute to economic growth.
Canada did stave off a feared enrollment plunge this year, in part because the federal government made it easier for international students to get work permits after graduation, but the huge gains in foreign students of the previous five years are likely over.
Indeed a trend that saw many international students choose Canada over the United States in recent years could reverse as U.S. President Joe Biden's administration overhauls the U.S. immigration.
""Something that's benefited Canada for some time is the political environment in the U.S., as it drove more international students to Canada,"" said Travis Shaw, a senior analyst at rating agency DBRS Morningstar.
The change of administration ""probably means we've got more competition for those international students in the years ahead,"" he said. 
An increase in domestic students could offset some of the need for new foreign students, but their lower tuition fees will create a significant financial gap. Other cost-saving alternatives might include reducing course offerings and consolidating smaller schools.
And while international enrollment is expected to stabilize as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, the longer the pandemic drags on, the greater the risk that more international students will go elsewhere to study, particularly if competitor campuses are able to safely reopen before those in Canada.
""Most students want to come to Canada for the student experience. If a student experience does not seem viable over the term of the course, it is sure to be a deterrent,"" said Aditi Joshi, an analyst at DBRS Morningstar.

Washington filed a lawsuit earlier this month to seize the cargo, alleging that Iran sought to mask the origin of the oil by transferring it to several vessels before it ended up aboard the Liberian-flagged Achilleas tanker destined for China. 
Washington said the cargo contravened U.S. terrorism regulations.
""This shipment does not belong to the Iranian government. It belongs to the private sector,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told a weekly news conference. 
He did not elaborate on what he meant by the private sector.
The Achilleas last reported its position on Sunday as anchored within the Galveston Offshore Lightering Area, which is outside the U.S. Gulf port of Galveston, Refinitiv ship tracking data showed on Monday. 
A U.S. official said last week that Washington had sold more than a million barrels of Iranian fuel seized under its sanctions programme last year. 
Tensions have mounted between Washington and Tehran since 2018, when former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers and reimposed sanctions on the country. 
U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to revive the nuclear deal if Tehran returns to full compliance with the accord. 

""It is very unfortunate that such an act of piracy is happening under the new U.S. administration ... a solution should be found to stop such acts of piracy by anyone for any reason,"" the spokesman Khatibzadeh added.

The new restrictions along the normally open borders were prompted by alarm over outbreaks in the Czech Republic and Austria's Tyrol region of strains of the coronavirus that spread faster and cause more illness.
Germany installed frontier checks on Sunday, drawing protest from Austria and concerns about supply-chain disruptions that could damage the country's export-oriented manufacturing sector.
""We have a situation in which we had to take all the necessary steps to prevent the virus variants...spreading as quickly in Germany as they are doing unfortunately in neighbouring countries,"" Steffen Seibert, Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief spokesman, told a news conference.
""A return to normal is in the interest of everyone involved,"" he said. National borders within the European Union's Schengen zone are normally open to ease trade and travel within its single market.
Austria has said the border controls are ""disproportionate"" and ""unacceptable"" and invited the German ambassador to the foreign ministry in Vienna to discuss the situation.
German police at the Czech and Austrian frontiers have been allowing in only truck drivers, German citizens and cross-border commuters in possession of negative COVID-19 test certificates.
Czech broadcasters aired footage of long lines of trucks stretching several kilometres (miles) on three major highways to Germany, with drivers waiting two to two-and-a-half hours.
Many German manufacturers, especially carmakers, rely on parts produced in eastern Europe and there have been fears that strict controls could crimp production.
BMW, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Audi said on Monday that the new border regiment has not affected car output so far.
Germany has extended until March 7 a lockdown introduced in December that shut all shops and non-essential businesses. The measures have contributed to a drop in daily infections and eased pressure on intensive care units in hospitals.
But outbreaks in neighbouring countries, including France, of more contagious virus variants from Brazil and South Africa threaten to undo those gains.
Yet, as coronavirus vaccine roll-outs gather pace across Europe, business pressure to reopen economies is growing.
Germany's retail association HDE, which will on Tuesday hold emergency talks with the economy ministry, urged the government to lay out a clear plan that allow retailers to open.
Merkel said on Friday that once a 7-day coronavirus incidence of under 35 per 100,000 people is reached, further relaxations would be possible, allowing a gradual return to broadly normal conditions.

""Politicians must deliver what they have promised long ago: a plan based on fair and transparent criteria for an exit from lockdown,"" said HDE chief Stefan Genth.

Turkey said on Sunday militants from the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) executed the captives, including military and police personnel, amid a military operation against the group. 
The United States said it stood by Turkey and that it condemned the killings if it was confirmed that responsibility lay with the PKK.
The United States and European Union have designated the PKK a terrorist organisation, but in Syria U.S. forces have been fighting alongside Kurdish YPG fighters who Ankara considers to be inextricably linked to the PKK.
""Now there is a statement made by the United States. It's a joke. Were you not supposed to stand against the PKK, the YPG? You clearly support them and stand behind them,"" he told supporters of his AK Party in the Black Sea city of Rize.
Since Joe Biden was elected U.S. President last year, Turkey has repeatedly said it wants to improve strained ties with the United States, but U.S. support for the YPG has infuriated Ankara and remains a key disagreement between the allies.
Erdogan said that Ankara would continue its cross-border operations into Iraq against the PKK, which has waged a decades-old insurgency in the mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey, in which more than 40,000 people have been killed. 
""If we are together with you in NATO, if we are to continue our unity, then you will act sincerely towards us. Then, you will stand with us, not with the terrorists,"" Erdogan said.

He said nobody could criticise Turkey's cross-border operations in Syria or Iraq after the killings, and countries must choose between Turkey and the militants.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A former Russian newspaper journalist accused of treason says state investigators have still not told him exactly what his alleged crime was, over six months after his arrest. 
Ivan Safronov, 30, covered military affairs as a reporter before starting work at Russia's space agency last May. He was detained last July and is being held in prison, accused of passing military secrets to the Czech Republic.
Safronov, whose treatment has provoked an outcry among some Russian journalists, faces up to 20 years in jail. He denies treason. 
""They say I committed a crime in 2017, but they don't say exactly what I did - they tell me to remember,"" Safronov said in an interview published on Monday by Kommersant newspaper, where he used to work. 
""I spent three months trying to dig up something on myself, but I haven't remembered any crimes,"" he said in written responses to questions submitted by the daily. 
The Kremlin declined comment on Safronov's remarks. It said it was up to Russia's courts to review the case. 
Safronov, who said he cannot communicate with his close relatives as all of them have been made witnesses, suggested the accusations were linked to his acquaintance with a Czech journalist he met in Moscow in 2010. 
When the Czech left Russia at the end of a work assignment, he set up a pay-to-view information agency for other media outlets containing analysis and press digests, Safronov said. 
He said he was sent possible coverage topics and submitted texts from 2017-19 based on ""information from open sources."" 
""Investigators see the fact of my acquaintance with (the journalist) as recruitment, his messages as intelligence missions, and a state secret was somehow found in my answers,"" he said.

Safronov said he had no access to state secrets as a journalist and that investigators had told him ""the accusation is not linked to journalism work.""

Suu Kyi, detained since a Feb. 1 coup against her elected government, had been expected to face a court on Monday in connection with charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios, but a judge said her remand lasted until Wednesday, her lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, said.
The coup and arrest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi and others have sparked the biggest protests in Myanmar in more than a decade, with hundreds of thousands coming on to the streets to denounce the military's derailment of a tentative transition to democracy.
""This is a fight for our future, the future of our country,"" youth activist Esther Ze Naw said at a protest in the main city of Yangon. ""We don't want to live under a military dictatorship. We want to establish a real federal union where all citizens, all ethnicities are treated equally.""
The unrest has revived memories in the Southeast Asian nation of bloody outbreaks of opposition to almost half a century of direct army rule that had ended in 2011, when the military began a process of withdrawing from civilian politics.
Violence this time has been limited, although police have opened fire on several occasions to disperse protesters. One woman who was hit by police fire in the capital Naypyitaw last week is not expected to survive.
On Monday, security forces used rubber bullets and catapults in the city of Mandalay, wounding two people lightly, media and residents said.
The government and army could not be reached for comment.
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
As well as the demonstrations in towns and cities, the military is facing a strike by government workers, part of a civil disobedience movement that is crippling many functions of government. 
Armoured vehicles were deployed on Sunday in Yangon, the northern town of Myitkyina and Sittwe in the west, the first large-scale use of such vehicles since the coup.
More soldiers have also been spotted on the streets to help police who have been largely overseeing crowd control, including members of the 77th Light Infantry Division, a mobile force accused of brutality in campaigns against ethnic minority insurgents and protests in the past.
Crowds were smaller, though it was unclear if people were intimidated by the soldiers or fatigue was setting in after 12 days of demonstrations.
""We can't join the protests every day,"" said a laid-off travel officer worker in Yangon who declined to be identified. ""But we won't back down.""
Earlier, more than a dozen police trucks with water cannon vehicles were deployed near the Sule Pagoda in Yangon, one of the city's main demonstration sites.
Protesters also gathered outside the central bank, where they held signs calling for support for the civil disobedience movement. An armoured vehicle and several trucks carrying soldiers were parked nearby.
Later, police sealed off the headquarters of Suu Kyi's party in Yangon shortly before protesters arrived and chanted slogans, a witness said.
'OUR LEADER'
Police in Naypyitaw detained about 20 school students protesting by a road. Images posted on social media by one of the students showed them chanting slogans as they were taken away in a police bus.
Protesters then gathered outside the police station where they were being held, media reported. They were later released.
Media earlier showed ranks of protesters marching in Naypyitaw with pictures of Suu Kyi with the message: ""we want our leader.""
Suu Kyi, 75, spent nearly 15 years under house arrest for her efforts to end military rule.
The army has been carrying out nightly arrests and has given itself search and detention powers. At least 400 people have been detained, the group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners said.
On Sunday, the military published penal code amendments aimed at stifling dissent and residents reported an internet outage after midnight on Sunday that lasted until about 9 a.m.
""It's as if the generals have declared war on the people,"" U.N. Special Rapporteur Tom Andrews said on Twitter.

Suu Kyi's party won a 2015 election and another on Nov. 8, but the military said the vote was fraudulent and used that complaint to justify the coup. The electoral commission has dismissed accusations of fraud.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel has cancelled its planned participation in a major defence expo in the United Arab Emirates next week due to COVID-19 curbs on air travel, Israeli officials said on Monday.
Dozens of Israeli defence firms had been due to take part in the  IDEX  (NYSE:IEX) conference in Abu Dhabi from Feb. 21-25 - a first for both countries, which last September established formal relations after closing ranks given their shared worries about Iran.
But officials from Israel's Defence Ministry and Regional Cooperation Ministry said the plan was cancelled. They cited Israel's Jan. 26 ban on international air travel, which is still in force as it tries to reverse a surge in COVID-19 contagion.
A Defence Ministry spokeswoman said it requested special permission for the firms to fly out to the UAE capital, but was refused by a Regional Cooperation Ministry authorisation panel. 
A Regional Cooperation Ministry spokesman said the request ""had to be denied, despite the desire to advance promote defence activity, and given the need to making unprejudiced decisions"".
The business newspaper Globes quoted an unidentified senior representative of an Israeli defence firm as saying that the cancellation would spell ""huge"" losses of deals to competitors.
""The Emirati hosts were supremely friendly and rolled out the red carpet. We were meant to have been the focus of the expo, with several top-of-the-line products and exhibits,"" the representative was quoted as saying. ""All that, for nothing?""
Israel and the UAE had, as part of their U.S.-backed rapprochement, proposed defence and military cooperation.

But anticipated exchanges of defence delegations have yet to happen - a byproduct, Israeli sources said, of coalition feuding between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Benny Gantz as they prepare to contest a March ballot.

Nigel Skea, 52, faces six months in prison for leaving his room three times on Sept. 21 last year, one of which was to meet Singaporean partner Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, who was not in quarantine but had booked a room in the same hotel. 
Eyamalai, 39, who married Skea in November, pleaded guilty to abetting him. Skea was also not wearing a mask, which is required in Singapore. 
The city-state requires most arrivals to undergo 14 days of quarantine at government-designated hotels.
Skea was twice ""loitering along the corridor"" and went to Eyamalai's room 13 floors higher by using a stairwell through an emergency exit door, which she had opened for him, according to the charges. 
""This is a classic tale of two lovers wanting to be together and trying to be as close as possible to each other, but breaching the law,"" the couple's lawyer S.S. Dhillon told the court. 
Sentencing is expected to take place on Feb. 26. Quarantine violations carry a penalty of a fine of up to S$10,000 ($7,565) or up to six months in jail, or both. 
Singapore has jailed and fined others for breaking COVID-19 rules, while some foreigners have also had their work permits revoked. 
It has largely brought the coronavirus under control, with less than a handful of new local cases a day, due to strict quarantining of arrivals, contact-tracing and social distancing.

KABUL (Reuters) - The United Nations on Monday denounced attacks on Afghan journalists and human rights activists at a time when dialogue was needed more than ever amid talks to try to end two decades of war.
The Afghan government and Taliban militants began peace talks in Doha last September, but negotiations have largely stalled. Washington is reviewing a deal that would have seen Western troops leave the country by May.
“The Afghan people need and deserve a flourishing civic space - a society where people can think, write and voice their views openly, without fear,” said Deborah Lyons, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan.
“The voices of human rights defenders and the media are critical for any open and decent society.""
Between Jan. 1, 2018, and Jan. 31, 2021, 65 human rights defenders and media professional were killed, the UN report said. Five human rights activists and six journalists were killed in the four months after the peace talks began.
Afghanistan is experiencing a new wave of ""intentional, premeditated and deliberate targeting of individuals with perpetrators remaining anonymous"", prompting professionals to quit their jobs and leave their homes, and journalists to exercise self-censorship.
Many of the attacks involve small improvised explosives called ""sticky bombs,"" which are typically attached to the underside of vehicles.
Few have ever been claimed by any warring party, although the government has said the Taliban are responsible. The group says it only targets government officials.
The Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, are seeking to topple the Western-backed government in Kabul and reimpose Islamic rule.
Islamic State militants also operate in Afghanistan, and government officials have said they have ties to the Taliban, another charge the Taliban denies.

Afghanistan's spy agency said it broke up two cells in the past week in Kabul that were jointly operating between Islamic State and the Taliban-linked Haqqani network. It said they were responsible for assassinations of officials and activists and rocket attacks in the capital.

Ozgur Gundem newspaper was among more than 130 media outlets the government closed during a state of emergency it declared following a failed military coup in July 2016, in a crackdown whose scale alarmed Ankara's Western allies and rights groups.
Some two dozen Ozgur Gundem staff were detained in 2016 as part of an investigation into their alleged links to Kurdish militants. 
At the time, a court closed the newspaper on grounds of spreading propaganda of the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the European Union as well as by Turkey.
Eren Keskin, a rights activist and the newspaper's co-editor-in-chief, along with two other Ozgur Gundem officials, were each sentenced to six years and three months in jail for membership of a terrorist organisation, lawyer Ozcan Kilic said.
Zana Bilir Kaya, the other co-editor-in-chief, was sentenced to two years and one month for spreading terrorism propaganda, he said.
Kilic also told Reuters he believed the verdict was political and harsher than in other similar cases, and that he would appeal it.
""The court gave a very harsh verdict. We thought it was related to the developments in the operation in northern Iraq. Courts are influenced by conflicts,"" he said.
Turkish officials said on Sunday that militants of the outlawed PKK had executed 13 kidnapped Turks, including military and police personnel, in a cave in northern Iraq amid a continuing military operation against the group.
Critics say Erdogan and his government have eroded the independence of courts and the media since 2016. Officials say the courts are autonomous and that the arrests are a response to serious security risks.
Ozgur Gundem had focused coverage on the PKK conflict in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast and long faced investigations, fines and arrests. 
The PKK took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Suspected Islamists killed three soldiers and 13 civilians and burnt down a church in a raid on a village in Democratic Republic of Congo's northeastern Ituri province, the army and a rights group said on Monday.
The attackers opened fire when they entered the village of Ndalya on Sunday morning, about 100 km (60 miles) south of the city of Bunia, said Christophe Munyanderu, coordinator of the group Convention for the Respect of Human Rights. 
An initial assessment showed that 13 civilians had been killed, Munyanderu said. The attackers also burned down a Catholic church, he said. 
""For the moment our troops are occupying the village after this attack which cost civilian lives,"" said army spokesman Jules Ngongo Tshikudi, adding that three soldiers and four assailants were killed when the army drove them back. 
It was not clear who carried out the attack, although Tshikudi blamed the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo since the 1990s. 
The group killed about 850 people last year, according to U.N. figures. 
Congo's eastern borderlands with Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi are home to more than 100 different militias, many remnants of its brutal civil wars that officially ended in 2003. 
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for several suspected ADF attacks in the past, but UN experts have not found any direct link between the two groups.

Zuma's lawyers confirmed in a letter to the inquiry that Zuma would not attend the inquiry this week, when he was due to give evidence.
""The summons issued for our client to appear on Feb 15-19 2021 is irregular,"" the letter said, justifying his no-show.
The inquiry led by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo is probing allegations of high-level graft during his nine years in power.
Zuma, a leading witness to the probe, denies wrongdoing but has not cooperated with the investigation.
Zuma was removed as president in 2018 over the accusations, which include that businessmen close to him used their position to plunder state resources and influence policy.
Zuma walked out of proceedings in November without permission, after which the inquiry approached the constitutional court to make him re-appear and give evidence.
Zondo said, ""It's difficult to understand why he (Zuma) would be scared of taking the witness stand and subjecting himself to questioning like everyone else.""
One of Zuma's lawyers did not respond to a message from Reuters seeking comment.
A lawyer for the inquiry said on Monday that Zuma had been implicated to date by the evidence of at least 40 witnesses.

""Whether Mr Zuma believes he has been accused of wrongdoing or not … his responses to those allegations are still directly relevant to the work of this commission,""the lawyer, Paul Pretorius, said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Monday launched a 58-nation initiative to stop countries from detaining foreign citizens for diplomatic leverage, a practice that Ottawa and Washington say China and others are using.
Foreign ministers signed a non-binding declaration to denounce what Canadian Foreign Minister Marc Garneau called unacceptable behavior.
""Taking people from their families and using them as bargaining chips is both illegal and immoral,"" he said by phone, calling the effort the first of its kind.
Other signatories include Japan, Britain, Australia and virtually all members of the 27-nation European Union.
The declaration does not target any nation. Garneau said it was designed to increase diplomatic pressure on countries that detain foreigners as well as others who might want to do so.
But a Canadian official said the initiative had been sparked by concern over arrests of foreigners by China, Iran, Russia and North Korea.
Even before the declaration was formally released, the Global Times, a Chinese state-backed newspaper, cited unnamed experts as saying the initiative was ""an aggressive and ill-considered attack designed to provoke China"".
Ottawa is locked in a dispute with Beijing, which detained two Canadians in 2018 after Vancouver police picked up a senior Huawei Technologies Co Ltd executive on a U.S. warrant. Canada denounces what it calls ""hostage diplomacy"" while China insists the two cases are not linked.
Among the signatories is the United States. Last week the State Department called for the release of the two Canadians and rejected China's ""use of coercion as a political tool"".
The Canadian official said the declaration could help put pressure on Beijing.
""We want to make them feel a little uncomfortable. We want them to know that a lot of countries think this practice is unacceptable and hopefully over time it does contribute to a change in behavior,"" said the official, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.
Last December the British parliament's foreign affairs committee called on the government to declare Iran's ""arbitrary detention of foreign nationals"" as hostage-taking. 
British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in 2016 and sentenced to five years after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran's clerical establishment.
The Canadian initiative was started last year by Francois-Philippe Champagne, Garneau's predecessor. Champagne, now innovation minister, said by working together nations could better focus attention on the detainees.
""Their liberty may have been stolen but their voices won't be silenced,"" he said by phone.

The oil producing region was hit hard last year as COVID-19 restrictions impacted non-oil economic sectors, and lower oil prices and crude output cuts weighed on its main income source. 
""We expect the proportion of foreigners in the region will continue to decline through 2023 relative to the national population, because of subdued non-oil sector growth and workforce nationalization policies,"" S&P said.
Gulf states rely heavily on foreign workers in sectors ranging from financial services to healthcare and construction, but efforts to nationalise the workforce to fight rising unemployment among nationals have accelerated in recent years.
The overall GCC population is unlikely to return to 2019 levels of 57.6 million people until 2023, S&P said.
""These changes could have repercussions for the regional economy and pose additional challenges to diversifying away from its heavy reliance on the hydrocarbon sector in the long run, if not met with economic and social reforms that foster human capital,"" it said.
S&P estimated the sharpest population decline last year occurred in Dubai, the Middle East business hub, where the impact of the pandemic on key employment sectors like aviation, tourism and retail led to an 8.4% population decline.
In Oman, where the government has in recent weeks intensified a long-standing policy, known as Omanisation, to create employment for its citizens, the expat population declined by about 12% last year, the agency said.
The region's largest economy, Saudi Arabia, saw its population shrink by 2.8% last year, and S&P estimates a growth of 0.8% by 2023.
The agency expects oil prices to remain at $50 per barrel this and next year, and to rise to $55 from 2023.
""As these levels are below the fiscal breakeven oil price for all GCC sovereigns except Qatar, we expect governments will moderate public investment spending, which is the main impetus of non-oil growth in the region,"" it said.

LISBON (Reuters) - The construction site outside Brazilian journalist Giuliana Miranda's suburban Lisbon apartment didn't bother her much - until remote working kicked in and the drilling noise drowned out her interviewees on Zoom. Soon, she moved house.
But luck was against her. Just before working from home became mandatory again last month, two of her eight neighbours in the new building began renovating their apartments. Two more have started since.
""The construction site had council permission to start at 7 a.m., and work Saturdays too. I moved because of the noise,"" she said by phone. ""But ... now, the new building has four people renovating their apartments too!""
A new line of legislation in a decree passed on Thursday extending Portugal's nationwide lockdown for another two weeks may finally bring peace and quiet to Miranda and others struggling to concentrate when neighbours are banging on walls and ripping up floors.
Under the decree, the government can impose limits to decibel levels within residential buildings during the working day, so as not to disturb remote workers. Currently, construction can take place 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays, with some projects receiving a licence to work weekends.
The government did not respond to a request for more details on its plans.
Hugo Fernandes, a 44-year-old musician who said he has suffered from the noise from renovation works in the building next door for more than two years, has high hopes.
""A new rule could change things. We've complained to the council before, to no avail, "" Fernandes said. ""It's unbearable and, as a musician working from home, it's just impossible.""
Still, loopholes in the legislation could leave those struggling with noise from construction work outside their building out of luck. The rule states that noise levels inside a building must be regulated - it doesn't specify if noise stemming from the street can be stopped. 
But for companies hired to do renovation work inside apartments, the legislation could pose a problem - particularly if it is open-ended, said Ricardo Gomes, head of the Portuguese Construction Company Association.

""There will be short-term damage to the sector, yes - but the real question is, how long would such rules last?"" Gomes said. ""COVID will end, but remote working won't. Like everything imposed in the state of emergency, these rules need to be limited.""

LONDON (Reuters) - London Zoo should be teeming with children released from school by half-term holidays. 
But instead, the monkeys' pranks are unobserved, King Cobra is coiled friendless in the reptile house and the future of the world's oldest scientific zoo is in peril.
As the menagerie in Regent's Park, central London, nurses a multi-million-pound hole in its budget and lockdown keeps visitors away, even during school holidays, the keepers are sad and anxious.
""Lockdown here has been really surreal - like with no visitors here, it's been a really sad time for the zoo,"" Kate Sanders, big cats team leader at the zoo, told Reuters. 
""We are losing so much money,"" said Sanders. ""I'm concerned the zoo might not survive.""
Opened in 1828 by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), London Zoo was visited by Charles Darwin while he was writing his ""Origin of Species"" and Queen Elizabeth II is its patron. 
Together with Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire, north of London, which is also owned by the ZSL, it has 22,949 animals. 
Feeding them costs around 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) a month and the latest lockdown will blow a 1.8 million pound hole in its budget on top of the 15 million pound loss last year.
""It just remains so sad that we are closed,"" ZSL London Zoo’s Chief Operating Officer Kathryn England said. ""We can't furlough animals and you can't furlough all of the staff who look after the animals.""
Lockdowns meant the zoo was closed for 18 weeks in 2020 - wiping out ticket sales. Adult tickets, including a voluntary contribution, at peak times cost 35.00 pounds and tickets for children cost 22.75.
""More importantly, we are here to inspire people about wildlife and as long as we are closed, we have to find very ingenious ways of doing that,"" she said. ""But nothing really beats having people in the zoo and having a great day out.""

""It's hard - it's really hard.""

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria's army said on Monday the country's air defences had intercepted ""Israeli aggression"" over the capital, Damascus, in the latest stepped-up bombing of Iranian targets inside the country over the last two months.
The Israeli military, which just began a surprise air force combat drill along the country's northern border, said ""it did not comment on foreign reports,"" according to a spokeswoman.
Syrian state media did not give details of what was hit by the Israeli air force. Israeli military planes flew over the Golan Heights to hit targets on the edge of the capital, an army statement said, without mentioning casualties but adding air defences downed most of the missiles. 
""Our air defences are continuing to repel the Israeli missile attacks over the skies of the capital,"" the Syrian army said in a statement.
A Syrian military defector said the bombing raids hit a major army division in the town of Kiswa, almost 14 km (8.7 miles) south of the capital, in a sprawling area where Iranian-backed militias have a dominant presence. 
Witnesses heard large explosions on the southern edge of Damascus, an area where Iranian-backed militias are entrenched, residents said. 
Israeli officials have acknowledged carrying out attacks inside Syria aimed at ending Tehran's entrenched military presence in Syria.
Military chief of staff Aviv Kochavi said at the end of last year that Israeli missile strikes had ""slowed down Iran's entrenchment in Syria,"" hitting more than 500 targets in 2020.
The army said on Monday that during the surprise drill, which will last until Wednesday, there would be an increase of air traffic throughout the country and that explosions could be heard in northern Israel.
It said the ""exercise simulates combat scenarios in the northern front, and will test all components in the (air force's) core missions, including maintaining aerial superiority, protecting the country's skies, as well as attacking and gathering intelligence.""
Western intelligence sources say Iran's military influence has expanded in Syria in recent years, prompting Israel to escalate its campaign to prevent its arch rival from establishing a major military foothold along its border. 
Iran's proxy militias, led by Lebanon's Hezbollah, now hold sway over vast areas in eastern, southern and northwestern Syria, as well as several suburbs around Damascus. They also control Lebanese-Syrian border areas.
Israel, which in the last two months staged some of its biggest strikes yet inside Syria, has concentrated on Al Bukamal, the Syrian city that controls the border checkpoint on the main Baghdad-Damascus highway.
The widening military campaign was part of a so-called ""campaign within wars"", which, according to Israeli generals and regional intelligence sources, have been tacitly approved by the United States. 

The operations that aim to prevent Tehran from changing the balance of power in Syria in its favour have gradually eroded Iran’s extensive military power without triggering a major increase in hostilities, regional intelligence sources say.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday marked the 13th anniversary of an official government apology to the country's indigenous population for their historic mistreatment. 
Morrison said past actions, including the removal of more than 100,000 Aboriginal children from their families and communities, had to be acknowledged.
""In acknowledging that fact, I repeat the words of my predecessor ... I am sorry,"" Morrison told Australia's parliament. 
Then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd led a landmark parliamentary apology in 2008 to members of the so-called Stolen Generations.
The government has in previous years marked the day with an annual update on its long-running Closing the Gap programme to improve the lives of the Indigenous population. 
Australia's 700,000 Indigenous people track near the bottom of its 26 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
After more than a decade of failing to meet targets such as improving life expectancy, education and health standards, the government last year overhauled the programme and put Indigenous leaders at the heart of decision making. The changes delayed the annual report, which is due for publication in July.

Just a day earlier, President Francisco Sagasti said he accepted the resignation of Health Minister Pilar Mazzetti due to a scandal over former President Martin Vizcarra having also received an early vaccination.
Vizcarra, who was ousted by Congress in November over corruption allegations, has said he did not jump the line to receive the vaccination, but rather that he got it as part of a trial. Local media questioned that explanation. 
Astete, who had held her post since November, said she was inoculated on Jan. 22 after receiving an offer from the Peruvian university Cayetano Heredia, in charge of the trials, to receive the Sinopharm Group Co (OTC:SHTDY) Ltd vaccine from a ""remnant lot"" of the tests. 
""I am aware of the serious mistake I made, which is why I decided not to receive the second dose,"" she said through Twitter. ""For the reasons stated, I have presented my letter of resignation to the president."" 
The government announced in early January an agreement with Sinopharm to purchase up to 38 million doses of the vaccine. 
The first batch of 300,000 vaccines arrived a week ago and the immunization program against COVID-19 began on Tuesday with the application of doses to healthcare workers who are the most exposed to the disease. Sagasti was one of the first to receive the Sinopharm vaccine as part of the campaign.
Some 43,491 people in Peru have died of COVID-19, according to official data. The country is facing a second wave of infections, with saturated hospitals and a shortage of medical equipment.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - Guinea declared a new Ebola outbreak on Sunday when tests came back positive for the virus after three people died and four fell ill in the southeast - the first resurgence of the disease there since the world's worst outbreak in 2013-2016.
The patients fell ill with diarrhoea, vomiting and bleeding after attending a burial in Goueke sub-prefecture. Those still alive have been isolated in treatment centres, the health ministry said.
""Faced with this situation and in accordance with international health regulations, the Guinean government declares an Ebola epidemic,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The person buried on Feb. 1 was a nurse at a local health centre and died after being transferred for treatment to Nzerekore, a city near the border with Liberia and Ivory Coast.
The 2013-2016 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa started in Nzerekore, the proximity of which to busy borders hampered efforts to contain the virus. It went on to kill at least 11,300 people, with the vast majority of cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.
Fighting Ebola again will place additional strain on health services in Guinea as they also battle the COVID-19 pandemic. Guinea, a country of about 12 million people, has so far recorded 14,895 coronavirus infections and 84 deaths. 
The Ebola virus causes severe vomiting and diarrhoea and is spread through contact with body fluids. It has a much higher death rate than COVID-19, but unlike the coronavirus it is not transmitted by asymptomatic carriers.
The ministry said health workers are trying to trace and isolate the contacts of the Ebola cases and will open a treatment centre in Goueke, which is less than an hour's drive from Nzerekore. 
The authorities have also asked the World Health Organization (WHO) for Ebola vaccines, it said. The new vaccines have greatly improved survival rates in recent years.
""It’s a huge concern to see the resurgence of Ebola in Guinea, a country that has already suffered so much from the disease,"" the WHO's Regional Director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, was quoted as saying in a statement.
Given how close the new outbreak is to the border, the WHO is working with health authorities in Liberia and Sierra Leone to beef up surveillance and testing capacities, the statement said.
The vaccines and improved treatments helped efforts to end the second-largest Ebola outbreak on record, which was declared over in Democratic Republic of Congo last June after nearly two years and more than 2,200 deaths.

But on Sunday, DRC reported a fourth new case of Ebola in North Kivu province, where a resurgence of the virus was announced on Feb. 7.

""We can confirm that Archie is going to be a big brother. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to be expecting their second child,"" the spokesperson said.
Archie was born in May 2019.
The Valentine's Day announcement was accompanied by a black and white photograph of a visibly pregnant Meghan lying on grass with one hand on her stomach and her head resting on the smiling prince's leg. The photo was taken by longtime friend and photographer Misan Harriman.
Queen Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip, Harry's father Prince Charles and the whole family were ""delighted"" and wished the couple well, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said.
Since ending their royal duties, Harry and Meghan have continued charity work and signed TV and other media deals, launching their debut podcast in December. 
Last year, Meghan revealed that she had a miscarriage in July, in an extraordinarily personal disclosure coming from a high-profile British royal.
The couple married in a glittering ceremony in 2018 that captured the world's attention but later gave up their official royal roles following disagreements with other family members and in the face of huge media attention.
Their relationship with the British press swiftly soured and the couple have launched legal cases against several newspapers.

Clashes between traders from the Yoruba and Hausa ethnic groups broke out on Saturday at Shasha market in Ibadan, the capital of Oyo, the state governor's spokesman said. Most Yoruba live in southwestern Nigeria, while the Hausa are concentrated in northern states. 
Tensions have increased in southwestern states in recent weeks amid claims by public figures that nomadic cattle herders from the mainly northern Fulani ethnic group are carrying out violent crimes, which the pastoralists have denied. Many of the herders have moved south in search of dwindling grazing land. 
Usman Yako, chair of the Hausa traders association at Shasha market, told Reuters by telephone at least 11 people from his ethnic group were killed in clashes at the market on Friday and Saturday that followed an argument between Yoruba and Hausa traders. 
President Muhammadu Buhari appealed on Twitter to religious and traditional leaders, as well as elected leaders, ""to join hands with the federal government to ensure that communities in their domain are not splintered along ethnic and other primordial lines"". 
""We will not allow any ethnic or religious groups to stoke up hatred and violence against other groups,"" he wrote. 
Oyo state police did not immediately respond to calls requesting comment. 
""The attacks, which led to the loss of lives and properties, must be investigated and perpetrators brought to justice,"" rights group Amnesty International said in a statement, referring to the violence at Shasha market.

Nigeria's security forces are already stretched by armed gangs of kidnappers in the northwest and an Islamist militant insurgency in the northeast.

New Zealand said on Sunday it was locking down its largest city after new cases emerged in the country, which has been credited with virtually eliminating the virus within its borders.
Australia’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, convened an urgent meeting late on Sunday and it was decided that all flights originating in New Zealand would be classified as ""Red Zone"" flights for an initial period of 72 hours from Monday.
""As a result of this, all people arriving on such flights originating within this three-day period will need to go into 14 days of supervised hotel quarantine,"" Australia's Department of Health said on its website.
The travel bubble was set up so that New Zealanders could get to Australia without needing to spend 14 days in a hotel, although quarantine was mandatory for people travelling in the other direction.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that genomic sequencing of the latest COVID-19 community cases showed they were the variant B1.1.7, the more transmissible variant first detected in the UK.
""We were absolutely right to make the decision to be extra cautious because we assumed it was going to be one of the more transmissible variants,"" Ardern said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live post on Monday.
The source of the new cases is still unknown as results do not link directly to any other positive cases detected in New Zealand to date. 
Ardern raised restrictions in Auckland to Level 3 through Wednesday, shutting public venues and prohibiting gatherings outside homes, except for weddings and funerals of up to 10 people. Schools will stay open for children of essential workers but others were asked to stay home.

The COVID-19 alert for the rest of the country was raised to Level 2, with all gatherings limited to 100 people, including at restaurants and cafes.

Menem died at 11:20 a.m. (1420 GMT) after several weeks in hospital for a urinary infection, heart problems and other health issues. 
His body will lie in state at the capitol building before being buried in an Islamic cemetery in provincial Buenos Aires. 
Menem won re-election after he privatized creaky state enterprises in a massive transformation of Argentine institutions in the early 1990s and the economy flourished.
But he left office under a cloud -- charged with corruption and conducting illegal arms deals in 1991 and 1995 with Croatia and Ecuador.
Ten years later, he was cleared of the arms smuggling charges, but Menem could never shake off the widely held suspicion that he had been involved in shady dealings even if he was never convicted.
The lawyer son of Syrian immigrants in La Rioja province, 750 miles (1,200 km) west of Buenos Aires, Menem became active in the Peronist party in the 1950s and 1960s and visited party founder Juan Peron in exile in Spain in 1964.
He served as La Rioja's governor from 1973-1976.
After a 1976 military coup Menem was arrested and imprisoned for five years, a time he dedicated to planning his bid for the presidency.
After his release he was re-elected governor two more times.
A charismatic speaker who favored stylish silk and linen suits, Menem saw himself as the successor of his political mentor, Peron, who died in 1974 after returning from exile.
While some Peronist leaders were trying to take the divided party down a sedate middle road, Menem revived the political boss, or caudillo, origins of the party, courting union leaders and rallying extreme factions from the left and the right to win the party's primaries in 1988.
DOLLAR PEG
Under Menem, Argentina finally emerged from the polarization of the 1976-1983 ""Dirty War"" dictatorship during which as many as 30,000 suspected dissidents were killed. He pardoned military chiefs and guerrilla leaders from both sides of the conflict.
He inherited an economy burdened by rampant inflation, and though he had run on a populist platform, he began selling off state companies and instituting free-market reforms that transformed the economy and drew praise from Washington and international lenders.
He also adopted the controversial one-to-one peg of the peso currency to the dollar.
His policies were praised while the economy grew robustly in the early 1990s, but he was later blamed for high unemployment, corruption and overspending that ate away the benefits his market-economy politics may have brought.
A year after becoming president he had a acrimonious separation from his wife, Zulema Yoma, who was unhappy with his rock-star lifestyle and devotion to fast cars, golf and glamour. Menem kicked her out of the presidential residence in front of television cameras.
His daughter, Zulemita, remained close to him after the split, serving as his first lady, although they later clashed over his second wife, Chilean former Miss Universe Cecilia Bolocco, who was 35 years younger than him.
That marriage ended in divorce in 2011, several years after he and Bolocco admitted they were separated. Chilean and Mexican media had published photos of her embracing another man.
OBSESSED WITH RETURN 
Menem wanted to run for a third term but courts ruled he could not, and economic and political chaos descended on Argentina soon after he left power.
His elected successor was toppled by street protests, and the next leader dropped Menem's currency peg as the country descended into a debt default and a deep 2001-2002 recession that drove millions into poverty.
Despite the arms dealing and corruption charges, most of which were eventually thrown out, Menem received the most votes in 2003's first round presidential elections.
He withdrew from the second round when polls showed he would lose to Nestor Kirchner, a rival Peronist faction's candidate, in a landslide.
In self-imposed exile in Bolocco's luxury apartment in Santiago, Chile, Menem received union leaders and plotted his return to power.
""With the last breath I take I will remain in politics,"" he told Reuters in a 2004 interview. 
He eventually returned to Argentina when judges dropped arrest orders against him and he was elected to the Senate for his home province in 2005 where he remained until his death. 
During his final years, he was investigated and charged over allegations he thwarted an investigation into the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center, Argentina's deadliest terrorist attack. The case made international headlines in 2015 after a prosecutor investigating the case was mysteriously found dead. 
In 2015, he failed to show up for a court date, though he responded to prosecutors' questions on the case in September 2016, mostly saying he did not know or did not remember the answers to their questions, Argentina's state-run news agency Telam reported. 

Menem had shelved his plans to run for president again in 2007, and he looked frail in the years before his death when his appearances in the Senate became increasingly rare.

""Ethiopia's trespass into Sudanese land is an unfortunate and unacceptable escalation, which could have dangerous repercussions on security and stability in the region,"" the Sudanese foreign ministry said in a statement.
Ethiopian foreign ministry official spokesman Dina Mufti and state minister of foreign affairs Redwan Hussein could not immediately be reached for comment and did not return messages.
The Ethiopian foreign ministry said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Saturday that ""Ambassador Dina called on the government of Sudan to stop plundering and displacing Ethiopian citizens that it has started as of November 6."" 
Dina said third party mediation was unneccesary once ""the Sudanese army evacuates the area that it has forcefully occupied,"" the Ethiopian foreign ministry Facebook post added. 
Ethiopia has also accused Sudan of crossing into its territory. 
Clashes erupted late last year between Sudanese and Ethiopian forces over Al-Fashqa, an area of fertile land settled by Ethiopian farmers that Sudan says lies on the Sudanese side of a border demarcated at the start of the 20th century.

Sudan said last month that an Ethiopian aircraft had crossed the border, an allegation that Ethiopia denies.

Rigoberto Lopez is charged with one count of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder, and two counts of second-degree attempted murder, the New York Police Department said on Twitter. 
The four unprovoked attacks apparently targeted homeless people and took place on the A train or at stations served by it beginning on Friday morning.
Local radio station 1010WINS, citing police sources, said Lopez was taken into custody late on Saturday wearing blood-soaked clothes and shoes. 
In the first attack, a 67-year-old man is recovering in the hospital after being stabbed by a masked assailant at the West 181st Street station in upper Manhattan, police said. 
Hours later, a man was found stabbed to death on an A train at Far Rockaway-Mott Avenue station in Queens. 
Soon afterward, a 44-year-old woman was discovered unconscious with stab wounds on an A train at the 207th Street station in Manhattan. She was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
The fourth person was a 43-year-old man who was stabbed early on Saturday, also at the West 181st Street station. After undergoing surgery, he was in a stable condition, police said. 

New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea told reporters on Saturday that 500 additional officers were being deployed to the city's transit system ""to make sure people feel safe.""

Support for front-runner and former soccer goalkeeper George Forsyth, of the conservative National Restoration party, fell six percentage points to 11%, according to the poll. His closest rival is former legislator and lawyer Yonhy Lescano of the Popular Action party, who advanced four notches to 10%.
The survey by polling firm Ipsos Peru and published in the newspaper El Comercio.
Right-wing presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori had 8% support in the survey. This is her third run for the presidency. She is the daughter of jailed former President Alberto Fujimori.
Left-leaning psychologist and anthropologist Veronika Mendoza has 8% support and retired military officer Daniel Urresti has 7%. Centrist economist Julio Guzmán fell three percentage points to 4%.
The survey, including 1,210 respondents between February 10 and 11, had a margin of error of 2.81 percentage points.
The election for leader of the world's second-largest copper producer is unpredictable, considering that eight weeks before the April 11 general elections, 32% of Peruvians say they will not support any candidate or do not know who to vote for.

A second round of voting will be held on June 6 between the top two vote getters if no one clinches more than 50% in April.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A fundraising event for Yemen's humanitarian crisis is expected to take place in early March, hosted virtually by Sweden and Switzerland, four aid sources told Reuters on Sunday.
A U.N.-backed push for international donors last June fell short of its $2.4 billion target, raising only $1.3 billion for what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian operation.
The nearly six-year war between a Saudi-led coalition and Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement, and the ensuing economic collapse, has left 80% of the population in need of help and pushed millions of Yemenis to the brink of famine. 
Pockets of famine-like conditions reappeared last year for the first time in two years as the COVID-19 pandemic, falling remittances and underfunding exacerbated the situation. 
The proposed date for the new donors conference is March 1, the four sources said, but the target amount and plans have yet to be finalised. Saudi Arabia co-hosted last year's fundraiser.
The United States' new special envoy to Yemen, Tim Lenderking, on Thursday spoke to the president of Yemen's internationally recognised government about a possible donors conference, President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's office said. 
The 2020 humanitarian response plan for Yemen received only $1.9 billion of the $3.4 billion required, the United Nations says. This underfunding led U.N. and other aid agencies to scale down or close various assistance programmes in Yemen.
U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock in January said that most of the shortfall last year was because Gulf donors gave much less, adding that the target for 2021 is likely to be similar to the $3.4 billion in 2020.
On Friday the U.N. said that nearly 2.3 million children under five could suffer from acute malnutrition in 2021, with 400,000 of those expected to suffer severe acute malnutrition, putting their lives at risk unless they receive urgent treatment.
U.N. officials are trying to forge a permanent ceasefire to revive stalled peace talks to end the conflict. 

The Houthi movement, which in late 2014 ousted Hadi's government from power in the capital, Sanaa, now holds northern Yemen.

Gulf states have long channelled funds into Lebanon's fragile economy, but they are alarmed by the rising influence of Hezbollah, a powerful group backed by their arch-rival, Iran, and so far appear loath to ease Beirut's worst financial crisis in decades.
""There is no way out of the crisis ... without a deep reconciliation with our Arab brothers and an end to using the country as a staging point for attacking Gulf countries and threatening their interests,"" Hariri said in a televised speech marking 16 years since the assassination of his father, ex-premier Rafik al-Hariri.
A U.N. backed tribunal in December convicted a Hezbollah member of conspiring to kill Rafik al-Hariri in a 2005 bombing. Hezbollah has denied any links to the attack. 
Saad al-Hariri, a former prime minister himself, was given the task of forming a government in October but is struggling so far to cobble together a cabinet to share power with all Lebanese parties, including Hezbollah.
After a meeting with President Michel Aoun on Friday, Hariri said there had been no progress on the formation of a government. 
Under a sectarian power-sharing system, Lebanon's president must be a Maronite Christian and the prime minister a Sunni Muslim. President Aoun is an ally of Hezbollah, listed as a terrorist group by the United States. 
On Sunday Hariri blamed Aoun for impeding progress, saying he had visited the president 16 times since his nomination as prime minister and proposed names to no avail. 
France has been spearheading efforts to rescue Lebanon from its worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
A new government is the first step on a French roadmap that envisages a cabinet that would take steps to tackle endemic corruption and implement reforms needed to trigger billions of dollars of international aid to fix the economy, which has been crushed by a mountain of debt.
""In all my communications there is a readiness and an enthusiasm to help Lebanon, to stop the collapse and rebuild Beirut,"" Hariri said. 

""But it is all waiting for the push of a button and that button is government formation.""

Poland allowed ski slopes to reopen from Friday for a two-week trial period, with cinemas, theatres and hotels also allowed to open at a maximum of 50% capacity.
Agata Manysiak was delighted to be back on the slopes in another Polish resort, Szczyrk.
""It's great, conditions are great. There is natural snow and it would be a shame not to take advantage of it,"" she said.
Many of the thousands who gathered in the centre of Zakopane were celebrating the second place finish of Pole Andrzej Stekala in a Ski Jumping World Cup event in the town.

Polish authorities have warned that tighter restrictions will be brought back if COVID-19 case numbers rise as a result of people disregarding social distancing rules.
Restaurants are still only allowed to serve take away food, and wearing masks is compulsory. 
While the disturbances were condemned by police and local authorities, the reopening of slopes and hotels was welcomed by businesses in Poland's mountain regions.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A truth and reconciliation commission could help Mexico come to terms with a legacy of African slavery, civil rights activist Martin Luther King III said during a visit to the Latin American country. 
King, the eldest son of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr, is visiting Mexico to join a government commemoration of Afro-Mexican liberation hero Vicente Guerrero, who as the nation's second president abolished most slavery in 1829, before the practice was ended in Britain and the United States. 
Guerrero died 190 years ago on Sunday.
Mexico has long overlooked the legacy of slavery and its impact on the country's Black people, who are mostly concentrated in poor coastal villages on the Pacific and Gulf coasts. 
King, 63, said both Mexico and the United States could consider South African-style reconciliation processes to fully acknowledge the past. 
""Before you can ever address a problem, you have to acknowledge that it exists,"" King said in an interview on Saturday. ""A truth and reconciliation commission gives people the opportunity to come and apologize for past conduct, so that you have a new slate.""
He said discussions about reparations for slavery should also flow from such a process.
Conversations about ""reparations in my judgment are certainly in order in places around the world, particularly where people have been enslaved,"" he said. ""I think the conversations must take place.""
Few truth commissions around the world have tackled the legacy of slavery and colonialism directly. 
However, a 2011 report from Mauritius' Truth and Justice Commission documented abuses suffered under slavery and indentured labor and recommended some land reparation.
African slavery in Mexico was at its height in the late 16th and early 17th centuries after Spain prohibited enslaving the indigenous population, with around 200,000 Africans brought to Mexico.
Growing awareness has led more people to self-identify as Afro-Mexican in recent years, with the 2020 census counting 2.5 million people, or 2% of the population, who self-identified as having African descent, up significantly from a count five years earlier. 

""Black Mexican communities ... must be included and must have a voice,"" King said. ""The goal is to make sure that nobody is invisible.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Supporters of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny plan to hold candle-lit gatherings in residential courtyards across Russia on Sunday despite warnings that they could be arrested. 
Navalny's allies have declared a moratorium on street rallies until the spring after police detained thousands of people in the past few weeks at protests against the opposition politician's arrest and imprisonment.
But they want Russians to show solidarity with Navalny by gathering outside their homes for 15 minutes on Valentine's Day evening, shining their mobile phone torches and arranging candles in the shape of a heart.
""(President Vladimir) Putin is fear. Navalny is love. That's why we will win,"" Leonid Volkov, one of Navalny's close allies, wrote on Twitter when calling on people to gather.
Navalny was arrested last month on his return from Germany following treatment for poisoning, in Siberia, with what many Western countries say was a nerve agent. He was jailed on Feb. 2 for violating parole on what he said were trumped-up charges. 
He blames Putin for the poisoning, and Western countries are considering new sanctions against Russia. The Kremlin denies any involvement and questions whether Navalny was poisoned. 
Volkov, who is based in Lithuania, is one of several Navalny allies now abroad or under house arrest in Russia. 
He urged people to flood social media with pictures of Sunday's gatherings - a new venture for the opposition that resembles political actions in neighbouring Belarus - using the hashtag #loveisstrongerthanfear in Russian.
HUMAN CHAIN
Another activist has called on women to form a human chain on a pedestrian street in Moscow on Sunday afternoon in support of Navalny's wife Yulia, who was reproted to have flown to Germany this week, and other women affected by the police crackdown against protesters.
More than 100 women, mostly in their twenties and thirties, turned up at the Arbat in central Moscow to form the chain, braving a bitter cold and wind and holding a white ribbon measuring more than a 100 metres long.
There were no arrests or clashes with the police. Another but smaller chain was formed in St Petersburg, Russia's second-biggest city. 
Russian law enforcement agencies on Thursday said that people taking part in unsanctioned rallies could face criminal charges.
Some rights groups accuse police of using disproportionate force against protesters in recent weeks. The Kremlin has denied repression by police and says the protests were illegal because they were not approved and risked spreading COVID-19.
Putin has blamed the pandemic for fuelling the protests and tried to downplay the role of Navalny. Speaking at a meeting of chief editors of mostly pro-government media last week, Putin refused to call Navalny by name, referring to him as ""the defendant"".
""This defendant is being used just as people's fatigue is emerging all over the world, including in our country,"" he said. ""Irritation has piled up, people have become disgruntled including by their living conditions, by the level of income.""
Navalny was in effect an outlet for anger at the authorities over the pandemic, he said. 

""Be it pandemic or not pandemic. Who is to blame? The authorities. But that's the fate of the authorities.""

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh is moving 3,000-4,000 more Rohingya Muslim refugees to a remote Bay of Bengal island over the next two days, two officials said on Sunday, despite concerns about the risk of storms and floods lashing the site.
Dhaka has relocated around 7,000 to Bhasan Char island since early December from border camps in neighbouring Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where more than a million refugees live in ramshackle huts perched on razed hillsides.
The Rohingya refugees will be moved to Bhasan Char by ships on Monday and Tuesday, Navy Commodore Rashed Sattar said from the island.
Bangladesh says the relocation is voluntary, but some of a first group to be moved spoke of being coerced. 
The government has dismissed safety concerns over the island, citing the building of flood defences as well as housing for 100,000 people, hospitals and cyclone centres.
It also says overcrowding in refugee camps fuels crime.
Once they arrive on Bhasan Char, the Rohingya, a minority group who fled violence, are not allowed to leave the island, which is several hours' journey from the southern port of Chittagong.
Bangladesh has drawn criticism for a reluctance to consult with the United Nations refugee agency and other aid bodies over the transfers. 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says the agency has not been allowed to evaluate the safety and sustainability of life on the island. 
""The process of moving the Rohingya will continue... they are going there happily for better life,"" Mohammad Shamsud Douza, the deputy Bangladesh government official in charge of refugees, said by phone from Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh.
""Our main priority is repatriating them to their homeland in a dignified and sustainable way,"" he said.
Bangladesh has called on Myanmar to move forward the stalled process of voluntary repatriation of Rohingya refugees, as international pressure mounts on the military leaders following a coup, which reduces the refugees' hopes of returning home. 

""I don't see any future for us,"" said 42-year-old refugee, who chose to move the island. ""The little hope we had of going back to our homeland was broken after the coup.""

Kampon Tansacha, president of the Nong Nooch Tropical Garden, said that due to strict screening protocols for visitors, people were feeling safer and have started to come back to visit the botanical park, which showcases recreations of landscaped gardens from around the world.
Thailand's tourism-reliant country has yet to lift a travel ban imposed last April to curb the outbreak, keeping most foreign investors away.

The move, which would echo measures taken in March and November 2020 when France went into national lockdowns, involves increasing the number of hospital beds available, delaying non- urgent surgery and mobilising all medical staff resources.
""This crisis organisation must be implemented in each region, regardless of the level of hospital stress and must be operational from Thursday Feb. 18,"" health authority DGS said in a memo cited by the newspaper.
The DGS was not immediately available for comment to Reuters.
France reported 21,231 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday, slightly up from 20,701 on Friday, taking the total cumulative number in France to 3,448,617, the sixth-highest in the world.
In contrast with some of its neighbours who are struggling to control more contagious variants, France has resisted resorting to a new lockdown, hoping a national curfew in place since Dec 15, first at 8 p.m. then at 6 p.m., will contain the pandemic.
Some scientists, however, believe President Emmanuel Macron took a gamble in deciding against a new lockdown despite the threat of highly contagious variants.
At the same time, France trails behind several other European countries, such as Britain, in rolling out vaccinations.
Health Minister Olivier Veran, who noted the variant first detected in Britain accounted for 25% of confirmed new infections in France, said on Thursday the government would decide in the coming weeks whether tougher restrictions were necessary at a national level.

Arnaud Fontanet, a member of the scientific council that advises the government on COVID-19 policy, told Europe 1 radio on Saturday he feared the variant first detected in Britain could account for the majority of the cases in March.

The sailors hugged relatives as they arrived before dawn at Istanbul Airport, where they were greeted by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and other officials, two days after news of their release in Nigeria emerged.
""We were in a forest. There were tough conditions. There were constantly armed men at our side,"" Mustafa Kaya, captain of the ship ""Mozart"" from which the crew were abducted, was cited as saying by the Demiroren news agency.
The Liberian-flagged container ship was headed to Cape Town from Lagos when it was attacked on Jan. 23, 160 km (100 miles) off Sao Tome island, maritime reports showed. One Azeri sailor was killed in what the crew described as a sophisticated and well-orchestrated attack.
""We didn't experience physical violence but they exerted psychological pressure during the negotiations. They said 'we will kill you if your company does not do what we want',"" Kaya said.
Kaya said that at the time of their abduction the crew had locked themselves in a secure room but that the pirates had forced their way in after a five-hour struggle.
""They were constantly opening fire, firing randomly inside. At that time one of our colleagues died. He was shot in the belly. We are very sad,"" he said.
The crew was finally taken by boat and released at a safe place specified by the company. Their release came two weeks after the attackers made contact to discuss a ransom.

After their release, Levent Karsan from Istanbul-based Boden Shipping had said that the sailors were all in good health and that it was not a political kidnapping, but solely aimed at getting a ransom, with talks handled by a team based in Hamburg.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalan voters headed to the polls on Sunday for an election that will test the strength of the Spanish region's pro-independence movement, but in an era dominated by the coronavirus crisis rather than separatist sentiment.
A steady trickle of mask-wearing voters turned up at polling stations that were replete with pandemic precautions: Temperatures taken on arrival, election workers in protective suits or visors, separate entrances and exits, hand gel on tap and floor markings to ensure social distancing. 
Whether the election is won by the separatist parties now in power in Catalonia or the Socialists who lead Spain's central government, it is unlikely to lead to any repeat of the chaotic, short-lived declaration of independence in late 2017.
But it will still be an important signal of the separatists' appeal and could affect the political trajectory of the pro-independence movement for years to come.
Opinion polls have pointed to a low physical turnout, with voters worried about the risk of contagion at polling stations. 
""I have some fear and concern but it is a civic duty and so I come to vote but I don't think it's appropriate during COVID to call these elections,"" said pensioner Jose Antonio Martinez, queuing to vote outside the Sant Antoni market in Barcelona. 
Close to 300,000 people have requested to vote by mail, a fraction of the 5.5 million potential voters but still a 350% rise from those who requested mail ballots in 2017.
Recent opinion polls have shown the Socialists - who oppose independence but favour dialogue - slightly ahead, although they would need support from other parties to form the first anti-independence regional government in nine years.
If separatists manage to retain control, a new independence declaration appears very unlikely, as the movement is divided between moderate and confrontational approaches and its top leaders are jailed or fled Spain after the 2017 events.
Polling stations began opening at 9 a.m. and Catalan authorities confirmed 100% of polling stations had opened without problem by around 11 a.m. 
""At this time there are very few people. I'm healthy and I don't live with anyone who is high risk,"" said Lali Olle, a 51-year-old psychologist who turned up in person to cast her ballot for centre-right separatist party Junts.""

People with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 will vote during a specific time slot later on Sunday.

To gain entry, these beneficiaries would have to present a ""Green Pass"", displayed on a Health Ministry app linked to their medical files. The app's rollout is due this week.
Nachman Ash, the national pandemic-response coordinator, said the reopening of hotel dining rooms, restaurants and cafes would happen ""around March 9"". 
""We want to open gradually, carefully so we don't have another breakout of another wave, and another lockdown,"" he told Ynet TV.
Israel began emerging from its third lockdown last Sunday.
On Monday, it signed an accord with Greece to ease travel restrictions there on Green Pass-bearing Israelis.
Hosting Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades on Sunday, his Israeli counterpart, Reuven Rivlin, said there were similar ""understandings"" on allowing the renewal of flights to Cyprus, which has reported that some 10% of its tourism was from Israel. 
No dates have been given for the implementation of the deals with Green and Cyprus. Israel has been closed to nearly all international air traffic as a COVID-19 precaution since Jan 26. 
The country is on course to fully inoculate 30% of its 9 million population with the two-dose regimen this month, a benchmark for a preliminary easing of curbs. It hopes for 50% coverage and a wider reopening next month.

The vaccine campaign is a centrepiece of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid to win a fifth term in a March 23 election.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Rescuers pulled out nine more bodies from the site of a flash flood in a Himalayan region of northern India on Sunday, a week after the disaster struck, bringing the death toll to 50 with more than 150 people still missing, officials said.
The flash flood in Uttarakhand state, triggered by what scientists said could have been a large avalanche of glacier ice, sent water, rocks and debris surging down the Dhauliganga river valley, destroying dams and bridges.
Rescuers are using heavy digging machinery in race to free dozens of dam construction workers trapped in an underground tunnel connected to a hydroelectric project being built by the government-owned National Thermal Power Corporation.
""We have not lost all hope yet. We hope to find more survivors,"" the top government official in the region, Swati Bhadoriya told Reuters. 
Authorities said 154 people were still missing.
Experts have cautioned there could be still be huge amounts of rock, debris, ice and water that could be dislodged, making rescue efforts risky. 
Uttarakhand is prone to flash floods and landslides. The disaster has prompted calls by environmental groups for a review of power projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains.
A team of scientists are investigating if a piece of a Himalayan glacier did fall into water and trigger the flood.

There are about 10,000 glaciers in the Indian Himalayas. Uttarakhand itself has up to 1,495 glaciers and many are receding due to the warming climate.

More than 4,000 took part in the protest, organisers said, streaming through the downtown shopping areas of Shibuya and Omotesando with posters saying ""Help us save Myanmar"" and ""Stop Crimes Against Humanity"". Tokyo police said they couldn't comment on how many people attended the event.
The march came as tens of thousands took to the streets of Myanmar on Sunday in a ninth straight day of protests. Several demonstrations have been held in Japan since the Feb. 1 coup, mainly by Myanmar residents of Japan.
While the detention of elected leader Suu Kyi is currently due to end on Monday, the coup has been denounced by Western countries, with the United States announcing some sanctions on the ruling generals. While other countries also considering measures, Japan and some other Asian nations are unlikely to cut ties given Myanmar's strategic importance in the region.
""It is very heart-rending,"" said Thant Zaw Htun, 45, originally from Yangon and now an employee at a recruitment agency, referring to the protests in Myanmar.
""I want to go back to Myanmar to join them but cannot because of the situation (travel ban due to the coronavirus pandemic). Instead, I join here today to do what I can do.""
While some carried portraits of Suu Kyi, others wore face masks and even earrings bearing Suu Kyi's image. Most remained silent rather than shout slogans as they marched in an effort to prevent spread of the coronavirus.
""As a Myanmar national, I absolutely cannot accept the military's coup in Myanmar,"" said Thwe Thwe Tun, 27, who works at a construction company. 

    ""I think all Myanmar people in Japan have the same opinion.""

399,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 14, 2021 04:01AM ET</span>",Tunisian police abuse allegations cloud democratic gains,"By Tarek Amara
TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisian police took Ahmed Gam from the shop where he worked, accused him of looting during recent protests, and beat him so badly during his detention last month that he lost a testicle, he said. 
Lying in bed in his parents' home in Bennane, near the coastal city of Monastir, Gam, 21, could not stand without help and cried as he described police beating and burning his genitals. 
His account was supported, in part, by a hospital report viewed by Reuters. 
Tunisia is widely seen as the sole relative success story of the 2011 ""Arab spring"" revolts for its democratic advances. It holds regular elections and has a press that criticises the state. 
But Gam's case is one of at least 100 in which, a Tunisian and international rights group says, security forces recently used violent abuse after people engaged in protest and dissent, freedoms won during the revolution 10 years ago. 
The protests, which began on Jan. 15, the day after the 10th anniversary of the revolution, have increasingly focused on abusive tactics by police. 
The Interior Ministry, which has oversight of the police, said it would not comment on ongoing cases, including Gam's, when asked by Reuters. But it denounced allegations against police as ""attacks aimed to undermine the credibility of its structures"" and said it sought a balance between upholding rights and enforcing the law.
""Some individual mistakes happen but ... we have maintained self restraint despite provocations,"" said Jamel Jarboui, spokesman for the national syndicate of security forces, a police union. 
A judge in Monastir is investigating Gam's complaint of torture. The family gave the judge the report from Sahloul Hospital in Sousse describing Gam's admission on Jan. 30 with ""testicular trauma"" and a decision to remove the testicle. 
The document, viewed by Reuters, is stamped by both the hospital and the Monastir Court of First Instance and dated Feb. 4. An official at the hospital, who asked to remain anonymous, confirmed Gam was hospitalised on Jan. 30 and his testicle removed. 
The judge could not be reached for comment but the state news agency TAP cited a court spokeswoman as saying he had opened an investigation for torture which caused the loss of an organ after seeing the doctor's document and hearing from the plaintiff. 
The judge has asked three people to appear before him on Monday in connection with the case, TAP reported. 
The recent unrest, which began on the day after the 10th anniversary of the revolution, started as clashes at night between police and youths in poor city districts before spreading to daylight protests.
While the protests initially targeted inequality, they later focused more on anger at police abuses, with demonstrators last week shouting: ""police everywhere, justice nowhere"".
TORTURE 
Gam denies having taken part in the protests as well as the accusations of looting. He said police seized him on Jan. 27 while he was at work and started hitting him in the face as soon as they put him in their vehicle. 
They took him to a detention centre in Monastir, tied his feet to the legs of a table ""like a chicken"" and then beat him in the groin with sticks, he said. 
""I told them I would die,"" he said. 
They then removed his clothes. ""One of them took a lighter and put it to each testicle,"" he said. The policeman stopped when a colleague told him to, Gam said. 
A group of seven police continued to torture him for more than an hour, he said. He was then held for two days without medical treatment. 
To end the assault, he said he told police he ""stole everything"", a confession he told Reuters was untrue. 
After two days police took him to hospital in the nearby city of Sousse, his testicle swollen and blackened. Doctors then removed it, he said. 
After his operation he was returned to custody and still faces prosecution for looting. However, the judge ordered his release while under investigation because of his medical condition, he said. 
Apart from viewing the medical records, Reuters was not able to independently corroborate his account.
ANGER
Monther Charni, head of the Tunisia Organisation Against Torture, said he knew of more than 100 cases of ill treatment in detention. Abuses also included beatings, rape threats, stripping detainees naked and fabricating charges, he said. 
Amnesty International North Africa director Amna Guellali also said the organisation had documented eight cases and believed police abuses during the recent unrest to be widespread. 
Mohammed Hdaya from Kasserine told Reuters by phone that police accused him of incitement against the security forces in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts in support of the protests. They arrested him, beat him, removed his clothes and photographed him, Hdaya said. He denies incitement and said the judge rejected the charges but police continued to harass him. 
""Is this a country of law?"" he said. 
Hamza Nassri Jeridi, a prominent activist and blogger, told Reuters he was detained on Jan. 17 after being accused of taking part in an illegal protest. He was held for three days in a crowded and dirty cell with no mattress or blanket. 
Water was only available from a dirty tap in the cell. Food was served during the day but because he was taken to court each morning and returned at night he was not fed for three days, he said.

As with the case of Gam, the Interior ministry said it would not comment on ongoing cases. Reuters was unable to independently corroborate Jeridi and Hdaya's accounts.

IWAKI, Japan (Reuters) - The stench of alcohol filled the small bar on Sunday as Aoi Hoshino swept up glass from whiskey bottles smashed in a strong earthquake the night before, one appearing to be an aftershock from a devastating quake that hit the Fukushima area in 2011.
The 7.3 magnitude quake struck shortly before midnight Saturday and cracked walls, shattered windows and set off a landslide in Fukushima, the area closest to the epicentre. More than 100 people were injured.
Hoshino, 46, swept broken glass from some 20 shattered whiskey bottles into a garbage bag in her bar on a back street in the city of Iwaki, roughly 200 km (120 miles) north of Tokyo and not far from the quake's epicentre. 
""We were hit by this coronavirus pandemic, and so we were looking forward to reopening our shops, and now this happens,"" she said, referring to a locally declared state of emergency that had closed her bar from January and was set to lift on Monday.
""It’s just one thing after another.""
The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said the quake was believed to be an aftershock from the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011 that set off a tsunami, killing nearly 20,000 people along a wide swath of northeastern Japan, and the Fukushima nuclear accident, the world's worst in 25 years. The agency warned of aftershocks for several days.
Hoshino said Saturday's quake brought back frightening memories.
""My body immediately reacted, and I couldn’t stop trembling. My legs were shaking too, but I couldn’t gauge whether it was safer to run out or stay in, so I ended up doing a weird little dance,"" she said with a chuckle.
At least 121 people were injured, NHK national television said, including several who suffered fractures, but there were no reported deaths.
The JMA predicted heavy rains in the quake-hit region on Monday, warning that earth may have been weakened by the quake, leaving it prone to landslides.
Train service to much of northern Japan was halted on Sunday. Repairs to East Japan Railway Co's Tohoku Shinkansen bullet train line could take around 10 days, national broadcaster NHK reported. 
BUILDINGS SHOOK IN TOKYO
The 11:08 p.m. (1408 GMT) quake shook buildings in the Japanese capital Tokyo, cutting power to hundreds of thousands of buildings across eastern and northeastern Japan. By morning, though, power was restored to virtually all. 
Several thousand households remained without water, forcing residents to line up with plastic jugs to receive water from trucks.
Though much of Iwaki appeared as usual, tiles had fallen from the front of at least one building, and the sound of broken glass being swept up echoed from several shops and restaurants.
On the wall of Noboru Endo's hair salon a hairline crack had opened, in the same place a wider one opened 10 years ago, but otherwise there was little damage.
Endo, 64, said Saturday's quake did not compare to the one a decade ago, which went on for several minutes and had weeks of frequent aftershocks.
""We’ve all pretty much gone back to life as usual, save a few areas that are still badly affected,"" he said of reconstruction efforts in the area.
There was no tsunami this time, and no reports of irregularities at any nuclear plants. NHK reported that about 160 millilitres (5 ounces) of water had leaked from a spent fuel pool at the Fukushima Dai-Ni reactor but that this presented no danger.
ANA Holdings said on Sunday that it was adding some extra routes and increasing the size of planes on other routes to northern Japan for Sunday and Monday.
Beermakers such as Asahi Group Holdings and Kirin Holdings, which have factories in Fukushima and Sendai, said they were assessing the impact on their facilities. Kirin said its Sendai plant sustained light damage and it was still checking the situation.
Carmakers Toyota and Nissan (OTC:NSANY), though, said none of their plants in the area were affected. 

Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas, and Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani lab will soon receive Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine for commercial sale, a company official said on Sunday, making Pakistan one of the first countries to market shots privately as it scrambles to secure supplies.
Despite concerns over fairness and higher prices, Islamabad agreed this week to allow the commercial import and sale of vaccines without price caps, in contrast to most countries, which are importing and administering vaccines through government channels.
""We are told the first shipment is expected within the next week,"" Chughtai Lab director Omar Chughtai told Reuters, adding it would be receiving several thousand doses. 
Pakistan's decision to allow private sales of vaccine without a price cap in a lower-income country of 220 million people faces criticism. 
Former health minister Zafar Mirza, while praising government efforts to procure and distribute free vaccine, said that avoiding a price cap for private sales ""will deepen inequality in society at a time when there is a need to have widespread coverage.""
The government launched a vaccination drive this month with 500,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine donated by longtime ally China. But aside from the donated Chinese doses, Islamabad has not completed any deals to buy vaccines.
PRICES WILL 'APPEAR INFLATED'
Sputnik V is one of four vaccines approved for emergency use in Pakistan, in addition to those by China's Sinopharm and CanSinoBio, and the AstraZeneca-Oxford University shot.
Chughtai Lab aims to import the others as well, but Sputnik V was the first to become available, Chughtai said.
Health Minister Faisal Sultan told Reuters in a message he was ""not directly aware"" of the deal. 
Chughtai declined to specify import costs or prices but said the price would ""appear inflated"" compared to what has been reported for Sputnik V globally, given the smaller volume it was planning to sell relative to global procurement. 
Sputnik V's developers have said the two-dose vaccine would be sold at $10 per dose.
""Internationally there is very high demand, and I would not be surprised if the price points are higher today,"" Chughtai said, adding that prices will come down over the next three to four months as more vaccine becomes available.
""The biggest challenge around the vaccines globally right now is allocation to specific countries,"" he said.
Chughtai said his Lahore-based pathology lab had turned down ""grey market"" offers from people in various countries who had ""extra vaccine"" not officially meant for re-export.
The lab is importing Sputnik V through Pakistani firm Ali Gohar Pharmaceuticals Pvt and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which is responsible for marketing the vaccine abroad.

Chughtai said he expected an official government decree in the next two days specifying rules on inoculations by the private sector, including on registration of recipients. The company expects to receive shipments every four to five days.

The identity of the 13 Turkish citizens was unclear and the minister, Hulusi Akar, said their kidnapping had not previously been announced for security reasons. 
Turkey launched a military operation against the PKK in northern Iraq's Gara region on Feb. 10 to secure its border and find citizens who had been kidnapped previously, Akar said in a statement released by his ministry on Sunday.
""In a search of a cave taken under control, the bodies of 13 of our abducted citizens were found. In a first inspection it was determined that 12 of our innocent and unarmed citizens were shot in the head and martyred and one shot in the shoulder and martyred,"" Akar said .
""According to initial information given by two terrorists captured alive, our citizens were martyred at the start of the operation by the terrorist responsible for the cave,"" he said at the operation's control centre near the Iraq border which he was visiting with military chiefs.
The PKK has not issued a statement on the incident.
Akar said 48 militants were killed in the operation and the region where they operated was taken under control, their ammunition stores and shelters destroyed. Three Turkish soldiers were killed and three were wounded in the operation, he said.
The operation began with air strikes and a ground operation was then launched by soldiers who landed in the area by helicopter, the ministry said. Turkey has carried out similar operations in northern Iraq in the past.
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, launched its armed insurgency in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey in 1984 and more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.
In the last couple of years Turkey's fight against the PKK has increasingly been focused in the mountains of northern Iraq, where the group has its stronghold around the Qandil mountains, along the Iranian border.

New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said the first attack happened on Friday morning when a 67-year-old man was stabbed by a masked assailant at the West 181st Street station in upper Manhattan. That victim is recovering in the hospital. 
Late on Friday, a man was found stabbed to death on the A train at Far Rockaway-Mott Avenue station in Queens, police said. Two hours later, a 44-year-old woman was discovered unconscious with stab wounds on an A train at the 207th Street station in Manhattan. She was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
In a fourth incident early Saturday, a 43-year-old man was stabbed back at the West 181st Street station. He underwent surgery and is in a stable condition, police said. 
Detectives said the attacks, all on the A train or at stations served by it, were unprovoked and that they are investigating whether they were all committed by the same person. 
Shea said the New York Police Department was immediately deploying 500 additional officers to the city's transit system in response. 
""Bottom line that the public should know is this: They can expect to see a very large footprint of uniformed officers,"" Shea told reporters at a news conference. ""Whether they go onto a train, whether they go onto a platform, and they'll be there as long as needed to make sure people feel safe."" 

In October 2019, New York police arrested a 24-year-old man accused of using a metal pipe to beat four fellow homeless people to death as they slept in the city's Chinatown district.

Opinion polls predict the Vetevendosje party will win between 45 percent and 55 percent of the vote among ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the 1.9 million population. While that would be nearly double its result in the election held in 2019, it may still need a partner to govern.
Albin Kurti, the leader of Vetevendosje who served as prime minister for five months last year, won votes on pledges to fight widespread corruption and on a stance that there should be no compromise in a dialogue with Serbia, which lost control over Kosovo in 1999 after NATO bombed its forces. 
""A dialogue with Serbia is not one of the first priorities,"" Kurti said in a televised address on Friday. ""I cannot listen to weeping and screaming in Belgrade about how Serbia lost Kosovo."" 
Serbia, backed by Russia, does not recognise Kosovo's independence, citing the need to protect the rights of its Serb minority. Negotiators from the European Union and U.S. have failed to secure a compromise to allow Kosovo to join international organisations such as the United Nations and NATO.
With one third of its workforce unemployed and a gross domestic product per capita of $4,300 Kosovo remains the poorest country in the Western Balkan region. 
""I expect to see a radical change in the health and education sector, those things that we need most and also in justice,"" Edin Pula, a 21-year old resident of Pristina, told Reuters.
Vetevendosje may have to join forces with either the now-ruling Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) or Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK).

Almost 2,400 polling stations will open at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) and will close at 7 p.m. (1800 GMT). The first official results are expected a few hours later.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive asked Hungary to ""take urgent action"" to let an opposition radio station continue broadcasting after it lost an appeal against the removal of its licence, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The EU this week expressed concern over media freedom in Hungary over the case of Klubradio, which has been broadcasting for 19 years and whose political and talk show guests often criticise government policies.
The Feb. 12 letter from the European Commission's head of communication networks unit, Roberto Viola, to Hungary's ambassador to the EU, Tibor Stelbaczky, read:
""I request you to ensure that the current use of this spectrum can continue in the interim period until final decisions on the rejection of the renewal request and on any new assignment become legally binding.""
""I would request the Hungarian authorities to take urgent action, pending the ongoing court proceedings and final decisions on the rights of use of spectrum, to ensure that... requirements of EU law are respected while avoiding irreparable damage to the current holder of the frequency.""
A spokeswoman for Hungary's EU embassy confirmed receipt of the letter and said it would be answered by the Hungarian authorities. 
The letter said Klubradio was facing ""imminent risk"" of being forced off air ""on the basis of highly questionable legal grounds."" 
Hungary's media authority refused to renew Klubradio's licence due to what it called a string of regulatory offences by the station. Klubradio lost an appeal against the removal of its licence on Tuesday, which means it would be able to operate online only from Sunday.
The Commission letter said Hungary, an ex-communist member of the EU, should respect the right to freedom of expression and to conduct business, as well as honouring the principle of proportionality. 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has long been criticised within the EU and by international rights groups for putting pressure on independent media, non-governmental organisations, courts and academics.
The bloc has launched a high-level case against Hungary over what it says are violations of the rule of law, and the European Parliament's main centre-right group suspended Orban's Fidesz party, citing democratic shortcomings.

Orban rejects the criticism and has refused to change tack.

The meeting of the leaders from the Group of Seven rich nations on Friday is the first since April last year, and will be Joe Biden's first major multilateral engagement as U.S. president, Downing Street said.
""The solutions to the challenges we face – from the colossal mission to get vaccines to every single country, to the fight to reverse the damage done to our ecosystems and lead a sustainable recovery from coronavirus – lie in the discussions we have with our friends and partners around the world,"" Johnson said.
Johnson will call for the G7 to work on a global approach to pandemics, such as designing an early warning system, which would bring to an end ""the nationalist and divisive politics that marred the initial response to coronavirus"", his office said.
The World Health Organization has warned that a ""me-first"" policy towards vaccines by rich nations could leave the poorest and most vulnerable at risk, while also allowing a situation in which the virus could continue to spread and mutate. 
Britain itself has been caught up in a row between the European Union and Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) over vaccine supplies, which almost led to the bloc imposing emergency measures to prevent exports of shots into the United Kingdom via Northern Ireland.
""Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) leaps in science have given us the vaccines we need to end this pandemic for good,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""Now world governments have a responsibility to work together to put those vaccines to the best possible use.""

In June, Johnson is due to host the first in-person summit of G7 leaders in nearly two years in a seaside village in Cornwall, southwestern England, which will focus on rebuilding from the pandemic and climate change, a top priority for Britain ahead of the COP26 conference it is due to host in November.

In a tweet, President Nicolas Maduro said medical and health personnel would be the first to receive the vaccine, ""given their exposure to COVID-19.""
The vaccines arrived at Caracas' international airport on a special flight from Moscow on Conviasa airlines, Venezuela's state carrier, according to Reuters witnesses and images shown by state television VTV.
""Here is the vaccine to serve the most vulnerable sectors with the highest priority, health personnel, for example; it is a vaccine that addresses the most grave cases of patients with morbidities,"" said Vice President Delcy Rodriguez.
""It is a vaccine that seeks to reduce community transmission,"" she added.
Maduro has previously said after healthcare workers, ""vulnerable sectors"" would be next in line, followed by teachers. 
For months Venezuela's government has said the South American country would receive 10 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine, although the vaccine's maker has not confirmed that figure.
In addition to Sputnik V, the Pan American Health Organization's chief of mission said last week that between 1.4 million and 2.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc vaccine had been reserved for Venezuela. At $10 per dose, those vaccines would cost between $140 million and $240 million.
Venezuelan government officials and opposition leaders have met to discuss buying coronavirus vaccines through the international COVAX program using cash frozen in the United States by economic sanctions, but no deal has been made. 
In a Thursday evening state television appearance, Maduro said the government was working on a $300 million deal with the Pan American Health Organization for vaccine supplies, but did not provide details. 
Authorities on Friday reported 132,259 coronavirus cases in the country and 1,267 deaths, but medical unions and opponents have said the figure is likely higher. 

The government has authorized a relaxation of the national quarantine for two weeks for the next Carnival (NYSE:CUK) holiday.

There has been speculation that the Democratic president could be signalling displeasure over the close ties Netanyahu forged with former President Donald Trump, who called Netanyahu two days after his inauguration in 2017.
""The prime minister is not worried about the timing of the conversation,"" Ambassador Gilad Erdan told N12's Meet The Press. He said Biden had urgent matters to contend with, such as the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout.
On Friday, the White House denied that Biden was intentionally snubbing Netanyahu by failing to include him so far in phone calls to foreign leaders since taking office on Jan. 20, saying the two leaders would speak soon.
Biden has already called numerous foreign leaders, including those from China, Mexico, Britain, India, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Russia. 
David Makovsky, a former U.S. Middle East negotiator at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said on Twitter that once Biden starts phoning Middle East leaders, Netanyahu would likely be first among them. 
While the right-wing Netanyahu was in lock-step with Trump over Middle East policy, he could be in for frostier relations with Biden, although Biden has long been regarded in Israel as a friend in Washington.

Netanyahu may find the alliance tested if Washington restores U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal that Trump withdrew from and opposes Israeli settlement building on occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood.

Namaki said Iran's three first deaths this week from the virus variant first found in Britain - including that of a 71-year-old woman with no history of travel - suggested that the virus was spreading and soon ""may be found in any city, village or family"". 
Namaki urged Iranians to avoid gatherings in order ""not to turn weddings into funerals"" during one of the traditionally most popular wedding months in the country.
Iran started a vaccination drive on Tuesday, two weeks after declaring there were no ""red"" cities left in the country. The inoculation focuses on hospital intensive care personnel as authorities await enough vaccines for the general population.
On Friday, Iran received 100,000 of the 2 million doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine it has ordered and state media said Moscow may increase the order to 5 million shots and allow Iran to produce the vaccine locally. Tehran also expects to receive more than 4 million doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s shot.
Iran plans to vaccinate 1.3 million people by March 20. 
Iran has recorded more than 1.5 million cases and 58,883 deaths, with the death toll of 74 on Saturday corresponding to an eight-month low, according to health ministry data.

Tehran began human trials of the first of its three domestic vaccine candidates in December.

IWAKI, Japan (Reuters) - A strong earthquake hit off the coast of eastern Japan on Saturday, injuring dozens of people and triggering widespread power outages, but there appeared to be no major damage and no tsunami warning was issued.
The earthquake had a 7.3 magnitude and its epicentre was off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of 60 km (36 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency said. It shook buildings for some time after it hit, shortly after 11:00 p.m. (1400 GMT). 
Houses and offices in the capital Tokyo, hundreds of kilometres away, also swayed and shook. No tsunami warning had been issued, the meteorological agency said.
At least two dozen people were injured, according to reports from the Kyodo news agency.
A Reuters cameraman on location in Fukushima said his 10th floor hotel room shook for some time. One man at the hotel was taken to hospital after falling and hitting his head on a door, the cameraman said.
Although injured, the man was still able to walk, the cameraman said. 
Television footage also showed broken glass from shop fronts.
Some 950,000 households were initially without power, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told a briefing carried on public broadcaster NHK. The blackouts appeared to be concentrated in northeast Japan, including Fukushima and neighbouring prefectures.
There were no irregularities at the Fukushima Daiichi and Daini nuclear power plants, or at the Kahiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, owner Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings said.
The utility also said there was no change in the radiation levels around its plants.
Kato said there were no irregularities at the Onagawa nuclear facility.
The quake hit off of Fukushima just weeks before the 10th anniversary of a quake on March 11, 2011 that devastated northeast Japan and triggered a massive tsunami leading to the world's worst nuclear crisis in a quarter of a century - one centred at the Daiichi facility.

Earthquakes are common in Japan, one of the world's most seismically active areas. Japan accounts for about 20% of the world's earthquakes of magnitude 6 or greater.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Beyond disappointing revelers, the cancellation of Brazil's annual Carnival (NYSE:CUK) celebrations amid a resurgence of COVID-19 also means that street vendors living on the margins will miss out on what for many is the biggest payday of the year.
Claudia Máximo Torres and her wife Daylane normally sell some 10,000 cans of beer to partygoers at Carnival time in São Paulo, where parties can stretch over several weeks, earning them a profit of more than 7,000 reais ($1,300).
""For Carnival, the numbers are extravagant,"" said 38-year-old Torres. ""Literally, we now have to throw all that out the window.""
The couple are among tens of thousands who work as street vendors, known as ""ambulantes"" in Portuguese for their wheeled coolers that allow them to circulate in the crowds, who will miss out on the annual boon.
""The ambulantes work with us every year and they are suffering a lot,"" said Jean Jereissati, chief executive of Brazilian beverage maker Ambev SA.
Ambev, which normally rolls out massive promotional campaigns at Carnival in cooperation with the vendors, is instead launching an aid program to help the sellers.
The company estimates some 20,000 people will use the program that will give out 255 reais worth of assistance to individual vendors in the form of food baskets and coupons.
While that aid of less than $50 may seem small, Torres compared it to the emergency payments from the government last year which at their peak came to just over $100 a month.
Torres said that while she had long ago ruled out a normal Carnival this year, she is pinning her hopes on one thing: ""The vaccine."" 
""Next year I hope to God that Carnival can happen again,"" she said.

Protesters threw paint at police and several small bangs were heard during a standoff near a city shrine after the demonstration had moved from Democracy Monument and the main leaders had called for it to disperse.
Activists said the red cloth on the monument represented the blood of fighters for democracy.
Police deputy spokesman Kissana Pattanacharoen said more than 20 police officers were injured in the clashes and seven or eight people were detained for questioning. He also said at least one firecracker exploded at the scene.
The demonstration was in reaction to this week's arrests of four leading protest figures under charges of insulting the monarchy in mass anti-government demonstrations last year.
The ""lese majeste"" law, contained in Article 112 of Thailand's criminal code, carries penalties of up to 15 years in prison.
Student activists say the law has been abused for decades to crush political opposition to a military-royalist establishment.
""We want Article 112 to be revoked plus the release of four of our leaders and other political prisoners convicted by this law,"" said protester Chutima Kaenpetch, 24.
The government led by former military junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha denies any abuse of the law, saying political opposition is allowed but breaking the law by insulting the king will be punished. 
Thailand is officially a constitutional monarchy, but the king is held in special esteem by conservative Thai culture that portrays him as the protector of the Buddhist religion and the nation.
The student movement that emerged last year smashed long-held taboos by openly criticising King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who they say has amassed too much personal power since taking the throne after the death of his father in 2016.

The Royal Palace has declined to directly comment on the protests, but Prayuth and government officials have said that criticism of the king is unlawful and inappropriate.

KABUL/HERAT, Afghanistan (Reuters) - A massive blaze engulfed a customs post in Afghanistan on Saturday after fuel trucks caught alight, injuring at least 60 people and prompting authorities across the nearby Iranian border to send fire engines and ambulances, officials said.
Scores of local residents battled to control the blaze in the border town of Islam Qala, which initial reports said had started after a gas tanker exploded. Officials said later that the cause was not immediately clear.
Waheed Qatali, governor of the western province of Herat, said Iranian authorities and NATO-led personnel in Afghanistan had been asked for urgent assistance to contain the fire, which damaged electricity infrastructure, leaving much of Herat's capital city without power.
Thick plumes of black smoke and flames rose high into the air around the scene, television pictures showed. 
Rescue workers and Afghan security forces moved hundreds of fuel and gas tankers from the area, while the international Resolute Support Mission was contacted with a request to provide aerial firefighting assistance, Qatali said.
A Western official monitoring the situation told Reuters at least 60 people had been injured so far. Afghan officials gave a lower casualty toll, but said that number could rise.
Across the Iranian border, regional emergency official Mohsen Nejat told state television Iran had sent 21 ambulances and 20 fire trucks to the scene.
More than 300 vehicles carrying gas, diesel and gasoline exploded, Hossein Akhundzadeh, a regional Iranian trade official, told Iran's semi-official news agency ISNA.
""It's not known whether the drivers were able to escape or not. The blaze has not been contained yet and exact information is not available,"" he said.
Wahid Tawhidi, a spokesman for power distribution company Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat, said 100 megawatt (MW) of electricity imported from Iran to Herat province had been disconnected because two pylons had burned down.
He said 60% of Herat, one of Afghanistan's largest provinces, was without power.
Younus Qazizada, the head of the Herat Chamber of Commerce and Industries, told Reuters the blaze had caused millions of dollars in damage.
""Preliminary investigations show that more than $50 million of damage has been caused by the fire so far,"" he said. 

Seventeen injured people were taken to hospital and the number of casualties could rise, said Mohammed Raffia Shiraz a spokesman for Herat's health department.

The shivering weather is blasting from Portland, Oregon, across the U.S. Plains, dipping through Texas to New Orleans and as far east as Washington, D.C., the National Weather Service said.
""It's winter's cold across much of the country,"" said Marc Chenard, a forecaster with the service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.
Amarillo, in the Texas panhandle, will see a high temperature of only a blistering cold 2 degrees Fahrenheit, Chenard said, breaking the record of 12 degrees set in 1895. Lubbock, Texas will hit a high of only 9 degrees. Little Rock, Arkansas will hit only 16 degrees.
""That's 40 to 50 degrees below average,"" Chenard said.
The bitter cold was already gripping much of the Plains, and on Thursday icy roads contributed to a massive multi-vehicle pileup in Fort Worth, Texas, where six people died and dozens were taken to a hospital.
Chicago will see lows of zero degrees Fahrenheit for the holiday. New Orleans will hit the low 20s by Tuesday's Mardi Gras, a celebration the city is famous for and already hobbled by the COVID pandemic.
Portland, Oregon will get an inch of snow - while not seeming to be much to Midwesterners, it is as much as the city typically gets in a year, the NWS reported.
Meanwhile, as much a foot of snow with high wind-driven drifts will clobber parts of Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. Dallas will see 4 inches, while sleet and freezing rain will sock Houston, creating dangerous road conditions, Chenard said.

One of the few warm spots for Valentine's Day will be Florida, which will see temperatures in the 80s in Miami and in the 70s in Central Florida's Orlando and Daytona Beach, Chenard said.

417,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2021 10:50AM ET</span>","Myanmar army suspends laws limiting forces, hunts protest backers","(Reuters) - Myanmar's junta on Saturday suspended laws constraining security forces from detaining suspects or searching private property without court approval and ordered the arrest of well-known backers of mass protests against this month's coup.
The announcements came on the eighth day of country-wide demonstrations against the Feb. 1 takeover and detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, which halted an unsteady transition to democracy that began in 2011.
A statement signed by military ruler General Min Aung Hlaing ordered the suspension of three sections of the laws ""protecting the privacy and security of the citizens"", which had been introduced after Myanmar opened up from half a century of army rule.
The sections suspended include the requirement for a court order to detain prisoners beyond 24 hours and constraints on security forces' ability to enter - and if need be damage - private property to search it or make arrests. The suspensions also frees authorities to spy on all communications.
The statement gave no specific end date.
The coup has prompted the biggest street protests in more than a decade and has been denounced by Western countries, with the United States announcing some sanctions on the ruling generals and other countries also considering measures.
Before Myanmar began democratic reforms, it was one of the world's most isolated countries. In another echo of the old era, the junta reintroduced a requirement for villages and wards in towns to register anyone staying overnight.
As anti-coup protests sprang up again in the biggest city Yangon, the capital Naypyitaw and elsewhere on Saturday, the army said arrest warrants had been issued for seven high profile critics of military rule over their comments on social media.
People should inform the police if they spot any of the seven people named and will be punished if they shelter them, the army's True News information team said in a statement. 
It said cases had been filed under a law which provides up to two years jail for comments that could cause alarm or ""threaten tranquility"".
On the wanted list is Min Ko Naing, 58, who was imprisoned for most of the time between 1988 and 2012, and who has been one of the most prominent figures in encouraging the protests and a civil disobedience movement.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach him for comment.
COUP OPPONENTS
Others with warrants against them included ""Jimmy"" Kyaw Min Yu - also a veteran of the 1988 student uprising - singer ""Lin Lin"" Htwe Lin Ko and Myo Yan Naung Thein, a political analyst, and Maung Maung Aye, an NLD-supporting television presenter, and writer Insein Aung Soe.
""I am so proud to have a warrant issued along with Min Ko Naing. Catch me if you can,"" said the last, Ei Pencilo, to her more than 1.6 million followers on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Like several of those named, she worked with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), which won a landslide in a November election the army alleged to be tainted with fraud - an accusation dismissed by the electoral commission.
The United Nations human rights office said on Friday more than 350 people have been arrested in Myanmar since the coup by army chief General Min Aung Hlaing, who said he acted because of election malpractice.
Journalist Shwe Yee Win, who had reported on opposition to the coup in the western town of Pathein, was taken away by police and soldiers on Thursday and has not been heard from since, her TimeAyeyar news website and her mother said.
""I am really worried,"" said Thein Thein, now looking after her daughter's one-year-old child. 
The government did not respond to requests for comment.
The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners voiced concern about a wave of overnight arrests.
""Family members are left with no knowledge of the charges, location, or condition of their loved ones. These are not isolated incidents, and nighttime raids are targeting dissenting voices,"" it said in a statement.
Suu Kyi, for decades the standard bearer of the fight for democracy in Myanmar, faces charges of illegally importing and using six walkie-talkie radios.
NLD press officer Kyi Toe said on Facebook that she was healthy under house arrest in the capital Naypyitaw.
The coup and detentions have prompted anger from Western countries and the 47-member U.N. Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on Friday calling on Myanmar to release detainees an refrain from using violence against protesters.

The United States this week began imposing sanctions on the ruling generals and some businesses linked to them.

418,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 13, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>","China refused to provide WHO team with raw data on early COVID cases, team member says","By Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China refused to give raw data on early COVID-19 cases to a World Health Organization-led team probing the origins of the pandemic, one of the team's investigators said, potentially complicating efforts to understand how the outbreak began. 
The team had requested raw patient data on 174 cases that China had identified from the early phase of the outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December 2019, as well as other cases, but were only provided with a summary, said Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert who is a member of the team.
Such raw data is known as ""line listings"", he said, and would typically be anonymised but contain details such as what questions were asked of individual patients, their responses and how their responses were analysed.
""That's standard practice for an outbreak investigation,"" he told Reuters on Saturday via video call from Sydney, where he is currently undergoing quarantine. 
He said that gaining access to the raw data was especially important since only half of the 174 cases had exposure to the Huanan market, the now-shuttered wholesale seafood centre in Wuhan where the virus was initially detected.
""That's why we've persisted to ask for that,"" Dwyer said. ""Why that doesn't happen, I couldn't comment. Whether it's political or time or it's difficult ... But whether there are any other reasons why the data isn't available, I don't know. One would only speculate."" 
While the Chinese authorities provided a lot of material, he said the issue of access to the raw patient data would be mentioned in the team's final report. ""The WHO people certainly felt that they had received much much more data than they had ever received in the previous year. So that in itself is an advance.""
A summary of the team's findings could be released as early as next week, the WHO said on Friday.
The probe had been plagued by delay, concern over access and bickering between Beijing and Washington, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.
The team, which arrived in China in January and spent four weeks looking into the origins of the outbreak, was limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and prevented from contact with community members, due to health restrictions. The first two weeks were spent in hotel quarantine.
China's refusal to hand over raw data on the early COVID-19 cases was reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times on Friday.
The WHO did not reply to a request from Reuters for comment. The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment but Beijing has previously defended its transparency in handling the outbreak and its cooperation with the WHO mission.
HARMONIOUS, WITH ARGUMENTS
Dwyer said the work within the WHO team was harmonious but that there were ""arguments"" at times with their Chinese counterparts over the interpretation and significance of the data, which he described as ""natural"" in such probes. 
""We might be having a talk about cold chain and they might be more firm about what the data shows than what we might have been, but that's natural. Whether there's political pressure to have different opinions, I don't know. There may well be, but it's hard to know."" 
Cold chain refers to the transport and trade of frozen food.
Peter Daszak, a zoologist and another member of the WHO mission, however tweeted on Saturday https://twitter.com/PeterDaszak/status/1360551108565999619 that he had a different experience as the lead of the mission's animal and environment working group. 
""I found trust & openness w/ my China counterparts. We DID get access to critical new data throughout. We DID increase our understanding of likely spillover pathways,"" he said in response to the New York Times piece. 
Daszak did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
Beijing has sought to cast doubt on the notion that the coronavirus originated in China, pointing to imported frozen food as a conduit. 

On Tuesday, Peter Ben Embarek, who led the WHO delegation, told a news conference that transmission of the virus via frozen food is a possibility, but pointed to market vendors selling frozen animal products including farmed wild animals as a potential pathway that warrants further study.

The 28-year-old, who goes by the name ""Spidey Htoo"", recently returned from Singapore to start a business. But the coronavirus outbreak set back his plans and now he fears the coup on Feb. 1 has derailed them.
""The coup was a big shock to me,"" he said.
Spidey Htoo said he wore the superhero costume at protests to stay out of trouble amid a wave of arrests after the coup.
The United Nations human rights office said on Friday more than 350 people had been arrested in Myanmar since the coup. Suu Kyi was detained on the first day and protesters demand her release.
Spidey Htoo said his participation in protests had been a dilemma for his parents. They don't want to speak out, but also don't want military rule in a country that lived in isolation under juntas for nearly 50 years until opening up began in 2011.
""Finally, they allowed me to join,"" he said.
By wearing a costume, he hopes to catch the attention of onlookers and media, Spidey Htoo said. Authorities cracked down bloodily on protests in 1988 and 2007, but the latest demonstrations have often had a lighter tone with people dressed in a variety of costumes.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing was once again shrouded in smog on Saturday after several days of heavy pollution which have plagued China’s capital during the Lunar New Year national holiday.
Visibility across Beijing was severely limited by the smog on the second day of Lunar New Year, with the tops of the city's Beijing’s tallest group of buildings in the east of the city almost completely covered by the haze.
The PM 2.5 level - which measures pollution - in the city's urban areas reached 239 micrograms per cubic meter according to state news agency Xinhua. 
Local authorities had issued a yellow alert for heavy air pollution on Thursday. China has a colour-coded, four-tier warning system for air pollution, with red the most serious, followed by orange, yellow and blue. 
""The air is horrible,"" said cosmetics sector worker Katie Li, 35, as she made her way to the gym."" 
""Starting the Lunar New Year with this kind of weather is a bit depressing,"" she added.
Staff at the Mutianyu section of the Great Wall of China in the north of Beijing said that they had received around 5,000 visitors on Saturday, a far cry from their usual daily capacity of 20,000 although they have capped numbers to around half of that due to COVID-19 restrictions. 
Some visitors complained about the haze affecting the views. But others, such as 32-year-old banking sector worker Brandon Chen, were unfazed by the conditions.
""Even though the air isn't great, for Chinese people walking up to a high point in the new year carries a lot of importance,” Chen said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italians' hopes in Mario Draghi could hardly be higher. But the former European Central Bank chief, who was sworn in as the country's new prime minister on Saturday, will have a tough time fulfilling them.
His main tasks will be the efficient management of over 200 billion euros ($241 billion) Italy expects from a European Union fund to help the bloc's recovery, and ensuring smooth progress of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.
Draghi has several advantages. He comes to power with one of the largest majorities of any government in Italy's post-war history, huge international prestige and an approval rating of 71%, according to a survey published this week.
But his broad parliamentary backing may also be a problem.
He will have to manage an unwieldy coalition made up of parties from left to right, including traditionally bitter foes such as the 5-Star Movement and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia, the right-wing League and centre-left Democratic Party.
Giovanni Orsina, head of the LUISS university school of government in Rome, said Draghi's popularity and credibility will assure him of an easy ride at the beginning.
""The party system is difficult to manage, but Draghi, with his prestige, can make it hard for them to thwart him,"" he said.
Party horse-trading over cabinet posts is normally a central part of forming an Italian government, yet Draghi unveiled his ministerial team on Friday without any apparent negotiations or opposition from the coalition parties.
His picks will not have pleased everyone, however, and it may be only a matter of time before resentment and dissatisfaction surface. 
RECOVERY PLAN
Draghi's first job will redrafting Italy's Recovery Plan, which must be handed to the European Commission by April to tap funds desperately needed to revive the recession-hit economy.
The Commission will disburse the money in instalments dependent on the government reaching milestones and meeting benchmarks.
The previous government of Giuseppe Conte was brought down partly by squabbles over how to manage the plan and which projects to include, so Draghi will want to swiftly stamp his authority on a revised version.
Italy has a dismal track record of using EU funds and making productive investments in its economy, with projects often bogged down by red tape or hit by corruption probes.
""We need to accelerate the procedures. It's unthinkable to achieve what we have to with the slowness of our bureaucracy,"" Enrico Giovannini, Draghi's new infrastructure and transport minister told Reuters shortly before his appointment. 
It will not be easy for the prime minister to overcome these deep-rooted problems, but his past performance at the Italian Treasury, the Bank of Italy and the ECB shows he can act decisively and effectively.
As Treasury chief he earned the moniker ""Super Mario"" for his whirlwind activity in spearheading privatisations and his role in Italy's preparations for monetary union. 
After a stint at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) in London he then reorganised the Bank of Italy, cutting its number of branches, before earning international acclaim at the ECB where he is credited with saving the euro through the bank's asset-buying programme.
""Draghi has shown he can be a great innovator and effectively lead complex organisations like the Bank of Italy and the Eurosystem of central banks,"" said Angelo Baglioni, economics professor at Milan's Cattolica University.
CREATIVE DESTRUCTION
Aside from the Recovery Plan, analysts are looking for clues to how Draghi will go about broader reforms of Italy's chronically sluggish economy.
Some indications may be found in a December report by a G30 working group he co-chaired which urged an end to state aid for firms whose fate has been sealed by COVID-19, suggesting there could be painful medicine in store. 
The report calls for ""a certain amount of 'creative destruction' as some firms shrink or close and new ones open, and as some workers need to move between companies and sectors"".
Reviving the economy will be closely linked to vaccinations and how the pandemic develops.
""Lockdowns can't last forever and vaccines are the only way to reduce health expenditure, because sick people cost money,"" said Fabrizio Pregliasco, a prominent Italian virologist.
On this front, Draghi inherits a situation which is broadly positive, with infection rates currently stable and pressure on hospitals relatively manageable.
After initial problems due to supply shortages, Italy's vaccination campaign is also going smoothly, with almost 80% of doses so far received having been administered to patients. 
Nonetheless, Draghi has no room for complacency and may face problems managing the frequent clashes between central government and the powerful governors of Italy's 20 regions who have a major say over health policy.
Economist Tito Boeri, a former chief of the state pension system, urged Draghi to claw back control over healthcare. 
""Vaccinations require an unprecedented effort ... it takes commitment and an organizational structure that needs to be largely centralized,"" Boeri said.

PARIS (Reuters) - It is the classic romantic combination: St Valentine's Day in Paris, the city of love, and a gift of red roses. But some Parisian florists are trying to wean customers off the flowers because of their ecological cost.
Most roses sold in France in the run-up to St Valentine's Day, a peak sales period for the global flower industry, have to be imported by air freight from countries such as Kenya, resulting in carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.
Florists worried at the environmental damage from this trade say there are viable alternatives that can be grown locally and they are trying to encourage customers to try them.
They face an uphill struggle, because the tradition of gifting red roses on St Valentine's Day, which falls on Feb. 14, is so engrained in many cultures.
Hortense Harang, founder of an online flower shop called ""Fleurs d'Ici"" - French for ""Flowers from here"" - has been spearheading the campaign to wean people off roses.
""Red roses is so 1950s,"" she said.
""Roses is something that is completely a no-go in this season because it doesn't make sense basically to buy roses. Roses do not grow under our latitudes in this season.""
Her campaign has gathered support. ""It's not logical to have flowers from the other side of the planet if we can get them locally,"" said Edith Besenfelder, a 46-year-old Paris florist who works with local and seasonal flowers. 
But old habits die hard. Celine Argente, the 40-year-old owner of the Sylvine flower shop in Paris, said she had been encouraging clients to buy red tulips as a way of declaring their love. But despite that, her shop this week was packed to the rafters with red roses, to meet demand.

""It's a classic which people can't change from,"" she said. ""The red rose remains the flower for Valentine's Day.""

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian police beat and arrested demonstrators on Saturday as a small group protested over the reopening of the site where activists denouncing police brutality were shot last year in the commercial capital, Lagos, Reuters witnesses said.
Rights group Amnesty International and witnesses have said soldiers opened fire on protesters on Oct. 20, killing at least 12 people at a toll gate in the city's affluent Lekki district and another area. The military has denied shooting live rounds and the police have denied involvement.
There was a heavy presence of armed police officers on Saturday at the toll gate, where a group of about 15 protesters gathered despite calls by the government this week to scrap the demonstration, Reuters witnesses said.
At least six of the protesters were beaten with truncheons and arrested before being driven away in police vans. 
""They are already manhandling us, but we're not going to be deterred. We're not going to step down,"" said one man, who did not provide his name and spoke to Reuters as he was being arrested.
A Lagos state police spokesman said in a text message he was unaware of the arrests but would look into accusations that activists had been manhandled.
Nigeria's information minister warned activists earlier this week to drop plans for the protest, saying it risked being ""hijacked by hoodlums"".
On Friday, one of the two youth members of a Lagos state panel investigating the October shootings resigned, citing ""undue intimidation of peaceful protesters"" and the panel's vote to reopen the toll gate - a source of revenue for the state government - before the probe had been finished.
Thousands of Nigerians calling for police reforms staged largely peaceful protests nationwide for about two weeks in October, but the Lekki shootings sparked street violence and looting across the country.

The wave of civil unrest was one of the worst since the end of military rule in 1999.

No militant group immediately claimed responsibility for the three attacks, which come amid an upsurge in violence in Afghanistan as clashes intensify between government forces and Taliban insurgents. 
A string of near-daily roadside bombings in recent weeks has killed government officials, judges, journalists and activists.
The bloodshed comes as U.S.-brokered peace talks in Qatar between the Taliban and representatives of the Afghan government have staggered in recent months.
President Joe Biden's team is reviewing a peace-building deal that the government of his predecessor Donald Trump sealed with the Taliban in February 2020. The pact requires all American and allied forces to leave the country by May 1.
The United States has reduced the number of troops in Afghanistan to 2,500 from the 12,000 there when the agreement was signed. But violence remains high, with the U.S. and Afghan governments largely blaming the Taliban.
On Saturday, a police spokesman in southern Kandahar province said a blast there was caused by a Humvee packed with explosives that targeted a police outpost, injuring seven police personnel.
Afghanistan's Defence Ministry said ""18 Taliban terrorists were killed and 9 others were wounded"" in an operation in Arghandab district of Kandahar province on Friday night. 
An explosion targeted the police commander in the Chapa Dara district of eastern Kunar province, killing four local police personnel, including the commander, said a provincial police spokesman.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's second most populous state Victoria entered a five-day lockdown on Saturday as authorities raced to prevent a third wave of COVID-19 cases sparked by the highly infections UK variant.
One new locally acquired case was confirmed in the past 24 hours, health authorities said on Saturday, taking the number of cases tied to a quarantine hotel at Melbourne airport to 14 and total active cases in the state to 20.
""A lot of people will be hurting today. This is not the position Victorians wanted to be in but I can't have a situation where in two weeks' time, we look back and wish we had taken these decisions now,"" Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Saturday. 
International flights to Melbourne will be stopped through Wednesday, after five en-route, with about 100 passengers, land on Saturday.
All 14 cases in the airport cluster are due to the highly infectious UK variant of the novel coronavirus. So far only direct contacts of workers at the hotel have tested positive.
""It's contained in that sense. There is concern in Victoria about spread into the community,"" Australia's Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly told reporters.
Streets in downtown Melbourne, the state's capital, and its suburbs were almost empty on Saturday, with people ordered to stay home for all but essential shopping, two hours of outdoor exercise, caregiving, or work that cannot be done from home.
Among the ""essential"" work, play at the Australian Open, the year's first Grand Slam tennis event which runs to Feb. 21, continued, but fans were banned through Wednesday. Thousands were forced to leave mid-matches before midnight on Friday.
Players missed the crowd buzz.
""It was a bit disturbing - in some ways sad. ... I just tried to focus on my game,"" Elina Svitolina said after winning her third-round match. 
The lockdown, which has shut restaurants and cafes for all but takeaway, hit just as Melbourne had geared up for the biggest weekend in nearly a year, with Lunar New Year celebrations, Valentine's Day and Australian Open crowds.
Melbourne last year endured a 111-day lockdown, one of the strictest and longest in the world at the time, to stem a coronavirus outbreak which lead to more than 800 deaths.
""It's the busiest weekend of the year for us. I'm sitting here making 178 heartbreaking phone calls to see if I can get them to rebook,"" said Will Baa, owner of Lover, a restaurant in the hip district of Windsor.
""Just fingers crossed that it only does extend for the short period of five days,"" he said.
More broadly, Australia is rated among the world's most successful countries in tackling the pandemic, largely because of decisive lockdowns and borders sealed to all but a trickle of travellers. With a population of 25 million, there have been around 22,200 community cases and 909 deaths.

New Zealand on Saturday reported one death of a patient with COVID-19. That case has yet to be included in the country's total of 25 COVID-19 deaths.

Left-wing economist Andres Arauz won Sunday's vote and moved on to the April 11 runoff vote. With less than 1% of votes left to count, Guillermo Lasso holds a narrow lead over indigenous activist Yaku Perez in the race for runner-up. 
Perez demanded a full recount after saying the vote had been manipulated, without presenting evidence of fraud. He argued that the data in the minutes of various electoral boards are inconsistent with data entered into the vote-counting system. 
National Elections Council President Diana Atamaint said that a recount will be carried out in the province of Guayas, home to the largest city Guayaquil and where Perez had strongly questioned the outcome. In addition, 50% of the vote 16 other provinces will be reviewed.
""Once the review process is finished, the final announcement of the results will be made,"" Atamaint said in a press statement. ""We are firmly going to defend the electoral process that we prepared with great affection, responsibility but above all with transparency.""
Perez and Lasso agreed to the recount in a meeting that included observers from the Organization of American States.
The statement did not say how long the process would take.
The official vote count shows Perez with 19.38% of the votes and Lasso with 19.74%, with 147 poll statements left to review. Arauz won the first round with 32.7%.
""We are convinced that now, with transparency, we will recover many votes,"" said Perez, after the meeting at the electoral council. ""It was worth the fight.""

Perez has visited various state agencies of the Andean country to denounce manipulation of the vote results, while his followers have held vigils in Quito and Guayaquil.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - About 800 longshoremen from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach on Friday got the first COVID-19 vaccinations for dockworkers at the United States' busiest seaport complex, which has been hard hit by pandemic-related workforce disruptions and surging imports.
The shots were a welcome relief for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) members who snapped up the appointments in about 20 minutes. 
The inoculations offer ""peace of mind"" to longshoremen Patty Castillo, 46, and Adrian Esqueda, 48, who said co-workers and family members have contracted COVID-19 - and some have died of it.
""We have a fortress against the disease,"" said Esqueda, as he sat in a truck with Castillo, his wife, during the observation period required after receiving the vaccination. 
Many dockworkers have jobs that require interacting with dozens of different people every day, ILWU members said.
""You can't do (working in) pods. There is no way to avoid contact and physical distance in some jobs,"" said ILWU member Brennan Hill, 52, who also received his first of two injections of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine at the Long Beach Convention Center on Friday.
""This offers a little hope going forward,"" Hill said of the start of vaccinations for the 15,000 people who work on the docks.
The two ports together account for nearly half of all U.S. maritime trade and some 70 percent of the nation's imports from Asia. They have been inundated with incoming cargo, resulting in delays that have caused record numbers of ships to wait to be unloaded and a slowdown in the movement of goods across the United States. 
Meanwhile, high-stakes battles are raging over which workers should be prioritized as essential.
Such decisions are sometimes made at the local level. That has led to a patchwork of vaccination eligibility rules that are exacerbating anxiety at a time when demand for COVID-19 vaccines far outstrips supply.
The Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services organized Friday's clinic, the first of a series. It came as mass inoculation sites in other parts of Los Angeles County - including at Dodger Stadium - are temporarily closed due to a lack of vaccine doses.
Some states are starting to expand vaccinations beyond first responders, healthcare workers and the elderly to supermarket clerks, line cooks, bus drivers and teachers.

In New York state, grocery store and restaurant workers are permitted to get the shots. And in Illinois, some auto factory workers have begun receiving vaccinations.

Timberlake spoke out on his Instagram account after criticism this week on social and mainstream media of interviews he gave some 20 years ago about his sex life with Spears when both were at the height of their careers.
The backlash followed the broadcast of a TV documentary about the rise and fall of Spears, including how she was shamed in the media when their relationship ended in 2002.
Timberlake also has been dogged for years by accusations that he failed to take sufficient responsibility for the infamous ""wardrobe malfunction"" during the 2004 Super Bowl half time show when he mistakenly exposed Janet Jackson's breast on stage.
""I specifically want to apologize to Britney Spears and Janet Jackson both individually, because I care for and respect these women and I know I failed, "" Timberlake, 40, wrote on Instagram.
The ""Sexy Back"" pop star, now married to actress Jessica Biel, said he was sorry for speaking out of turn, or not speaking up, for what was right in the past.
""I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism,"" he said.
Timberlake and Spears dated for about three years before splitting up abruptly in 2002. Spears was questioned in the media about her virginity while Timberlake said he had slept with her and then wrote a song ""Cry Me a River"" in which he implied that she had cheated in the relationship.
In Friday's apology, Timberlake said the entertainment industry sets white men up for success.
""Because of my ignorance, I didn't recognize it for all that it was while it was happening in my own life,"" he said.
Spears' business and personal affairs have been controlled by court-appointed conservators since 2008.

Representatives for Jackson and Spears did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday.

MILAN (Reuters) - Europe's medicines regulator is planning to speed up assessments of any COVID-19 vaccines that are modified to protect against variants of the virus, the head of the agency's COVID-19 task-force told Reuters on Friday.
Marco Cavaleri, chair of the vaccine evaluation team at the European Medicines Agency (EMA), said there should be no need for lengthy large-scale trials like those needed to evaluate the first COVID-19 vaccines, since tweaks for new variants can be tested on smaller groups.
""We are working on updated guidelines, assuming that we cannot ask for large Phase III trials. This will allow us to go faster,"" said Cavaleri.
""We will ask for much smaller trials, with a few hundred participants, rather than 30,000 to 40,000,"" he told Reuters. He said the EMA would focus primarily on immune response data.
Drugmakers including  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) have been testing their COVID-19 vaccines against several fast-spreading, more infectious variants of the novel coronavirus. 
Variants which emerged in Brazil (known as P.1.), Britain (known as 20I/501Y.V1 or B.1.1.7) and South Africa (known as 20I/501Y.V2 or B.1.351) have already spread around the world, piling more pressure on governments struggling to tame the pandemic which has killed almost 2.5 million people.
These are the three major variants that are worrying scientists, with their spread raising the risk that newly-developed COVID-19 vaccines will need to be updated or tweaked to be effective against some variants, and that people may require one or more booster shots.
STREAMLINING
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also said it is considering a rapid review process for the quick turnaround of new COVID-19 booster shots if variants emerge against which the vaccines do not provide protection.
Vaccine makers Pfizer and BioNTech, as well as AstraZeneca and Moderna, whose COVID shots have been authorised for emergency use in Europe, have said they are preparing for the possibility that variants will emerge that could require tweaks to their vaccines. 
Normally, an EMA approval requires extensive studies with large numbers, starting with safety and ending with efficacy. 
""We will also try to streamline regulatory procedures doing something similar to what happens with flu vaccines. In short, without the drugmakers having to submit all the preliminary data again"", Cavaleri said.
He added that the EMA is also aware that in the near future it may no longer be possible to do clinical trials with placebo for categories such as the elderly, due to rollout of current COVID-19 vaccines.
""In that case we could think about a head-to-head comparison with an already approved vaccine"", he said.
Cavaleri also told Reuters Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will file its vaccine formal application in the next few days.
""Probably as early as next week"", he said, noting that the EMA has been conducting a rolling review of the vaccine for some time. ""Mid-March is reasonable for the EMA decision,"" he said.
The EMA, he added, has been in contact to date with about 50 pharmaceutical companies working on COVID vaccines.
Regarding the Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, he said the agency is in constant contact with the company producing it.
""There is a constructive cooperation. If there are no problems with the answers we receive on the subject of the production phase, the rolling review could start within a matter of weeks,"" he said

The EMA is also in contact with the Chinese companies developing vaccines, particularly Sinovac Biotech, but the process for the Chinese vaccine is a few steps behind the Russian one, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Parties to the International Criminal Court on Friday elected Britain's Karim Khan as the new prosecutor for a nine-year term starting on June 16. 
Khan won a secret ballot against three other candidates to replace lead prosecutor Fatou Bensouda. The 123-member Hague-based court, which began work nearly 20 years ago, handles war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and crimes of aggression.
British barrister Karim is best known for heading the United Nations' special investigative team looking into Islamic State crimes in Iraq. 
In his 27-year law career Khan, who is also Queens Counsel, has worked for almost every international criminal tribunal in roles in prosecution, defence and as counsel for victims. At the ICC Khan is best known for being a lead defence counsel who has worked on cases from Kenya, Sudan and Libya. 
There was intense political jostling for the top ICC job at a time of heightened scrutiny of the prosecutor's office.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration imposed sanctions last year on court staff including Bensouda over investigations by her office into possible war crimes committed in Afghanistan, including by American troops. The United States is not a member of the court.
New U.S. President Joe Biden's administration will ""thoroughly review"" the sanctions on ICC officials, a State Department spokesman said last month. 
Then last week the court said it has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in the Palestinian territories, which could lead to an inquiry strongly opposed by non-ICC member Israel and the United States.
One of the first decisions by Khan could be whether to press ahead with a full investigation into the Palestinian territories, where Bensouda said there is a reasonable basis to conclude war crimes may have been committed by both Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups.

""Karim’s extensive experience in international law will be pivotal in ensuring we hold those responsible for the most heinous crimes to account and gain justice for their victims,” Britain’s Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab posted on Twitter.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued new guidance for U.S. schools to reopen, recommending universal mask-wearing and physical distancing as key COVID-19 mitigation strategies to get children back in the classroom quickly.
The guidelines https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/index.html, which also emphasize the need for facility-cleaning, personal hygiene and contact tracing, are intended to give school districts a road map to bring the nation's 55 million public school students back to classrooms without sparking COVID-19 outbreaks.
""We believe with the strategies we have put forward that there will be limited to no transmission in schools if followed,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters, noting that the CDC was not mandating that schools reopen. 
The agency also said school reopenings should not be conditional on teachers' access to COVID-19 vaccines, but strongly recommended U.S. states prioritize teachers and school staff for vaccination.
President Joe Biden promised to reopen most K-8 schools within 100 days of taking office on Jan. 20. He praised the CDC's guidance on Friday and emphasized the problems arising from the continued closure of schools, including children's mental health struggles and the exodus of parents from the workforce.
""We have sacrificed so much in the last year. But science tells us that if we support our children, educators, and communities with the resources they need, we can get kids back to school safely in more parts of the country sooner,"" Biden said in a statement.
Just 44% of U.S. school districts were offering fully in-person learning as of December and 31% were operating all remotely, according to the Center for Reinventing Public Education, which surveyed 477 of the nation's nearly 13,000 school districts. Other districts have employed a hybrid learning model, where students attend some school days in-person and some virtually. 
School reopenings have caused labor disputes between teachers unions, who fear for their members' safety, and school districts in major U.S. cities. In Chicago this week, the teachers union and district reached agreement on a safety plan after months of negotiations that included threats of a strike.
On Friday, the American Federation of Teachers, which has about 1.7 million members, commended the CDC's guidance for relying on ""facts and evidence.""
""We urge the CDC to remain flexible as more data comes to light. The guidance is instructive for this moment in time, but this disease is not static,"" AFT President Randi Weingarten (NYSE:WRI) said in a statement.
FLEXIBLE APPROACH
The CDC's phased mitigation strategy is adaptable depending on the level of COVID-19 transmission in a school's community. 
In areas where the COVID-19 positive test rate is below 5% and there were fewer than nine new cases per 100,000 in the last seven days, schools can fully reopen and safely relax social distancing measures as long as masks are worn, Walensky said. In areas of higher transmission, the agency is urging 6 feet (1.83 m) of separation in classrooms and weekly testing of students, teachers and staff. 
Elementary school students should learn in-person at least part-time even in areas of high transmission, the guidance says. 
Recent studies have shown that in-person learning has not been associated with increased community transmission, especially in elementary schools.
House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy criticized the reopening guidelines on Friday as not bold enough to ensure that students return to classrooms promptly.
""Families and students deserve better. They need iron-clad assurances that their children will be able to get back into the classroom environment that offers the best education model,"" McCarthy said in a statement. 
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said on Friday that House committees were working to pass Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan legislation, which includes a $130 billion investment that could help schools follow the CDC protocols, to help schools enforce the CDC's guidelines.

""Without strong assistance from Congress, our schools cannot afford to enact the science-based safety precautions required,"" Pelosi said in a statement.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea's nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs are an urgent priority for the United States and Washington remains committed to denuclearization of the country, the U.S. State Department said on Friday.
The Biden administration's lack of direct engagement with North Korea should not be seen as an indication that the challenge posed by its weapons programs was not a priority, department spokesman Ned Price said.
""It in fact very much is,"" he told a regular briefing.
North Korea continued to make progress in its nuclear and missile programs in recent years ""which makes this an urgent priority for the United States and one that we are committed to addressing together with our allies and partners,"" Price said.
""And ... the central premise is that we remain committed to denuclearization of North Korea,"" he said.
Price said the lack of direct engagement to date was ""a function of us making sure that we have done the diplomatic legwork, that we have been in close contact in touch with our partners and allies,"" aiming for a coordinated approach.
The Biden administration, which took office last month, says it is conducting a full review of North Korea policy in consultation with allies, particularly South Korea and Japan, following former President Donald Trump's unprecedented engagement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which failed to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
A confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters on Monday said North Korea developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs throughout 2020 in violation of international sanctions, helping fund them with some $300 million stolen through cyber hacks. 
President Joe Biden's top Asia official, Kurt Campbell, has said the administration must decide quickly on how to approach North Korea and not repeat an Obama-era delay that led to ""provocative"" steps by Pyongyang that prevented engagement.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who discussed North Korea with his South Korean counterpart on Thursday, has said additional sanctions could be used in coordination with allies to press North Korea to denuclearize. 
Biden called Kim a ""thug"" during his election campaign, and said he would only meet him ""on the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - A U.N. envoy on Friday said U.S. and E.U. sanctions on Venezuela were worsening a humanitarian crisis and recommended the United States relax the measures, an argument the country's opposition labeled ""regime propaganda.""
Following a 12-day visit, Alena Douhan, a U.N. special rapporteur focusing on sanctions, recommended in a preliminary report that the sanctions be lifted and the Venezuelan government be granted access to funds frozen in the United States, United Kingdom and Portugal. 
Washington in January 2019 sanctioned state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela to try to oust President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse in the once-prosperous OPEC nation and stands accused of corruption, rights violations and rigging his 2018 re-election. 
Maduro's government blames the sanctions for Venezuela's economic woes. Prior to blacklisting PDVSA in 2019, Washington in 2015 implemented its first sanctions on top Venezuelan government officials, and in 2017 issued some financial restrictions on PDVSA. 
""Unilateral sanctions increasingly imposed by the United States, the European Union and other countries have exacerbated the abovementioned calamities,"" Douhan told reporters, recognizing that the economic decline started in 2014 with the downturn in oil pries and that mismanagement and corruption also contributed. 
Venezuela's opposition and U.S. officials point out that the country's economic collapse began before the imposition of economic sanctions, and argue the sanctions are justified because Maduro's government would more likely use the resources for corrupt ends than to alleviate Venezuelans' suffering.
""We regret the rapporteur's imprecisions and the lack of mention of subjects like corruption, inefficiency, political violence and the use of hunger as a tool of social and political control,"" Miguel Pizarro, opposition leader Juan Guaido's envoy to the United Nations, wrote on Twitter. 
""That is allowing oneself to be used for regime's propaganda."" 

U.S. Ambassador for Venezuela James Story - who is based in neighboring Colombia, as the two countries cut off diplomatic ties in 2019 - wrote on Twitter on Thursday that Venezuela's crisis was due to ""the regime's corruption,"" noting that the sanctions exempted humanitarian goods.

The lack of direct contact between the Democratic president and the long-serving right-wing premier has fueled speculation in Israel and among Middle East experts that the new administration may be signaling its displeasure over the close ties Netanyahu forged with Biden’s predecessor, former President Donald Trump.
“He is looking forward to speaking with Prime Minister Netanyahu,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters at a daily briefing when asked when Biden would call. “I can assure you that will be soon, but I don't have a specific time or deadline.""
Asked if the delay in a Biden courtesy call was meant to disrespect the Israeli leader. Psaki said: ""It is not an intentional dis. Prime Minister Netanyahu is someone the president has known for some time.” Biden, she said, was “looking forward to having the conversation.”
Israel is one of Washington’s closest allies. Trump and his predecessor, Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, both spoke to Netanyahu within days of taking office. 
Biden has already made calls to a number of foreign leaders, including those from China, Mexico, Britain, India, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and Russia.
Netanyahu has himself downplayed the notion that he was being slighted.
While Netanyahu was almost in lock-step with Trump over Middle East policy, he could be in for frostier relations with Biden. Biden has long been regarded in Israel as a friend in Washington but he and Netanyahu have sometimes not seen eye-to-eye.
Netanyahu will be challenged if Biden restores U.S. participation in the Iran nuclear deal that Trump withdrew from, improves Washington’s tattered relations with the Palestinians as he has promised, and opposes Israeli settlement building on of occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood.

Netanyahu used his bond with Trump in recent elections to tout his ability to keep the United States aligned with his policies. But with Israel’s fourth election in two years scheduled for March 23, he may not have that political luxury anymore.

(Reuters) - U.S. census data used once a decade to redraw legislative districts will not be made available until September, officials said on Friday, a delay that could make it difficult for states to finish new maps in time for the 2022 congressional elections.
In announcing a new release date of Sept. 30, the Census Bureau cited lingering delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the bureau to shut down many of its data collection operations last spring as lockdowns swept the country.
The bureau had previously set a target of July, which was already months later than the data is typically provided to states.
Every 10 years, states employ the fresh census data to draw the lines for members of the U.S. House of Representatives as well as thousands of state legislative offices.
Some good-government groups have expressed concern that the compressed timeline could make it easier for lawmakers to engage in gerrymandering, the process by which maps are deliberately skewed to benefit one political party over another.
If new maps are drawn late in 2021, that would leave little time for legal challenges to work their way through the courts before filing deadlines for elections. In Illinois and Texas, two states where one party holds unilateral power to redraw legislative boundaries, candidates must file before year's end to run for office in 2022.
""You're starting to bump redistricting up against the election cycle,"" said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice. ""There's less time to challenge maps. That puts a lot of pressure on civil rights groups.""
The only two states that have legislative elections in 2021, Virginia and New Jersey, will be forced to use existing maps as a result of the postponement.
""This was a census like no other,"" Kathleen Styles, a Census Bureau official, said on a call with reporters on Friday. ""COVID-19 was definitely the driving factor in our schedule here.""
The state-level population figures that determine whether states will gain or lose U.S. House seats will be available in April, but the more specific data needed to draw maps will be delayed.
Democrats hold a slim 10-seat majority in the House, and some analysts have said that a combination of reapportionment and gerrymandering could be enough to swing the majority. Texas and Florida, two states that are controlled by Republicans and have seen aggressive gerrymanders in previous cycles, are expected to gain three seats and two seats, respectively. 
A Brennan Center analysis issued on Thursday found that Republicans would have sole control over the drawing of 181 congressional seats, compared with only 49 for Democrats.

The delay also may force states to pass legislation extending redistricting deadlines or turn to the courts to seek extensions. Half of U.S. states have either a constitutional or statutory deadline calling for new maps in 2021, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A strong earthquake struck Tajikistan on Friday and the tremors were felt as far away as north India and Pakistan, witnesses said. Many residents ran out of their homes, but no major damage was reported. 
The U.S Geological Survey put the quake's magnitude at 5.9 and centred 35 km (55 miles) west of Murghob in Tajikistan, central Asia. 
The Tajikistan Emergency Situations Ministry said the epicentre was 420 km (260 miles) east of the Tajik capital Dushanbe near the border with China. 
The seismic service of the country's Academy of Sciences told Russia's RIA Novosti that the quake's intensity was measured at 6.1. The news agency said there were no casualties or damage, citing the Committee on Emergency Situations. 
Monitoring agencies in the region pegged the quake as being a bit more severe. India's National Center for Seismology said its magnitude was 6.3, while the National Seismic Monitoring Centre in Pakistan measured it at 6.4.
Tremors were felt in Dushanbe but the epicentre was in a sparsely populated area.
Cracks were reported in some homes in northern Kashmir, the Indian Meteorological Department said. A witness also reported a wall collapse near the northern Indian city of Amritsar, but there were no reports of casualties. 
A resident in Indian Kashmir's Baramulla district said it felt like a strong wind had lashed his house. ""My whole house shook and cracks appeared in a corner of one of the rooms,"" Firdous Ahmad Khan said.
Tremors were felt across Pakistan including the capital, Islamabad, and northwestern Peshawar, and even as far as the eastern city of Lahore, which borders India.
In Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir, where a 2005 earthquake wreaked serious destruction, there was panic, according to witnesses, and many people rushed out of their homes in fear.
""I thought it's the same like what had hit us in 2005. My children started crying,"" said Asif Maqbool, a resident in Madina Market, a neighbourhood of Muzaffarabad that was almost flattened in the 2005 quake. 
Saima Khalid, a resident of the Khawaja Muhalla district of Muzaffarabad, said everyone in the neighbourhood came out onto the streets.
""They were crying, reciting verses from the Holy Koran,"" she said.

The quake was also felt in northern Afghanistan but there were no reports of casualties or damage.

ROME (Reuters) - Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, took charge of Italy's new government on Friday, and unveiled a cabinet that mixed unaffiliated technocrats with politicians from across his broad coalition.
President Sergio Mattarella asked Draghi to be prime minister after party wrangling brought down the previous administration, and set him the task of tackling the coronavirus health crisis and economic meltdown pummelling the country.
Following a week of consultations, almost all the main parties from across the political spectrum have endorsed Draghi, and he named a number of prominent figures from these various groups as ministers to cement their support.
Luigi Di Maio, a leader of the 5-Star Movement, will remain foreign minister, while Giancarlo Giorgetti, a senior figure in the League party, will be industry minister. Andrea Orlando, from the centre-left Democratic Party, will be labour minister.
However, some key posts went to non-affiliated technocrats, including Daniele Franco, director general of the Bank of Italy, who was named as economy minister and Roberto Cingolani, a physicist and IT expert, who was handed the new role of minister for green transition.
There were only eight women in the 23-strong cabinet.
The new team will be sworn in on Saturday, opening the way for debates in both houses of parliament early next week, where Draghi will unveil his policy plans and face votes of confidence -- a formality given his cross-party backing.
Draghi received a boost on Thursday when the largest group in parliament, the 5-Star Movement, agreed to support the government, meaning it will have such a large majority that no single party will have the numbers to bring it down.
RECOVERY FUND
One of the reasons so many parties have joined forces in the ruling coalition is that they all want to have a say in how Italy spends more than 200 billion euros ($242.56 billion) it is set to receive from a European Union economic recovery fund.
Draghi, 73, is widely credited with having saved the euro currency during his time in charge of the ECB and he will no doubt be influential now in shaping EU debate on how the bloc should engineer its economic revival.
Politicians he met this week said he told them he is opposed to fiscal austerity, despite soaring national debt levels, given the importance of protecting social cohesion.
He also honoured a pledge to create the powerful new ministry for ecological transition, which combines the environment and energy portfolios, helping win over the 5-Star for whom green issues are core concerns.
Policies to fight climate change are required to be a pillar of the Recovery Plans to be presented by EU countries to the European Commission by April.

Draghi has also said he will make the anti-coronavirus vaccine programme a priority. Italy has registered some 93,000 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's aides have launched a formal review of the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, reviving the Obama-era goal of closing the controversial facility with the aim of doing so before he leaves office, the White House said on Friday.
Aides involved in internal discussions are considering an executive action to be signed by Biden in coming weeks or months, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, signaling a new effort to remove what human rights advocates have called a stain on America’s global image.
Asked whether Biden would shut the high-security prison located at the Guantanamo Naval Station by the time his presidency ends, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters: ""That certainly is our goal and our intention.""
But such an initiative is unlikely to bring down the curtain anytime soon on the offshore facility, due largely to the steep political and legal obstacles that also frustrated efforts by his ex-boss, former President Barack Obama, to close it.
Set up to house foreign suspects following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington, the prison came to symbolize the excesses of the U.S. “war on terror” because of harsh interrogation methods that critics say amounted to torture.
""We are undertaking an NSC process to assess the current state of play that the Biden administration has inherited from the previous administration, in line with our broader goal of closing Guantanamo,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne told Reuters, which was the first to report that the review was under way.
""The NSC will work closely with the Departments of Defense, State, and Justice to make progress toward closing the GTMO facility, and also in close consultation with Congress,"" she added.
The immediate impact of a new approach could be to reinstate, in some form, Obama's Guantanamo closure policy, which was reversed by Donald Trump as soon as he took office in 2017.
Trump kept the prison open during his four years in the White House. Now, 40 prisoners remain, most held for nearly two decades without being charged or tried.
Biden’s campaign said during the 2020 race that he continued to support closing the detention center but did not say how he would do it.
It is also unclear how specific Biden’s coming executive action might be about his plans for the prison, which holds suspects in the Sept. 11 attacks among its detainee population.
""This is an encouraging and much welcome development,"" said Scott Roehm, Washington director of advocacy group The Center for Victims of Torture. ""The process needs to move quickly.""
FILLING OUT BIDEN'S GUANTANAMO TEAM
Signaling that deliberations are still at an early stage, Horne said ""a number of key policy roles still need to be filled,"" including ones at the Defense, State and Justice Departments. ""We need to have the right people seated to do this important work,"" she said.
Biden, who was Obama’s vice president, can expect to confront many of the same hurdles faced by his former boss.
Opened under President George W. Bush, the prison's population grew to a peak of about 800 inmates before it started to shrink. Obama whittled down the number further but his effort to close the prison was stymied largely by Republican opposition in Congress.
The federal government is still barred by law from transferring any inmates to prisons on the U.S. mainland. Even with his own Democratic party now controlling Congress, their majorities are so slim that Biden would face a tough challenge securing legislative changes because some Democrats might also oppose them.
A revived Guantanamo strategy is expected to focus initially on further decreasing the number of prisoners by repatriating them or finding other countries to accept them, according to the people familiar with the matter.
This could also mean re-establishing a State Department post of Guantanamo closure envoy, created by Obama but eliminated by Trump, to resume negotiations with other governments on detainee transfers, the sources said.
In addition, the Pentagon could restart a parole-style review process of prisoners’ cases to determine whether they still posed a threat, the sources said.
Still, any closure plan could initially be hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, making moving prisoners unlikely for now.
Just over three weeks after taking office, the Biden administration has not made Guantanamo one of its top early priorities as it grapples with the pandemic and its economic fallout. Obama made closing Guantanamo one of his first executive orders in 2009 but failed to do so by the end of his second term.
""While I’m glad to hear that the new administration will be reviewing policy with an eye towards closing Guantanamo, it’s concerning that it is coming so late in the game,"" said Andrea Prasow, deputy Washington director for Human Rights Watch.
Shutting the facility has been a demand of progressive Democrats whose support helped Biden win the White House.
The prison’s continued existence, critics say, is a reminder of detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture.
Privately administration officials express skepticism about getting the support they will need from Congress.
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin’s statement during his January confirmation hearing that the new administration would seek Guantanamo’s closure drew a letter of rebuke signed by seven Republican House members, all military veterans.
“If we release these GITMO detainees, they'll become rockstars in the Islamist Extremist world, posing an even greater threat to America and the world,"" tweeted U.S. Representative Mike Waltz, one of the signatories.
Of the prisoners who remain, nine have been charged or convicted by military commissions. The most notorious is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused Sept. 11 mastermind. About two dozen have not been charged but have been deemed too dangerous to release.

Six inmates have previously been cleared for release by a government panel yet remain jailed with no arrangements for transfer.

446,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 01:25PM ET</span>",Iranian official arrested in Istanbul over dissident's killing: sources,"(Reuters) - Turkey has arrested an Iranian official suspected of instigating the killing of an Iranian dissident in Istanbul 15 months ago, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
Confirming a report in Turkey's Sabah newspaper, the sources said Mohammad Reza Naserzadeh was detained earlier this week on suspicion of planning the shooting of Masoud Molavi Vardanjani, a critic of Iran's political and military leadership.
The case could strain ties between Iran and Turkey, regional powers which have grown closer under Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan despite sometimes deep differences, including in Syria where they back opposing sides in the 10-year conflict.
Iran's Foreign Ministry said the newspaper report was ""baseless"".
Vardanjani was shot dead on an Istanbul street in November 2019, a year after leaving Iran and criticising what he said was corruption in the Islamic Republic in a series of social media posts. 
Last year two senior Turkish officials told Reuters his killing was instigated by intelligence officials at Iran's consulate in Istanbul. A senior U.S. administration official also said Washington believed Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security was directly involved. 
At the time, one of the Turkish officials identified the two suspects by initials - one set of which matched Naserzadeh's.
Sabah said Naserzadeh was working at the civic registry department of the Iranian consulate in Istanbul but Reuters was not able to independently confirm that element of its report.
Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh denied that any consulate staff member was involved in Vardanjani's killing and said Iran was in talks with Turkish officials to shed light on the issue, according to the foreign ministry's website. 
In December, Turkish officials accused Iranian authorities of targeting another opponent in Istanbul when they announced they had detained 11 people involved in the abduction and smuggling to Iran of an Iranian dissident wanted in connection with a deadly attack in southwestern Iran.
Habib Chaab, an Iranian ethnic Arab separatist leader, was drugged and kidnapped by a network working ""on behalf of Iran's intelligence service"" after being lured into flying to Turkey by an Iranian intelligence operative, a senior official said.
Last week an Iranian diplomat accused of planning to bomb a meeting of an exiled opposition group was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a court in Belgium, the first trial of an Iranian official for suspected terrorism in Europe since Iran's 1979 revolution.

The two officers, Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe, were arraigned on felony assault charges two days after the June 4 incident outside City Hall in which local rights activist Martin Gugino, then 75, was shoved, fell and hit his head.
But Erie County District Attorney John Flynn Jr. said on Thursday that a grand jury had dismissed the case, despite his own belief that a crime had been committed.
""We have a system in place here where society makes those decisions, not one person,"" Flynn told a press conference. ""And that’s the way it should be, and that’s the way it was.”
Flynn said he was duty-bound to charge the officers with felony assault - even though he did not believe their actions “rose to the level of a felony” - because of a state law that protects people 65 and older from attacks by those at least 10 years younger.
Saying he expected to be criticized for the grand jury's decision, Flynn insisted he made a forceful case but declined to elaborate about the panel's proceedings, which are secret.
The video, shot by a local reporter and seen by tens of millions of people on the Internet, shows Torgalski pushing Gugino before he fell and McCabe about to kneel toward the man sprawled on the sidewalk before being moved along by a supervisor. 
Gugino, who had approached the officers during a protest for racial justice after a curfew had been imposed, was rushed to a hospital with a critical head injury, from which he recovered. 

The officers, both members of a police tactical unit, were initially suspended without pay. But they were back on the payroll 30 days later and the incident will now be the focus of an internal affairs investigation, the Buffalo News reported.

GENEVA (Reuters) - - All hypotheses are still open in the World Health Organization's search for the origins of COVID-19, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing on Friday.
A WHO-led mission in China said this week that it was not looking further into the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab, which it considered highly unlikely. The United States has said it will review the mission's findings.
""Some questions have been raised as to whether some hypotheses have been discarded. Having spoken with some members of the team, I wish to confirm that all hypotheses remain open and require further analysis and study,"" Tedros said.

""Some of that work may lie outside the remit and scope of this mission. We have always said that this mission would not find all the answers, but it has added important information that takes us closer to understanding the origins of the COVID-19 virus,"" he said.
The mission has said its main hypotheses are that the virus originated in a bat, although there are several possible scenarios for how it passed to humans, possibly first by infecting another species of animal.
The former administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which left office last month, said it believed the virus may have escaped from a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan. China has strongly denied this, and says the Wuhan Institute of Virology was not studying related viruses.

449,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 12:45PM ET</span>",Tough migration enforcement south of border key to Biden plans,"By Laura Gottesdiener, Frank Jack Daniel and Ted Hesson
CIUDAD HIDALGO, Mexico (Reuters) - ​In the days before U.S. President Joe Biden's inauguration, Mexican soldiers patrolling the banks of the wide Suchiate River found few migrants amid the flow of trade across the water from Guatemala.
The likely explanation lay hundreds of miles to the south, where baton-wielding Guatemalan security forces beat back one of the largest U.S.-bound migrant caravans ever assembled, according to a Reuters photographer and other witnesses.
""We're scared,"" Honduran migrant Rosa Alvarez told a reporter by telephone as she fled with many others toward the nearby hills, two young children in tow.
The operation was part of a U.S.-led effort, pursued by past American administrations and accelerated under former President Donald Trump, to pressure first the Mexican and then the Central American governments to halt migration well short of the U.S. border.
Under the Biden administration, the same general strategy is likely to continue, at least for the near term, according to six U.S. and Mexican sources with knowledge of diplomatic discussions.
Biden has been gradually unraveling many Trump-era immigration policies. Yet the new administration has encouraged Mexico and Guatemala to keep up border enforcement in their countries to stem northward migration, according to two Mexican officials and a U.S official, all speaking on condition of anonymity.
Diplomats and experts at immigration think tanks told Reuters that it would be politically expedient for the Biden administration to keep asylum seekers and other migrants from trekking en masse to the country's southern border, especially as Mexico and the United States are being ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic and seeking to contain its spread.
They also said any rush to the U.S border could hand Biden’s political opponents ammunition to sink the rest of his immigration agenda, which includes providing a pathway to citizenship for immigrants already in the United States and reducing asylum application backlogs.
The Biden administration has not specifically endorsed militarized action, however, and has vowed to treat migrants with dignity.
""They want the relevant countries to have appropriate border controls,"" said one former U.S. official familiar with the matter, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It doesn't mean that they hold everyone back and beat back migrants. That's not the objective here.""
A White House spokesperson declined to comment, referring Reuters to recent public remarks by Roberta Jacobson, a special assistant to the president specializing on the southwest border.
Jacobson told reporters on a recent call that the administration had not talked with Mexico specifically about how it deploys its security forces on its own soil. She added, however, that the two countries' diplomats, as well as Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, had spoken about the need to jointly work on managing migration. She stressed the importance of addressing its root causes such as poverty and corruption.
Two other administration officials, including Juan Gonzalez, the president's lead adviser on Latin American policy, recently underscored U.S. support for immigration enforcement well south of the U.S. border.
""I need to recognize here the work that (Guatemalan) President (Alejandro) Giammattei has done in managing the migration flows when the caravans started out,"" Gonzalez told the El Salvadoran investigative website El Faro after the January crackdown.
The Mexican government has informed the new U.S. administration that it intends to keep current immigration enforcement measures in place because it is in Mexico's sovereign interest to secure its own borders, one senior Mexican official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Biden already faces pressure from leading Republican lawmakers who accuse his administration of undermining immigration enforcement.
The new administration has ""sketched out a massive proposal for blanket amnesty that would gut enforcement of American laws while creating huge new incentives for people to rush here illegally at the same time,"" Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on the Senate floor after Biden's first day in office.
Biden officials have repeatedly pleaded with asylum seekers not to migrate now, stressing that the administration needs time to enact its domestic immigration changes.
At the same time, human rights advocates say leaning on Mexico and Central America to halt mass migration violates people's rights to seek asylum. It also potentially subjects them to further violence and abuse on their journeys north, they say.
""We've seen time and time again that militarized approaches don't really stop people from leaving,"" said Daniella Burgi-Palomino, co-director of the Latin America Working Group, an organization dedicated to influencing U.S. policy.
'REGIONAL CONTAINMENT'
About 8,000 people, including many women and children, joined January's migrant caravan shortly before Biden's inauguration, aiming to arrive in the United States after he took office.
The Trump administration had all but locked down the U.S. southern border and forced some asylum applicants to wait for months in Mexico. It also had prodded Mexican and Central American governments, largely through threats, to confront migrant caravans.
For instance, Mexico in 2019 deployed 20,000 National Guard and soldiers to police its borders to stave off Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Mexican goods.
Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras coordinated a regional containment strategy ahead of the January caravan, Martin Alonso Borrego, director of Latin America and the Caribbean for Mexico's foreign ministry, told Reuters. 
After a Jan. 11 meeting among the countries, Guatemala declared emergency powers in nearly a third of its states and deployed up to 4,000 soldiers, police officers and air force personnel.
As Biden's inauguration approached, rumors that a large migrant group was forming in Honduras prompted Mexico to beef up its military presence at its own southern border and send buses to Guatemala to aid in the return of caravan members.
The crackdown in mid-January provided some respite to Mexican troops on the Suchiate River. It also inspired fear among migrants.
Honduran migrant Alvarez and her family spent days in Guatemala's hills trying to make their way toward the Mexican border. ""We're without money and food,"" she said, before Reuters lost touch with her.
In the mid-January confrontation in Guatemala, the Reuters photographer and other witnesses saw a wall of security forces confront hundreds of migrants, beating some and deploying tear gas. Some migrants threw rocks. Guatemalan immigration authorities reported an unspecified number of injuries.
Guatemala's human rights ombudsman Jordan Rodas said ""it was outrageous to see the scenes of how the military brutally received our Honduran brothers and sisters."" 
Immigration experts and people familiar with the Biden administration's thinking say Washington may try to exercise more oversight down the line over how Mexican and Central American authorities conduct border containment operations.
Proponents of greater U.S. immigration control say it would be a mistake to pull back on the Trump-era pressure.

""It's not clear how effectively Guatemala and Mexico can block them, especially if the numbers get bigger and especially if they are not pressured to do so by Biden,"" said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors lower levels of immigration.

Duterte, a firebrand nationalist who openly disapproves of the long-standing U.S. military alliance, unilaterally cancelled the Visiting Force Agreement last year in an angry response to an ally being denied a U.S. visa.
The withdrawal period has been twice extended, however, to create what Philippine officials say is a window for better terms to be agreed.
Speaking to Philippine troops on Friday after inspecting newly acquired air assets, Duterte said: ""I'd like to put on notice if there is an American agent here, from now on, you want the Visiting Forces Agreement done? You have to pay.
""It is a shared a responsibility, but your share of responsibility does not come free, after all, when the war breaks out we all pay,"" Duterte said, alluding to Washington and Beijing stepping up military activities in the South China Sea.
Duterte did not elaborate, or say how much U.S. should pay. 
The U.S. embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on his remarks.
The Philippines defence apparatus want to keep the VFA as it has been vital in boosting the capabilities of under-resourced Philippine forces through dozens of annual joint training exercises, Duterte's defence minister has said. 
U.S. and Philippine officials met on Thursday to settle differences over the VFA, the first under U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, which has reaffirmed the alliance in the face of China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea.
""(The United States) is free to advance their troops in our land...We do not like it because we want to remain neutral,"" Duterte said. ""But the exigency of the moment requires their presence here, I am okay with that.""
Relations between the United States and its former east Asian colony have been complicated by Duterte's rise to power in 2016 and his frequent statements condemning U.S. foreign policy, and his open embrace of China.

Duterte reiterated that he wanted to avoid confrontation with China over maritime claims that ""would lead to something we can hardly afford"".

Hotels, cinemas, and theatres reopened at a maximum of half their usual capacity in a cautious move designed to ease restrictions without spurring a new surge in cases. 
Bielecki, 35, started his day at Kino Muranow, an arthouse cinema in central Warsaw, watching the comedy ""Palm Springs"", and planned to spend much of the rest of the day crossing the city to find open cinemas. 
""There isn't a huge selection of films or cinemas but ... I definitely plan, as much as my energy and possibilities allow, to see many films today,"" Bielecki told Reuters.
Another moviegoer, Remigiusz Kadelski, 39, said he had found it hard to get used to watching films on a laptop, because, for him, cinema was ""experiencing some emotions together which you are absolutely not able to recreate at home"".
The government will decide in two weeks whether the looser restrictions can be maintained. Many larger cinema chains opted to stay closed due to the uncertainty.
The number of new infections has levelled off in recent weeks. On Friday, Poland reported 6,379 new cases and 247 deaths.
Ski slopes and swimming pools also were able to reopen, but gyms will remain closed and restaurants will still only be able to provide takeaway meals.
Wojciech Szyszko, 70, relished the chance to clip on his skis, trekking to the Gorka Szczesliwicka slope in Warsaw by city bus to be one of the first down when it opened at 10 a.m. 
""The weather is beautiful, the hill is beautifully prepared, the first ski was beautiful,"" a masked and happy Szyszko told Reuters at the bottom. ""If this lift didn't work then I would climb up it by myself and ski down it five times.""
The director of the hill Grzegorz Kwiatkowski told Reuters that he expected many more skiers in the coming days.

The decision, reversing the former Trump administration's blacklisting of the Houthis, is part of a policy shift by U.S. President Joe Biden aimed at easing the world's worst humanitarian crisis and intensifying diplomacy to end Yemen's gruelling civil war.
""This decision is a recognition of the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen,"" Blinken said in a statement.
The war pits the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement against Yemen's internationally recognized government backed by a Saudi-led military coalition.
The Biden administration, other governments, the United Nations and aid organizations shared fears that the sanctions imposed on the Houthis under the designations could strangle food deliveries just as the threat of major famine is rising.
Blinken, however, appeared to signal limits to U.S. tolerance of the Houthi movement. He said three of its leaders - Abdul Malik al-Houthi, Abd al-Khaliq Badr al-Houthi and Abdullah Yahya al-Hakim - will remain subject to U.S. sanctions.
He also said Washington would continue to ""closely monitor"" the activities of the movement and its leaders and is ""actively identifying"" new sanctions targets, especially those responsible for attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and missile strikes on Saudi Arabia. 

""The United States remains clear-eyed about Ansarallah’s malign actions,"" Blinken said, using a term by which the Houthi movement also is known. ""Ansarallah’s actions and intransigence prolong this conflict and exact serious humanitarian costs.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Illegal armed groups in Colombia are using forcibly recruited children and adolescents as ""war machines"" and sexual slaves amid ongoing internal conflict in the country, the government said on Friday.
Violence in Colombia fell after a 2016 peace deal with its largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), but still-active guerrillas and crime gangs continue to target minors for recruitment.
""This crime must be abolished,"" said President Ivan Duque at an event commemorating the international convention that prohibits the use of children in armed conflicts. ""One of the greatest tragedies humanity has seen is the recruitment of minors.""
Armed groups convert children into ""war machines, leading them to the cruelty of extinguishing another life, of being used as human shields for criminal leaders and also being used as sexual slaves for the same commanders,"" Duque said.
Between 2018 and 2020, 313 children and adolescents were forcibly recruited, according to the government's unit responsible for registering victims. Recruitment figures fell 53% in 2020 compared with 2019, when there was a 30% reduction from 2018.
Some children were recruited at as young as six, but 96% were between 12 and 17 years old when they were enlisted, official figures showed. In the last three years 520 minors have left armed groups.
The National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, former FARC fighters who reject the peace deal and crime gangs founded by right-wing ex-paramilitaries are all guilty of child recruitment, the government says.
In some areas - including the Pacific city of Buenaventura, where recent gang violence has led to protests and demands for government help - recruitment is made easier by poverty and lack of educational and work opportunities for youth.
Between 1985 and 2020 over 7,400 Colombian minors were forcibly recruited, and around 16,000 children were killed in the conflict.

NACHOD, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Jan Mach had coped with his eastern Czech district hospital's COVID-19 wards filling up - until 22 new arrivals on Monday alone were too much and he had to seek outside help.
On Wednesday, ambulances took 15 patients to hospitals as much as 230 km (140 miles) away, as closer ones were also packed.
""We have been close to our ceiling in the past 14 days, we have touched it several times,"" director Mach said, adding the 339-bed hospital had 120 COVID-19 patients. ""On Monday alone we took in 22 patients and that was beyond our means.""
Nachod and Trutnov, neighbouring districts on the Polish border 150 km east of Prague, are among several regions that have seen incessant spread of the disease, despite a national lockdown.
A new, more infectious variant of the virus first detected in Britain is the likely reason - data from January showed between 45% and 60% of new patients were infected with the UK variant. 
On Friday, the region of 550,000 reported just four free beds in COVID-19 wards and eight in high dependency and intensive care units (ICUs) treating coronavirus patients. 
""We are taking in patients in a more serious condition and younger patients, I mean born 1970 and later, we had not seen that in the autumn,"" Mach said.
Patients who would normally be treated in high-dependency units or ICU have had to be given therapies such as high-flow oxygen on normal wards due to the shortage of beds. 
Mach spoke minutes after overseeing another ICU patient being transferred to another hospital. Staff dressed in full-body protective gear pushed the trolley past piles of equipment boxes, one of them with the hand-written label ""body bags"".
The Czech Republic has ranked among the European countries worst-hit by the pandemic. Only Portugal has reported more new cases per capita in the past two weeks, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
As of Friday morning, the country of 10.7 million had reported 17,902 COVID-19 related deaths.
Still, the parliament voted on Thursday not to extend a national state of emergency, which will lift some of current lockdown measures including the closure of shops, a loosely policed ban on gatherings and a night-time curfew.
Petr Stepanek, chief surgeon in the resuscitation unit at Nachod hospital, said the situation was ""very tense"".

""It is about the 'British' variant,"" Stepanek said. ""If a majority of the population has already had it, thank God. If not, then the situation can become very dramatic.""

MADRID (Reuters) - The number of teenage girls saying they felt pressured into sexual activity has almost doubled in seven years in Spain to more than one in 10 of respondents, a study by the Equality Ministry showed on Friday.
Increased social media and internet usage has helped raise awareness of abuse but also brought new forms of exploitation and risky behaviour, it said, in its first study of gender-based violence and sexist attitudes among 14-20-year-olds since 2013.
""Teenagers' perception of machismo is much keener now thanks to better access to information and global feminist movements,"" State Secretary for Equality Noelia Vera told a news conference.
""But having clear opinions about gender violence doesn't free you from suffering it.""
Almost half of teenage girls said they had been sent sexual photos online and more than two in five had been asked to send sexual photos of themselves, the study showed, while nearly one in four had been asked to engage in virtual sex.
Dangerous online behaviours, such as using a webcam with a stranger or telling them your name, home or school address, all jumped significantly in 2020 compared to 2013, with a quarter of teens admitting they gave a stranger their home address online.
More than 8% of teens said they posted or sent sexually explicit photos of themselves online in 2020, up from 1.7% in 2013 - while nearly one in five met with a stranger they encountered on the internet, close to double the 2013 rate.
On the upside, far fewer girls reported enduring control-based violence such as their partner ""deciding for them down to the last detail"" - down to 5% from 2013's 16% - or isolating them from their friends, which dropped to 3.7% from 11.2%.
The study's director Maria Jose Diaz praised the efforts of teachers and parents but said they were not reaching everyone.
""We have a vaccine, a Spanish vaccine: socio-sexual education which moves away from domination-submission dynamics and towards relationships based on mutual respect and equality,"" she said, noting that more than 17% of girls still reported experiencing psychological abuse and control-based violence.

""But we need to extend that education to the other half of teens who say they've not received it.""

458,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 10:30AM ET</span>",Analysis: Collapsed health system makes Venezuela vaccination campaign an uphill battle,"By Brian Ellsworth and Vivian Sequera
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's deteriorated health system and collapsed economy will make the country one of the toughest places in the region to conduct a coronavirus vaccination campaign, an effort that already trails most of South America, experts said.
The country has one of the region's lowest coverage rates for even basic vaccines, according to regional health figures, driven by years of blackouts, loss of medical personnel and decay of local clinics that are crucial for such campaigns.
Venezuela on Thursday moved a step closer to getting access to COVID-19 vaccines as opposition leaders and officials from President Nicolas Maduro's cash-strapped government began talks on how to pay for inoculations.
But without filling the gaps in its health infrastructure, reaching remote corners of the economically devastated country will prove difficult. That could leave pockets of isolation that undermine the global mitigation effort and boost the risk for the creation of new variants. 
Cold storage facilities are operational in Caracas, but regional distribution centers in state capitals have seen extensive decay of refrigeration units, said Dr. Huniades Urbina, a pediatrician and a member of the National Academy of Medicine.
""You don't accomplish anything by storing the vaccine in Caracas without being able to take it into the provinces,"" Urbina said in an interview. ""In the states, in the regions, they're not prepared with the cold chain (capacity) they need.""
The impact of Venezuela's hyperinflationary economic crisis is evident in the country's vaccination rates, which trail far behind even Haiti's in inoculations for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and hepatitis B shots, according to Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) data. 
CLINICS ABANDONED
Health experts blame years losses of qualified personnel due to mass migration, inadequate budgets for vaccination campaigns, and the abandonment of clinics in rural areas. 
By 2017, vaccination had dropped off so sharply that Venezuela suffered a measles outbreak that was only controlled through a campaign involving PAHO that was meant to ensure that it didn't spread to other countries.
Venezuela blames its current situation on U.S. sanctions that have crippled oil exports and made it more difficult to import goods including medicine. 
The information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Venezuela's economic collapse has fueled the migration of more than 5 million people since 2015, and the situation on the ground has worsened in recent years.
Fuel shortages are now so severe that basic travel is complicated and expensive, creating obvious hurdles to distributing vaccines in remote areas.
Provincial cities have suffered frequent blackouts since a 2019 power outage paralyzed the country for nearly a month, further undermining cold-chain capacity. 
And local humanitarian organizations have denounced a systematic campaign of intimidation of aid workers that has drawn criticism from the United Nations Office on Human Rights, undermining trust among crucial local allies.
Dr. Alberto Paniz-Mondolfi, assistant professor of pathology at Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine in New York, says when he did his residency in Venezuela two decades ago, even clinics in the remote Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) region were fully equipped for vaccine campaigns.
""(Now) you do not have refrigerators in the ambulatory clinics. You do not have secure access to dry ice,"" said Paniz-Mondolfi, who fled Venezuela in 2019 after being threatened by government officials over his research on the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases.

""You go to any community in Venezuela, a remote community in the provinces, most of the ambulatory network has been shut down.""

459,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 10:25AM ET</span>",Trump's defense will make the case for his acquittal on inciting Capitol riot,"By Susan Cornwell and Makini Brice
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's defense lawyers will make their case on Friday why the former president is not guilty of inciting last month's deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol, as the Senate races toward a final vote in his impeachment trial as soon as Saturday.
Trump's lawyer David Schoen said the defense team would take ""three to four hours"" on Friday to lay out its arguments against convicting Trump for inciting the Jan. 6 riot, which sent lawmakers scrambling for safety and resulted in the deaths of five people, including a police officer.
Schoen did not discuss the defense strategy, but Trump's lawyers have argued his rhetoric was protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and that prosecutors had not directly connected the actions of the rioters to Trump.
Democratic prosecutors on Thursday wrapped up two days of arguments for Trump's conviction, saying the Republican knew what would happen when he exhorted supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress gathered to certify Democrat Joe Biden's election win, and that he should be held accountable.
""If he gets back into office and it happens again, we'll have no one to blame but ourselves,"" lead impeachment manager Representative Jamie Raskin told senators.
The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives charged Trump on Jan. 13 with inciting the insurrection, but Democrats are unlikely to gain a Senate conviction and bar Trump from running for office again.
Conviction requires a two-thirds majority in the 100-member Senate, which means at least 17 Republicans would have to defy Trump despite his continued popularity among Republican voters.
On Tuesday, the Senate voted largely along party lines to move ahead with the impeachment trial even though Trump's term ended on Jan. 20. Six of 50 Republican senators broke with their caucus to side with Democrats.
In their arguments, the Democratic prosecutors provided numerous examples of Trump's actions prior to the rampage to illustrate what he intended when he told supporters to go to the Capitol and ""fight like hell"" as lawmakers convened for the election certification.
Trump falsely claimed his Nov. 3 election loss was the result of widespread fraud.
""He knew that egged on by his tweets, his lies and his promise of a 'wild' time in Washington to guarantee his grip on power, his most extreme followers would show up bright and early, ready to attack, ready to engage in violence, ready to 'fight like hell' for their hero,"" Raskin said.
DID IT CHANGE ANY MINDS?
Several Republican senators praised the presentation of the Democratic House prosecutors, although they questioned whether it had changed any minds.
""There was a lot of useful information presented today and the Democrats certainly presented an emotionally jarring and powerful argument, but it doesn't change my opinion that removing a former president from an office he no longer holds is unconstitutional,"" Republican Senator Mike Braun tweeted.
Three Republican senators who are sitting as jurors at the trial - Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) and Mike Lee - met with the Trump defense team on Thursday night to discuss its legal approach, a source familiar with the meeting said.
""We were discussing their strategy for tomorrow and we were sharing our thoughts in terms of where the argument was and where it should go,"" Cruz told reporters.
Republican Senator Bill Cassidy told reporters he wanted to hear the defense respond to the time line laid out by House prosecutors detailing Trump's inaction as the riot developed and his call to a senator even as lawmakers were being evacuated.
""Now, presumably since we were at that point being evacuated I think ... there was some awareness of the events,"" Cassidy said. ""And so what I hope the defense does is explain that.""
Neither side has so far announced an intention to call witnesses, leaving senators on track for final arguments and a vote as soon as Saturday.

Trump is the first U.S. president to be impeached twice and the first to face trial after leaving office. His first impeachment trial, which stemmed from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden, ended in an acquittal a year ago in what was then a Republican-controlled Senate.

460,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 10:20AM ET</span>",Prominent anti-Trump Republicans reject third party,"By Tim Reid, James Oliphant, David Morgan and Joseph Ax
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of former Republican officials considering a new center-right political party to counter former President Donald Trump's influence would face steep challenges in shaking up a U.S. political system that has favored two-party rule throughout its history.
Reuters exclusively reported on Wednesday that more than 120 Republicans - including former elected officials, along with former administrators under Trump and former presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush - met virtually on Feb. 5 to discuss forming a third party or a new center-right faction.
Two of the most prominent anti-Trump Republicans in Congress - Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois - rejected the idea of a breakaway party in statements to Reuters on Thursday. Other Republican critics of Trump expressed similar skepticism - arguing a third party would accomplish little beyond splitting the votes of conservatives and helping Democrats get elected.
The resistance to a third party among some of Trump's toughest Republican critics underscores the extreme difficulty of such a political revolt. Such an effort would require walking away from the Republican Party's massive political infrastructure - staff, money, connections and data on donors and voters - that would take years if not decades to build from scratch.
An upstart party would also have little chance of succeeding without a charismatic leader who could capture the loyalties of millions of disaffected voters, said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was a senior advisor to the Republican primary campaign of Marco Rubio, a Senator from Florida, in 2016. 
""If somebody was going to start a third party that was going to gain some traction, it would be Trump"" and not his opponents, said Conant.
Kinzinger joined the Feb. 5 video conference of the anti-Trump group and spoke for about five minutes, a spokeswoman told Reuters. But the congressman wants to ""reform the party from within,"" she said. He has recently formed a new political action committee to support Republican primary challengers running against pro-Trump House Republicans such as Matt Gaetz, of Florida, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia. 
A spokesman for Cheney told Reuters in a statement that she opposes ""any effort to split the party,"" saying it would only make it easier for Democrats to enact policies that conservatives oppose.
Both Cheney and Kinzinger were among just 10 House Republicans, a small minority, who voted to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
A more likely outcome of an anti-Trump movement would be for centrist Republicans to try to purge Trumpism from within its own ranks, said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida who recently quit the party in protest of Trump and declared himself an independent.
A party of center-right conservatives could never create a broad enough coalition to win national elections, Jolly said. And Trump has effectively undercut his more moderate opponents among Republican voters, he said, by ridiculing them as ""Never Trumpers"" and ""RINOs"" (Republicans in Name Only). 
""It's just impossible to escape the 'never Trump' label,"" he said.
Others argue it would be much harder to wrest power over the Republican Party from Trump. 
""Let's not kid ourselves; we are not going to change this party,"" said Jim Glassman, a former undersecretary of state under George W. Bush.
Glassman gave a five-minute presentation on the Feb. 5 call advocating for a new party. Any effort to reclaim the party would be ""a soul-deadening slog,"" he told participants.
He told Reuters on Thursday that he sees the Republican Party as now thoroughly in thrall to Trump - and beyond repair.
""I thought, if Trump lost by 7 million votes, there may have been a chance to do that,"" he said in an interview. ""But events since the election have made clear that's not going to happen.""
Asked on Wednesday about the discussions for a third party, Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, said: ""These losers left the Republican Party when they voted for Joe Biden.""
SPLIT ON STRATEGY
Glassman believes there are enough Republican donors who are disgusted with Trump and willing to finance a new party. He believes a new conservative party could also attract maybe one fifth of Republican voters who disapprove of Trump, along with some independents and Democrats. Further, he said, running third-party candidates in House and Senate races would force the Trumpist candidates to tack to the center in general elections and temper the shrill partisanship of those races.
Many people at the Feb. 5 virtual gathering agreed with Glassman. In a poll of participants, about 40% of those in attendance supported creating an entirely new party, according to one source with direct knowledge of the discussions. About 20% favored creating a faction within the party, and an equal number supported creating a faction outside the party, though it remained unclear exactly how such an independent faction would operate.
While they disagreed on strategy, participants in the meeting said, attendees united on the need to organize and advocate for a return to ""principled conservatism"" that prizes the rule of law and adherence to the Constitution, ideals they believe Trump has violated.
Among the group at the Feb. 5 meeting was Elizabeth Neumann, former deputy chief of staff in the Department of Homeland Security under Trump. She's enraged at Republican lawmakers' continued support for Trump in the wake of his stolen-election claims, which she had repeatedly warned - before the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riots - could lead to violence. Now she wants to politically target the lawmakers who voted, in the hours after the deadly insurrection, to overturn the presidential election result - and she's open to any strategy that might work.
""I hear arguments that we should break off and form a new party, or we should stay inside the party. There will come a time when this crystallizes,"" Neumann told Reuters on Thursday. ""At the moment, I'm more focused on the individual people and holding them accountable."" 
HISTORY OF THIRD-PARTY FAILURES
Historically, third parties have generally failed in U.S. elections, particularly at the presidential level, often serving more as spoilers than true contenders.
Theodore Roosevelt, a charismatic war hero, had served two previous terms as president but lost in 1912 when he ran as a Progressive (NYSE:PGR) - or ""Bull Moose"" - Party candidate, finishing second, with more votes than the Republican candidate, in a three-way race ultimately won by Democrat Woodrow Wilson. That was the last time any third-party candidate won more votes than either of the two major party presidential candidates.
More recently, the most successful third-party candidate was Texas billionaire Ross Perot, whose self-financed Reform Party campaign in 1992 earned him 19% of the vote in a race won by Democrat Bill Clinton, who unseated incumbent Republican President George H.W. Bush.
In other cases, supporters of losing presidential nominees have blamed third-party candidates for siphoning off voters. In 2016, some backers of Democrat Hillary Clinton were frustrated by Green Party candidate Jill Stein, whose percentage of the vote was greater than Clinton's margin of defeat in key states.
Republican Senator Rand Paul, asked about the prospects for a new party, told Reuters: ""That'd be a good way to allow the Democrats to always win.""
Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn laughed when asked by Reuters about a possible third party.
""More power to 'em,"" he said. 
Cornyn, however, predicted shared opposition to President Biden's agenda will hold Republicans together. He said he hopes life in the Republican Party will return to something more normal in Trump's absence. 

""It's made us all a little crazy,"" Cornyn said.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters at his regular morning news conference that he supports Biden's executive order, one of his first actions on becoming U.S. president.
""We think it's good that they don't build any more walls,"" said Lopez Obrador, noting that several past U.S. presidents have extended border barriers during their terms.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump made the border wall one of his top issues dating back to his 2016 campaign, in which he also insisted repeatedly that Mexico would pay for it. He later sought funding from the U.S. Congress for the project.
Lopez Obrador also urged U.S.-bound migrants to hold back from seeking to cross illegally just because of the change in presidents.
""The border is not wide open,"" he said.

The U.S. government next week will begin to process asylum seekers forced to wait in Mexico under a controversial program put in place by Trump, officials said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The sisters of prominent Saudi women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul said on Thursday they wanted real justice for her, and the lifting of a travel ban, the day after she was released from prison on a suspended sentence.
Hathloul, 31, has campaigned for women's right to drive and to end Saudi's male guardianship system. She spent nearly three years behind bars in a case that drew international condemnation, and remains forbidden to leave Saudi Arabia for five years.
Rights groups and her family say Hathloul was subjected in prison to electric shocks, waterboarding, flogging and sexual assault - accusations that Saudi Arabia denies.
""What we want now is real justice,"" Lina al-Hathloul told an online news conference, speaking from Brussels. ""That Loujain is completely, unconditionally free."" 
She said her sister would fight the travel ban, and that their parents were also unable to leave the country.
Another sister, Alia, said Hathloul was now at the home of their parents, who were overjoyed to have her back. The first thing Hathloul did after speaking to her siblings, they said, was to go to the supermarket for ice cream.
Lina tweeted a picture of Hathloul on Wednesday, smiling but thinner than before, with a new grey streak in her hair.
The sisters said she had lost weight from the hunger strikes she had staged to protest against her prison conditions.
""She's very strong,"" said Alia, who also lives in Brussels. ""I'm so proud of her ability to keep high hopes, to be very positive and to say 'OK, I went through horrible things - but life continues'.""
Loujain al-Hathloul was arrested in March 2018 in the United Arab Emirates, where she was studying, and flown back to Saudi Arabia against her will. 
She was one of at least a dozen women's rights activists who were arrested as Saudi Arabia ended a ban on women driving cars, at least two of whom are still in prison, human rights sources said.
ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE
She was given a sentence of five years and eight months last December under broad cybercrime and terrorism laws, for activities including calling for an end to male guardianship and communicating with global rights groups, activists, foreign diplomats and international media. U.N. rights experts said the charges were spurious.
Hathloul served most of the custodial half of her sentence, which is suspended for a further two years and 10 months.
""She is very determined to use all means that exist within the legal framework in Saudi Arabia ... in order to obtain her rights,"" Alia said. ""She was tortured and she cannot forget this very dramatic period in her life.""
Loujain told her siblings that she had not initially mentioned the torture during phone calls from prison because guards had held an ""electroshock device"" to her ear and threatened to use it if she mentioned her treatment. 
An appeals court dismissed the torture claims on Tuesday, citing a lack of evidence, her family said.
In a written statement on Thursday, the government's media office said Hathloul had failed to accuse any specific person of torture or provide evidence, and that both a lower court and a court of appeal had therefore found that ""the validity of the case was not proven"".
The office said Saudi laws ""prohibit torture in all its forms"" and require punishment for those found guilty.
Asked whether Loujain would continue her activism, her sisters said her release was conditional, but that they could not elaborate.
Since her charge sheet, which the family made public last year, referred to her social media posts, she risked violating the terms of her release if she posted online again, Lina said.

The sisters were unsure if they are under a travel ban themselves, and said they would not yet risk returning to Saudi Arabia.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 09:32AM ET</span>",Three wounded in Myanmar as hundreds of thousands of protesters defy junta,"(Reuters) - Supporters of ousted Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi clashed with police on Friday as hundreds of thousands joined nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations in defiance of the junta's call to halt mass gatherings.
The United Nations human rights office said more than 350 people, including officials, activists and monks, have been arrested in Myanmar since the Feb. 1 military coup, including some who face criminal charges on ""dubious grounds"".
The U.N. rights investigator for Myanmar told a special session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva that there were ""growing reports, photographic evidence"" that security forces have used live ammunition against protesters, in violation of international law.
Special Rapporteur Thomas Andrews urged the U.N. Security Council to consider imposing sanctions and arms embargoes.
Myint Thu, Myanmar’s ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, told the session that Myanmar did not want ""to stall the nascent democratic transition in the country,"" and would continue international cooperation.
Friday's mostly peaceful protests were the biggest so far, and came a day after Washington imposed sanctions on generals who led the takeover.
Three people were wounded when police fired rubber bullets to break up a crowd of tens of thousands in the southeastern city of Mawlamyine, a Myanmar Red Cross official told Reuters.
Footage broadcast by Radio Free Asia showed police charging at protesters, grabbing one and smashing him in the head. Stones were then thrown at police before the shots were fired.
""Three got shot – one woman in the womb, one man on his cheek and one man on his arm,"" said Myanmar Red Cross official Kyaw Myint, who witnessed the clash.
Several people in Mawlamyine were arrested but later released when a thousands-strong crowd stood outside the police station and demanded they be freed, according to live footage broadcast by Radio Free Asia.
Doctors have said they do not expect a 19-year-old woman shot during a protest in the capital Naypyitaw on Tuesday to survive. She was hit in the head with a live round fired by police, witnesses said. 
In the biggest city Yangon on Friday, hundreds of doctors in white duty coats and scrubs marched past the golden Shwedagon pagoda, the country's holiest Buddhist site, while in another part of town, football fans wearing team kits marched with humorous placards denouncing the military.
Other demonstrations took place in Naypyitaw, the coastal town of Dawei, and in Myitkyina, the capital of northern Kachin state, where young men played rap music and staged a dance-off.
Social media giant Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said it would cut the visibility of content run by Myanmar’s military, saying they had ""continued to spread misinformation"" after seizing power. 
The generals have sought to justify their takeover by saying there was fraud in an election last November won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), a claim rejected by the country's election committee.
In a letter read out to the rights council in Geneva, some 300 elected parliamentarians from Myanmar called on the United Nations to investigate ""gross human rights violations"" committed by the military since its coup.
CALL FOR 'MORE ACTIONS'
Supporters of the NLD welcomed the U.S. sanctions but said tougher action was needed.
""We are hoping for more actions than this as we are suffering every day and night of the military coup here in Myanmar, "" Suu Kyi supporter Moe Thal, 29, told Reuters.
Myint Thu, Myanmar's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, told the special council session that his government wanted ""better understanding of the prevailing situation in the country, and constructive engagement and cooperation from the international community.""
""We do not want to stall the nascent democratic transition in the country,"" he said.
The coup has prompted the biggest demonstrations since a 2007 ""Saffron Revolution"" that ultimately became a step toward the democratic change that has now been halted.
Friday's protests marked the seventh consecutive day of protests, including one on Thursday outside the Chinese embassy where NLD supporters accused Beijing of backing the junta, something China has denied.
Security forces carried out more arrests overnight Thursday.
PRISONER AMNESTY
The junta remitted the sentences of more than 23,000 prisoners on Friday, saying the move was consistent with ""establishing a new democratic state with peace, development and discipline"" and would ""please the public"". 
The Frontier Myanmar news magazine reported the prisoners given amnesty included four supporters of a gunman who shot dead a prominent Suu Kyi ally and constitutional lawyer in 2017.
The protests have revived memories of almost half a century of direct army rule, punctuated by bloody crackdowns, until the military began relinquishing some power in 2011.
The generals have promised to stick to the 2008 constitution and hand over power after elections, but on Friday the junta said it would ""work for the emergence of a constitution that is in alignment and harmony with the Democratic Federal Union"". 

No date has yet been set for elections.

During CCTV's four-hour show which typically draws hundreds of millions of viewers, performers appeared on stage wearing outfits that approximated African clothing and had darkened their skin with make-up.
""The New Year Gala director team is just stupid and vicious,"" said one of a number of users who took to Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), China's Twitter-like social media platform, to criticise the skit. 
""Is there any difference between Chinese people doing blackface and white people slanting their eyes to make fun of Asians?""
China's foreign ministry said the integration of cultural elements from other countries into Chinese shows was a sign of respect and the inclusion of the African segment was not a diplomatic issue.
""If anyone wants to seize on the CCTV Spring Festival Gala programme to make a fuss, or even sow discord in relations between China and African countries, they obviously have ulterior motives,"" it said in a statement to Reuters. 
The gala sparked similar controversy in 2018 over a skit featuring actress Lou Naiming. She appeared on stage in colourful garb, her face and arms coloured brown, carrying a fruit basket on her head and accompanied by someone costumed as a monkey. (https://reut.rs/3p7KpxW) 
Organisations and advocates for Africans in China also lambasted the show, which aired Thursday evening.
""While supporters of the practice allege that blackface centres on empathy & realism, it’s difficult to disassociate it from a long history of minstrelsy & fixation on problematic caricatures,"" Black China Caucus, an activist group, said on Twitter. 
""Next year, we hope organizers decide to end this practice & hire some of thousands of Black people living in many parts of China.""
A representative for CCTV could not be reached for comment on Friday, a public holiday.

The show, which this year celebrated Chinese medical workers and the country's space programme, has been a television staple since it was first broadcast in 1983.

RAINI CHAK LATA, India (Reuters) - For three days, Sushama Rana waited at a makeshift dirt helipad in the Indian Himalayas to return to her village and look for her missing brother-in-law.
Yashpal Rana was herding goats when a flash flood swept down a remote valley on Sunday, smashing everything in its path including two hydroelectric power stations.
More than 200 people are feared killed, although most of those are still missing. [nL4N2KI1YE]
The wall of water also swept several bridges into the valley, home to more than a thousand people spread over 13 villages. 
An eight-seater Airbus helicopter more often used to carry tourists has begun ferrying supplies to the villages, some of which are suffering from intermittent power and water.
But it is also carrying people back to their home villages to mourn. 
Yashpal married his wife a year ago, and is the father of a four-month-old son.
His family has given up hope of finding him alive.
""We just want to find his body and perform his last rites,"" Sushama said. 
The valley is home to a key paramilitary post by the Chinese border, and many of the troops, known as the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), are helping in the relief work from a command post at a primary school in Lata, one of the affected villages.
Some can now only be accessed via a 5km trek on foot, Deputy Commandant Raj, the officer in charge of the operation said. Dozens of solar powered lamps are being sent up towards the border to those without power.
The Indian military's Mi-17 and Chinook helicopters are useless when trying to access the villages, perched on steep hills with little flat ground. 
Instead, the relief operation is relying on a commercial craft - normally used for pleasure rides at a nearby ski resort - to land on a narrow strip of concrete perched by the Dauliganga river.
Jagged, snow-capped peaks loom over the valley, which is covered in forests of pine and fir.
In contrast to the mud and tangled metal remnants downstream, the crystalline Dauliganga – a tributary of the Ganges river worshipped as a god by many Indians – sparkles in the sun.
Reuters travelled on one of the relief missions into the valley, with returning locals in the passenger seats and sacks of rice and lentils in the helicopter's small hold. 
But in Raini Chak Lata, the first village in the valley to be cut off, the most pressing issue is not food, but processing the events of Sunday's disaster, the causes of which are still be to be conclusively determined.
""Nobody wants to eat when family members are not able to come,"" Yashpal's brother Rajpal said.
Yashpal had two postgraduate business degrees, according to Rajpal, but was not able to find a job. He had returned to Raini Chak Lata, and was down at the river bank with the family's goats when the torrent of water, mud and dust came roaring down the valley. 
""He is probably somewhere there,"" he said.
When Sushama saw the first helicopter of the day on Friday, she wept and ran towards it, before being held back by workers as the blades swept up a cloud of dust. 
Authorities have transported more than 300 people since the disaster, but the list of people wanting to ride is long. 
Finally, she was able to board the final flight of the day, which swept over destroyed dams.
She clutched her shawl as she disembarked. 

""Somehow, after waiting for three days, I have finally arrived,"" she said, walking the mile to the village on foot.

The operator said in a statement on Friday that it hoped to resume distribution, but needed a valid licence to do so.
The development comes a week after London revoked a licence for distributing CGTN in Britain, leading China on Friday to bar the BBC from its television networks.
A spokesman for regulators in North Rhine-Westphalia, one of the regions where distribution has been paused, said that CGTN had until now been distributed under a British licence, and that this now no longer applied.
It was unclear if the British licence no longer applied specifically because of Britain's withdrawal of it, or because Britain was no longer in the European Union's single market, whose members frequently recognizes each other's regulatory decisions.
""We are currently in discussions regarding the withdrawal of the licence both with regional media authorities and the broadcaster's representatives in order to clarify the legal situation,"" the company said.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - An anti-establishment party was expected to take the lead in parliamentary elections in Kosovo on Sunday, complicating Western efforts to broker an end to a territorial dispute with Serbia that has hobbled its 13 years of independence.
The Vetevendosje party's growing popularity has shifted the political balance in the small Balkan state, which declared independence from Serbia nine years after NATO bombing ended a crackdown on separatists by then-Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic.
Opinion polls predict it will win between 45 and 55 percent of the vote among ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the 1.9 million population. That would be nearly double its score in 2019 although it may still need a partner to govern.
Serbia, backed by Russia, does not recognise Kosovo's independence, citing the need to protect the rights of its Serb minority. Numerous EU and U.S. negotiators have failed to secure a compromise to allow it to join international organisations such as the United Nations and NATO.
Vetevendosje argues there can be no compromise with Serbia and has campaigned against widespread graft in Kosovo during two decades of rule by parties led by former separatist fighters.
A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) campaign has won it support among young people, including the many who have moved abroad to try to find work. One in three people are unemployed in what is the poorest country in the Western Balkans.
Faton Byqmeti, 27, flew in from France to cast his ballot.
""It would be good to get rid of the thieves,"" he told Reuters. ""We hope the Vetevendosje people will do something, that’s why we came from abroad to vote.""
Vetevendosje may have to join forces with either the now-ruling Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) or Alliance for the Future of Kosovo (AAK), but analysts foresaw a change in the political elite.
""Those ruling Kosovo for the past 20 years will be thrown out of political life in Kosovo and we will see new politicians,"" said Nexhmedin Spahiu, a 55-year-old professor from the northern town of Mitrovica, home to many ethnic Serbs.
Naim Rashiti an analyst with the Balkans Policy Research Group said Vetevendosje leader Albin Kurti would face the same dilemmas as his predecessors over how to fortify Kosovo's independence.
Former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, whose AAK party could emerge as a king-maker, says Kosovo should not be held hostage to a deal with Serbia.

""We might as well look for other options and another option would be referendum and becoming a union with Albania,"" he told Reuters.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo 2020 Olympics chief Yoshiro Mori resigned on Friday and apologised again for sexist remarks that sparked a global outcry, leaving the troubled Olympics searching for a chief five months from the opening ceremony.
The resignation of former prime minister Mori, 83, will further erode confidence in the organisers' ability to pull off the postponed Summer Games during a coronavirus pandemic.
A selection committee made up of an equal number of men and women, and centred around athletes, would choose a new president, Tokyo 2020 chief executive Toshiro Muto told a news conference after a meeting of a board of advisers.
He did not say when the decision would be made but it had to be done ""urgently"".
""Regarding qualities of a new president ... experience in Olympics and Paralympics ... Gender equality or diversity and inclusion ... we need a person that has a really high-level of understanding of that,"" Muto said.
Among the possible candidates, media said, was Olympics Minister Seiko Hashimoto, 56, a seven-time Olympian and pioneering female lawmaker. Her first name is based on the Japanese words for the Olympic flame and she was born just days before the 1964 Tokyo Olympics opened. 
Hashimoto later told reporters she had not been asked to replace Mori and she sought to reassure the public that Japan would stay focused on preparations.
Mori sparked a furore when he said during an Olympic committee meeting this month that women talk too much, setting off a chorus of calls for him to be sacked. He initially refused to step down.
""My inappropriate comments caused big trouble. I'm sorry,"" Mori said at the beginning of a meeting of senior organising committee officials on Friday, adding that the most important thing was for the Tokyo Olympics to be a success. 
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it was ""as committed as ever"" to staging the Games, which are due to open on July 23.
""The IOC will continue working hand-in-hand with his successor to deliver safe and secure Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 in 2021,"" IOC President Thomas Bach said in a statement. 
'DAMAGE'
Mori on Thursday had asked the mayor of the Olympic Village, 84-year-old Saburo Kawabuchi, to take over the job but by Friday, amid public dismay that the chosen successor was another older man, media reported that Kawabuchi turned the job down.
Broadcaster Fuji News Network quoted a government source as saying: ""We can't give the impression that things have changed unless we install a woman or see a generational shift.""
Top government spokesman Katsunobu Kato declined to comment on the issue except to say things would be done according to procedures and in a transparent way.
The Mori controversy has done ""serious reputational damage"" to the Tokyo Olympics, said one source involved in the Games, requesting anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter and adding that many officials want a woman to replace Mori.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, herself a pioneer as Tokyo's first female leader, avoided a direct answer when asked during a news conference who Mori's successor should be, but said the person should embody Olympic ideals of inclusivity and be somebody the world can accept.
""Diversity and harmony - that's something that the person at the top needs to understand, embody and broadcast,"" she said.
Tammy Parlour, head of the Women’s Sports Trust in Britain, told Reuters in an email that the Olympics were a chance to showcase equality.

""The wider issue is not what one man says though, but how the Olympic movement can capitalise on its visibility to promote brilliant women across all sports and create greater diversity behind the scenes in leadership positions,"" she said.

The warnings come nearly six years after the outbreak of war that rendered 80% of the population reliant on humanitarian aid.
In a report published on Friday, the agencies projected a 22% increase in severe acute malnutrition among children under 5 in Yemen, compared to 2020.
Severe acute malnutrition means there is a risk of death from lack of food. Aden, Hodeidah, Taiz and Sanaa are among the worst-hit areas, the report said. 
""These numbers are yet another cry for help from Yemen where each malnourished child also means a family struggling to survive,"" World Food Program (WFP) Executive Director David Beasley said in a joint statement with the Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO), UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO).
Another 2.3 million under 5s are expected to suffer acute malnutrition in 2021. Acute malnutrition among young children and mothers in Yemen has increased with each year of the conflict, they said, driven by the high rates of disease and rising rates of food insecurity.
Around 1.2 million pregnant or breastfeeding women are projected to be acutely malnourished this year.
Famine has never been officially declared in Yemen. The U.N. says the country is the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
Along with conflict, economic decline and the pandemic, a shortfall of donations last year is also contributing to the worsening humanitarian crisis.
Nutrition and other services that keep millions from starvation and disease are gradually closing across Yemen amid the acute funding shortage.
The agencies said they had only received $1.9 billion of the $3.4 billion required for the country's humanitarian response. Programmes have started to close and scale down.

A Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore the Yemeni government ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthi movement in late 2014. The Houthis say they are fighting corruption.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has won plaudits for gifting and selling COVID-19 vaccines around the world, but it will have to crank up the pace of immunisations at home to meet its targets.
Having reported the world's second-highest number of COVID-19 cases after the United States, India wants to innoculate 300 million people - a fifth of its population - against the virus by August.
However, in four weeks health workers vaccinated only 7.5 million frontline workers on priority, a rate at which it would take India several years to reach its goal.
""Vaccination programmes usually start off slow and then ramp up as logistic and operational issues are sorted out,"" said Gagandeep Kang, Professor of Microbiology at the Christian Medical College in Vellore.
""In India, we are fortunate that supply of vaccines is not a rate-limiting step, but to meet the timelines set by the government, we will have to immunise somewhere between 4 and 5 times more people each day than we are doing today.""
The government says it is ready to step up vaccinations from next month, including by roping in more private hospitals, once identified groups from the general public are given the shots. A government online vaccine platform told Reuters it could handle 10 million inoculations a day.
The health ministry also says India is the fastest to reach the 7 million milestone, though immunisation relative to population has been much higher in many other countries.
Several big Indian states, such as Tamil Nadu and Punjab, have covered fewer than 40% of their high-risk people such as nurses, doctors and hospital cleaning staff, worrying the federal government.
New Delhi has urged states to accelerate vaccinations after a review found ""substantial"" room for improvement, though the government thinks involving too many private players in the campaign might be tricky.
""Administering vaccines needs a system because of the nature of the disease,"" said a senior government official involved in the process, declining to be named citing service rules.
""They have to take details of the person taking it, record and monitor it.""
'STOKING INHIBITIONS'
India, which makes 60% of all vaccines in the world, has gifted or sold COVID-19 shots to 17 countries and has requests from five more. The government, however, told http://164.100.24.220/loksabhaquestions/annex/175/AU1411.pdf parliament this week it was coordinating with the manufacturers to ensure adequate supplies for its own campaign.
It also says http://164.100.24.220/loksabhaquestions/annex/175/AU917.pdf infrastructure such as cold storage and special vehicles are not an issue, while acknowledging vaccine hesitancy among some beneficiaries.
India has deployed the COVAXIN shot developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, as well as a vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University.
Some doctors and the opposition-ruled state of Chhattisgarh, however, are worried about COVAXIN, which was approved last month for emergency use without any efficacy data from a late-stage trial.
The health ministry has chastised Chhattisgarh for ""stoking inhibitions"" over vaccines during a pandemic. India recorded 9,309 daily new cases of COVID-19 on Friday, increasing the total number to 10.88 million cases since the pandemic began. Deaths rose by 87 to a total of 155,447.
""In such unprecedented times, you should help address any vaccine hesitancy and do what's in the best interest of people, not further vested interests!"" Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Twitter in response to a letter from his Chhattisgarh counterpart.
Bharat Biotech has said efficacy data from the late-stage clinical trial will be out by next month. The government has called the shot safe and effective.

India is also expected to approve other shots in coming months, including Russia's Sputnik V and products from Cadila Healthcare,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Friday appeared in court on slander charges he denounced as politically motivated amid mounting tensions between Russia and the West over his treatment. 
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed last week for almost three years for parole violations he said were trumped up. The West has condemned the case and is discussing possible sanctions on Russia. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier on Friday that Moscow was ready to sever ties with the European Union if the bloc hit it with painful economic sanctions. Moscow has accused the West of hysteria over the case. 
Navalny paced around inside a glass cage nicknamed the aquarium in the Moscow courtroom, railed against the slander case in several heated exchanges with the judge, and at one point told her she didn't know the law and needed legal courses. 
The judge reprimanded the 44-year-old lawyer at least 15 times and threatened to have him removed from the hearing. 
Navalny stands accused of defaming a World War Two veteran who took part in a promotional video backing constitutional reforms last year that let Putin run for two more terms in the Kremlin after 2024 if he wants. 
Navalny described the people in the video as traitors and corrupt lackeys. He accuses authorities of using the slander charges to smear his reputation and said his comment was not specifically directed against the veteran in question. 
At the hearing, the grandson of the veteran, who is in his 90s, asked Navalny for a public apology, prompting Navalny to refuse, saying the veteran was being exploited for political ends. 
""Everyone's grandfather here fought in the war! But you're the only one who's pimping him out,"" Navalny said. 
Although the charge, if proven, is punishable by up to two years in jail, his lawyer has said that Navalny cannot face a custodial sentence because the alleged crime was committed before the law was changed to make it a jailable offence.
It remains unclear whether the judge in the case agrees with that analysis. News agency RAPSI cited a lawyer as saying he could face up to a 30-day jail sentence. 
Security at Friday's court hearing was heavy. Police and state bailiffs wearing body armour and carrying weapons were deployed inside the court and around it and the state prosecutor arrived for the hearing with three bodyguards. 
Navalny's arrest and jailing has sparked nationwide street protests in Russia. 

His allies plan to stage a new kind of protest on Sunday and are urging his followers to gather for 15 minutes in residential courtyards across the country, shining their mobile phone torches and lighting candles.

N'DJAMENA (Reuters) - Chad will deploy some 1,000 troops to the tri-border region of Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali to reinforce national armies that, backed by French and European allies, are battling Islamist insurgents, according to French and Chadian sources.
The deployment will be announced during a summit on Feb. 15-16 in the Chadian capital N'Djamena held to tackle the situation in the Sahel, a French presidency official and a senior Chadian security official said. 
It comes as France, which sent troops to the region in 2013 to help repel jihadists who had occupied northern Mali, considers adjusting its military presence. This could entail France pulling some of the 5,100 soldiers that are involved in counter-terrorism operations in the Sahel.
Although France has claimed military successes against Islamist insurgents over the past year, it is searching for an exit strategy. The grinding operation has cost billions of euros and left 55 French soldiers dead, yet violence is persisting with signs it is spreading to coastal West Africa. 
The French official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said President Emmanuel Macron could decide to hold off for a few weeks before adjusting his forces as he continues to consult with Sahel and European partners on the way forward. 
""We now have very encouraging signals of an imminent deployment of the Chadian battalion,"" the official told reporters in a briefing ahead of the summit. Financing from partner countries and equipment from France had been secured. 
Chadian troops were last year mostly engaged in fighting insurgents from Boko Haram and the Islamic State in West Africa in the Lake Chad region.
Chad’s armed forces are among the most respected and battle hardened in West Africa, a reputation forged during decades of regional wars and rebellions, and honed in the 2013 campaign in the deserts of northern Mali.
Their deployment to the tri-border theatre would enable French and other forces to re-orient their military mission to central Mali and to target Islamist leaders linked to al Qaeda.
The Chadian security source said the troops were already en route to the tri-border region, known as Liptako-Gourma, a region slightly larger than Germany, where the allies are trying to wrest back control of terrain from the insurgents.
Niger's ruling party presidential candidate Mohamed Bazoum told a campaign rally in the Tillabery region, situated in Liptako-Gourma, that Chadian troops will be based there.
TALKS WITH JIHADISTS?
The N'Djamena summit will aim to shift the focus of attention to jihadists in central Mali and to economic development and better governance to help reassert state control in areas once dominated by militants, officials said. 
""They are slowly coming round to the idea that the military option has shown its limits and something else needs to be done, but it’s a slow process and is not the official line,"" said a person familiar with French thinking.
Niagale Bagayoko, chair of the African Security Sector Network think tank, said that one of the main issues at stake in discussions would be whether to negotiate with the jihadists. 
Mali and Burkina Faso have said they are open to such talks, an option opposed by France.
""The actors that are the closest to the ground say that without seeing the political dimension of the conflict, we won’t go anywhere,"" Bagayoko said.
Mentioning the two paramount al Qaeda-linked leaders in the region, she said, ""I think France wants to record a victory by eliminating Iyad al Ghali or Amadou Koufa and then say that it's possible at a local level to negotiate with unit chiefs who were affiliated but are less politically dangerous.""

KYIV (Reuters) - Belarusian authorities have brought new charges against two prominent opponents of President Alexander Lukashenko who were jailed during mass protests, accusing them of extremism and trying to seize power, their lawyer said on Friday. 
The charges against Maria Kolesnikova and Maxim Znak could see them jailed for 12 years. Kolesnikova was one of three women who joined forces in an election against Lukashenko last year that prompted a crackdown against months of unrest. 
The charges coincided with Lukashenko staging a two-day ""People's Assembly"" which he says is intended to promote political reform but which the opposition has dismissed as a sham to help the veteran leader cling to power. 
More than 33,000 people have been detained during the protests. The crackdown has prompted new Western sanctions but Lukashenko has refused to resign, backed by diplomatic and financial support from Russia. 
Lawyer Dmitriy Laevski said Znak was being punished ""for not being afraid. For not giving up"". ""There are no legal grounds for any of the charges,"" he added. 
Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus since 1994, had on Thursday promised to hold a referendum on constitutional reform early next year. 
But reformist pledges were laced with triumphant language about Lukashenko saving the country from ""mutiny"".
In a second speech on Friday, Lukashenko suggested Belarusians should ditch their smartphones, saying these were being monitored by the United States. One of the delegates proposed awarding Lukashenko the title ""Hero of Belarus"". 
Referring to himself as an ""authoritarian"" leader, Lukashenko turned his attention to Viktor Babariko, another electoral opponent, who was jailed last year on corruption charges Babariko says were fabricated. 
""Everyone is worried about Babariko: ah, the president's rival was imprisoned. Yes, I don't care about such competitors,"" Lukashenko told the assembly. 
Exiled opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called the assembly a facade. ""Fake elections, fake inauguration, fake democracy. The regime holds Belarusians hostage,"" she wrote on Twitter. 

The U.S. embassy called the assembly ""neither genuine nor inclusive of Belarusian views and therefore does not address the country's ongoing political crisis.""

ERRIGOITI, Spain (Reuters) - A ban on wolf hunting in Spain's rural north is ratcheting up tension between agriculture and conservation, pitting farmers who fear for their livelihood against environmentalists who applaud the move. 
Following a decision by the Environment Ministry last Thursday, protections for the Iberian wolf in the south of Spain will be extended north of the Douro river, where controlled hunting had still been allowed. 
""We think it's a great success,"" said Nerea Larrabe, who manages the Basondo animal refuge in the northern Basque region, where hunting will soon be outlawed.
""It's legislating to make sure an important species from our environment doesn't disappear,"" she told Reuters.
Since the 1960s Spain's Iberian wolf population has rebounded from a few hundred to an estimated 1,500-2,000, with more than 90% of the population concentrated in the north.
As apex predators, wolves help regulate local fauna, but they also kill some 15,000 farm animals across the country each year, according to agricultural association COAG.
""There's the conflict,"" said Peru Lopez de Munain, a livestock vet in the Basque town of Errigoiti. ""If wolves just killed deer, wild boar and rabbits it would be fine, there would be no problem."" 
Farmers in some regions have adapted to living with wolves, building high-fenced pens to protect their flocks, but Lopez de Munain thinks the Basque Country's extensive herding, where sheep roam freely over large areas, is incompatible with a resurgent wolf population.
Hunter and herder Isaac Ruiz Olazabal, whose land winds through the softly rolling hills of the Karrantza valley, agrees.
He recalls how a neighbouring farmer, alerted by vultures circling overhead, returned to his pasture to find two of his animals ripped to shreds.

""Wolves and livestock can't be together,"" he said. ""They're going to have to turn this story around, otherwise many of us farmers are going to disappear.""

483,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 05:25AM ET</span>",Analysis: Google partners brace for hit as search giant threatens Australia exit,"By Byron Kaye and Paresh Dave
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Google's threatened shutdown of its search engine in Australia over a proposed content licensing law would ripple across industries, saddling partners like Apple with a sudden revenue gap and retailers as varied as affordable Kmart to upmarket David Jones with a supply of potentially useless gadgets.
The Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc-owned company last month said it would likely pull its core search function from Australia if the government pushes ahead with a plan to require it and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) to pay media companies an indeterminate fee for news snippets shown on their services. 
Google and Facebook are fighting the first-of-its-kind ""News Media Bargaining Code"" as other countries consider similar efforts to aid publishers that have lost ad sales to the tech companies. In a sign of the Australian effort's potential to shake up the industry,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) - whose Bing search engine stands to benefit from any Google retreat - on Thursday called for the United States to adopt a similar law. 
Australian lawmakers have said the law is needed to help media firms stay afloat and so will press forward despite the threat, which Google formalised in a securities filing last week that stated forced bargaining ""could result in our having to alter or withdraw products and services"". Final passage of the legislation could come as early as next week.
Google is pitching its own payment program with terms it can better control, and last month reached a deal with major publishers in France as well as Reuters.
In Australia, Google users, advertisers and business partners have begun to worry about losing Google, which has a 94% share of the country's search market. The interconnected nature of Google's products means that devices including Android phones, Chromebook laptops and Nest smart speakers could be impaired without search.
""If Google's search function no long longer exists in Australia, that will remove a lot of the features I use on Google Nest,"" said Margaret Morgan, a screenwriter from Sydney who keeps a speaker in most rooms of her house and owns a Google Pixel smartphone.
Google declined to comment for this story. The company has argued that being able to link to other websites for free is essential to search and many other free services that benefit Australians.
REASON TO WORRY
The many companies that get paid in one way or another from Google search revenue have reason to worry, too. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), for one, receives billions of dollars globally to set Google as the default search program on iPhones, the Safari web browser and the Siri voice assistant, U.S. antitrust authorities have said.
Browser makers including Mozilla and Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) get revenue share from Google, as do internet carriers in Australia such as TPG Telecom Ltd's iinet, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd's Optus and Telstra (OTC:TLSYY) Corp. 
The various partners did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.
Exact terms of such deals could not be learned, but estimates based on publicly available information showed that half-a-billion dollars or more could be at stake. 
Total search ad revenue in Australia is pegged at about $3 billion for 2021 by researcher eMarketer, with almost all of that going to Google. The company paid out about 22% of its global ad revenue to search and other partners last year, financial statements showed.
In the United Kingdom, with about 2-1/2 times the population of Australia, Google spent $1.5 billion to become the default search engine on a variety of devices in 2019.
GADGET HIT
Australian electronics chains such as JB Hi-Fi Ltd, Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd and Wesfarmers Ltd-owned Officeworks could also take a hit because they stock gadgets that have Google's search engine built-in. The same goes for department store chains like Wesfarmers' Kmart, Woolworths Group Ltd's Big W, and David Jones, which is owned by South Africa's unrelated Woolworths Holdings (OTC:WLWHY) Ltd.
Though Pixel phones hold just 2% of Australia's smartphone market, Nest speakers dominate with a 61% share, or 1.6 million households. Nearly a million Australians among a population of 25 million use five or more Google-owned services, technology analysis firm Telsyte said.
Search is ""fundamental to Google's business model across all its products,"" said Foad Fadaghi, managing director of Telsyte. 
Retailers have began seeking reassurance from Google about its products' functionality if search disappears, though none have cancelled or returned orders, two people with knowledge of the communications told Reuters.
Google also has smaller search partnerships. Software vendors Hey You and Redcat enable restaurants to solicit orders via buttons that accompany search results, and the Australian Football League has let fans vote on awards through search.
Redcat sales and marketing director Lawrence Pelletier said the year-old search integration drives 15,000 orders a month, mostly from new customers.
""Would it be crippling if Google left? No. Would it be frustrating? Yes,"" Pelletier said. 
Hey You Chief Executive Uzair Moosa said he is exploring alternatives, but Google's largest search rival, Bing, does not offer a comparable tool.
Catherine Rowlands, a nurse from Sydney with a Pixel phone, told Reuters she feared what was to come.

""My phone without Google,"" she said, ""might as well be an old Nokia (NYSE:NOK) or something that just makes phone calls.""

""We have received the report back from our Taskforce team on the ground in the Tigray region, they have unfortunately established rape has taken place conclusively and without a doubt,"" Ethiopian Women's Minister Filsan Abdullahi tweeted late on Thursday.
Though witnesses, medics and aid workers had spoken of widespread sexual abuse since fighting began in November, Filsan's comments were the first confirmation by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government.
The state-appointed Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said that 108 rapes had been reported in Tigray - nearly half in the regional capital Mekelle - in the last two months. 
Though Abiy's federal troops captured Mekelle at the end of November from the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), sporadic fighting has continued, with communications and access to the mountainous region of 5 million people restricted.
While some victims have identified their abusers as federal forces or allied soldiers, Reuters has been unable to independently verify accounts of rape. The government has said it has zero tolerance towards sexual violence. 
The Rights Commission said many rapes were likely to have gone unreported.
""The war and the dismantling of the regional administration have led to a rise in gender-based violence in the region. Local structures such as police and health facilities where victims of sexual violence would normally turn to report such crimes are no longer in place,"" it said.

Spokesman Adinew Abera said the Women's Ministry had so far assessed only Mekelle and the nearby town of Quiha, adding: ""We will deploy experts to all districts of Tigray. So the number will be higher than what is mentioned.""

Malaysia agreed to return them after the Myanmar military, which seized power in a Feb. 1 coup, offered to send three navy ships to pick citizens held in Malaysian immigration detention centres, officials and sources told Reuters this week.
""The principle of non-refoulement applies also in Malaysia as part of customary international law which is binding on all states,"" Yante Ismail, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Kuala Lumpur, told Reuters in an emailed statement. 
Malaysia's director-general of Immigration, Khairul Dzaimee Daud, confirmed on Thursday that 1,200 Myanmar nationals were to be sent back but did not say if any of them were refugees.
Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, instead regarding people who arrive without proper documents as illegal migrants.
It is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar. 
In the past, people from Myanmar detained in Malaysia have included members of the ethnic Chin, Kachin and the Muslim Rohingya communities fleeing conflict and persecution.
Rights groups have expressed concern over the safety of Myanmar refugees after the military coup.
The UNHCR said Malaysian authorities had yet to inform it of the deportation but it was concerned that a ""number"" of those in detention may require international protection, including vulnerable women and children. 
The UNHCR has not been allowed entry into Malaysia's detention centres since August 2019, preventing it from being able to identify refugees and leaving no way out for the asylum seekers.
Malaysia has toughened its stance on immigration during the COVID-19 pandemic, arresting thousands of undocumented migrants.

The vital waterway has turned blue along the Thai-Laos border, from its usual murky brown colour - signaling shallow water and low levels of nutrition-rich sediment - partially from outflow restrictions from the Jinghong dam in China's Yunan province, the inter-governmental MRC said.
Friday's statement said low rainfall and dams on the Lower Mekong and tributaries also contributed to the drop in levels.
""There have been sudden rises and falls in water levels immediately downstream of Jinghong and further down to Vientiane,"" said Winai Wongpimool, director of the MRC Secretariat's Technical Support Division.
Such fluctuations affect fish migration, agriculture and transportation that nearly 70 million people rely on for their livelihoods and food security.
""To help the Lower Mekong countries manage risks more effectively, we call on China and the Lower Mekong countries themselves to share their water release plans with us,” Winai said.
The MRC said normal conditions may be restored if large volumes of water are released from Chinese dams' reservoirs.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not reply to requests for comment on Friday, a public holiday.
The U.S.-funded Mekong Dam Monitor, which uses satellite data to track water levels, also said it noticed daily fluctuations in water releases from China's Jinghong Dam in February. 
China last year pledged to share data from it dams with MRC member countries Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
In January, Beijing notified neighbours that its dams were filling reservoirs and flow will be restored to ""normal operation status"" on Jan. 25. 
Outflow levels at Jinghong Dam were 785 cubic metres per second in early-January before rising to 1,400 cubic metres per second in mid-January, the MRC said.

However, levels dropped again in February and were 800 cubic metres per second as of Thursday, the MRC said. The statement did not mention any recent notification from Beijing.

Relations between Russia and the West have come under renewed pressure over the arrest and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, which has sparked talk of possible new sanctions.
Three European diplomats told Reuters on Thursday that the European Union was likely to impose travel bans and asset freezes on allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, possibly as soon as this month, after France and Germany signalled their willingness to move ahead. 
Pressure for sanctions has grown since Moscow infuriated European countries last week by expelling German, Polish and Swedish diplomats without telling the EU's foreign policy chief, who was in Moscow for a visit. Paris and Berlin now say there must be a response.
Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov was asked in an interview due to be published in full later on Friday whether Moscow would now move towards cutting ties with the EU itself. 
""We proceed from the fact that we're ready (for that). In the event that we again see sanctions imposed in some sectors that create risks for our economy, including in the most sensitive spheres,"" Lavrov said. 

""We don't want to isolate ourselves from global life, but we have to be ready for that. If you want peace then prepare for war,"" he said.

488,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 12, 2021 02:10AM ET</span>",Asian drug lords likely producing precursor chemicals in Golden Triangle,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Crime syndicates in Asia’s drug-producing Golden Triangle region have likely begun producing ingredients to manufacture methamphetamine, enabling them to avoid restrictions on importing precursors such as pseudoephedrine and ephedrine. 
The development shows a new level of sophistication by drug syndicates as ""pre-precursors"" such as propionyl chloride are far less tightly regulated and easier to obtain. 
""It is increasingly clear organised crime are using pre-precursors and have particularly impressive capacities in place to produce their own precursors - something nobody understood until recently,"" said Jeremy Douglas, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) regional representative for Southeast Asia. 
The Golden Triangle – an area that centres on northeast Myanmar but includes parts of Thailand and Laos – was for years a main opium-growing region, with Asian crime groups forming alliances with ethnic minority militias who control parts of the area, especially in Myanmar.
But more recently production has boomed in amphetamine-type stimulants, especially methamphetamine, or meth as it is known, with the amount coming out of the Golden Triangle rising rapidly for a decade.
Authorities in Asia seizing a record 139 tonnes of meth in 2019, up from 127 tonnes in 2018 and 82.5 tonnes in 2017, UNODC data showed.
While final seizure data from last year is not available, the UNODC said the meth surge was not interrupted by the outbreak of COVID-19.
In contrast to the significant rise in meth seizures, interceptions of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine have fallen in Myanmar and surrounding countries. 
The seizure of pseudoephedrine in Myanmar dropped from 1,192 tonnes in 2016 to none in 2019, while seizure of ephedrine there dropped from 534 kg in 2016 to 402 kg in 2019, UNODC data showed.
Meanwhile, intelligence suggests some militia groups in Myanmar are importing chemicals used to make pseudoephedrine and ephedrine, even though there are no known legitimate industries in the region that require them.  
Reflecting growing concern about the trend, the issue was discussed at a meeting of the Thai government, the UNODC and other international agencies last week.
Douglas said that governments and law enforcement agencies in Asia will need to work closely together to better regulate and control the flow of chemicals, including some that are not controlled.

China's National Radio and Television Administration said an investigation found BBC World News' China-related reports had ""seriously violated"" regulations, including that news should be ""truthful and fair,"" had harmed the country's national interests and undermined national unity. 
The channel, therefore, does not meet requirements for foreign channels broadcasting in China and its application to air for another year would not be accepted, it added.
Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), the publicly funded broadcaster in the former British territory, said separately
on Friday it was suspending the relay of BBC news programming starting later on Friday, following the decision from Beijing.
English-language BBC World News is not included in most TV channel packages in mainland China, but is available in some hotels and residences.
Two Reuters journalists in Beijing said the channel had gone blank on their screens.
China's move was condemned by British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab and the U.S. State Department.
""China's decision to ban BBC World News in mainland China is an unacceptable curtailing of media freedom,"" Raab said.
""China has some of the most severe restrictions on media and internet freedoms across the globe, and this latest step will only damage China’s reputation in the eyes of the world.""
At a regular news briefing, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price condemned the decision. 
""It's troubling that as (China) restricts outlets and platforms from operating freely in China, Beijing's leaders use free and open media environments overseas to promote misinformation,"" Price said.
Earlier this month, the State Department said it was ""deeply disturbed"" by reports carried by the BBC of systematic rape and sexual abuse against women in internment camps for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in China's Xinjiang region and said there must be serious consequences for atrocities there.
China denies accusations of abuses in Xinjiang and said the BBC report was ""wholly without factual basis"".
The BBC said it was disappointed by the decision of the Chinese authorities to bar BBC World News from broadcasting.
""The BBC is the world’s most trusted international news broadcaster and reports on stories from around the world fairly, impartially and without fear or favour,"" the BBC said.
On Feb. 4, British media regulator Ofcom revoked China Global Television Network's (CGTN) licence to broadcast in the United Kingdom after an investigation found the licence was wrongfully held by Star China Media Ltd.

China criticised the ruling as politicised and warned it reserved the right to make a ""necessary response"".

(Reuters) - Winter weather battered the United States from coast to coast on Thursday as a series of storms expected to last for days mixed with an Arctic air mass to bring snow and freezing rain as far south as Texas, where six people died in a multi-vehicle pileup.
A line of freezing rain stretched from Texas to West Virginia, with some of it accumulating to one-quarter to one-half inch, according to meteorologist Marc Chenard at the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.
Among the areas coated with freezing rain during the Thursday morning rush hour was Fort Worth, Texas, where police said icy road surfaces were a factor in a traffic wreck involving 133 vehicles that began in the express lanes of Interstate-35.
At least six people were killed in the pileup, and 65 others were treated at hospitals for injuries, including three initially listed in critical condition, fire and rescue officials told reporters later in the day.
""There were multiple people that were trapped within the confines of their vehicles and requiring use of hydraulic rescue equipment to successfully extricate them,"" Forth Worth Fire Chief Jim Davis told a news briefing.
Video from the scene showed dozens of smashed cars and trucks, some literally piled on top of one another on a slick roadway under cloudy skies. A large stretch of the highway was closed in both directions for hours after the crash.
The Texas precipitation was part of a system that brought rain to several Southeastern states and modest amounts of snow to West Virginia, Maryland and New Jersey, Chenard said.
A separate storm system will make its presence felt in the mid-Atlantic region on Saturday, he said.
""That may bring potentially significant freezing rain accumulations to portions of Virginia and Maryland,"" he added.
Yet another weather system was moving into the Pacific Northwest, where it was forecast to remain through Saturday and bring as much as 8 inches (20 cm) of snow to normally rainy Seattle and 12 inches (30 cm) to Portland, Oregon. Seattle averages about 6 inches of snow in an entire winter season.
""An event of this magnitude is rare,” said Chenard.
The Northwest storm front is forecast to make its way eastward, bringing significant snowfall to the upper Midwest over the weekend and freezing rain south almost to the Gulf Coast of Texas.
""There likely will be winter weather impacts in the East by early next week,"" Chenard added.
The storm systems, which normally would have brought rain, have been converted into snow and ice makers by a polar air mass that has descended on much of the country, bringing frigid temperatures before beginning to recede in the middle of next week, Chenard said.

Recent low temperatures in the upper United States from Montana to Wisconsin have ranged from minus 35 to minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 37 to minus 40 degrees C).

Opposition leader Juan Guaido last week said that Venezuelan funds controlled by the U.S. Treasury Department could be used to pay for vaccines. The cash-strapped government of President Nicolas Maduro has signed up for COVAX, co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide vaccines globally, but has not made the associated payments.
The meeting marks a step forward in what will likely be a long process requiring that U.S. authorities approve the use of the funds, as well as the completion of a vaccination roll-out plan for crisis-stricken Venezuela.
In a Thursday evening state television appearance, Maduro said the government was working on a $300 million deal for vaccine supplies, but did not provide details 
""We are looking for a practical, effective agreement to create a $300 million fund for Venezuela's vaccines with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), with the WHO,"" Maduro said. 
The United States in 2019 froze $342 million held by Venezuela's central bank in the United States as part of a sanctions program that was meant to force Maduro from power.
Moving the funds usually requires applying for license from the U.S. Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control.
The Pan American Health Organization's Chief of Mission in Venezuela, Paolo Balladelli, in a tweet said there had been advances in obtaining vaccines for Venezuela, and that Unicef and the World Health Organization would be involved.
""Today, with the will of the political, technical and academic actors of Venezuela, the National Roundtable for Access to the COVAX Strategy has advanced to guarantee access to vaccines against COVID-19,"" he wrote. 
The Pan American Health Organization did not respond to a request for comment seeking confirmation that his tweet referred to a meeting between the government and Guaido representatives. 
One of the participants in the meeting was Julio Castro, a doctor and medical advisor to Guaido, said sources, who asked not to be identified.
Castro did not respond to messages seeking comment, but on Twitter also suggested there had been a meeting.
""Today the National Table for Access to the COVAX Strategy was established,"" he wrote. ""We welcome the beginning of the construction of a joint strategy among all.""

Balladelli last week said that between 1.4 million and 2.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccine had been reserved for Venezuela. At $10 per dose, those vaccines would cost between $140 million and $240 million.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has denounced his cabinet for a lack of innovation and ""smart strategies"" in drafting goals for a new five-year economic plan, state media reported on Friday.
The ruling Workers' Party wrapped up its four-day plenary meeting on Thursday, where Kim also mapped out his vision for inter-Korean affairs and relations with other countries, as well as party rules and personnel issues.
With the economy topping the agenda, Kim reviewed action plans for his new five-year strategy, facing international sanctions, a prolonged border closure and reduced outside aid amid the coronavirus pandemic.
He accused the cabinet of drafting plans that did not advance significantly on previous ones and that had ""failed tremendously on almost every sector.""
""The plans did not accurately reflect the party's ideology and guidelines and lacked innovative insights and smart strategies,"" Kim told the meeting, according to KCNA. 
""As the cabinet almost mechanically put together numbers given by ministries, plans for some sectors were unrealistically elevated and others had lowered goals that were already easily achievable and must be done.""
The party decided to build 10,000 homes in capital Pyongyang this year, replacing a previous construction plan that Kim described as too low and a product of ""self-protectionism and defeatism"" in the bureaucracy.
He also called for enhanced self-reliance and the local production of goods and materials, KCNA said, after trade with China, which accounts for about 90% of shipments into and out of North Korea, plunged more than 80% last year due to strict COVID-19 lockdowns.

The party also discussed personnel changes, promoting Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon to the politburo shortly after reinstating him as an alternate member of the powerful governing body.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly 30 experts on global nuclear security urged President Joe Biden's administration on Thursday to restore U.S. leadership on fissile materials to reduce the threat that militants will use them to create weapons. 
Global security of materials like plutonium and highly enriched uranium received ""limited high-level attention"" by former President Donald Trump's administration, the experts said in a letter to about six officials at the State Department, the Department of Energy and the National Security Council. 
""U.S. leadership on this issue has weakened and international progress has slowed,"" wrote the experts, including Sharon Squassoni of George Washington University and William Tobey of Harvard University, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters. 
It recommended launching a comprehensive plan to achieve security of global stocks of nuclear weapons, fissile materials and nuclear facilities where sabotage could cause a catastrophe. 
The administration should boost funding for the issue, which the letter called ""an investment in national security against threats of nuclear and radiological terrorism."" Washington should also increase financial and political support for the International Atomic Energy Agency and improve diplomacy on the issue.
Last week Russia and Washington extended the New START arms control treaty for five years, preserving the last pact limiting deployments of the world's two largest strategic nuclear arsenals. 
But international work has slowed in recent years on securing fissile materials at research reactors and in bulk form at sites after nuclear weapons were dismantled in Russia and some Former Soviet Union countries, said Miles Pomper, a senior fellow at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. 

Washington doesn't ""have much of a window into what they are doing and they seem to have slowed down on a lot of things like minimizing their highly enriched uranium stocks,"" Pomper said.

498,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 06:40PM ET</span>","Over her objection, Ghislaine Maxwell's testimony about massages is unsealed","By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell denied under oath to having given anyone including the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein a massage, according to testimony released on Thursday that the British socialite fought to keep sealed.
The testimony was excerpted from a July 2016 deposition in a long-settled lawsuit by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre.
It is the basis for part of a perjury charge in a six-count indictment charging Maxwell with helping Epstein recruit three teenage girls for sex from 1994 to 1997.
Maxwell's lawyers had argued that prosecutors obtained the deposition illegally, and releasing the testimony would make getting it suppressed harder because prosecutors could claim it became public anyway.
But on Monday, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska, who oversees Giuffre's case, found that Maxwell had only a ""minimal"" privacy interest in the 20-line excerpt, and could discuss suppressing it with the Manhattan judge in the criminal case.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In the excerpt, Giuffre's lawyer David Boies asked Maxwell whether she gave massages to anyone other than Epstein at any of the financier's properties.
Maxwell responded that she does not give massages, prompting an exchange included in her indictment.
""Is it your testimony that you've never given anybody a massage?"" Boies asked.
""I have not given anyone a massage,"" Maxwell responded.
""You never gave Mr. Epstein a massage, is that your testimony?""
""That is my testimony.""
The perjury charge, one of two in Maxwell's indictment, also covered Maxwell's denying knowledge of whether Epstein possessed sex toys, or had sex in the 1990s and 2000s with anyone other than herself and two other women.

Maxwell has pleaded not guilty. Her trial is scheduled for July. Epstein killed himself in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are investigating reports that about 80 migrants may have been trapped in a tanker truck on Monday and were struggling to breathe, an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) said on Thursday.
The official said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit was looking into 911 calls placed on Monday around San Antonio, Texas.
""We're dying,"" a male caller said in Spanish as he pleaded for help on one of the calls, according to recordings obtained by Reuters. Moans of others could be heard in the background.
The ICE investigative unit is seeking to learn if the incident may have been human trafficking, the official said.
""At face value, it’s at least human smuggling,"" said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the matter.
The investigation comes as arrests of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border have been increasing after a steep drop at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. officials in January encountered nearly 78,000 migrants attempting to cross the southern border illegally or who were denied at ports of entry, a 6 percent increase over the previous month.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation field office in San Antonio and Bexar County Sheriff's Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
On one of the calls, a man said a white truck with approximately 80 people inside was stopped on the side of the highway, according to the recording.
""We don't have oxygen,"" the man said at one point.
Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar, whose jurisdiction includes San Antonio, described the scene in an interview with KABB, a local Fox affiliate.
""It's heartbreaking to hear because clearly behind the caller in the background, you can hear others in the car, in the trailer, and they're also screaming for help in Spanish and saying that they're out of air,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on Myanmar's acting president and several other military officers and warned the generals there could be more economic punishment as Washington responds to the military coup.
The U.S. Treasury Department said it targeted eight people, including the defense minister, three companies in the jade and gems sector, and updated sanctions on the top two military officials, accusing them of playing a leading role in overthrowing Myanmar's democratically-elected government.
But Washington stopped short of including the entire Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), the military's conglomerates that are prevalent throughout Myanmar's economy.
President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved an executive order for new sanctions on those responsible for the coup in Myanmar, also known as Burma, that ousted the civilian-led government and detained elected leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
""The February 1 coup was a direct assault on Burma's transition to democracy and the rule of law,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement.
""We are also prepared to take additional action should Burma's military not change course. If there is more violence against peaceful protesters, the Burmese military will find that today's sanctions are just the first,"" Yellen added.
Thursday's action designated Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar military Min Aung Hlaing and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Soe Win under Biden's executive order. Both were previously hit with sanctions in 2019 over allegations of abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities.
Others listed were six members of the National Defense and Security Council and four military officials announced as members of the State Administration Council, including Defense Minister Mya Tun Oo.
The three companies named by Washington - Myanmar Ruby Enterprise, Myanmar Imperial Jade Co, LTD, and Cancri (Gems and Jewellery) Co, LTD - were identified by a U.N. mission on Myanmar in 2019 as part of the MEHL conglomerate.
The White House said the sanctions do not need to be permanent, urging Myanmar's military to ""immediately restore power to the democratically elected government, end the state of emergency, release all those unjustly detained, and ensure peaceful protesters are not met with violence.""
The Biden administration has been working to form an international response to the crisis.
John Lichtefeld, vice president at Washington-based strategic consultancy The Asia Group, said Thursday's announcements were an ""opening salvo putting the military on notice,"" adding that sanctions against the MEHL and MEC conglomerates may still occur.
""I think this is a signal to the military that the United States is serious and has a very wide range of tools at its disposal. The range of actors potentially implicated by this order is exceptionally broad, even though the order itself does not directly sanction any individual or entities,"" he said.
Suu Kyi's party won a 2015 election but the transition to democracy was brought to a halt by the coup that ousted her government as it was preparing to begin its second term after her National League for Democracy (NLD) swept a Nov. 8 election.
The military cited election fraud as justification for its takeover. The electoral commission dismissed accusations of fraud.
Also on Thursday, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said it was immediately redirecting $42.2 million of assistance away from work that would have benefited Myanmar's government.
The aid agency said it would continue to support the people of Myanmar with approximately $69 million in bilateral programs.

Protesters have taken to the streets in cities and towns in the largest demonstrations in Myanmar for more than a decade, reviving memories of almost half a century of direct army rule, punctuated with bloody crackdowns, until the military began relinquishing some power in 2011.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's movement has received bitcoin donations worth nearly $300,000 this year, outstripping the total amount it was given in the cryptocurrency in 2020 at the prices at the time, according to a data analysis.
Navalny made headlines in January after he returned to Russia for the first time since being poisoned in Siberia last summer. He was arrested and last week handed a nearly three-year jail term in a case he says was politically-motivated.
His anti-Kremlin movement has accepted donations in bitcoin since 2016 via its network of regional political headquarters, an attempt to make it harder for Russia's intelligence services to track and potentially disrupt its funding. 
Leonid Volkov, who is in charge of Navalny's campaign HQs across Russia, told Reuters that overall donations had doubled in January month-on-month, though did not break the donations down by payment method or disclose how much had been received.
But the campaign's bitcoin wallet, viewed by Reuters, showed it received 6.242 bitcoins from Jan. 1 to Feb. 11. At current rates, that's nearly $300,000. 
That exceeds the value of all the bitcoin donations it received for 2020, according to calculations by cryptocurrency website Protos, with each donation valued in terms of bitcoin prices at the time it was made.
Bitcoin has been rallying hard, jumping over 300% in 2020 and breezing past record highs to reach above $47,000 on Thursday.
Volkov said it was incorrect to place a value of $300,000 on the bitcoin donations this year using the current high exchange rate, however, since most of them had been made when the crypto-currency was worth less than half its value today.
The largest single donations were made the day after Navalny's return to Russia - one whole bitcoin - and on the eve and immediately after protests in his support on Jan. 23 - 0.86 bitcoin and another whole bitcoin, according to data on the blockchain.com website.
""We had a very big inflow of donations,"" said Volkov. ""Most of the donations came from normal people. There's nothing complicated about it.""
Since 2016, when Navalny's regional network began accepting bitcoin transfers, more than 658 bitcoins have shown up in its wallets. At the current price, that is worth about $31 million.
Volkov said the 658 bitcoins reflected the accounts’ total turnover though and were not all donations since the team used the wallets for their own operations converting other kinds of donations into bitcoin. 
Total bitcoin donations probably totalled one third of the turnover sum, which at current prices would be around $10 million, he said. 
At the moment, however, the balance of Team Navalny's bitcoin wallet has fallen to 1.49277086 bitcoins.
Navalny's team also accepts payments via bank and card transfers as well as via Paypal. Volkov said bitcoin donations generally accounted for about ten per cent of the total. “But in January this was not so.”
Russian authorities periodically block the bank accounts of Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, a separate organisation he founded which conducts investigations into official corruption. 
""They are always trying to close down our bank accounts – but we always find some kind of workaround,"" said Volkov.
“We use bitcoin because it’s a good legal means of payment. The fact that we have bitcoin payments as an alternative helps to defend us from the Russian authorities. They see if they close down other more traditional channels, we will still have bitcoin. It’s like insurance.”

The government said on Tuesday it will require passengers arriving from countries where worrying coronavirus variants are spreading to pay for 10 days of quarantine in hotels, while rule-breakers will face heavy fines or jail terms, under tighter restrictions from next week.
The new travel rules add to restrictions that already ban Britons from travelling abroad for holidays. The government said the stronger measures were needed to prevent new variants of the virus from thwarting Britain's rapid vaccination programme.
However, the booking portal for the quarantine scheme was removed just hours after it launched, which a government website said was due to ""a minor technical issue"".
Britain’s health department did not have an immediate comment.
The opposition Labour Party’s home affairs spokesman Nick Thomas-Symonds called on the government to urgently fix the portal. 

""It is extremely worrying that even the limited hotel quarantine booking system is showing signs of failing from the outset,"" he said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Medical teams working to immunize Brazil's remote indigenous villages against the coronavirus have encountered fierce resistance in some communities where evangelical missionaries are stoking fears of the vaccine, say tribal leaders and advocates.
On the São Francisco reservation in the state of Amazonas, Jamamadi villagers sent health workers packing with bows and arrows when they visited by helicopter this month, said Claudemir da Silva, an Apurinã leader representing indigenous communities on the Purus river, a tributary of the Xingú. 
""It's not happening in all villages, just in those that have missionaries or evangelical chapels where pastors are convincing the people not to receive the vaccine, that they will turn into an alligator and other crazy ideas,"" he said by phone.
That has added to fears that COVID-19 could roar through Brazil's more than 800,000 indigenous people, whose communal living and often precarious healthcare make them a priority in the national immunization program.
Tribal leaders blame Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and some of his avid supporters in the evangelical community for stoking skepticism about coronavirus vaccines, despite a national death toll that lags only the United States.
""Religious fundamentalists and evangelical missionaries are preaching against the vaccine,"" said Dinamam Tuxá, a leader of APIB, Brazil's largest indigenous organization.
The Association of Brazilian Anthropologists denounced unspecified religious groups in a statement on Tuesday for spreading false conspiracy theories to ""sabotage"" the vaccination of indigenous people. 
Many pastors of Brazil's urban evangelical megachurches are urging followers to get vaccinated, but they say missionaries in remote territories have not gotten the message.
""Unfortunately, some pastors who lack wisdom are spreading misinformation to our indigenous brethren,"" said Pastor Mario Jorge Conceição of the Assembly of God Traditional Church in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state.
The government's indigenous health agency Sesai told Reuters in a statement that it was working to raise awareness of the importance of coronavirus immunization. 
Bolsonaro has played down the severity of the virus and refused to take a vaccine himself. He has aimed special derision at the country's most widely available shot, made by China's Sinovac Biotech, citing doubts about its ""origins.""
At an event in December, the president ridiculed vaccine maker  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) because he said the company had refused to assume liability for collateral effects in talks with his government.
""If you take the vaccine and turn into an alligator, it's your problem. If you turn into Superman or women grow beards, I have nothing to do with that,"" Bolsonaro said sarcastically.
Pfizer has said it proposed standard contractual guarantees to the Brazilian government that other countries accepted before using its vaccine.
Access to social media even in remote corners of Brazil has fanned false rumors about the coronavirus vaccines. 
For instance, 56-year-old tribal chief Fernando Katukina, of the Nôke Kôi people near the Peru border, died Feb. 1 of cardiac arrest related to diabetes and congestive heart failure. Word spread rapidly on social media and radio that the COVID-19 vaccine he received in January had caused his death.
The Butantan biomedical center, which is producing and distributing the Sinovac vaccine, scrambled to convince indigenous people that was not the case.
""The social media messages saying that Fernando Katukina died after taking a COVID-19 vaccine are fake news,"" Butantan wrote in a tweet. 

COVID-19 has killed at least 957 indigenous people, according to APIB, out of some 48,071 confirmed infections among half of Brazil's 300 native ethnic groups. The numbers could be much higher, because health agency Sesai only monitors indigenous people living on reservations.

ROME (Reuters) - Members of Italy's 5-Star Movement voted on Thursday to back Prime Minister designate Mario Draghi, opening the way for the former European Central Bank chief to take office at the head of a broad government of national unity.
In an online ballot, 59.3% of 5-Star supporters heeded a call from party leaders to support the new administration, despite the fact it includes some of their arch foes and will be headed by the sort of technocrat they have previously decried.
After coalition infighting brought down the last government, President Sergio Mattarella called on Draghi, one of the most respected institutional figures in Italy, to form a new cabinet to tackle the coronavirus health crisis and economic meltdown.
Having secured the endorsement of almost all Italy's political parties, Draghi is likely to present his list of ministers to Mattarella on Friday and unveil his policy programme next week in parliament.
Confidence votes in both houses enabling him to take office will be a formality. However some lawmakers from the 5-Star, which was born in 2009 as an anti-system, anti-euro party, have threatened to oppose Draghi regardless of the online ballot.
In a sign of the divisions, one of its leading lights, Alessandro Di Battista, announced he would quit the group. ""My political conscience can't take it anymore,"" he said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The movement's members held similar online votes before forming coalitions first with the rightist League in 2018 and then with the centre-left Democratic Party in 2019. The size of victory on those two occasions was 94% and 79% respectively.
While Thursday's margin was far narrower, the result is still a boost for Draghi and means no single party will have the power to bring down his administration.
POLICY PRIORITIES
The 5-Star leadership had urged members to vote yes, saying the group had to help lead the economic recovery in Italy, which expects to receive more than 200 billion euros ($242.56 billion) from a European Union fund to revive its battered economy.
""In one of the most dramatic moments in our recent history, the 5-Star Movement has chosen the path of courage ... but above all it has chosen the European path,"" Luigi Di Maio, foreign minister and a top 5-Star politician said on Facebook.
Draghi, 73, is widely credited with having saved the euro currency during his time in charge of the ECB and he will no doubt be influential now in shaping EU debate on how the bloc should engineer its economic revival.
He has told politicians this week that he is opposed to fiscal austerity, despite soaring national debt levels, saying it was important to protect social cohesion.
Draghi also reportedly promised to create a powerful ministry for ecological transition, a move that helped win over support from 5-Star for whom environmentalism is a core concern.
Policies to fight climate change are required to be a pillar of the Recovery Plans to be presented by EU countries to the European Commission by April.

Draghi has also said he will make the anti-coronavirus vaccine programme a priority. Italy has registered almost 93,000 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe.

Defying coronavirus restrictions, thousands of people rallied in central Athens for a second day, as legislators debated the bill.
The legislation passed in the 300-seat parliament with 166 deputies voting in favour and 132 against. 
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said the reforms would end years of lawlessness at Greek campuses.
""Nowhere in the world do we see images ... of historical buildings being vandalised, equipment being looted,"" Mitsotakis told legislators before the vote, referring to numerous incidents in recent years where self-styled anarchist groups broke in and caused damage on Greek campuses.
The issue of police on campus has been especially sensitive in Greece since the 1967-1974 military government. During a 1973 student revolt that helped topple the junta, a tank crashed through the gates of the Polytechnic university, killing students.
Opponents of the law say state universities could hire more security staff and upgrade other safety measures instead of bringing in police.

Other measures in the bill limit the length of time students can stay enrolled before getting a degree.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Fighting drug trafficking and dismantling armed groups are the top challenges for Colombia's military in 2021, the country's new defense minister said on Thursday, adding he is confident violence against human rights activists can be reduced.
Colombia could restart aerial fumigation of coca - the base ingredient in cocaine - with herbicide glyphosate as early as next month, Defense Minister Diego Molano told Reuters in an interview.
Though the FARC rebel group disarmed under a 2016 peace deal, still-active guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (ELN), crime gangs and former FARC fighters who reject the accord continue to battle over lucrative illegal mining and drug trafficking territory.
""What we want is security, security, more security,"" said Molano. ""First, the head-on fight against drug trafficking, which is the biggest threat we have in Colombia to the stability of our democracy.""
Molano, who took over as defense minister on Feb. 2 after his predecessor died of COVID-19, said the government would look to capture the leaders of armed groups with an increase in military and intelligence operations.
""Disassembling these groups, capturing their leaders and succeeding at diminishing these structures"" is a priority. 
Molano said the Andean country would pursue the Clan del Golfo, Los Caparros and Los Pelusos crime gangs ""by air, sea and land.""
Colombia has repeatedly accused Nicolas Maduro, the president of neighboring Venezuela, of allowing the ELN and former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) to operate from his country. Maduro has denied the claims.
Molano said Colombia will not conduct operations in other countries to pursue kingpins, and will need international cooperation to capture targets.
The arrest or death of major criminal leaders is part of the effort to curb mass killings and murders of human rights activists, which have sparked international criticism against Colombian President Ivan Duque. [nL1N2KF3EL] 
Molano did not give details about recent promises by Duque to increase military operations to reduce the murders.
Aerial fumigation with glyphosate - suspended in 2015 on concerns it could potentially cause cancer - will restart as soon as the government gets judicial approval, Molano said.

""As soon as the procedure is finished, which we expect at the end of March, we'll start,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A crime wave in Oakland, California's Chinatown has rankled the community heading into the Lunar New Year, prompting celebrities to offer a reward to fight anti-Asian harassment.
In a surveillance video that has gone viral, a 91-year-old Asian man is seen being shoved to the ground from behind in Oakland on Jan. 31, his head slamming face first into the sidewalk. It was one of three similar incidents that day, allegedly perpetrated by the same suspect.
The violence outraged Chinese-American actor Daniel Wu, who grew up in the Bay Area, went to school in Oakland, hung out at his aunt's Chinatown bakery, and whose father is also 91.
""It really hit home,"" said Wu in a Zoom interview. ""This is in addition to the layers and layers and layers of other incidents that have been happening since COVID but also pre-COVID. ... I just couldn't stand it and had to do something about it.""
Wu, a star in numerous Chinese films, partnered up with Korean-American actor Daniel Dae Kim to offer a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the suspect in the assault.
""We needed to put quite frankly our money where our mouth is to raise awareness for it in a way that we're able to talk about it right now,"" said Kim, known for roles in TV series ""Hawaii Five-O"" and ""Lost.""
The suspect was later identified as Yahya Muslim, 28, who had been arrested over an unrelated case. He faces multiple assault charges for the Chinatown incidents. Prosecutors are investigating whether the attacks were racially motivated.
Other incidents include theft and assault, community leaders say.
""With all these incidents happening, many people are afraid to come out and shop"" for Friday's Lunar New Year, said Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce.
""Within the community there are many seniors who live inside Chinatown (who) are also afraid to walk on their own streets. Many employees are expressing their fear working in their own stores.""
From March through December last year, over 2,800 first-hand accounts of anti-Asian hate in the United States were reported https://secureservercdn.net/104.238.69.231/a1w.90d.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Press-Statement-re_-Bay-Area-Elderly-Incidents-2.9.2021-1.pdf to Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition formed to document such incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Oakland's police department said it was devoting more resources to Chinatown, moving a command post there and increasing routine patrols.

""Everyone has a mother or a father"" and should be able to relate, said Kim. ""We hope that by raising awareness of this in the Asian American community, we're actually unifying people against this kind of crime.""

Police said Gregory Paul Ulrich, 67, used a handgun to shoot five people at the Allina Health Clinic in Buffalo, Minnesota, on Tuesday, killing one. He also brought three homemade bombs with him and managed to explode two of them, damaging the building, they said. 
Local media reported that Ulrich had threatened at least one Allina doctor in 2018 in a dispute over surgery on his back, and that a judge had issued a restraining order against Ulrich. Police said Ulrich was believed to hold a grievance against someone at the clinic, in a small city about 35 miles (55 km) northwest of Minneapolis, but declined to share more details. 
After being arrested at the clinic, he told police he left his cellphone there, which contained ""a rambling video message that alluded to an incident at the clinic,"" according to a criminal complaint filed in the Wright County District Courthouse in Buffalo.
Ulrich used a wheelchair in a virtual appearance from jail on Thursday morning before state District Court Judge Catherine McPherson, the Star Tribune newspaper in Minneapolis reported. He did not enter a plea and told the judge he did not wish to say anything, the newspaper reported. Neither Ulrich nor his attorney could immediately be reached for comment.
He is charged with one count of murder in the second degree, four counts attempted murder in the first degree and two charges related to his use of explosive devices and carrying a gun without a permit.
Buffalo police told reporters this week that Ulrich was well known to the department, but few details were released as to the nature of his alleged grievance with the clinic.
Three of the surviving victims remained hospitalized, according to the criminal complaint, while the fourth person was due to return to the hospital for surgery to remove bullets from their leg.

513,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 01:50PM ET</span>",Merkel promises lockdown will not last a day longer than necessary,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel urged Germans on Thursday to have a little more patience after agreeing with regional leaders to extend a coronavirus lockdown until March 7 and said restrictions would not last a day longer than necessary. 
Addressing the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, Merkel said the extension was needed to avoid a third wave due to the risk posed by new virus variants.
""I know what we have achieved in our fight against the virus has had, and is still having, a high price,"" said Merkel.
A gradual fall in daily infections has raised pressure for an easing of tight restrictions in place since mid-December and Merkel agreed with state premiers on Wednesday that some schools and hairdressers could open sooner than March 7. 
With neighbouring countries seeking to contain major outbreaks, Germany will impose stricter controls on people seeking to enter its territory from the Czech Republic and Austria's Tyrol region from Feb. 14, an Interior Ministry spokesman said on Thursday.
The Czech Republic earlier announced a stricter lockdown in three districts, including two on the border with Germany, where coronavirus infections have soared above 1,000 per 100,000 residents over the past week.
""The introduction of border controls is required to prevent the virus (mutation) from being transmitted to Germany,"" the Interior Ministry spokesman said, adding that details of how strict the measures will be were still being finalised.
Seeking to reassure Germans that the lockdown was helping, Merkel said she was aware this was the most serious curtailment of freedoms in post-war Germany. She knew many people were lonely and worried about money and their future.
""As a democracy we have a duty not to keep the restrictions in place for a day longer than is necessary,"" she said.
Europe's biggest economy shrank by 5% last year and some businesses are dismayed at the latest extension and the lack of a timetable for easing restrictions.
A vaccination programme offered hope for the coming months, said Merkel, adding that she understood people's disappointment with the roll-out, which is far slower than in Britain, Israel and the United States. 
To avoid a third wave of infections, however, a little more patience was required.

Biden’s failure to include Netanyahu so far in his calls with foreign leaders has raised eyebrows in Israel and among Middle East experts. Former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump both spoke to him within days of taking office.
""The president looks forward to speaking with Prime Minister Netanyahu. He's obviously somebody that he has a long-standing relationship with,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a news briefing.
Having been in lockstep with Trump for four years, Netanyahu will likely be challenged by any Biden departure from Trump’s tough policy on Iran and towards the Palestinians.
Biden has pledged to restore U.S. involvement in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal - which Trump had pulled out of - and likely opposition by the White House to Israeli settlement of occupied land where Palestinians seek statehood. 
Trump delighted Netanyahu by quitting the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposing sanctions on it that had been lifted in return for limits on activities that could, potentially, produce nuclear weapons in the future.

""Obviously there's an important relationship that the United States has with Israel on the security front and as a key partner in the region,"" Psaki said. ""He'll be talking with him soon - I don't have a specific date or time for you on that call yet.""

515,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Ethiopia closes camps housing Eritrean refugees in Tigray after reports of attacks,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Two camps in Ethiopia's Tigray region housing Eritrean refugees have been shut and the occupants relocated, authorities said on Thursday, after the United Nations said residents had reported attacks, including by suspected Eritrean troops.
The UNHCR refugee agency has called for protection for the residents of the Shimelba and Hitsats camps, which it says were attacked by armed men who killed and abducted refugees. On Feb. 1, it said residents had reported that Eritrean troops had forced some refugees back into Eritrea.
Accusations of an Eritrean military presence are one of the most contentious issues in Tigray, where the central government has claimed victory over a rebellious regional government in a conflict that began in November.
Eritrea and Ethiopia have both denied that Eritrean troops operated on Ethiopian territory. The ousted Tigrayan regional authorities and many residents accuse Eritrea of intervening on the central government's behalf.
Tesfahun Gobezay, director general of Ethiopia's Agency for Refugees and Returnees Affairs (ARRA), confirmed the camp closures, first reported by the state news agency on Wednesday.
The state-appointed human rights commission reported on Thursday that Shimelba and Hitsats had been ""destroyed"". Tesfahun told Reuters that description was an ""overstatement"".
""There was a lot of fighting in those areas, not in the camps but in those areas where the camps are located,"" he said.
""Refugees didn't get the necessary services quickly and also they panicked due to the firing happening around the camps. So they left the camps, and Ethiopian defence forces sheltered them and escorted them to the nearest towns of Tigray,"" he said.
He said 5,300 refugees had gone to two other refugee camps in Tigray. Others were now in Tigray towns or the capital Addis Ababa.
Chris Melzer, a UNHCR spokesman, said the agency concurred with the conclusion that the camps were now unsafe, ""considering the reports of attacks on Hitsats and Shimelba, the reports of abductions, destruction, looting, and killing of humanitarian staff"". Decisions to relocate must be voluntary and movements must be organised in safety and dignity, he said.
CAMPS UNREACHABLE
Aid agencies say they have been unable to reach the camps since the conflict erupted in Tigray. Reports from all sides are difficult to verify because communications to the region remain patchy and the government tightly controls access.
The United Nations said on Feb. 1. that refugees who had fled from the two camps spoke of ""infiltration of armed actors in the camps, of killings, abductions and also some forced returns to Eritrea at the hands of Eritrean forces"".
In December, a United Nations team was shot at when it tried to reach the Shimelba camp. Two diplomatic sources told Reuters the U.N. team had encountered uniformed troops from Eritrea.
The Ethiopian government's emergency task force for Tigray did not immediately respond to questions about the camps, while the prime minister's office referred Reuters to ARRA. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed launched a military campaign in Tigray to remove the region's then-ruling Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), after the government said regional forces attacked federal troops. Abiy has declared victory, but low level fighting has continued in some areas.
Protests broke out in the regional capital Mekelle on Tuesday and continued on Wednesday, with residents blocking roads, protesting against reported killings by Eritrean troops and the failure of elders to stop the war. One person was shot dead after soldiers opened fire on protesters, according to residents and an aid worker.
Eteneshe Nigusse, spokeswoman for a government-appointed interim administration in Tigray, said she needed to check casualty reports with security. She told Reuters ""the presence of the Eritrean army in Tigray"" was a major issue raised at a meeting of religious leaders, elders and the public on Tuesday.

Washington imposed long-anticipated sanctions on Ankara over the S-400 missiles in December, in a move Ankara has condemned. Turkey's defense minister said on Tuesday that Ankara would propose only partially activating the S-400s in negotiations with the United States.

517,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 01:06PM ET</span>","Myanmar ruler calls for end to protests, sanctions loom","(Reuters) - Myanmar's new junta leader on Thursday called on civil servants to return to work and urged people to stop mass gatherings to avoid spreading coronavirus, as a sixth day of protests against him and his coup spanned the Southeast Asian country.
As Washington moved closer to imposing sanctions, European Union lawmakers called on their countries to also take action against the military leadership and Britain said it was considering measures it could apply to punish the Feb. 1 takeover.
The coup and the detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi along with scores of others have prompted the biggest demonstrations since a 2007 ""Saffron Revolution"" that ultimately became a step towards now halted democratic change.
Senior General Min Aung Hlaing addressed the protests for the first time in public, blaming ""unscrupulous persons"" for stoppages in a growing civil disobedience movement by medics, teachers, railway workers and many other government employees.
""Those who are away from their duties are requested to return to their duties immediately for the interests of the country and people without focusing on the emotion,"" he said.
In a statement issued by the army's information service, he also urged people to avoid gatherings, which he said would fuel the spread of the coronavirus. 
Protesters gathered across the country on Thursday.
Hundreds of workers lined a road in the capital Naypyitaw, chanting anti-junta slogans and carrying placards supporting Suu Kyi. Thousands demonstrated in the main city of Yangon, some taking a humorous approach, such as men dressed in short skirts.
""What a joke! He must be completely delusional to ask people who are protesting against him to come back and work,"" said one Twitter user, who identified as Nyan Bo Bo, in response to Min Aung Hlaing's statement.
CHINA EMBASSY PROTEST
Hundreds of protesters also demonstrated outside the Chinese embassy, accusing Beijing of supporting the military junta despite Chinese denials. They held up pictures of Suu Kyi to demand her release.
The military launched the coup after what it said was widespread fraud in a November election, won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) in a landslide. The electoral commission had rejected those claims.
Suu Kyi, who was swept to power following a historic election victory in 2015, faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkie radios. 
Former minister Kyaw Tint Swe, regarded as her right-hand man, was among five people arrested in another sweep overnight, a senior NLD official said. He had been one of her representatives in crunch talks with the military before the coup.
Myanmar authorities did not answer a request for comment and Reuters was unable to confirm the arrests independently. 
The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners rights group said at least 220 people had been arrested since the coup.
The protests have revived memories of almost half a century of direct army rule, punctuated by bloody crackdowns, until the military began relinquishing some power in 2011.
BIDEN APPROVES SANCTIONS
U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved an executive order for new sanctions on those responsible for the coup.
Washington would identify the first round of targets this week and was taking steps to prevent the generals in Myanmar, also known as Burma, having access to $1 billion in Myanmar government funds held in the United States.
Min Aung Hlaing and other top generals are already under U.S. sanctions over abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities.
European Union lawmakers issued a non-binding resolution urging the reinstatement of civilian rule.
Britain was also looking at further measures it could apply to its former colony, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
""The international community will not accept the coup in Myanmar and we will hold those responsible to account,"" he said.
A draft resolution on Myanmar was formally submitted by Britain and the European Union, a day ahead of a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council.
So far 22 of the forum's 47 member states have sponsored the text, according to the British mission to the U.N. in Geneva.
The sponsors hope that a text can be adopted unanimously to send a strong signal, but it may come to a vote, diplomats said.
The language appeared somewhat watered down from an initial draft circulated informally that would have condemned the coup. The text ""strongly deplores"" the coup, but still calls for the release of Suu Kyi and others, as well as access for U.N. human rights monitors.
Suu Kyi, 75, won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for campaigning for democracy and remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of the Rohingya.

She spent nearly 15 years under house arrest under previous juntas. Her lawyer says he has not been allowed to see her.

A secret ballot will be held to pick one of four candidates remaining out of an initial field of 14 to replace lead prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, who leaves on June 15. 
Intense political jostling for the top job came amid heightened scrutiny of the prosecutor's office.
Former U.S. President Donald Trump's adminstration imposed sanctions last year on court staff including Bensouda over investigations by her office into possible war crimes committed in Afghanistan, including by American troops. The United States is not a member of the court.
Last week the court said it has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in the Palestinian territories, which could lead to an inquiry strongly opposed by non-ICC member Israel and the United States.
One of the first decisions by a new prosecutor could be whether to press ahead with a full investigation into the Palestinian territories, where Bensouda said there is a reasonable basis to conclude war crimes may have been committed by both Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups.
Observers say Britain's Karim Khan, who now heads a United Nations team investigating Islamic State crimes in Iraq, is a favorite to win the lead prosecutor job after leading in negotiations between members following a move to expand the list of final candidates in November.
Khan is closely followed by Irish lawyer Fergal Gaynor. The two other remaining candidates are Spanish prosecutor Carlos Castresana and late entrant Francesco Lo Voi, an Italian prosecutor.
A candidate must gain at least 62 out of 123 voting countries to win. The election process has been the focus of lobbying by states and non-governmental organisations and additional rounds of voting may be required.
A first round is expected Friday when a session of the court's governing body, the Assembly of States Parties, resumes in New York at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).

GENEVA (Reuters) - A jailed Chinese lawyer who defended other human rights lawyers arrested in a sweeping crackdown against activism has won an international human rights award, the jury said on Thursday.
Yu Wensheng was arrested in Jan. 2018, a day after publishing an open letter calling for reforms. He is serving a four-year sentence announced in June 2020 after being convicted at a secret trial of ""inciting subversion"".
The Martin Ennals award, named for a former secretary-general of Amnesty International, has been awarded annually since 1994. The winner is selected by a jury of 10 global human rights organisations, including Amnesty and Human Rights Watch.
Loujain al-Hathloul, a prominent women's rights activist released on Wednesday after nearly three years in Saudi prison, and Soltan Achilova, a journalist documenting violations in her native Turkmenistan, were the other finalists.
The jury praised them as outstanding human rights defenders ""despite the many attempts to silence them by their authoritarian governments"".
""On the eve of the Chinese New Year, we hope this recognition of Yu Wensheng’s work will shine a light on his achievements and help him regain the freedom he has lost,"" said Philippe Currat, president of the board of the Martin Ennals Foundation which oversees the award.
Yu had defended jailed prominent rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang before being stripped of his license and arrested.
“It is an honour for my husband, but also an encouragement to all Chinese human rights defenders to pursue their work despite the hardships,"" his wife Xu Yan said on his nomination. 
Phil Lynch, executive director of the International Service for Human Rights, one of the groups on the jury, said the award showed that ""unjustly imprisoning Yu Wensheng"" and other human rights defenders ""will not go ignored"".

The case against Sobol, who is under house arrest facing charges she flouted COVID-19 restrictions at a protest last month, comes amid a crackdown on Navalny's allies and supporters who have staged several rallies to protest against his jailing. 
Most of Navalny's prominent allies are now in custody or under house arrest, but his supporters plan to stage a brief Valentine's Day protest in residential courtyards across the country this Sunday. 
The new charges against Sobol relate to a case opened in December. Her supporters said she rang the doorbell of a flat owned by the family of a man who Navalny has said was an FSB security service officer involved in his poisoning. 
The FSB has dismissed Navalny's account of the poisoning.
In its account, the Investigative Committee has said that Sobol and several others tried to gain entry to an elderly woman's flat in Moscow, wearing uniforms used by the state consumer health watchdog.
It accused her of tricking a delivery courier to enter the apartment block before barging into the woman's flat when she opened the door. It said Sobol was suspected of using violence to enter illegally.
Sobol's allies used her account on Twitter to say she considered the case to be political. 

Navalny was poisoned in Siberia last summer with what many Western countries say was a military-grade nerve agent.

KABUL (Reuters) - Unknown gunmen attacked a United Nations convoy on the outskirts of Afghanistan's capital on Thursday, killing five Afghan security force members who were escorting the international agency's vehicles, the UN and officials said. 
The attack took place near Kabul, according to an Afghan interior ministry official, adding they believed the insurgent Taliban were behind it. 
A spokesman for the militants said they had nothing to do with the attack.
The UN's mission to Afghanistan said in a statement on Twitter that ""the UN family in Afghanistan mourns the loss of five Afghan...personnel in an incident today.""
Attacks on international forces and foreign players have been rare since the Taliban signed a troop withdrawal deal with Washington almost a year ago. 
However, violence against Afghans has escalated around the nation even as the Taliban and the Afghan government hold peace talks in Qatar. 
On Thursday, three back-to-back blasts in eastern Kunar province left three people dead and two injured, according to a police spokesman. 
At least two people were killed and five others injured in three separate blasts in eastern Nangarhar province, local officials said.
Unknown gunmen shot and injured Qotbuddin Kohi, a journalist working for Pajhwok News agency in northern Faryab province on Thursday, according to the media outlet's director. 
Almost daily deadly attacks with small, magnetic bombs attached to the undercarriages of vehicles, as well as roadside explosive devices and shootings, are unnerving Afghan officials, activists and journalists.
Officials say that peace talks have largely stalled as the violence rises and U.S. President Joe Biden's administration reviews how to handle the peace process.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - A warning from the Cuban embassy in Colombia about a possible attack in Bogota by National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels is inaccurate, the guerrilla group said on Thursday, accusing the Colombian government of planning attacks on civilians. 
Cuba's ambassador earlier this week wrote to the Colombian government to alert it to a supposed attack being planned by the ELN's Eastern Front.
Cuba was the site of brief peace talks between the Marxist ELN and the Colombian government, which collapsed after the ELN bombed Bogota's police academy in 2019, killing more than 20 people. The rebel peace delegation remains in Havana.
""After verifying with all the guerrilla organization of the National Liberation Army, we clarify that the information received by the Cuban embassy in Bogota is not part of the ELN's military plans,"" said the statement, dated Feb. 10 and posted to the ELN's website on Thursday.
""We alert the public that the state's armed forces are planning to carry out terrorist actions against the population to cast blame on the ELN, to intensify international pressure against our delegation in Cuba.""
Asked for his reaction to the ELN's statement, Defense Minister Diego Molano responded with a modified version of a local idiom about thieves mocking their victims.
""After thief and terrorist, buffoon.""
The ambassador's two-paragraph letter said the attack was planned for the coming days, but added the embassy could not evaluate the ""verisimilitude"" of the information.
Colombia has repeatedly urged Cuba to extradite the ELN negotiators on charges related to the police academy bombing.
The delegation, which had told the ambassador it had no knowledge of the supposed planned attack, does not participate in military decision-making, the ELN said.
The ELN, founded by radical Catholic priests in 1964, is widely considered to be less centrally controlled than the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group, which inked a peace deal with the government in 2016.

ROME (Reuters) - If Italy's prime minister-designate Mario Draghi gets his government off the ground, he will have to confront several thorny problems that - in previous jobs - he had a role in creating.
Draghi, a former European Central Bank chief, is feted in Italian media as a national saviour and parties who have fought each other for years now want to join forces in his coalition, but his record has shadows as well as light.
Resurrecting the Italian economy, the most chronically sluggish in the euro zone, will be his top priority, but he will also have big corporate headaches to resolve, from the plight of the world's oldest bank to that of Italy's main road-toll operator. 
On all these fronts, Draghi the prime minister will have to untangle knots tied in past years by Draghi the Italian Treasury chief and Draghi the ECB president. 
That raises questions about how he will proceed.
With billions of euros to spend from the European Union Recovery Fund, Draghi will doubtless initially show no trace of the austerity he once promoted, but how will he approach negotiations to rewrite the EU's budget rules? And will he proceed with Rome's plans to nationalise the motorways that he himself privatised as Treasury director general in the 1990s? 
A popular meme on social media in Italy sums up the Draghi enigma.
It pictures him with a raised hand and the caption ""this hand can be Friedman, or it can be Keynes"", referring to the economists Milton Friedman, who famously espoused free markets, and John Maynard Keynes who championed state intervention.
""Draghi is above all a pragmatist,"" said Mauro Gallegati, an economics professor at Marche University. ""He used to be all about austerity, market forces and privatisations. Now he is in a transition from Friedman to Keynes.""
Draghi's plans for a ministry for ecological transition suggest a strong role for the state in tackling climate change, something Friedman and probably the Draghi of the 1990s would have wanted left to the market.
ECB LETTER
Draghi has made no public comments on his policy plans. He was not available to comment on this article.
Even before COVID-19 plunged Italy into its steepest post-war recession, the country had barely grown for two decades.
Its many problems range from an ageing, shrinking workforce to a lack of public investment and a cloying state bureaucracy.
Yet a growing number of economists agree the austerity measures that Draghi upheld as ECB chief alongside other EU institutions exacerbated those difficulties, weakening Italy's production capacity and crimping its growth potential.
Just ahead of his eight-year tenure as ECB president in 2011 Draghi was co-signatory to a letter to the Italian government calling for spending cuts and accelerated deficit reduction.
That year, Italy's potential growth - measuring the cruise rate at which the economy can grow without generating inflation - was calculated by the International Monetary Fund at 0.7% and estimated to remain stable for the next five years.
Two years later, after draconian budget curbs and deep recession, the IMF's estimate had fallen to -0.3%, and was projected to remain below 0.5% for the next four years.
In 2012 Draghi, along with the European Commission, was a promoter of the ""Fiscal Compact"", which toughened the terms of the EU's Stability Pact by imposing faster fiscal consolidation for high debt countries like Italy.
However, despite running a tight budget, Italy's debt continued to grow as a proportion of output because the economy either shrank or stagnated. By 2014, the debt-to-gross domestic product ratio had risen to 132% from 116% in 2011.
""I think they realised what they did to southern Europe was a mistake, nobody was talking about austerity anymore even before the coronavirus hit,"" said Roberto Perotti, an economics professor at Milan's Bocconi University. 
SAVING MONTE PASCHI
As governor of the Bank of Italy in 2008, Draghi approved the purchase by centuries-old bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), Italy's third largest, of rival lender Antonveneta at an inflated price that analysts say contributed to its financial meltdown.
He was also responsible for its oversight while MPS took out derivative contracts that undermined its accounts.
Italy owns 64% of the bank after a 2017 bailout that cost taxpayers 5.4 billion euros. It has promised the European Commission that it will exit by mid-2022. 
Draghi was ECB chief in mid-2017 when it declared MPS was solvent, clearing the way for the European Commission to authorise the bailout.
The Treasury is now trying to find a buyer for the bank, a task that will fall to Draghi as prime minister. 
On Wednesday, MPS reported 2020 results showing its annual loss had soared to 1.7 billion euros ($2.06 billion).
FROM PRIVATISER TO NATIONALISER?
Draghi will also have to decide whether to complete the nationalisation of Italy's largest toll road operator, Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI), whose privatisation he organised as Treasury director general in the 1990s.
The privatisation terms are now widely criticised for having created a virtual private monopoly, with huge profits for the buyer - the Benetton family. 
The sell-off was in the spotlight again after the 2018 collapse of a bridge in Genoa, killing 43 people. Prosecutors say the disaster was mainly caused by scant investment in maintenance despite the company's massive profits.
ASPI and its holding company Atlantia deny all wrongdoing.
""The ASPI privatisation was a great deal only for the buyer, to the detriment of road-users and the taxpayer,"" said Massimo D'Antoni, an economics professor at Siena University. 
The ASPI operation was just one of a raft of sell-offs organised by Draghi, including the bank MPS, some of which failed to create prosperous companies.
""We have to recognise that Draghi was in charge of a privatisation drive that didn't go too well,"" said Marche University's Gallegati, adding that he believed Draghi would proceed with the re-nationalisation of the motorways.

SANTA RITA DO SAPUCAI, Brazil (Reuters) - When Vitória Bueno's mother first dropped her off at ballet class, she worried about her five-year-old fitting in. 
Born without arms, Bueno's dream of being a dancer seemed painfully unrealistic - especially in a small town in rural Brazil, where her disability made her a social curiosity. 
""People would line up outside the house to see her,"" said her mother Wanda, 39, still hurt as she recalled the insensitivity. ""They would lift up her sleeves to look.""
But Bueno, now 16, focused on her assemblés, pirouettes and other technical challenges.
She took up jazz and tap as well.
Now a regular at the ballet academy in her hometown in the state of Minas Gerais, Bueno's talent has made her a social media star and an inspiration to many.
""For me, arms, they're just a detail,"" Bueno said at the theater where she performs. ""I follow with my eyes, as if they were there.""
Watching her glide across the wooden stage, synchronized with her colleagues in a dazzle of green and white, it is easy to forget she dances without arms.
""I don't feel like I need them at all,"" she added.
She started ballet on the advice of her physiotherapist, who noticed the young Bueno would arrive dancing.
More than just realizing a dream, the strength and flexibility gained through dance have proven crucial to Bueno, who does everything from brushing her teeth to picking items off the supermarket shelf with her feet.
""There are things she can do with her feet that I can't do with my hands,"" said her stepfather, Jose Carlos Perreira. 
With over 150,000 Instagram followers (@vihb_bailarina), Bueno is glad to be a role model for others too.

""We are more than our disabilities, so we have to chase our dreams,"" she said, flashing a broad smile.

526,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 11, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>","France, Germany seek Russia sanctions over Navalny, diplomats say","By John Irish and Robin Emmott
PARIS (Reuters) - The European Union is likely to impose travel bans and asset freezes on allies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, possibly as soon as this month, after France and Germany signalled their willingness to move ahead, three diplomats said.
The sanctions, in response to the jailing of Putin's main domestic critic Alexei Navalny, could be the first to be imposed under a new framework enacted in December, which allows the EU to take measures against human rights violators worldwide.
But Berlin and Paris are still likely to withhold support for tougher steps sought by some European allies, such as halting the huge Nord Stream II gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.
Pressure for sanctions has grown since Moscow infuriated European countries last week by expelling German, Polish and Swedish diplomats without telling the EU's foreign policy chief, who was in Moscow for a visit. Paris and Berlin now say there must be a response.
Poland, Baltic countries, the Czech Republic and Romania had already been pushing for sanctions, and the agreement of the EU's two most powerful countries means other EU states are unlikely to block it. The decision could be taken when EU foreign ministers hold their next meeting on Feb. 22.
""We can't avoid sanctions anymore,"" said a European diplomat. ""There is a consensus including in Germany to have sanctions. We can't respond in any other way.""
Germany has been vocal in support of Navalny, who was treated there for what Berlin says was poisoning by a Soviet-era nerve agent. But it also has close energy links to Russia.
Russia controls a third of Europe’s gas market. The $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, led by Russia's state energy company Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), would double the capacity of an existing undersea pipeline which bypasses Ukraine and deprives Kyiv of transit fees.
Berlin, with support from Paris, says sanctions should not target the pipeline, despite U.S. punitive measures against the project and a European Parliament resolution calling for it to be blocked.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told German lawmakers on Wednesday that sanctions needed to hit Russians responsible for Navalny's jailing. France's foreign ministry, in response to a Reuters question on whether it backed sanctions, said: ""The latest developments, especially with regard to Alexei Navalny's situation, will be fully taken into account. The EU's response must be united, strong and comprehensive"".
The EU already imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Last year it imposed travel bans and asset freezes on six Russian officials close to Putin over Navalny's poisoning. Moscow has denied blame for Navalny's illness and says it has seen no proof he was poisoned.
When a former Russian spy was poisoned in then-EU member Britain in 2018, the bloc took more than a year to impose sanctions, which targeted lower level military intelligence agents rather than Russia's national leadership. Now it is under pressure to take more forceful measures, and faster.

Two allies of Navalny, Vladimir Ashurkov and Leonid Volkov, joined a video call with EU states and envoys from Britain, the United States, Canada and Ukraine on Monday to propose senior figures in business, political, judicial and security circles who could face sanctions, according to Western diplomats.

Prosecutors accuse Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, of violating his bond terms by not informing the court of his address. They are asking a Kenosha County, Wisconsin, judge to increase his bond by $200,000 and issue a warrant for his arrest.
Rittenhouse's lawyers have said threats to his safety prompted him to conceal his whereabouts. They said they would be willing to disclose his address under seal - an offer declined by prosecutors.
Rittenhouse was due to appear before Kenosha County Circuit Judge Bruce Schroeder at 1:15 p.m. CST (1915 GMT) for a bond hearing, according to court records.
Rittenhouse had traveled on Aug. 25 from his home in nearby Antioch, Illinois, in a self-appointed role to protect the streets of Kenosha where the police shooting of Jacob Blake had sparked large protests against police brutality and racism.
He has been charged in Kenosha County with first-degree homicide and five other criminal counts related to the shootings, in which two people were killed and a third was wounded.
Rittenhouse's legal team has said their client, who is white, feared for his life when he fired his semi-automatic rifle, and have indicated they plan to argue self-defense.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark said on Thursday it will significantly strengthen its defence capabilities in the Arctic, including long-range drones and radars, as shrinking sea ice has fast-tracked a race among global powers for control over resources and waterways.
The military build-up comes as both China and Russia have been making increasingly assertive moves in the region, even as Denmark and its Arctic neighbours have tried in recent decades to keep the region what they call a ""low tension"" area. 
Lawmakers in the Nordic country agreed to spend half of the allocated 1.5 billion Danish crowns ($245 million) on drones to improve surveillance in Greenland, a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
Nearly 400 million will be spend on an air surveillance radar in the Faroe Islands located in the North Atlantic.
""We have seen an increase in foreign activities in the Arctic and the North Atlantic,"" Defence Minister Trine Bramsen said in a statement.
""We need better surveillance and presence in the region - not to escalate conflicts, but because we need to take the threats seriously,"" she said. 
The United States also has increased focus on the Arctic and Greenland in recent years. Former president Donald Trump offered in 2019 to buy Greenland, the world's largest island, from Denmark.
NATO-member Denmark currently has one aircraft, four helicopters and four ships to monitor the vast area. In addition to enforcing sovereignty, they handle fishing inspection and search and rescue operations. Six sleds powered by 80 dogs patrol the remote northeastern part.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Georgy Malets didn't make it to an anti-Kremlin rally last month. He was detained on his way there by police using facial recognition technology in the Moscow metro.
The 30-year-old Russian photo blogger said the police told him he had been identified by a ""Face-ID"" camera system and must accompany them to a police station for checks. 
""I could see they had some kind of photographs, but they weren't from cameras - it was definitely a photograph from my profile on social networks,"" Malets told Reuters. 
He said he was questioned for four hours as a witness in a criminal case the police said had been opened into earlier rallies, so missed the Jan. 31 protest.
Moscow police and the IT and transport departments of the mayor's office did not respond to requests for comment. 
But reports from other protesters who have attend rallies in recent weeks in support of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny also indicate police are using facial recognition technology to make preventive arrests and detentions.
An unnamed law enforcement source told TASS news agency the technology used images stored on a database of regular protesters. Rights advocates expressed concern surveillance systems were being used for this purpose. 
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
Samariddin Radzhabov, who was tried for throwing a plastic bottle at a police officer in 2019, said he was also detained on the metro before the Jan. 31 rally and then released. 
Ekaterina Schulmann said her husband Mikhail was detained after entering the Moscow metro following a protest. 
""They (the police) said he was stopped because 'face control had reacted' and that he had to go to an investigator as a witness in some kind of criminal case,"" she told Reuters.
Three others at the police station he was taken to had also been identified using facial recognition technology, she said.
The Moscow mayor's office announced it was rolling out a facial recognition system in the metro to spot wanted criminals in 2018, when Russia hosted the soccer World Cup. There are now surveillance cameras all over Moscow.
""There is still a lot we don't know about the facial recognition system in Moscow,"" said Kirill Koroteev, a lawyer at human rights group Agora. 
He said it was unclear how automated the system was, whether all cameras used it and which databases it used. 
""At first they said the system would be used to find lost kids and fugitive convicts,"" said Sarkis Darbinyan, an Internet freedom advocate. ""Then they used it to monitor self-isolation during the pandemic, and now, as expected, to monitor protests and activists."" 
PANIC BUTTON
Tens of thousands have protested since Navalny was arrested after returning from Germany following treatment for poisoning in Siberia with what Western countries say was a nerve agent. 
He was jailed on Feb. 2 for violating parole on what he says was a trumped-up charge. The Kremlin denies his treatment is politically motivated and questions whether he was poisoned.
The Kremlin has also defended thepolice against accusations of using disproportionate force, saying the protests are illegal because they have not been approved and could spread COVID-19.
Protesters have for several years used social media to coordinate rallies. Now they also have a smartphone app available which, if they are detained, allows them to obtain a lawyer as easily as ordering a taxi, says its founder, Kaloy Akhilgov.
The Advocall app contains a panic button to summon a lawyer, contacts for lawyers and instructions on how to behave if detained or questioned. 

Akhilgov, who runs a law firm, said his lawyers would work without charge to help protesters if necessary. About 4,600 people had downloaded the app and over 300 requests for legal assistance had been received via the app, he said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia will deport 1,200 detained Myanmar nationals after the Myanmar military government, which took over in a Feb. 1 coup, offered to send three navy ships to pick them up, officials from both countries and two sources told Reuters.
Myanmar, via its embassy in Kuala Lumpur, made the offer to take back its citizens held in Malaysian immigration detention centres last week, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The detention centres typically hold asylum-seekers and refugees, along with others who are in Malaysia without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as illegal migrants.
The officials did not respond to queries as to whether those being repatriated included refugees.
Detainees have in the past included members of the Chin, Kachin and the Muslim Rohingya communities fleeing ethnic conflict and persecution by the military in Myanmar. 
Malaysia is home to more than 154,000 asylum-seekers from Myanmar, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. There are also thousands of migrant workers.
The sources said Myanmar had offered to take back only its citizens. Myanmar recognises over 100 ethnic groups but not the Rohingya, who are seen as illegal migrants from Bangladesh.
The sources, who requested anonymity, said the navy ships were expected to arrive in Malaysia on Feb. 21 and leave two days later.
Malaysia's Director-General of Immigration Khairul Dzaimee Daud confirmed the details, adding that authorities had agreed to hand over the detainees to Myanmar's navy. 
""Yes we have agreed. All of them are from immigration depots,"" he said in a text message, without elaborating. 
Win Min Soe, a labour attache at the Myanmar embassy, also confirmed Myanmar's offer. 
Spokesmen for the Malaysian prime minister's office and foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment. 
James Bawi Thang Bik, of the Kuala Lumpur-based Alliance of Chin Refugees, said that while Malaysia has regularly deported Myanmar nationals, this was the first time Myanmar's navy had offered to help repatriate its citizens. 
He called on Malaysian authorities to work with the UNHCR to determine whether those to be deported included undocumented refugees. 
""Refugees are in danger of being sentenced to jail and persecuted if they are sent back to Myanmar,"" he said. 
The coup and the detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi along with scores of others have prompted the biggest demonstrations in Myanmar since a 2007 ""Saffron Revolution"" that ultimately became a step towards democratic reforms.
In 2017, Myanmar's army drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to neighbouring Bangladesh in an operation that the United Nations has said was carried out with “genocidal intent”.
Myanmar denies the accusation.

(Reuters) - Among the hundreds of thousands who have taken to the streets of Myanmar in recent days have been members of the Southeast Asian nation's many faiths – majority Buddhists as well as Christians, Muslims and Hindus, and dozens of distinct ethnic groups.
Major ethnic armed organizations – whose rebel armies control vast swathes of the country – have also thrown their weight behind a growing civil disobedience movement and indicated they will not tolerate crackdowns on protesters by the military leaders who seized power in a Feb. 1 coup.
""What is happening right now is not about party politics,"" said Ke Jung, a youth leader from the Naga, a group of tribes on the remote Indian border. The Naga Party, the biggest political party in the region, released a statement condemning the coup.
""It is a fight for a system,"" Ke Jung told Reuters by phone. ""We cannot compromise with the military, it will give us a black mark on our history.""
Protests have taken place across the country of 53 million, from the southeastern shores of the Andaman Sea to the temple-studded central plains and the mountainous northern borders, demanding the military that overthrew and detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her government surrender power and release the detainees.
On Thursday, thousands staged a protest aboard traditional fishing boats on Inle Lake in Shan state, while thousands of majority Christian ethnic Karen marked their National Day in the main city of Yangon and elsewhere with mass protests against the coup.
ETHNIC DIVISIONS
The diverse identity of the protesters - who have marched in pouring rain and scorching heat, wearing hoodies and flip flops, Spiderman costumes and traditional outfits - has shown rare unity in a country often riven along ethnic lines.
Myanmar has been at war within its borders for decades, with government troops battling ethnic armed groups seeking greater autonomy.
Minorities have often harboured deeply held grievances against the state dominated by the Bamar Buddhist ethnic majority they say has marginalized and oppressed them.
Many felt Suu Kyi's government, which came to power in a landslide 2015 election that ended nearly half a century of military rule, failed to live up to its top campaign pledge to bring peace to the fractious borderlands.
But the army that has seized power is accused of the gravest crimes against ethnic minorities, including mass killings and rapes during the expulsion of more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine in a 2017. The army has been accused of genocide in a case brought at The Hague, which it denies.
The new military government has tried to appeal to ethnic leaders, giving key positions to prominent ethnic politicians. In his first public address, coup leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing said the goal of the new junta was ""eternal peace"".
'END THE DICTATORSHIP'
Phado Man Nyein Maung, a former senior leader of the Karen National Union (KNU), one of the largest ethnic armed groups, and one of those who accepted positions with the junta, told Reuters a decade-long democratic experiment had not enshrined greater rights for the minority.
""Our political demands are not fulfilled with the democratic elections – this is the main lesson that we learned,"" Phado Man Nyein Maung said by phone. 
But the KNU has sought to distance itself from him and on Thursday its leader, Saw Mutu Saypho, called for all ethnic groups to ""work together to absolutely end the dictatorship"".
Troops from the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA), a splinter group of another Karen armed organization, drove into the centre of one of the protests on Sunday after government troops fired shots into the air. Wielding rifles, the fighters rolled in on trucks to applause and shouts.
Other powerful groups, including the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS), have also expressed support for the anti-coup movement. 
TNLA leaders posted pictures on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of themselves making the three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salute that has become a symbol of the movement. ""May the military dictatorship fall down,"" the post said.
A spokesman for the Arakan Army (AA), which has been locked in a deadly conflict with government troops in western Rakhine state since 2018, said it was ""closely monitoring the current developments inside Myanmar"".
The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) in the north has not formally commented, but one senior KIA leader warned the army in a Facebook post not to shoot demonstrators.
Saw Kapi, a Karen leader and founding director of the Salween Institute think-tank, said many saw it as their ""duty"" to oppose the coup.

""Thousands of ethnic youths joined the nationwide protests today,"" he said. ""Their common goal is to reject military dictatorship and establish a federal democracy in Myanmar.""

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A committee tasked with dismantling the government of toppled former president Omar al-Bashir has issued a wide-ranging order to prosecute members of Sudan's ex-ruling party following days of violent protests across the country.
Posted early on Thursday, the decree directed state governors to‮ ‬take action through the public prosecutor against ""all leaders of the dissolved National Congress Party, and its active cadres and the leaders of its facades"". 
Military generals ousted hardline Islamist Bashir in April 2019 and now rule in a fragile transitional arrangement with political parties that were part of the uprising against him.
Over the past few days, protests by Bashir-era loyalists have taken a violent turn in major cities across Sudan, with government buildings and vehicles set on fire and property pillaged.
Markets were looted in several cities, and a spokesman for the committee described the situation as an ""economic war"" against Hamdok's government, which has struggled with price hikes and fuel and bread shortages.
While the NCP was formally dissolved after the coup, former Bashir supporters have led unrest in Khartoum and other cities, and the transitional period has seen reported coup plots and a botched assassination attempt on Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.
On Thursday the public prosecution issued an order for the arrest of eight men including well-known Bashir allies suspected to have gone into hiding.
Hamdok on Wednesday swore in a new cabinet and formed a working group of ministers to monitor the aftermath of the protests.
The committee tasked with dismantling Bashir's repressive ruling apparatus said it had received information about activities by former NCP members ""to organise arson and looting and terrorise unarmed citizens"".
Governors of several states said the protests were distinct from other, peaceful demonstrations held in protest against a worsening economic crisis.
""It was not isolated, nor was it a sudden act or reaction, but rather an arranged and politically planned action by the former regime,"" said North Darfur Governor Mohamed Hassan al-Arabi.

Desperate workers from Africa and Asia are turning to charities and aid organisations. 
    There are hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in Lebanon but rights groups say its labour laws do not provide adequate protection or health cover. 
    Hospitals are running out of capacity to treat critically ill patients as a result of a spike in infections since the Christmas and New Year holidays. Lebanon has registered 328,016 cases and 3,803 deaths. 
    ""Because of the economic crisis and because of the outbreak of the COVID pandemic as well, there's been a decrease in the quality of life of migrant workers and they find themselves certainly in a more dire situation,"" said Médecins Sans Frontières field coordinator Maya Trad.
    She and her colleagues have set up a helpline that directs callers to mental health, medical or social support.

    The Siblin Isolation Centre, run in partnership with the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, helps curb transmission of the virus in communities where people cannot isolate, MSF says.
    For one migrant worker, the experience left her grateful and touched.
    ""I felt that I had found my place, their human interaction is great,"" she said after recovering. ""I left in tears. I wanted to stay in that place.""
    But now she plans to fly home.

Berberoglu regained his status as a lawmaker when the court decision regarding his case was read out in parliament on Thursday. 
Parliament stripped Berberoglu of his parliamentary status last June along with two pro-Kurdish MPs when convictions against them became final.

The 36 pages outlining the proposed laws were given to mobile operators and telecoms license holders for comment on Tuesday - just over a week after the army overthrew the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, the civil society groups said.
Spokesmen for the government and telecommunication ministry did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
The proposed bill would give unprecedented censorship powers and violate privacy, contravening democratic norms and fundamental rights, said the Asia Internet Coalition, whose members include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
""This would significantly undermine freedom of expression and represents a regressive step after years of progress,"" the group said in a statement.
""We urge the military leaders to consider the potentially devastating consequences of these proposed laws on Myanmar’s people and economy.""
A copy of the proposed bill, reviewed by Reuters, says its aims include protecting the public and preventing crime and the use of electronic technology to harm the state or its stability.
It says internet providers would have to prevent or remove content deemed to ""cause hatred, destroy unity and tranquillity"" to be ""untruthful news or rumours"" or to be inappropriate to Myanmar's culture, such as pornography. 
""We are aware of the draft cyber security bill and are in the process of reviewing it,"" said Cathrine Stang Lund, a spokeswoman for mobile operator Telenor.
More than 150 Myanmar civil society organisations said in a statement: ""The so-called bill includes clauses which violate human rights, including the rights to freedom of expression, data protection and privacy, and other democratic principles and human rights.""
Days after seizing power, the military rulers banned Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms where its critics had voiced opposition. The junta blocked the Internet for a day, but that did not stop giant anti-coup protests.

Myanmar was one of the world's most isolated countries under military rule from 1962 to 2011, when a quasi-civilian government began liberalisation.

Protesters were shot on Oct. 20 by people witnesses said were soldiers at the toll gate in the affluent Lekki district of Lagos. Rights group Amnesty International said soldiers and police killed at least 12 protesters in Lekki and another district. The military and police have denied involvement.
Nationwide protests against police brutality were largely peaceful until the Oct. 20 shooting, which spawned some of the worst civil unrest since the 1999 return to civilian rule in Africa's most populous country.
A judicial commission in Lagos is looking into the allegations that the army and police opened fire on protesters on Oct. 20. Social media campaigners said a demonstration would be held at the toll gate on Saturday in protest at its reopening before the commission had completed its investigation.
In response, Information Minister Lai Mohammed said the planned rally could turn violent because of ""hoodlums"".
""We therefore strongly warn those who are planning to re-occupy Lekki Toll Gate on Saturday to desist,"" Mohammed told a news conference on Thursday in the capital Abuja. 
""While peaceful protests are the constitutional rights of Nigerians, violent protests are not. At this time, the chances that any peaceful protest will be hijacked are very high.""
Violence would not be tolerated, he said, adding: ""The security agents are ready for any eventuality."" 
The unrest in October led to the deaths of six soldiers, 37 policemen and 57 civilians, as well as the destruction of 269 private and public properties, Mohammed said.

ROME (Reuters) - Sister Nathalie Becquart, 52, who Pope Francis appointed last week to a key Vatican post, is an accomplished seafarer who loves using nautical images to illustrate her views of life, faith and the role of women in the Roman Catholic Church.
""I find myself sailing in the middle of the ocean towards a new adventure,"" she said of her new position.
Becquart, a member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters, was appointed joint number two of the Synod of Bishops, a department that prepares major meetings of world bishops held every few years..
She will become the first woman to have a right to vote in the assemblies, something many women and some bishops have called for. 
Catholic media have called her appointment ""historic"" or a ""revolution"" because of its possible long-term ramifications.
""This is a very brave sign and a very prophetic choice by Pope Francis,"" she told reporters on Wednesday. ""I also hope this points to a concrete change.""
Women have participated as observers and consultants in past synods but only ""synod fathers"", including bishops and specially appointed or elected male representatives, could vote on final positions sent to the pope. He then writes his own document.
""What I am discovering at the Vatican is that you need a lot of patience,"" said Becquart, who has worked as a consultant in the synod office since 2019.
""Many tasks and roles are not always easy. It's like when you are in the open sea - you have storms but you also have wonderful moments and incredible landscapes,"" she said.
SISTER SKIPPER
Becquart doesn't mind being called ""The Sailing Nun"". Before she joined the Xaviere Sisters, she learned to sail as a girl on the Atlantic coast of France, becoming a skipper and taking part in many regattas.
She studied at the prestigious HEC business school in Paris and also worked as a consultant in marketing and advertising. Today, like many sisters, Becquart does not wear a traditional habit but dresses simply, with a cross on a jacket lapel or on a necklace. 
Her love of sailing never disappeared. Even after she entered the religious life, she skippered spiritual retreats for young Catholics, spending a week or two on 40-foot (12-metre) boats in the Atlantic and Mediterranean and still sails when she can.
Francis has upheld the Church's tradition barring women priests, but he has set up commissions to study the history of women deacons in the early centuries of the Catholic Church, responding to calls by women that they be allowed to take up the role today. 
He has also named six women to senior roles in the council that oversees Vatican finances, and women as deputy foreign minister, director of the Vatican Museums and deputy head of the Vatican Press Office.
Becquart says the Church's ""patriarchal mindset is changing"" and she is convinced that Francis will do more for women.

""Pope Francis is a man of his own generation and does not necessarily share the mindset of a young person,"" she said. ""But he is close, he is rooted in the people of God and he feels, he listens. He is the one who is writing history.""

NAZARETH, Israel (Reuters) - Few Arab politicians in Israel's history have openly flirted with the country's right wing, let alone endorsed its main candidate for prime minister.
But Ali Salam, the mayor of Nazareth, says that he sees ""no better choice"" for Israel's 21% Arab minority than veteran conservative Benjamin 'Bibi' Netanyahu.
In the build-up to a fourth election in two years, Salam has hosted Netanyahu in Israel's largest Arab city, disparaged protests against him and actively cheered a split in Israel's main Arab coalition, the Joint List.
""Bibi, if you ask me, is the best one to continue for another five years,"" Salam, 69, told Reuters in Nazareth, the city where Jesus grew up, according to Christian tradition.
For Netanyahu, the embrace of Salam and divisions among hitherto united Arab parties might help divide the opposition and nudge Israel's complex coalition arithmetic a fraction in his direction, ahead of a March 23 election that polls indicate will be a tight race.
The mayor's rhetoric contrasts with other Arab leaders, who have long accused Netanyahu of demonising Arabs.
On election day in 2015, Netanyahu urged his voters to turn out, warning that Arabs were flocking to the polls ""in droves"".
In 2019 his party sent monitors equipped with body cameras to polling stations in Arab towns, prompting allegations of voter intimidation.
And many Arabs were infuriated by a 2018 law that asserted Israel was the historic homeland of the Jewish people ""and they have an exclusive right to national self-determination in it.""
But as a city leader with no national political ambitions, Salam says his job is to deliver the best for his 110,000 residents.
And he lambasts the Arab political establishment which, he says, has failed to bring government investment to Arab communities.
""Speaking honestly and clearly: Bibi's tenure has brought the strongest improvement of the economic situation in Arab society, ever,"" Salam said.
Salam said he planned to vote for the United Arab List, an Islamist party that split away from the Joint List last week after its leader also advocated, unsuccessfully, that it work with Netanyahu.
UNPOPULAR VIEW 
Israel's Arab minority - Palestinian by heritage, Israeli by citizenship - is mostly descended from the Palestinians who lived under Ottoman and then British colonial rule before staying in Israel after the country's 1948 creation.
Ahmad Tibi, a Joint List lawmaker, said Arab leaders embracing Netanyahu were ""a joke"".
""Maybe it's Stockholm Syndrome, to have empathy with that person who kidnapped you, or oppressed you,"" Tibi said. He believes that Netanyanu ""will not (get) a lot of votes, even if he is smiling and laughing more.""
The debate over whether to work with Netanyahu reflects deep frustration with existing Arab parties, said Asad Ghanem, a professor of political science at Haifa University. 
""The fact that the head of the biggest Arab town in Israel supports Netanyahu, without being afraid to say it, reflects an Arab society in political crisis without an agenda to solve its challenges, (principally) crime and violence,"" Ghanem said.
Netanyahu has also tried to woo Arab voters by pledging 100 million shekels ($30.7 million) to combat violence in Arab towns, and promising to include an Arab minister in his next government.
Only 25% of Arabs believe they should cooperate with Netanyahu, according to one poll. But few see a realistic alternative, according to Arik Rudnitzky, of the Israel Democracy Institute.

""Are you ready to cooperate with any government to achieve your needs, or would you like to wait all your life in the opposition?"" Rudnitzky said.

In 2017, just two months after a chaotic and short-lived declaration of independence thrust Catalonia into the global spotlight and triggered Spain's deepest political crisis for decades, two separatist parties garnered enough votes in parliament to form a coalition.
This time, with fears over the pandemic potentially leading to record-high voter abstention rates, the outcome is wide open.
The two main separatist parties - centre-right Junts and leftist Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya - are neck and neck in opinion polls with the Socialists, whose campaign is being led by Spain's former health minister. 
The separatists hope to top a combined 50% of votes for the first time.
But even if they get to form another coalition - and some surveys have shown the Socialists, who favour continued union with Spain, ahead - a renewed independence push appears off the agenda, at least for the time being.
DIALOGUE, OR CONFRONTATION?
In the aftermath of the events of 2017 - when national authorities first outlawed an independence referendum and, after the region unilaterally declared secession, temporarily took over its government - many of the movements senior leaders are either in jail or have left Spain to avoid prosecution.
""The separatist movement does not have a (clear goal) on the horizon as it did in 2017,"" said Joan Esculies, history professor at the University of Vic, north of Barcelona.
The movement has also been weakened by divisions over strategy. 
Esquerra favours dialogue with the leftist central government and has been one of its key partners in the Spanish parliament, while Junts has adopted a more confrontational approach.
The Socialists, the senior party in Spain's governing national coalition, chose Salvador Illa, health minister in Madrid until two weeks ago, to front their campaign, seeking to benefit from his exposure during the pandemic.
Illa, 54, has embraced a conciliatory tone. He opposes independence but has promised dialogue. 
Were he to snatch the region away from the separatists, which would also entail finding coalition partners, that would mark a significant break with history, as nationalist parties have governed Catalonia for 34 of the last 41 years.
""I propose to look forward to the future without reproaches,"" Illa told Reuters, also promising an economic revival in a region that suffered an exodus of businesses following the referendum.
The election could also have repercussions in Madrid. 

If Junts remains the biggest separatist party, there could be growing internal opposition to Esquerra's strategy after it handed votes to the Spanish government in exchange for dialogue on the Catalan political crisis.

A Savanta ComRes poll for The Scotsman showed 47% would vote for independence and 42% would vote against, up 4 percentage points, with 10% still undecided.
Scottish nationalists are pushing for an independence referendum to be held after this May's Scottish parliament election, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said such votes should happen only once in a generation.
Alongside polling on independence support, the survey found that Scottish Conservatives had gained popularity while there was greater support for both Johnson and the British government.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been accused by her predecessor and mentor, Alex Salmond, of misleading parliament over the government's unlawful investigation of sexual harassment claims against him. 
She has denied misleading parliament. Salmond was cleared by a jury at Edinburgh's High Court of all sexual assault charges.
""That kind of division could perhaps make people think twice about independence and whether or not the SNP can be trusted ultimately to have a united front when it is needed the most to get independence over the line,"" said Chris Hopkins, political research director at Savanta ComRes.
In a referendum in 2014, Scots voted 55%-45% to remain in the United Kingdom, but both Brexit and the British government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis have bolstered support for independence among Scots.

If Scots voted to leave, it would be the biggest shock to the United Kingdom since Irish independence a century ago - just as it grapples with the impact of Brexit, a move that Scotland's voters strongly opposed.

GAZA (Reuters) - Ahmed Al-Natour was working at his Gaza market shoe stall when a fire started in a nearby bakery and swept through a crowd of shoppers last March.
Twenty-five people were killed and Natour, 34, suffered severe burns to his face and other parts of his body. Back home after months in hospital, he is venturing out wearing a therapeutic mask now being made locally for the first time.
Using a 3D scanner in its clinic and a 3D printer owned by a Gaza business, Medecins Sans Frontieres-France provides compressive masks for Gaza facial burn victims to help them heal and prepare some for reconstructive surgery.
The transparent masks are made of solid plastic materials imported from France that help soften tissues and prevent complications such as scarring.
""I feel comfortable when I wear it, and it relaxes the face. It is easy to use, and I go shopping while wearing it,"" Natour said, as he wore the mask fastened with elastic straps.
In the past, 3D masks were available for burn patients in Gaza only when they travelled to Jordan for reconstructive surgery.
Coronavirus travel restrictions have made such journeys difficult, with only two Gaza patients able to make the trip in 2020 compared with 25 in 2019.
Abed El-Hamid Qaradaya, MSF-France's physiotherapy activity manager in Gaza, said at one of the organisation's clinics that the masks had made a major difference for some patients.

""We have made face masks for 23 patients since the middle of 2020, and they helped to transform their lives,"" he said.

REIMS, France (Reuters) - When Marie-Ines Romelle, a Black woman born on the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, decided to join the exclusive world of France's champagne producers, she saw no one who looked like her.
Instead of being intimidated, she applied the motto by which she tries to live her life.
""You have to dare. When we dare, we manage to push open doors,"" she said.
Romelle, 42, is now running her own champagne label, in partnership with a local vineyard, and says it is has found a market among customers of Caribbean origin who want a brand that reflects their connections with the region.
The brand is called Marie Cesaire, a portmanteau of the names of her mother and father. In a nod to the Caribbean, the label on the bottle carries an image of a hummingbird and the drink is sweetened with raw cane sugar.
To the best of her knowledge, she is the only Black producer of champagne, a strictly regulated designation that is reserved exclusively for people making the sparkling wine in the Champagne region of northeast France.
When Romelle was 3 years old, she and her family moved from Guadeloupe to a Paris suburb.
Her father died when she was 9. She left school at 16 to support her family. She developed a passion for champagne when she worked as a sales assistant in an airport delicatessen near Paris.
Years later in 2015, after jobs managing stores, working as a bank asset manager and studying for a business degree, she moved to the champagne region and launched her brand.
She said she hoped to blaze a trail for other people from ethnic minority groups.
""We have to stop building barriers and telling ourselves that 'I can't do this or that',"" she said.

""I hope that tomorrow, someone will identify with me, and that I will make an impact on them, that they will dare to do things they didn't dare to before.""

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon paid a rare visit to a quarter of Beirut that is a Hezbollah stronghold on Thursday to attend the memorial service for political researcher and activist Lokman Slim. 
He was shot dead and found in his car last Thursday in south Lebanon - the first killing of a high-profile activist in years.
""This was a barbaric act, unforgivable and unacceptable,"" Dorothy Shea said in a speech at the service, which was held at the Slim family home in Beirut's Dahiya quarter. 
Slim ran a research centre, made documentaries with his wife and led efforts to build an archive on Lebanon's 1975-1990 sectarian civil war. 
He spoke out against what he described as the intimidation tactics of the Iranian-backed, armed Shi'ite Hezbollah group and its attempts to monopolise Lebanese politics. 
Hezbollah has condemned the murder, but Slim's sister has suggested he was murdered because of those views.
On Thursday, his mother, Salma Merchak, quietly cried as she listened to Muslim and Christian prayers for her son at the service, which was also attended by the ambassadors of Germany, Canada, Britain and Switzerland.
In a speech afterwards, she asked Lebanon's young people to foreswear arms and embrace dialogue in his memory.
""I ask you, the young, if you really want a nation to continue with the principles that he fought for and was convinced of,"" Merchak said. 

""Use only your logic and reason. Weapons don't benefit the country. They didn't benefit me - I lost my son.""

More than 11,000 people were detained at protests in recent weeks over the arrest and imprisonment of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, according to non-governmental group OVD-Info, which monitors arrests during mass protests.
Dunja Mijatovic, the Council of Europe's Human Rights Commissioner, said the number of detainees was unprecedented, citing OVD-Info's figures.
In a letter addressed to Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev, dated Feb. 5 and published on Thursday, she expressed dismay over reports of police beatings, including attacks on dozens of journalists.
She said many detainees had complained about the lack of food, drinking water, timely access to sanitary facilities, heating and appropriate sleeping places due to overcrowding, as well as being denied legal or medical assistance. 
""Such a situation, if confirmed, amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment and should stop immediately,"" said Mijatovic.
The Kremlin has denied repression by police and said any cases of alleged police brutality are being looked into but that there have been more cases of riot police officers being attacked by protesters than vice versa.
The interior ministry, which is in charge of the police, did not immediately comment.
Navalny was jailed this month for parole violations. Charges charges he said were trumped up and politically motivated. He was poisoned in Siberia with what many Western countries said was a nerve agent. The Kremlin questions whether he was poisoned.
Mijatovic urged Kolokoltsev to use his authority to stop the practice of apprehending individuals exercising their right to peaceful assembly and bring policing of demonstrations in line with applicable human rights standards. 
The Council of Europe, Europe's main human rights forum, has 47 member states including Russia. All are signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights.

""The specious charges against Kavala, his ongoing detention, and the continuing delays in the conclusion of his trial, including through the merger of cases against him, undermine respect for the rule of law and democracy,"" the U.S. State Department said.
Kavala was acquitted a year ago of charges related to 2013 anti-government protests, but was immediately rearrested on charges relating to a failed 2016 coup. An appeals court subsequently overturned his acquittal on the protest charges. 
A Turkish court ruled on Friday to combine the two outstanding cases and rejected Kavala's request to be released.
Turkey's Foreign Ministry said Washington should respect legal proceedings in the courts.
""Turkey is a state of law. No country or person can give orders to Turkish courts about legal proceedings,"" it said, adding that issuing demands on Turkish courts while refusing to extradite U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who Ankara blames for the failed 2016 coup, was ""inconsistent and unprincipled"".
Kavala was accused by Turkey of collaborating with Henri Barkey, a prominent U.S.-based Turkey scholar, and both men were charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order. 
An indictment alleged that Barkey had links to Gulen's network. Gulen denies involvement and Barkey has said the charges are a ""complete fabrication"".
""We also note with concern U.S. citizen Dr. Henri Barkey's inclusion in these unwarranted court proceedings. We believe the charges against Dr. Barkey to be baseless"", the State Department said on Wednesday.

The State Department urged Turkey to abide by a European Court of Human Rights ruling in late 2019 that Kavala be released.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The president of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics organising committee, Yoshiro Mori, will resign over a sexist remark that sparked an outcry, two sources said on Thursday, while the former prime minister said he could not let the controversy drag on.
Mori's resignation would be bound to raise new doubts over the viability of holding the postponed Games this year.
The sources, who have knowledge of the matter, said Mori would be replaced by former Japan Football Association president and mayor of the Olympic village, Saburo Kawabuchi, 84.
Mori made the sexist remark - that women talk too much - at a Japanese Olympic Committee board meeting early this month, setting off a storm of criticism at home and abroad.
Mori, 83, told Nippon TV he would ""explain his thoughts"" at a meeting on Friday but he had to deal with the issue. He did not confirm the reports that he would step down.
""I cannot let this problem prolong any longer,"" Mori said, and he again apologised for the remark.
A spokesman for the organising committee declined to comment.
Mori first retracted the comment about women at a hastily called news conference on Feb. 4, acknowledging it was inappropriate and against the Olympic spirit.
But he declined, at that time, to resign.
Pressed then on whether he really thought women talked too much, Mori said: ""I don't listen to women that much lately, so I don't know"". 
Mori served as prime minister for a gaffe-plagued year from April 2000. 
((For a profile of Mori, click here https://www.reuters.com/article/olympics-2020-mori-blunders/update-1-tokyo-2020-outgoing-chief-mori-had-a-history-of-blunders-sexist-remarks-idUSL1N2KH09D))
Olympic and ruling party officials told Reuters this week that Mori's resignation could imperil the Games. 
They said his deep network of politicians and Olympic officials was key to pulling off a successful Games.
But his comment on women drew sharp criticism in parliament, where opposition lawmakers demanded his resignation, and from the public on social media.
""Because of Mori's comments, I've recognised again the importance of gender equality and diversity,"" ruling party lawmaker Masazumi Gotoda said on Twitter. 
""Discrimination is absolutely unacceptable.""
Mizuho Fukushima, head of the opposition Social Democratic Party, said on Twitter: ""This is the result of many, many women raising their voices. Of course, this doesn't resolve the problem. We need to create a society of gender equality.""
Mori was due to meet his expected successor, Kawabuchi, on Thursday to discuss the handover, one of the sources said.
VACCINATION DRIVE
The 2020 Tokyo Games were postponed for a year because of the novel coronavirus and the pandemic is still creating huge questions about their viability, even though the government has said it is determined the July 23-Aug 8 Games go ahead.
Even before last year's postponement, ballooning costs and a plagiarism scandal involving the official logo bedevilled preparations.
But the coronavirus has proven to be the biggest threat.
Nearly 80% of the public are opposed to holding the Games this year because of concern about the coronavirus, recent polls show.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said coronavirus vaccines are key to a safe Olympics and he said on Wednesday the vaccination drive would begin in the middle of next week.
Japan's vaccination campaign is later than in most major economies and any delay could sow doubts about a government aim to secure enough doses for everyone before the Olympics. 
If Mori does step down, it would mark the first time an Olympics organising committee president has not seen the job through to a Summer Games since the 2004 Athens Olympics. 

Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki led the successful Athens bid but was pushed aside by the government, which appointed Panagiotis Thomopoulos organising committee president. Angelopoulos-Daskalaki replaced Thomopoulos after the International Olympic Committee warned Greece they could lose the Games because of poor progress with preparations.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and China have agreed to pull back troops from a bitterly contested lake area high in the western Himalayas, the Indian defence minister said on Thursday, in a breakthrough after a months-long standoff on the disputed border.
Rajnath Singh told parliament the accord over Pangong Tso, a glacial lake at 14,000 ft (4,270 metres), had been reached after several rounds of talks between military commanders and diplomats from the nuclear-armed neighbours.
""Our sustained talks with China have led to agreement on disengagement on the north and south banks of the Pangong lake,"" he said.
China's defence ministry said frontline troops from the two countries had begun to pull back from the shores of the lake on Wednesday.
The standoff began in April last year when India said Chinese troops had intruded deep into its side of the Line of Actual Control or the de facto border in the Ladakh area in the western Himalayas. 
China said its troops were operating in its own area and accused Indian border guards of provocative actions. 
In June, 20 Indian soldiers were killed when the two sides clashed with iron rods and stones in the Galwan Valley, the first combat losses on the border in 45 years. China also suffered an unspecified number of casualties. 
Since then the two countries, who fought a war in 1962, had moved thousands of troops, tanks, artillery guns and combat jets close to the border. 
Singh said the Indian government had told Beijing that peace and tranquility had been seriously disturbed by the actions of Chinese troops and bilateral ties had suffered.
""To ensure disengagement in friction points along the LAC, it was our view that troops of both sides, who are now in close proximity, should vacate the forward deployments made in 2020 and return to the permanent and accepted bases,"" he said.
Pangong lake is a finger of water extending from China's Tibet Autonomous Region in India's Ladakh region. 
In August, Indian troops occupied heights on the southern banks of the lake in retaliation against Chinese troops advancing further along the north bank. 
Singh said the two sides had agreed to dismantle defence structures they had built on the two sides of the lake, two-thirds of which China controls. 
Once the disengagement has been completed at the lake, military commanders will meet within 48 hours to discuss pull back from other areas, Singh said. 

India and China have not been able to agree on their 3,500 km (2,200 mile) long border since the war in 1962.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping held their first telephone call as leaders, with Biden saying a free and open Indo-Pacific was a priority and Xi warning confrontation would be a 'disaster' for both nations.
Biden also underscored his ""fundamental concerns about Beijing's coercive and unfair practices, its crackdown in Hong Kong, reported human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including toward Taiwan"", the White House said in a statement.
Xi told Biden that confrontation would be a ""disaster"" and the two sides should re-establish the means to avoid misjudgments, according to the Chinese foreign ministry's account of the call, which took place on Thursday morning in Beijing time but Wednesday evening in the United States.
The Chinese leader maintained a hardline tone regarding Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan, which Xi told Biden were matters of ""sovereignty and territorial integrity"" that he hopes the United States will approach cautiously.
Taiwan's government, which has complained of China's repeated military drills near the Chinese-claimed and democratic island, thanked Biden for expressing his concern.
The telephone call was the first call between Xi and a U.S. president since the Chinese leader spoke with former President Donald Trump in March last year. Since then, relations between the two countries have plunged to their worst level in decades, with Trump blaming China for the COVID-19 pandemic. 
During the Trump administration, the United States launched a series of actions against China, including a trade war, sanctions against Chinese officials and firms perceived to be security threats and challenging Beijing's South China Sea territorial claims.
Xi congratulated Biden on his election in a message in November, even though Biden had called him a ""thug"" during the campaign and vowed to lead an international effort to ""pressure, isolate and punish China.""
Chinese officials have expressed cautious optimism that bilateral relations will improve under Biden and urged Washington to meet Beijing halfway.
The U.S. and Chinese read outs of the call mentioned areas for potential cooperation, with both honing in on climate change and fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
""You have said that America can be defined in one word: Possibilities. We hope the possibilities will now point toward an improvement of China-U.S. relations,"" Xi told Biden, according to China's Foreign Ministry.
NO CHANGE IN U.S.-CHINA POLICY
The Biden administration has made it clear that it will continue to maintain pressure on China, however, although it has also pledged to take a more multilateral approach.
A senior Biden administration official told reporters ahead of the telephone call that Biden would be ""practical, hard-headed, clear-eyed"" in dealings with Xi, but wanted to ensure they had the opportunity to have an open line of communication, despite U.S. concerns about Chinese behavior.
The official said the call came at a time when the United States believed it was in a position of strength, after consultations with allies and partners, to lay out core concerns about China's ""aggressive activities and abuses"". 
The Biden administration will look in coming months at adding ""new targeted restrictions"" on certain sensitive technology exports to China in cooperation with allies and partners, the official said. He also said there would be no quick moves to lift the tariffs the former Trump administration left in place against Chinese imports. 
The call came after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke by phone to top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi on Friday. That was the first announced high-level exchange between top diplomats from the two countries since former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Yang in Hawaii last June.
In his call, Blinken said Washington would stand up for human rights in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong - all issues Yang had days earlier said the United States should stay out of. 

Biden has said Beijing is Washington's ""most serious competitor"", and his administration has indicated it will broadly continue the tough approach taken by Trump.

Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm manager, has ruled Belarus since 1994 but faced an unprecedented wave of street protests since a presidential election last August that the opposition says was blatantly rigged. 
Mass arrests and a severe crackdown on protests prompted a new round of Western sanctions but Lukashenko has held on thanks to diplomatic and financial support from traditional ally Russia, which sees Belarus as a buffer state against NATO. 
Lukashenko says the assembly could discuss draft constitutional reforms and politicians close to the authorities hinted at the possibility of an amnesty for political prisoners. 
The two-day event is expected to trigger new protests, which have simmered for months but reduced in size since August. 
""Lukashenko is gathering loyalists at the so-called All Belarusian People's Assembly to legitimise usurper in the eyes of the people,"" said Franak Viacorka, an advisor to exiled opposition figure Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 
""Because Lukashenko understands that he lost people's support, and he is still clinging on to power by all possible means."" 
Most of the delegates attending the assembly are pro-government local deputies and officials who were elected at special closed sessions. 
A journalist from the local Internet portal TUT.BY, who tried to attend one of these meetings, was detained and spent three days in a pre-trial detention centre.

Biden's government, which took office on Jan. 20, has moved to reassure democratic Taiwan that its commitment to them is ""rock solid"", especially after China stepped up its military activity near the island shortly after Biden's inauguration.
Biden, in his call with Xi, underscored his ""fundamental concerns about Beijing's coercive and unfair practices, its crackdown in Hong Kong, reported human rights abuses in Xinjiang, and increasingly assertive actions in the region, including toward Taiwan"", according to the White House. 
Taiwan's Presidential Office thanked Biden for the comments.

""As a member of the international community, Taiwan will continue to work closely with like-minded countries, including the United States, to jointly contribute to the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region.""
China regularly describes Taiwan as the most important and sensitive issue in it relationship with the United States, and was infuriated by stepped-up contacts between the two and increased arms sales under former President Donald Trump's administration.
Xi maintained a hardline tone regarding Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan, which Xi told Biden were matters of ""sovereignty and territorial integrity"" that he hopes the United States will approach cautiously.
Taiwan has been heartened by the renewed pledges of support from Biden's team.
On Wednesday, Taiwan and the United States held their first publicly acknowledged formal meeting in Washington under the new administration.
Taiwan's defacto ambassador to the United States, Hsiao Bi-khim, met Sung Kim, acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.

DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - A British man jailed for his role in the death of an Indonesian policeman in 2016 on a beach in Bali was released on Thursday after serving his sentence.
David Taylor, 38, was jailed in March 2017 together with his Australian girlfriend, Sara Connor, over the death of traffic policeman Wayan Sudarsa, whose body was found on the island's popular Kuta beach with neck and head wounds.
Taylor left Bali's Kerobokan jail dressed in a black T-shirt and with dark glasses and a mask.
He did not comment to reporters before getting into a waiting car, but the head of the prison, Fikri Jaya Soebing confirmed his release.
Fikri said he had been granted 18 months and 15 days of remission.
Taylor is now expected to be taken to the airport and deported to Britain.
Taylor and Connor were tried separately and had told the court a fight had broken out with the policeman over Connor's missing purse.
They were charged with assault leading to death and Taylor was sentenced to six years in prison and Connor to four years.
Connor was granted an early release last year due to good behaviour.

Taylor's lawyer said after his sentencing his client accepted the ruling.

TAPOVAN, India (Reuters) - Indian authorities on Thursday began drilling inside a tunnel in the Himalayas in an attempt to rescue more than 35 workers trapped there after a flash flood that destroyed dams and bridges.
About 171 people remain unaccounted for since Sunday's disaster in Uttarakhand state, most of them workers at the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project and at the smaller Rishiganga dam, which was swept away by the torrent. 
So far, the bodies of 33 people have been found, the state police chief's office said. 
While scores are thought to have been washed away as rock and debris surged down the Dhauliganga River, rescue efforts have been focused on saving an estimated 35 workers stuck in a 2.5 km tunnel connected to the Tapovan project. 
But the slush and water has been so heavy that soldiers have made only halting progress in four days. 
After clearing more than 100 metres of mud, rocks and debris, relief workers on Thursday sent water tankers and generators deep into the tunnel to assist in drilling. 
The men are trying to search for signs of life in smaller tunnels and rooms branching off from the main passage, officials said.
Relatives continued to arrive at the site, but five days after the disaster, there was frustration at the lack of progress. 
""They are not telling us anything,"" said Praveen Saini, whose nephew, Ajay Kumar Saini, is trapped in the tunnel.
Another was holding onto hope that his brother had survived after he was able to ring his mobile.
""If his phone survived, maybe he survived,"" Jugal Kishore said.
Originally thought to be a glacier breaking apart in the country's second highest, Nanda Devi mountain, and crashing into the river, some scientists now say the flood was more likely to have been caused by an avalanche.

""It appears that the event was caused by a very large rockfall from high up the mountainside which picked up lots of snow and ice on the way down and melted these because of the frictional heat created by the rock fall,"" said Stephan Harrison, professor of Climate and Environmental Change at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom.

""The State of Qatar is working on de-escalation through a political and diplomatic process to return to the nuclear agreement,"" Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani said on Wednesday, according to state news agency QNA. 
The remarks came in briefing notes about two separate calls earlier in the week between Thani and U.S. Special Representative for Iran Robert Malley and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. 
U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is exploring ways to restore the nuclear deal that Iran signed with world powers but abandoned in 2018 by former President Donald Trump, who restored sanctions.
Thani said Qatar's communication was going on with both Iran and the United States, given the strategic ties Qatar holds with both.
A breakthrough was reached last month to resolve a three-year dispute between Gulf Arab states and Qatar. 

The pact was one in a series of Middle East deals sought by the Donald Trump administration - the others involving Israel and Arab states - aimed at building a united front against Iran.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines defence apparatus wants to keep a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the United States, its defence minister said on Thursday, as officials met to settle differences over a pact central to Washington's Asia strategy. 
Thursday's meeting in Manila between U.S. and Philippine officials comes after President Rodrigo Duterte, who openly disapproves of the U.S. alliance, unilaterally cancelled the two-decade-old VFA last year, in an angry response to an ally being denied a visa.
The withdrawal period has been twice extended, however, to create what Philippine officials say is a window for better terms to be agreed. 
""We at the defence department and the armed forces, the general feeling is for the VFA to continue,"" Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told news channel ANC. 
The meeting is the first under U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, which has reaffirmed the alliance in the face of China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea.
Lorenzana said the VFA, which sets out rules for U.S. soldiers operating in the Philippines, has been vital in boosting the capabilities of under-resourced Philippine forces through dozens of annual joint training exercises.
Its importance was stressed by U.S. counterpart Lloyd Austin during a call with Lorenzana on Wednesday.
Ties between the United States and its former colony have been complicated by Duterte's rise to power in 2016 and his frequent statements condemning U.S. foreign policy, and open embrace of China. 
But while the Philippines-U.S. relationship ""has always been strong"", Lorenzana said the Southeast Asian nation ""should not be made to choose"" between Washington and Beijing. 
Lorenzana has also expressed concern about a new Chinese law empowering coastguard to fire on what it sees as threats, and repeated U.S. navy patrols that China sees as provocations. 

""I told Secretary Austin we don't want any miscalculations or accidents in the South China Sea because we are right smack there in the centre of conflict,"" Lorenzana said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - No matter who you are, it is a safe bet that this past year has been challenging and traumatic.
Now imagine that you faced a pandemic while in charge of a New York City hospital that is one of the largest in the nation. 
Dr Steven Corwin, president and CEO of NewYork-Presbyterian, has helped steer a network of 10 hospital campuses through the biggest public health crisis in generations.
Corwin spoke to Reuters about the lessons learned from this period of tragedy, loss – and ultimately, hope.
Q: Years ago, could you have ever foreseen what has happened to this country over the last year?
A: Part of the issue for us as a country, let alone hospital systems, was a failure of imagination. There were some warning signs like swine flu and Ebola, but pandemic preparedness was not the highest item on everyone’s list. It obviously should have been much higher.
Q: How has your system been able to handle COVID-19?
A: We started to bear the brunt of it in March and April into early May, when things were really horrific. We were stretched to the absolute maximum. 
We normally operate 450 ICU beds; we had to expand to 900. We normally use 4,000 surgical masks a day; we were using 100,000. 
It was overwhelming, and thankfully we got through it, but unfortunately in recent months the virus has been accelerating all over the country.
Q: COVID-19 has forced so many companies and industries to rethink the way they do things – is the same true for hospitals?
A: Our antennae are up, in terms of thinking about pandemics and what the next one could be. We have much more expertise in our hospital system now, and we use outside experts to help identify threats. 
We have also changed our business model, from just-in-time to just-in-case. We need reserves and flexibility, not just in physical spaces but in equipment, training and how we deploy staff.
We have also learned that the system as a whole is more resilient than a single hospital. Everything is so interconnected and interdependent, that if one hospital is getting overwhelmed, a crisis is less likely if other parts of the system are helping out.
Q: How has COVID-19 helped reveal a lot of systemic inequities in our society?
A: This crisis has been a real eye-opener. Coupled with everything happening around the country, such as with the George Floyd protests, we felt we needed to double down on our commitments. We want to eliminate any disparities – for instance for Black maternal mortality, for cancer outcomes, and for children undergoing surgery.
Disparities in mortality for people of color spurred us to make sure we have an ongoing and significant effort in health equity, through our Center for Health Justice. 
Q: Is telehealth revolutionizing how you do business?
A: Before, 3% of hospital visits were done by telehealth. During the pandemic, it was over 50%. Now it has settled at around 25% of visits, but I think telehealth is here to stay. It’s not a fad.
Q: With so much suffering going on, how do you make sure your own workers are OK?
A: They’re not. It’s heartbreaking, to be honest. March 1 will be 12 months of this. People are tired, and there’s a cumulative trauma effect. 
Mortality may be less now, but they are still seeing a lot of people die. It has affected everybody, but some more than others, like the frontline workers. They did the impossible in the spring, and they feel like they’re reliving it again right now.
There is nothing more troubling to a care provider than to be the person holding an iPhone next to someone who is passing away. It’s extremely traumatic and incredibly humbling. We talk to doctors and nurses about it, and they remember that moment. It haunts their dreams.
Q: With so many vaccine options coming online, are you hopeful?
A: It’s a tremendous scientific achievement to get vaccines out that quickly, and there is light at the end of the tunnel. But everyone needs to understand this is a global pandemic, and vaccines have to be distributed worldwide – because the more the virus circulates, the more likely there could be mutations. I think it will take a few more months to really get this under control. 

We have the first-team offense on the field now. They are digging in, and good things are starting to happen.

Speaker Trevor Mallard prevented Rawiri Waititi from asking questions in the debating chamber on Tuesday and eventually ordered him to leave for not wearing a tie.
Waititi, 40, was wearing a taonga, a Maori greenstone pendant instead, which he said was a Maori business attire.
The incident sparked a debate about why a necktie was mandatory with Waititi describing the piece of clothing as a 'colonial noose', and said forcing him to wear it was a breach of his rights and an attempt to suppress indigenous culture.
After a meeting with the Standing Orders Committee, Speaker Mallard said late on Wednesday that he had decided to make ties optional in the House.
""As Speaker, I am guided by the committee’s discussion and decision, and therefore ties will no longer be considered required as part of ‘appropriate business attire’,"" Mallard said. 
""I acknowledge those who felt this was an important issue worthy of further consideration,"" he said.

Waititi and a handful of other MPs were spotted without a tie in parliament on Thursday, media reports said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will turn away most migrants apprehended at its border with Mexico under a Trump-era policy aimed at limiting the spread of the coronavirus and to give the Biden administration time to implement ""humane"" asylum processing systems, a White House official said on Wednesday.
The comments followed reports of the release of some migrant families into the United States and increasing pressure on President Joe Biden to reverse the restrictive policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told a news briefing that because of the pandemic ""and the fact that we have not had the time as an administration to put in place a humane, comprehensive process for processing individuals who are coming to the border, now is not the time to come."" 
""The vast majority of people will be turned away,"" she added.
U.S. officials in Texas last week released hundreds of Central American migrant families from custody amid concerns of overcrowding in Border Patrol facilities after local authorities in Mexico balked at taking them back.
Biden, who took office last month, has left in place a Trump-era COVID order called Title 42 that allows U.S. authorities to rapidly expel to Mexico migrants caught crossing the border illegally.
Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, which filed a new lawsuit over the policy on Monday, said it was using a ""guise"" of public health to undermine legal protections for asylum seekers.
""Our fight for these families continues, until and unless the Biden administration ends this cruel practice once and for all,"" Rose said in a statement.
U.S. officials in January encountered nearly 78,000 migrants attempting to cross the southern border illegally or who were denied at ports of entry, a 6 percent increase over the previous month.
The Biden administration also faces pressure from congressional Democrats over the deportation practices.
Hispanic and Black lawmakers in recent days sent a pair of letters to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calling on him to adhere to new enforcement priorities outlined in a Jan. 20 memo that are much more targeted than Trump's broad immigration crackdown.

The memo called for immigration officers to prioritize national security threats, people who arrived in the United States on or after Nov. 1, 2020, and people with certain criminal convictions who are determined to be a public safety threat.

565,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 08:06PM ET</span>","Biden approves order for sanctions on Myanmar generals, businesses","(Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he had approved an executive order for new sanctions on those responsible for the military coup in Myanmar and he repeated demands for the generals to give up power and free civilian leaders.
Biden said the order enabled his administration ""to immediately sanction the military leaders who directed the coup, their business interests as well as close family members.""
Washington would identify the first round of targets this week and was taking steps to prevent the generals in Myanmar, also known as Burma, having access to $1 billion in Myanmar government funds held in the United States.
""We're also going to impose strong exports controls. We're freezing U.S. assets that benefit the Burmese government, while maintaining our support for health care, civil society groups, and other areas that benefit the people of Burma directly,"" Biden said at the White House. 
""We'll be ready to impose additional measures, and we'll continue to work with our international partners to urge other nations to join us in these efforts.""
The Feb. 1 coup and detention of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi presents Biden him with his first major international crisis, and a test of his dual pledges to re-center human rights in foreign policy and work more closely with allies.
""I again call on the Burmese military to immediately release the democratic political leaders and activists,"" he said. ""The military must relinquish power it's seized.""
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said Washington was rolling out collective actions with partners on Myanmar.""We can impose substantial costs ourselves. We can impose costs that are even steeper ... by working with our like-minded partners and allies,"" he told a briefing.
ASIAN INFLUENCE
Western countries have condemned the coup, but analysts say Myanmar's new junta will not be as isolated as previous iterations, with China, India, Southeast Asian neighbors and Japan unlikely to cut ties given the country's strategic importance.
Derek Mitchell, a former U.S. ambassador to Myanmar, said it was vital to get nations such as Japan, India and Singapore involved in a strong response.
""The key will not be just what America does,"" he said. ""It’s going to be how we get others along with us, allies who may have more skin in the game, more leverage, or at least better relationships with the key players.""
The United Nations' top human rights body is to consider a resolution on Friday drafted by Britain and the European Union condemning the coup and demanding urgent access for monitors.
However, diplomats said China and Russia - which both have ties to Myanmar's armed forces - are expected to raise objections or try to weaken the text. The UN Security Council released a statement last week calling for Suu Kyi's release but stopping short of condemning the coup.
FESTIVE PROTESTS
Protesters returned to the streets of Myanmar on Wednesday despite the shooting of a young woman the previous day.
There were no reports of violence on Wednesday, and in many places protests took on a festive air, with bare-chested body builders, women in ball gowns and wedding dresses, farmers on tractors and people with their pets.
Thousands joined demonstrations in the main city of Yangon, while in the capital, Naypyitaw, hundreds of government workers marched in support of a growing civil disobedience campaign.
The protests have been the largest in Myanmar in more than a decade, reviving memories of almost half a century of direct army rule, punctuated with bloody army crackdowns, until the military began relinquishing some power in 2011.
The military justified its takeover saying a Nov. 8 election, which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide, was a fraud. The electoral commission dismissed the army's complaints.
While Biden did not specify who would be hit with new sanctions, Washington is likely to target coup leader Min Aung Hlaing and other top generals who are already under U.S. sanctions imposed in 2019 over abuses against Rohingya Muslims and other minorities.
It could also target Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited and Myanmar Economic Corp, military holding companies with investments spanning sectors including banking, gems, copper, telecoms and clothing. 
Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, spoke on Wednesday with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has a longstanding interest in the country and a close relationship with Suu Kyi, a McConnell aide said.
Suu Kyi, 75, won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize for campaigning for democracy and remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of the Rohingyas.

She has spent nearly 15 years under house arrest and now faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkies. Her lawyer says he has not been allowed to see her.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called on his ruling Workers' Party to take a more direct role in his new five-year economic plan and blamed the party for past failures in implementing reform, state media reported on Thursday.
The remarks come on the third day of the party's plenary meeting, where Kim had also laid out party plans for South Korea relations and external affairs, as well as plans for each economic sector.
In January, Kim openly admitted that his previous five-year economic plan had failed to meet its goals in almost every sector.
Kim this week stressed the importance of strengthening legal supervision and control over the next five-year plan, which was unveiled at a congress in January, state media KCNA said.
""It called upon the legislation sector to remove irrational elements becoming stumbling blocks to the implementation of the national economic plan and enact and perfect new laws for every sector,"" KCNA reported.
Kim blamed the party for failing to fulfil its responsibilities and role as ""organisers and standard-bearers"" in carrying out previous economic policies.

""Legislative bodies including the prosecution organ should increase their role to make sure the national economic plan is properly distributed and correctly executed,"" Kim told the party on Wednesday in a statement carried by KCNA.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian police on Wednesday clashed with rock-hurling protesters in the capital Port-Au-Prince amid street demonstrations against President Jovenel Moise after his government retired three Supreme Court judges earmarked as his potential replacements. 
Police fired teargas and shot in the air in an attempt to disperse pockets of protesters, who pelted the security officials with rocks, according to a Reuters witness. 
""We are back to dictatorship! Down with Moise!"" the protesters shouted as music blared from speakers amid chaotic scenes in the poor Caribbean nation of about 11 million people.
The protesters also yelled ""Down with Sison,"" a reference to the U.S. Ambassador to Haiti, Michele Jeanne Sison. Washington has so far backed Moise's claim that he should step down in February 2022 after presidential elections are held this year.
The latest political tumult in the volatile island nation comes amid a crippling economic crisis and a sharp rise in crime, especially kidnappings for ransom.
The opposition is demanding Moise leaves power immediately, accusing him of acting like an authoritarian leader and violating the constitution.
Tensions intensified over the weekend after Moise alleged there was an attempt to overthrow his government. Authorities on Sunday arrested 23 people, including a Supreme Court judge and a senior police official.
On Monday, the government issued an executive decree retiring the arrested judge and two other Supreme Court justices.
All three had been approached by the opposition as possible interim leaders to replace Moise and head a transitional government. In the end, the opposition chose magistrate Joseph Mecene Jean Louis, 72.
The opposition says Moise should have stepped down on Feb. 7, when they say his five-year term in office expired, following disputed 2015 elections.
Moise rejects that, citing a term that began in February 2017 after he won fresh elections in 2016. He has pledged to step down in February next year.
A group of journalists on Wednesday also complained to security officials about heavy-handed policing. 
Two journalists covering the protests received minor injuries when the police dropped a tear gas canister into a pickup truck, labeled as media, which was transporting journalists, according to reporters and television footage.

Police could not immediately be reached for comment.

""Presidents Hariri and Macron discussed the internal Lebanese difficulties that hinder the formation of the government and the possible ways to overcome them,"" the Twitter post said, adding that the two men had discussed French efforts to resolve the crisis over a two-hour dinner.
Macron has been spearheading international efforts to rescue the former French protectorate from its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. Macron is trying to use Paris' historical influence in Lebanon to persuade squabbling politicians to adopt a roadmap and form a new government to root out corruption, a prerequisite for international donors including the IMF to unlock billions of dollars in aid.
However, those efforts have so far failed.
Highlighting some of that frustration, the French presidency did not include the dinner on Macron's public agenda keeping the meeting private. Officials had declined to comment earlier in the day on whether the two men would even meet.
Hariri, a former prime minister, was given the task of forming a government after Mustapha Adib resigned in September. He is so far struggling to cobble together a cabinet to share power with all Lebanese parties, including Iran-aligned Hezbollah.

Paris was not initially keen for Hariri to take up the role, having previously failed to implement reforms, French officials have said. But given the lack of progress in forming a credible government, Macron did not oppose the nomination.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Iranian nuclear scientist assassinated near Tehran in November was killed by a one-ton gun smuggled into Iran in pieces by the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, according to a report by The Jewish Chronicle on Wednesday.
Citing intelligence sources, the British weekly said a team of more than 20 agents, including Israeli and Iranian nationals, carried out the ambush on scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh after eight months of surveillance.
Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report, which was published on the website of the London-based newspaper.
Iranian media said Fakhrizadeh died in hospital after armed assassins gunned him down in his car. Shortly after his death Iran pointed the finger at Israel, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif writing on Twitter of “serious indications of (an) Israeli role.""
Israel declined to comment in November and on Wednesday night an Israeli government spokesman responded to the latest report by saying: “We never comment on such matters. There has been no change in our position.”
Fakhrizadeh, 59, was long suspected by the West of masterminding a secret nuclear bomb programme.
He had been described by Western and Israeli intelligence services for years as the mysterious leader of a covert atomic bomb programme halted in 2003, which Israel and the United States accuse Tehran of trying to restore. Iran has long denied seeking to weaponise nuclear energy.
According to the Jewish Chronicle’s report, Iran has “secretly assessed that it will take six years” before a replacement for him is “fully operational” and that his death had “extended the period of time it would take Iran to achieve a bomb from about three-and-a-half months to two years.”
Giving no further details of its sourcing, the world's oldest Jewish newspaper said the Mossad mounted the automated gun on a Nissan (OTC:NSANY) pickup and that “the bespoke weapon, operated remotely by agents on the ground as they observed the target, was so heavy because it included a bomb that destroyed the evidence after the killing.”

It said the attack was carried out “by Israel alone, without American involvement” but that U.S. officials were given some form of notice beforehand.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Prominent women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was released from a Saudi prison after nearly three years behind bars, her family said on Wednesday, a case that has drawn international condemnation.
Hathloul, 31, was detained in May 2018 and sentenced in December to nearly six years in prison on charges that U.N. rights experts called ""spurious"" under broad counter-terrorism laws. The court suspended two years and 10 months of her sentence, most of which had already been served.
She still faces a five-year travel ban ordered by the court.
""Loujain is at home !!!!!!"" her sister Lina tweeted. 
Another sister, Alia, said Hathloul was at their parents' home in Saudi Arabia. She posted a picture of Hathloul smiling in a garden, looking much thinner and with grey streaks in her hair.
Rights groups and her family say Hathloul, who had campaigned for women's right to drive and to end Saudi's male guardianship system, was subjected to abuse, including electric shocks, waterboarding, flogging and sexual assault. 
Saudi authorities denied the accusations. A Saudi appeals court dismissed the torture claims, citing a lack of evidence, her family said on Tuesday.
Amnesty International on Wednesday urged Riyadh to bring to justice ""those responsible for her torture"" and ensure Hathloul faces no further punitive measures like a travel ban.
Saudi officials have not commented on her conviction or sentencing. There was no immediate comment on her release.
The White House has said President Joe Biden, who is taking a firmer line with Saudi Arabia than predecessor Donald Trump, expects Riyadh to improve its human rights record, including releasing political prisoners.
""Releasing her was the right thing to do,"" Biden said of Hathloul.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed her release, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. 
""But I think it is important that others who are in the same condition as her, who have been jailed for the same reasons as her, also be released and that charges be dropped against them,"" he told reporters. 
Hathloul, detained along with several other women's rights activists, was convicted on charges including seeking to change the Saudi political system and harming national unity.
Saudi Arabia's rights record came under global scrutiny after the 2018 murder of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, which tarnished Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's image. The prince denied ordering the killing.
Agnes Callamard, the independent U.N. rights investigator who led an international probe into Khashoggi's murder, welcomed Hathloul's release but said in a Twitter post that ""the cruelty"" of Saudi rulers that ""violated her most basic right to physical and mental integrity"" should not be forgotten. 
Diplomats have said the kingdom has appeared to be acting to address potential friction with the Biden administration.
Saudi authorities released two activists with U.S. citizenship on bail this month pending trials on terrorism-related charges. Last month, a Saudi appeals court nearly halved a six-year jail sentence for a U.S.-Saudi physician and suspended the rest, meaning he did not have to return to jail.
Hathloul's family published her indictment after her case was transferred to a Specialised Criminal Court, established to try terrorism suspects but used in the past decade to prosecute perceived dissidents. Authorities made few charges public.

The main ones against Hathloul included calling for an end to male guardianship and communicating with global rights groups, Saudi activists in the kingdom and abroad, and foreign diplomats and international media.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to speak with his Turkish counterpart, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, in the coming days, a State Department spokesman said on Wednesday while reiterating that American policy opposing Turkey's Russian S-400 missiles remains unchanged.
""I would expect the secretary and his Turkish counterpart will have an opportunity to chat, to connect in the coming days, State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.
Asked whether the United States is considering Turkey's recent suggestion that it may not need to make the Russian S-400 missile defense systems operational all the time, Price said Washington's policy remained unchanged.
""Russian S-400s are incompatible with NATO equipment, they threaten the security of NATO technology, and they're inconsistent with Turkey's commitments as a NATO ally,"" Price said.
Turkey's defense minister, Hulusi Akar, was cited on Tuesday as saying that Turkey would propose only partially activating its S-400s in negotiations with the United States, which sanctioned Ankara over the air defense systems in December.
Price did not say whether Washington would consider the proposal, reiterating that the U.S. policy remains the same and that Washington continues to urge Turkey not to retain the S-400 system.
""Turkey is a long-standing and valued NATO ally. ... We seek cooperation on common priorities, and as with any ally, we engage in dialogue to address disagreements,"" Price said.
Washington sanctioned Ankara for acquiring the S-400s on grounds they threaten its advanced F-35 fighter jets and are incompatible with shared NATO defenses, something that Turkey rejects. Turkey says the systems will stand independently from NATO defenses.

Since Democrat Joe Biden was elected U.S. president, Ankara has said it wants better ties and again proposed an S-400 joint working group. Washington has repeatedly rejected that and says sanctions will remain until Turkey no longer possesses the missiles.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has carried out its plan to produce uranium metal, the U.N. atomic watchdog confirmed on Wednesday, despite Western powers having warned Iran that would breach their 2015 nuclear deal as uranium metal can be used to make the core of an atom bomb.
Iran began breaching its nuclear deal with major powers step by step in 2019 in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the deal the previous year and Washington's reimposition of sanctions on Tehran. 
Iran has in recent months accelerated those breaches of the deal's restrictions on its atomic activities, potentially complicating efforts to bring the United States back into the deal under President Joe Biden.
A law passed in response to the killing of its top nuclear scientist in November, which Tehran blames on its foe Israel, called for steps including opening a uranium metal plant. Iran told the International Atomic Energy Agency in December it planned to produce uranium metal fuel for a research reactor.
""Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi today informed IAEA Member States about recent developments regarding Iran's R&D activities on uranium metal production as part of its stated aim to produce fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor,"" the IAEA said in a statement.
Wednesday's report, seen by Reuters, and a previous one said that Iran planned to carry out research on uranium metal using natural uranium before moving on to uranium metal enriched to 20%, the level it is enriching uranium to now, short of the 90% that is weapons grade.
""The Agency on 8 February verified 3.6 gram of uranium metal at Iran's Fuel Plate Fabrication Plant (FPFP) in Esfahan,"" the IAEA statement added.
France, Britain and Germany, all parties to the deal, last month said they were ""deeply concerned"" and that Iran's uranium metal production had no civilian credibility but potentially serious military implications.
The 2015 deal's central aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb to at least a year from roughly 2-3 months. Iran, however, denies ever pursuing nuclear weapons and says it only wants to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. 

U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations' top human rights body is to consider a resolution on Friday drafted by Britain and the European Union that would condemn Myanmar's military coup and demand urgent access for monitors, a text seen by Reuters shows.
However, diplomats said Human Rights Council members China and Russia - who both have ties to Myanmar's armed forces - are expected to raise objections or try to weaken the text.
Procedural wrangling began on Monday, with Beijing and Moscow raising objections over virtual voting as officials met to plan both the council's four-week session from Feb. 22 and Friday's special session on Myanmar.
The U.N. Security Council last week called for the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others detained by the military but stopped short of condemning the coup.
Protesters took to the streets for a fifth day on Wednesday, vowing to keep up demonstrations against the coup even after a woman was shot and critically wounded.
""It's only a matter of time until there is a big-scale confrontation,"" a U.N. official told Reuters of the protests.
The request by Britain and the EU received formal support from 19 members, including Myanmar's fellow Asian nations Japan and South Korea, at the 47-member forum. 
""We have to keep up the pressure,"" a European diplomat said.
The United States, which backed convening Friday's session, is imposing new sanctions on those behind the coup and any linked entities.
The draft resolution condemns the ousting of the civilian government and calls for its restoration and the unconditional release of those ""arbitrarily detained"". It urges the military to refrain from using violence against peaceful protesters, while ensuring freedom of expression and an open internet.
Thomas Andrews, the U.N. investigator on human rights in Myanmar, should be granted urgent, unrestricted access, it says.

Andrews, in a statement on Wednesday, said security forces and police have a duty to refrain from using excessive force against peaceful demonstrators and that ""following orders is no defence for committing atrocities"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday that he has assured his Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau that India would do its best to supply Canada with vaccines to fight the pandemic, potentially easing shortages faced in the country.
""Was happy to receive a call from my friend @JustinTrudeau. Assured him that India would do its best to facilitate supplies of COVID vaccines sought by Canada,"" Modi said in a tweet.
Modi's assurance comes while Canada has been struggling to quickly secure doses of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's vaccines against COVID-19.
Last week, Trudeau said Canada would succeed in inoculating its population despite ""momentary disruptions"" in vaccine supply. He promised tens of millions of doses would arrive in the months to come and reiterated that every Canadian seeking a shot would be vaccinated by September.
Modi's tweet comes after a Canadian opposition member last week quizzed Canada's Procurement Minister Anita Anand about whether Trudeau had called on Modi for help with supplies. 
Canada does not yet have a vaccine manufacturing facility of its own and is reliant on foreign suppliers. 
India, which boasts several vaccine manufacturing facilities in contrast, is fast emerging as a key supplier of shots to the world. And several western pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc,  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), among others have all tied up with Indian drug manufacturers to produce their vaccines for sales domestically and overseas. 
Canada has also said deliveries of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine may begin before March end, if Canada's health regulator approves its use.
Last week, Reuters reported that Verity Pharmaceuticals and Serum Institute of India (SII) - the world's largest vaccine maker, have applied to distribute SII's licensed version of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine in Canada.

Canada has recorded over 20,000 deaths and more than 810,000 cases of COVID-19 and many provinces have reimposed restrictions to combat a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition plans to convert anger over Alexei Navalny's arrest and jailing into parliamentary seats at the ruling pro-Kremlin party's expense later this year have suffered a setback after an acrimonious outbreak of infighting.
The row began on Saturday when the veteran founder of Yabloko, a storied anti-Kremlin party, urged people to turn their back on Navalny, who has emerged as the most high-profile opposition politician after his arrest and jailing sparked nationwide protests. 
""Everyone must decide whether to support Navalny or not,"" Grigory Yavlinsky wrote in an article, which accused Navalny of being a xenophobic and authoritarian nationalist, something the 44-year-old has denied in the past. 
""But you need to understand. A democratic Russia, respect for people, and a life without fear and repression are incompatible with Navalny's policies.""
The intervention came ahead of parliamentary elections in September where Navalny's allies plan to encourage people to vote tactically. It has caused upheaval in Yabloko and drawn fierce condemnation from Navalny's allies, some of whom have urged Yabloko to expel Yavlinsky. 
The ensuing acrimony, which has seen many people insult Yavlinsky on social media and some side with him, raises questions about whether the opposition will unite or, as in the past, mount separate challenges and squabble. 
The authorities have allowed Yabloko to run in the past, although it long since failed to win enough votes to gain seats in parliament. Meanwhile, applications by Navalny's allies to register a party have repeatedly been rejected.
Some Yabloko members criticised Yavlinsky, saying he risked driving voters away at a time when people were looking for an outlet after the protests.
""Either our party can represent these people or we'll be left without voters - the only oxygen for political parties,"" Lev Shlosberg, a prominent Yabloko politician, wrote in a riposte. 
Yevgeny Roizman, the former anti-Kremlin mayor of the city of Yekaterinburg, said he could no longer run for parliament on a Yabloko ticket. 
Others said it was wrong to criticise Navalny who they said was a genuine political prisoner and unable to respond.
The row shines a light on longstanding concerns among some Kremlin opponents about Navalny's suitability to lead the opposition due to what they regard as his unacceptable views.
Yabloko expelled him in 2007 over ""nationalist activities."" 
Navalny, who used to march with extreme nationalists and has used language about non-Russians which some critics have found offensive, said at the time that the real reason he was shown the door was his own desire to get rid of Yavlinsky. 
Jailed this month for nearly three years in relation to an embezzlement case he says was trumped up, Navalny has dismissed similar criticism in the past as being motivated by personality differences and political manoeuvring. 
Nikolay Rybakov, Yabloko's party leader, offered support to Yavlinsky in an interview with TV Rain.
""Yavlinsky did a very unusual thing in Russian politics. He spoke honestly to many people about what people are talking about in their kitchens but are afraid to say on social networks because they're afraid they'll be criticised,"" he said.
Navalny's jailing, following his return to Russia from Germany last month after being poisoned in Siberia with what many Western countries say was a nerve agent, prompted tens of thousands of people to take to the streets in protest.
His allies have called for people to gather briefly in their courtyards this Sunday and say they will call for more protests, something the Kremlin regards as illegal, in the spring. They have also called for more investigations into corruption, along the lines of hugely popular videos that Navalny has produced.

Yavlinsky said protests and investigations were not the answer. Kremlin opponents should use more conventional methods to try to win seats in parliament, he said.

TAPOVAN, India (Reuters) - When Tarun Dev first saw reports of flooding in India's Himalayas, he felt afraid.
His brother, Jugal Kishore, a 35-year-old electrical engineer, was one of 70 workers at the Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project when a flash flood on Sunday destroyed two power stations and left more than 200 people missing. 
The family immediately set off from their home in Punjab.
""Since Monday, we have been at this spot,"" he said, treading gingerly on the warped floorboards of what used to be the staff guesthouse, weakened from a thick coating of mud. 
""I called his phone, it was ringing until this morning,"" he said. ""If his phone survived, maybe he survived.""
Relief workers stood by a crater holding body bags, but Dev said he refused to give up hope. 
""Until we get the body, we are staying.""
Hundreds of police, military and specialists ranging from engineers to drone pilots are working at the site of the disaster, the cause of which is not yet certain. 
Originally thought to be a glacier breaking apart and crashing into the river, some scientists now say it was more likely to have been due to an avalanche.
Four days into the rescue efforts, chances of survival are receding, those involved in the operation say. 
Many of the missing men are migrant labourers, supporting entire families back home. Other are locals lured by one of the few sources of stable income in the region. 
Sati Negi's brother, 30-year-old Patminder Bisht, is one of 30 workers trapped hundreds of metres into a service tunnel at the larger Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project downstream. She and her sister, Deepa Chauhan, have spent the week waiting at the mouth of the tunnel for rescuers to show them photos and videos after emerging. 
""He is a good husband and father,"" she said, as excavators hauled mud from the shaft. ""He has two daughters and one of them is a heart patient. What will they do if he doesn't come back?""
At Rishganga, the low-lying staff quarters meant many there stood little chance of reaching safety. 
Kamal Chauhan, the 38-year-old project head of the site, was walking to breakfast on Sunday morning when he heard villagers shouting on a nearby hill. 
Looking up, he saw a cloud of mud and dust roaring down the valley. 
And so he ran, calling on his men to follow him to higher ground as it grew rapidly closer, destroying everything in its path. 
Only a few of them did in time, he said.
He stayed behind to help show police where to look for bodies. But his thoughts are elsewhere. 

""I can't explain how I'm feeling,"" he said. ""My mind doesn't know what to think.""

Moore struck a chord with locked-down Britain and people around the world by walking around his garden with the help of a frame to raise tens of millions of pounds for the National Health Service workers.
""He was an amazing man with the biggest heart,"" said his daughter Hannah in a statement. ""We hope that the world will continue to spread the hope joy and love that my father felt, and that we can make tomorrow, a good day for each other.""
The family, she said, missed his humour and his chuckle.
""He was our world. Not hearing his chuckle in the house, catching the mischievous twinkle in his eye, hearing the shuffle in the corridor of his now famous walking frame,"" she said. 
""We are already missing his routines, like surreptitiously feeding the dogs porridge out of his bowl or sitting in the kitchen every day to have lunch and asking us how our day is going.""
His endeavour and wit spread joy amid the grim news of the coronavirus outbreak: Moore's message to the world was that the sun would shine again and that the clouds would clear.
Moore died on Feb. 2 at Bedford Hospital in central England. He had tested positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 22 and was fighting pneumonia. 

""He inspired hope in so many and captured the heart of the nation, and the world, during its time of need. He held a place in so many people's hearts and because of that we understand that we aren't grieving alone,"" his daughter said.

TAPOVAN, India (Reuters) - Rescuers in northern India made a vain attempt on Wednesday to find signs of life using a drone to search for 35 construction workers missing inside a tunnel days after a flash flood swept down a mountain valley destroying dams and bridges. 
Some 204 people remain unaccounted for since Sunday's disaster in Uttarakhand state, most of them workers at the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project and at the smaller Rishiganga dam, which was swept away by the torrent.
At the Tapovan tunnel's entrance, anxious relatives lingered in heavy rain, desperate for word on whether anyone had been found. 
""We don't know what else to do,"" said Deepa Chauhan the sister of 30-year-old Patminder Bisht, a supervisor among the workers at the site.
A drone with five cameras was sent inside a short stretch of the tunnel for a second day on Wednesday, but found no-one, either alive or dead, an official said. 
So far, police say, 32 bodies have been retrieved from the Himalayan mountainsides or pulled out of the Dhauliganga river further downstream.
As the hours passed in the winter cold, there was a mounting risk hypothermia could kill anyone in the tunnel who had survived, said Vivek Pandey, a spokesman for the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, a paramilitary force involved in the rescue effort.
Excavators had cleared more than 80 metres of mud blocking the tunnel entrance, but still have at least another 80 metres to go to reach where most of the workers were believed to be trapped, officials at the site said.
Giant boulders were blocking progress.
""Sediment and water has entered the tunnel and we are unable to clear it,"" a government official monitoring the situation from New Delhi told Reuters. 
Elsewhere in the valley, helicopters dropped food parcels and villagers set up a zip wire across the river to deliver supplies to some of the 13 mountain villages cut off by the disaster.
A team of scientists have reached the glacier site to determine what triggered a calamity, which fuelled concern about the building of hydropower projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains. 

The flash flood was initially thought to have been caused by a glacier breaking apart and crashing into the river, but some scientists now say it was more likely to have been due to an avalanche.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>",Analysis: Economic pain may push tough-talking Iran to show nuclear flexibility,"By Parisa Hafezi and John Irish
DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Iran insists the new U.S. administration act first to save the
collapsing 2015 nuclear deal but faces pent-up pressures, from ruinous sanctions to internal dissent and wider regional crises, that may impel Tehran to show flexibility in a test of wills.
U.S. sanctions are squeezing Iran’s oil income, Iranians' economic misery is palpable. Israel’s normalisation deals with Gulf Arab states threaten Iran's wider regional presence, and Tehran's regional proxy wars are draining scarce resources.  
    Despite official Islamic Republic bluster that Tehran is in no rush for Washington to rejoin its nuclear accord with world powers, the myriad pressures mean speed is of the essence with a presidential election looming in June.
    ""Public dissatisfaction is simmering ... The hopes of many Iranians that their economic misery would quickly end after (U.S. President Joe) Biden's election are turning to frustration and anger,"" a senior Iranian official said.
Iran's clerical rulers fear a re-eruption of unrest among its core voting bloc - lower-income Iranians - whose periodic bouts of protest in recent years reminded them how vulnerable they could be to popular anger over economic hardships.
""This anger over economic problems should be addressed immediately. It does not mean yielding to America's pressure. It means showing heroic flexibility,"" he told Reuters. 
Biden has said Washington will return to the nuclear pact abandoned by predecessor Donald Trump if Tehran first resumes compliance with its strict limits on uranium enrichment, a potential pathway to nuclear bombs. But with mutual mistrust running deep, Tehran avers that Washington must act first. 
    ""It is a delicate decision for top leaders to make. They have to choose between sticking to their uncompromising stance or showing some flexibility,"" another senior Iranian official told Reuters.
There may be little time to lose to avoid the risk of the stand-off deteriorating into open conflict, some analysts say.
    Since Trump ditched the deal, asserting it was too lenient on Iran, Tehran has been rebuilding stockpiles of low-enriched uranium, enriching it to higher levels of fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up production.
    Dramatically upping the ante, a law passed by the hardline parliament obliges Tehran on Feb. 21 to cancel the sweeping access given to U.N. non-proliferation inspectors under the 2015 deal, limiting their visits to declared nuclear sites only.
""This will be considered a major breach by Iran and will deeply complicate the situation,"" warned a senior Western diplomat whose country is a party to the deal. 
QUIET DEBATE ABOUT MUTUAL GESTURES
However, some officials and analysts see room to bypass the hardline public posturing over which side should take the first step to rescue the deal, which was touted as a key insurance policy against wider Middle East war when signed.  
Iran would be amenable to a step-by-step, give-and-take approach if Washington took the first step, another Iranian official who was involved in the nuclear diplomacy with six world powers before 2015 told Reuters.
    ""Biden needs to build trust by returning to the deal as soon as possible. Then they should immediately find a way to ease the unjust economic pressure that would encourage Iran to show flexibility,"" he said. 
    Three sources told Reuters on Monday that the Biden administration was weighing a wide array of ideas on how to revive the deal, including an option where both sides would take small steps short of full compliance to buy time.
    A viable route to agreement that would avoid either side losing face has yet to crystallise, however. 
    ""We still don’t know how all this will happen because the Americans have not defined how they see the calendar sequencing and crucially what they actually want to obtain. The Iranians have also not defined what they want,"" said a European diplomat. 
    A senior Iranian diplomat suggested one gesture by Tehran towards resolving the impasse could be help in ending conflicts in Yemen, Iraq and Syria, saying this could offer a ""quick foreign policy win"" for Biden.
    Ali Vaez, Iran analyst at the International Crisis Group, suggested Washington could help pave the way to a new deal by reviving a French proposal to give Iran a $15 billion credit facility, or unblocking Iranian funds abroad. About 90% of Iran’s official reserves are frozen abroad due to sanctions.
    Eurasia Group analyst Henry Rome said Iran could match U.S. gestures by eschewing further provocative moves, such as ""not reducing U.N. inspector access, not installing more advanced centrifuges, not ramping up enriched uranium production"". 
    Another gesture could lie in a prisoner swap - Tehran has in the past indicated readiness to carry one out with Washington. 
Ultimately the Islamic Republic desires Western recognition of what it sees as its rightful place as a pre-eminent power in the Middle East, where for decades Iran and Saudi Arabia have jostled for the upper hand. 
Saudi Arabia and Israel both opposed the 2015 deal and fear its revival, without addressing Iran's ballistic missile program and role in various Middle East conflicts via proxy forces, might further embolden their mutual enemy.
ECONOMIC MISERY
As the nuclear impasse has festered, so has popular disenchantment at home - especially among women and the young, who comprise the bulk of voters - over high unemployment, soaring inflation and restrictions on political freedoms and social life. 
    Hundreds of factories have been closed, Iran's rial currency has lost 70% of its value against the U.S. dollar and official data show over 40 million Iranians live below the poverty line. 
    The election outcome in June will have no notable sway on nuclear policy, which is determined by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. 
But the myriad privations suffered by voters make a poor turnout more likely and this could bolster critics who say the establishment must moderate domestic and foreign policy.

""Any delay in reviving the economy could push Iran into chaos. People cannot take more economic pressure,"" said a former Iranian official who favours policy reforms.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranians staged a socially-distanced commemoration of their 1979 Islamic revolution on Wednesday, parading in vehicles to avoid infection rather than on foot and displaying ballistic missiles in defiance of Western efforts to curtail the programme. 
State television carried live footage of cars, motorcycles and bicycles moving through the streets of dozens of cities and towns where normally tens of thousands of people march at the annual event.
Despite the switch to wheel-bound forms of parade, the ceremony's sentiments remained unchanged. Participants waved Iranian flags and signs that read “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” - trademark slogans of the revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed Shah from his throne.
Iran, the Middle East country worst hit by COVID-19, has registered around 59,000 deaths and nearly 1.5 million cases. Authorities launched a vaccination drive on Tuesday, focusing initially on hospital intensive care personnel. 
In an online speech, President Hassan Rouhani raised the prospect of diplomacy if there were reciprocal moves to break an impasse over its unravelling 2015 nuclear deal with big powers.
""The moment that they honour their commitments under the deal, we will adhere to our commitments... The only path is certainly the world’s agreement with Iran,"" said Rouhani. 
U.S. President Joe Biden has said that if Tehran returned to strict compliance with the deal, Washington would follow suit and use that as a springboard to a broader agreement that might restrict Iran’s missile development and regional activities. 
Ruling out talks over its military capabilities, Tehran insists that Washington should take the first step by lifting all sanctions reimposed on Iran after Biden's predecessor Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018. 
""Time is running out for Washington and the current window is closing fast,"" state TV quoted Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as saying. 
Tehran faces Feb. 21 deadline when a new Iranian law obliges the government to scrap the sweeping inspection powers given to the U.N. nuclear watchdog by the deal and limiting inspections to declared nuclear sites only.
The U.S. sanctions, coupled with the coronavirus crisis, have wrecked the economy in Iran, where official data in September showed that over 50% of Iranians were living below the poverty line. 
State television showed three ballistic missiles on display in Tehran's Azadi (Freedom) Square and said they had launch ranges of between 700 and 1,000 km (435-620 miles).
It also aired footage of underground missile bases that the elite Revolutionary Guards unveiled over the past few years.

Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is to generate power and for other peaceful purposes. But U.S. intelligence agencies and the United Nations nuclear watchdog believe Iran once had a nuclear weapons programme that it halted.

SAJONEMETI, Hungary (Reuters) - Zoltan Berki usually wakes up before dawn, as his five small children sleep next door, to feed the old iron furnace that stands in a wall cavity to warm up both rooms. This is the only part of his house that he can afford to heat during winter.
Come rain or shine, Berki, a stocky 28-year-old Roma man, cycles an hour to work to save on the bus fare, so he is up anyway.
But he also has to burn some materials before daylight, to conceal the thick black smoke that billows from his chimney when he uses plastic or rubber. Such household pollution is illegal in Hungary, including in this town near the Slovakian border.
People do it anyway. On a foggy winter's day, dense smoke of different hues spews from nearly every chimney. It stays low in the air, gradually filling the narrow valleys.
""Firewood is expensive,"" Berki said one recent afternoon, as his family played around him, crammed into a small room. ""Either I buy wood or food. So I go to the forest, or the junkyard, and if we find plastic or rubber we burn that.""
The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled last week that Hungary had breached pollution limits for over a decade in the Sajo river valley, as well as other areas, which could be grounds for financial penalties unless reversed.
The ruling should be seen as ""a wake-up call"", European Commission spokeswoman Vivian Loonela said.
The Hungarian government did not respond to a request for comment.
Although Hungary has reduced its carbon emissions in the past decades and is not the worst offender in Europe, pockets of high pollution persist, and rules are rarely enforced, according to locals and environmental rights groups.
The capital Budapest and the southern city of Pecs suffer too, but the situation in the Sajo valley, where pollution and poverty go hand-in-hand, is especially severe.
In Berki's home, the hand-sized doors of the furnace open with a creak. Berki starts the flames and throws in a wood plank or two to build heat. Then he burns whatever he can. Plastic bottles, cut-up tyres and window frames all work. An old shoe often suffices.
Scavenging for material https://reut.rs/3tKI0wD to burn is common for the poorest people in the small, run-down town of Sajonemeti and those nearby, among the most destitute communities in Europe since Communist-era heavy industry vanished 30 years ago, leaving thousands jobless.
Aware of the rules, Berki avoids burning some fuel by day.
""The neighbours can see, and you can also smell it,"" he said. ""We throw the rubber and the plastic bottles and such things on at night.""
The valley forms a dead end and prevents winds as cold air settles in, so heavy smog can linger for weeks. Several such areas exist in Hungary, together contributing to thousands of premature deaths every year, according to Europe's top court.
YEARS OF ALARM
Hungarian environmental groups have been raising the alarm for years.
In 2020 Zsuzsanna F. Nagy, northeastern Hungary's foremost environmental activist, surveyed locals about their heating practices, and found that while some people burned rubbish, even those who tried to heat homes properly often burned lignite or other coal products that were unfit for home use.
That echoed the assessment of the Clean Air Action Group, a Budapest-based green organisation, which said coal types can vary widely, and by using the wrong ones, households could erase gains made by a post-Communist cleanup of industry.
The gap between quality coal and low-grade alternatives can mean a 60-fold difference in particulate emissions, it said.
In Hungary, a country of 10 million people, air pollution causes an annual 13,000 premature deaths, a million people fall sick and billions of euros are lost to economic damage, Clean Air project leader Judit Szego said.
According to the European Environmental Agency, Hungary ranks third in Europe behind Bulgaria and Poland in health damage, losing an annual 1,128 life years per 100,000 residents due to particulate pollution, or small flying dust, alone - compared with about 500 in the UK or 250 in Sweden.
Air pollution can cause allergic reactions, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, the National Public Health Institute said in a 2017 study.
Berki's five children all use inhalers because they suffer from asthma symptoms, he said. To his father, Zoltan Berki Sr., pollution means chest pain and coughs.
On Sunday, the elder Berki went to dig up leftover coal by hand - a common sight in winter.
The man-made mounds are littered with materials for burning, including logs from the old coal mine rail tracks which are infused with diesel.

""Smokes like hell but burns nicely,"" he said as he piled up a few. ""We collect what we find and take it home to burn. They heat up nicely, and we can't afford to buy anything.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday invited protesting farmers for talks to address growers' concerns about three new agricultural laws that seek to deregulate the country's vast farm sector.
Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping out on main highways on the outskirts of New Delhi for more than two months in a bid to force the government to withdraw the new laws they say benefit private buyers at their expense.
Defending the laws passed by his government in September, Modi said: ""The laws give farmers the freedom to directly sell produce to buyers, unshackling them from the age-old restriction of selling crops only through wholesale markets.""
The laws were designed to give an option to farmers, without weakening existing wholesale markets, Modi told parliament. Lawmakers from the main opposition Congress party walked out of parliament, expressing solidarity with the protesting farmers.
Protesting farmers accuse the government of introducing the laws to help large private retailers. Growers say the laws will gradually make traditional wholesale markets irrelevant and farmers will be left at the mercy of private buyers.
Modi said India's agriculture sector needed investment to help modernise the food supply chain and improve infrastructure, critical to raising farmers' incomes, and India's private sector should not be viewed with suspicion.
""India's private sector has played an important role in the nation's welfare, and we need wealth creators here,"" he said.
Stressing the need to switch to profitable crops such as fruit and horticulture, Modi said Indian farmers needed to look beyond growing rice and wheat.
After years of bountiful harvests, India struggles with bulging inventories of rice and wheat worth billions of dollars that lie unsold in government warehouses.

Modi also asked protesters and their supporters to stop vandalising toll plazas and telecommunication masts.

Many protesters banged pots and pans, borrowing from nightly displays of discontent in neighbouring Myanmar at last week's coup, while some held Myanmar flags to show support for the country's pro-democracy movement.
The Bangkok demonstration had originally been organised to show solitary with protesters in Myanmar, but it morphed into calls to change or end the strict ""lese majeste"" law after the four activists were detained on Tuesday.
Police in riot gear briefly scuffled with protesters when activists marched near a police station. A smoke canister was seen on the ground near the protest site. 
""If we come out to the streets in the hundreds of thousands, we can reform monarchy,"" protest leader Panusaya “Rung” Sithijirawattanakul said. 
Youth-led protests in Thailand last year broke traditional taboos by openly calling for reform of the powerful monarchy and the denial of bail for the four protest leaders prosecuted for royal insults has enraged activists.
About 1,000 protesters had gathered by nightfall, some holding signs that said ""free our friends"" and ""abolish 112"", referring to the article of the criminal code that covers royal insults. Others struck metal pans bearing the numbers 112. 
Some 44 opposition lawmakers earlier on Wednesday submitted a proposal to amend the article.
Protest leaders declared the rally a resumption of last year's street demonstrations, which were disrupted by a second wave of coronavirus infections that has seen Thailand's cases increase five-fold since mid-December. 
""Today is the first gathering, first opening and a battle after an unjust system jailed our friends,"" Panupong Jadnok, a protest leader said.
They renewed last year's three demands: ousting Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, rewriting the military-backed constitution and reforming the monarchy.
Panupong said events in Myanmar should inspire the Thai movement.
Prayuth, who led a coup in 2014, said the return of protests will harm Thailand. 

""Is it appropriate? If it's not, then don't go support them. Haven't we had enough in Thailand?"" he said.

There were no reports of violence on Wednesday and in many places protests took on a festive air, with bare-chested body builders, women in ball gowns and wedding dresses, farmers in tractors and people with their pets. Some set up a protest line in inflatable rubber tubs.
Thousands joined demonstrations in the main city of Yangon, while in the capital, Naypyitaw, hundreds of government workers marched in support of a growing civil disobedience campaign.
A group of police in Kayah state in the east marched in uniform with a sign that said ""We don't want dictatorship"", according to pictures published in media.
Earlier, soldiers took over a clinic that had been treating wounded protesters in Naypyitaw on Tuesday, a doctor there said.
The teenager was shot when police fired, mostly into the air, to clear the protesters. Her brother, Ye Htut Aung, told Reuters the family – though supportive of the protests – had urged her against going but she insisted.
The army's True News Information Unit said in a statement the security forces only used non-lethal weapons and the police were investigating. It said two police had been injured by the ""rioters"" and were in hospital.
Protesters draped a big portrait of Mya Thwate Thwate Khaing from a bridge in Yangon. A doctor at the hospital where she was being treated told Reuters she was not likely to survive. 
Human Rights Watch said a 20-year-old man also wounded by a bullet was in a stable condition, while doctors said three other people were being treated for wounds from suspected rubber bullets.
Protesters were also hurt in Mandalay and other cities, where security forces used water cannon and arrested dozens. State television said four police were also hurt by protesters throwing stones.
'DISPROPORTIONATE FORCE'
The protests are the largest in Myanmar in more than a decade, reviving memories of almost half a century of direct army rule and spasms of bloody uprisings until the military began relinquishing some power in 2011.
The military, which has imposed restrictions on gatherings and a night curfew in the biggest cities, justified its takeover on the grounds of fraud in a Nov. 8 election that Suu Kyi's NLD party won by a landslide. The electoral commission dismissed the army's complaints.
Western countries have condemned the coup but taken little concrete action to press for the restoration of democracy.
The U.S. State Department said it was reviewing assistance to Myanmar to ensure those responsible for the coup faced ""significant consequences"".
U.N. human rights investigator Thomas Andrews voiced concern at the use of lethal force.
""Myanmar military personnel and police need to know that ‘following orders’ is no defence for committing atrocities and any such defence will fail, regardless of their place in the chain of command,"" he said.
He said that ""hundreds of arbitrary detentions"" had been recorded since the coup.
The United Nations main human rights body is set to consider a resolution on Friday that would condemn the coup in Myanmar and demand urgent access, a text shows.
Avinash Paliwal, a senior lecturer at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies, said Myanmar would not be as isolated now as it was in the past, with China, India, Southeast Asian neighbours and Japan unlikely to cut ties. 
""The country is too important geo-strategically for that to happen. The U.S. and other Western countries will put sanctions - but this coup and its ramifications will be an Asian story, not a Western one,"" Paliwal said.
Underscoring that Asian stance, the prime minister of neighbouring Thailand, Prayuth Chan-ocha, himself a former army chief who seized power in a 2014 coup, said he had received a letter from Myanmar's new junta leader, army chief Min Aung Hlaing, asking for help to support democracy.
""Thailand supports the democratic process. The rest is up to him to see how to proceed,"" Prayuth said.
Suu Kyi, 75, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy and remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of the Muslim Rohingya minority.

She has spent nearly 15 years under house arrest and now faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkies and her lawyer said he has not been allowed to see her.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's 5-Star Movement struggled on Wednesday to quell its deep divisions over Mario Draghi's drive to form a government which risk tearing apart the anti-establishment party and delaying the creation of the cabinet.
Party leaders who met Draghi on Saturday and again on Tuesday had sounded upbeat about the prospects of joining the broad-based administration he is putting together to tackle the coronavirus health emergency and economic slump.
With pledges of support from a host of groups, including the League, Forza Italia and the Democratic Party, Draghi does not need 5-Star votes. However, the movement has the largest number of lawmakers in both houses of parliament and its absence would undermine his efforts to build a national unity alliance.
As usual for such a major decision, 5-Star had been expected to hold an online ballot of members to take the final decision. But the leadership had to postpone the poll set for Wednesday after hitting fierce opposition from some of its lawmakers.
""Saying 'yes' or 'no' to Draghi would be too simplistic ... We need to vote on a programme,"" party chief Vito Crimi told Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview on Wednesday.
A new prime minister normally only reveals his programme to parliament once his ministers have been sworn in. It was not immediately clear if 5-Star was expecting Draghi to disclose all or part of his plans early in order to guarantee their support.
5-Star was born in 2009 as an anti-system, anti-euro protest party and it has formed the backbone of the last two coalition governments, which both collapsed following rows with allies.
""SUPERFLUOUS""
Posts on the party blog suggest many members are uneasy at the prospect of hooking up with a former president of the European Central Bank, despite calls from the movement's founder, Beppe Grillo, to endorse the initiative.
Grillo's appeals angered some party stalwarts and around 1,000 took part in a stormy Zoom call on Tuesday to denounce Draghi, party sources said.
""I don't recognise Grillo anymore. I used to love him. He made me feel passionate. I suggested (on the call) that we should call in an exorcist and liberate him,"" Maria Muscara, a councillor in the southern region of Campania, told Reuters.
5-Star sources say a sizeable number of its 92 senators do not want to support Draghi and might rebel even if Grillo's stance is eventually backed by an online ballot - putting the future of the group at risk. 
One source said lawmakers were unhappy at the idea of joining another government that included the right-wing League, its coalition partner between 2018-19. They are also worried that their voice will be lost in a broad-based government.
""We will be superfluous. They will be able to govern without us,"" a 5-Star lower house deputy said, declining to be named.
Another lawmaker, who also asked for anonymity, said that if they were to back Draghi, they would need public assurances that he would put many issues close to their heart in his programme, including green policies, income support initiatives, tax cuts and a prominent state role within the national motorways.
There was no immediate comment from Draghi or his aides.

Politicians expect Draghi to see the president before the end of Friday to confirm he has sufficient backing to form a government and to present a list of ministers.

(Reuters) - A weather system already punishing the Midwestern United States with the coldest temperatures of the winter was forecast to spin to the south and West on Wednesday, prompting ice storm warnings and likely hazardous travel conditions.
The cell of arctic high pressure sitting over Canada that has driven temperatures some 20 or 30 degrees below normal in the U.S. Midwest and northern plains will bring even rougher weather as it moves into central and southern states, the National Weather Service said.
""We have very cold air across Canada that will continue to funnel down into the central portion of the United States for the next several days,"" said meteorologist Lara Pagano of the weather service. ""This is actually going to be a prolonged period of well below normal temperatures.""
Wind chill advisories have already been issued for northern U.S. states, including Montana and North Dakota.
As temperatures drop further south and mix with moist air streaming across the region from the Pacific Ocean, weather advisories and warnings are also expected for Illinois, Kentucky, Oklahoma and northern Texas, Pagano said.
Ice storm warnings will likely be announced for Arkansas, Mississippi and Kentucky, she said, with the possibility of power outages. 
Icy roads were expected to make driving dangerous across much of the region and flights could be delayed or canceled.
""We have that colder high pressure in place so we're going to start to see moisture meet up with the core high pressure, bringing ice and ice storms that will impact the Mississippi Valley, Ohio and Tennessee valleys tonight into Friday,"" Pagano said.
Already parts of the upper Midwest have been gripped by extreme cold weather this week, with parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin seeing below zero temperatures for several days.

International Falls, Minnesota saw temperatures dip to -36 degrees Fahrenheit (-38 degrees Celsius) on Monday, according to AccuWeather.

    Tens of thousands have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest against the jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin. 
    The Moscow-based Levada Centre said an opinion poll conducted from Jan. 29 to Feb. 2 showed that 45% of people expected fresh political protests, a jump from 23% last November.
    The poll also found that 43% of people said they thought protests with economic demands were possible. That level was last recorded in November 1998, the year of Russia's financial crisis. 
    Despite those figures, fewer Russians said they were willing to take part. 
    Around 15% of 1,616 people polled in 50 different regions said they would be ready to turn out to a political protest. The poll also showed that 17% of Russians would be willing to take part in a protest linked to economic conditions.
    Those figures represent Russians' lowest willingness to take to the streets since March 2018, according to the poll. 
    Some human rights groups and allies of Navalny have accused police of using disproportionate force to break up the recent protests in support of the opposition politician. 
    OVD-Info, a protest monitor, said police had detained more than 11,000 people nationwide during the rallies. 
    The Kremlin has rejected allegations of state repression against Navalny's supporters.

    Navalny's team last week declared a moratorium on street protests until the spring and summer but has since urged Russians to gather near their homes on Valentine's Day to shine their mobile phone torches and light candles in heart shapes.

The two dominant factions - Fatah and Hamas - convened in Cairo this week with 12 other groups for Egyptian-brokered talks on how to prepare for parliamentary elections on May 22 and a presidential vote on July 31.
There are still many obstacles, amid widespread scepticism about the feasibility of holding elections in three different areas: the parts of the occupied West Bank where the Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule, Hamas-controlled Gaza, and East Jerusalem, which is under Israeli control.
But speaking in Cairo on Wednesday, Jibril Rajoub, the head of Fatah's delegation to the talks, insisted that the elections would go ahead, even if it meant going against the will of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and ""the will of all the enemies of the Palestinian people"".

There are 2.8 million eligible voters in Gaza and the West Bank, and 85% of them have so far been registered. The voting age is 18. Israel allowed Palestinian elections in East Jerusalem last time.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China called on the United States on Wednesday to invite the World Health Organization to investigate origins of the COVID-19 outbreak there, as sparring over the pandemic continued after the WHO wrapped up its field work in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Hours after the WHO team revealed preliminary findings at a Wuhan news conference on Tuesday, Washington said it wants to scrutinize data used by the team, which concluded that the virus causing COVID-19 did not originate in a laboratory in Wuhan, and that bats remain a likely source.
""We wish that the U.S. side can, like China, uphold an open and transparent attitude, and be able to invite WHO experts to the U.S. to conduct origin tracing research and inspection,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a regular daily briefing, repeating a call it has been making recently. 
The origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, are highly politicized, with China pushing the idea that the virus has roots outside its borders.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday that the Biden administration had not been involved in the ""planning and implementation"" of the WHO investigation and wants to take an independent review of its findings and underlying data.
""The U.S. independently examining the WHO's data? It's the WHO who should examine the U.S. data,"" said Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's official People’s Daily, on social media platform Weibo (NASDAQ:WB). 
""Did we all mishear, or is this spokesperson really so shameless?"" 
Peter Ben Embarek, who heads the WHO-led team that spent four weeks in China - two of them in quarantine - said that the investigation had not dramatically changed its picture of the outbreak, although the virus could have crossed borders before arriving in Wuhan.
In addition to ruling out a lab leak, he said that frozen food could possibly be a means of transmitting the virus, which would support a thesis backed by Beijing, which has blamed some case clusters on imported food packaging.
The WHO's conclusion ""completely refutes the conspiracy theory raised by some anti-China hawks, like former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who has been accusing the Wuhan Institute of Virology of leaking the virus,"" the Global Times wrote.
Pompeo had said there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the new coronavirus emerged from a Chinese laboratory.

Chinese officials have stressed in recent months that the virus could have emerged in multiple regions outside China.

""In the wake of three terrorist attacks in Kabul this morning, Mohammadzai Kochai, police chief of district five of Kabul was martyred along with his bodyguard,"" interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said. 
Another three people were wounded, he added.
A separate blast later hit a car near the upmarket international Serena Hotel, although a police spokesman said there were no casualties. 
District five, where Kochai was based, is a transport hub between the capital Kabul and Afghanistan's southern provinces, many of which are dominated by the Taliban. 
Kochai had sought to crack down on the high levels of insecurity in the district in recent months.
The Taliban did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the attacks. The group has denied involvement in a recent wave of targeted assassinations which the government and many foreign powers have blamed on it. 
Almost daily deadly attacks with small, magnetic bombs attached to the undercarriages of vehicles, roadside explosive devices and shootings are unnerving Afghan officials, activists and journalists.
The attacks are concentrated in urban centres and come as protracted peace talks take place in Doha between Taliban militants and the Afghan government.
Officials say the talks have largely stalled as U.S. President Joe Biden's administration reviews how to handle the peace process, including a troop withdrawal agreement Washington signed with the Taliban under previous President Donald Trump.

ROME (Reuters) - In February 2017, populist firebrand Matteo Salvini accused the-then European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi of being an ""accomplice"" in what he termed the economic ""massacre"" of Italy.
Fast forward four years and Salvini has unexpectedly pledged the support of his League party for a government that Draghi is trying to put together to tackle the twin scourges of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis ravaging the country.
For a man who once campaigned for Italy to quit the European single currency, Salvini's endorsement of Draghi marks a potential sea change for the League, shunting it out of the far-right, eurosceptic camp and into the moderate, centre right.
League politicians say it is a calculated move, aimed at improving Salvini's image, thereby enhancing his prospects of one day becoming prime minister, while boosting the appeal of their group, whose poll ratings have been in decline.
""We want to become like the Republican Party in the United States. An inclusive party that reconciles all the positions of the Italian centre right, no one excluded,"" Giulio Centemero, a League parliamentarian, told Reuters.
President Sergio Mattarella gave Draghi a mandate to form a government last week after the previous coalition collapsed, urging him to seek cross-party backing for his administration.
Salvini's immediate response was to keep Draghi at arm's length and push instead for early elections. 
But members of his inner circle, including moderate stalwart Giancarlo Giorgetti, who is a friend of Draghi, saw it as a golden opportunity to hit the reboot button and shake off the ""far-right"" label that has spooked investors in the past.
""The League wants to join Draghi in order to clear its name in Europe, to get rid of its reputation as a eurosceptic party,"" said a senior League source, who had helped shape the policy.
MISCALCULATION
Salvini's plain-talking, anti-migrant message has resonated with millions of Italians and helped transform the League from a troubled regional party into Italy's most popular group, which won 34% of the vote in European parliament elections in 2019.
At the time, the League was in government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. Carried away by his success, Salvini quit the coalition, expecting to trigger a national election. It proved a terrible miscalculation.
The centre-left Democratic Party unexpectedly replaced the League in government and dumped Salvini into opposition where his approval ratings have dropped behind that of another League politician - Luca Zaia, the governor of Veneto.
Zaia is widely perceived to have done a good job tackling the coronavirus in his region and represents the old, established League, close to the industrialists and small business leaders who make up the backbone of the economy.
""The pandemic has shown that polarising policies are not accepted by citizens in the face of suffering. Voters want solutions for their problems,"" said Nicola Pasini, professor of Political Sciences at the Milan University. 
The old wing of the party celebrated Draghi's promotion, confident he would draw up business-friendly plans on how to spend more than 200 billion euros ($243 billion) from a European Union fund that is designed to revitalise the battered economy.
But to guarantee a share of the spoils, they needed the League to be in the room when the decisions were being made.
At a meeting with Salvini last Thursday, party sources said the northern governors, including Zaia, joined forces with Giorgetti to convince Salvini to throw in his lot with Draghi.
""There was very little opposition to the shift in policy. The governors carry a lot of weight and when they speak in unison, Salvini tends to fall into line,"" said a League lawmaker, who declined to be named. 
""A JOKE""
The League has seen an immediate bump in its poll ratings thanks to its decision to join the new, broad-based government, with support climbing 0.7 points over the past week to 24% -- the biggest increase of any party according to SWG pollsters.
""(Salvini's) move shows the League is a fully mature party and makes it clear that it is a trustworthy party of government,"" said Gianluca Cantalamessa, one of the League's new wave of lawmakers from southern Italy.
Some of the League's far-right allies in the European parliament are much less happy at the prospect of a government led by Draghi, who is expected to immediately set to work on the recovery plan, hoping to utilise all the EU funds on offer.
""It is a joke, but a very bad one that the Germans ... will not be able to laugh at,"" said Joerg Meuthen, co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), arguing that Berlin will end up footing much of the bill.
League politicians snapped back at him, reviving speculation that Salvini might soon abandon the nationalist faction in Europe and ask to join the European People's Party (EPP) group -- home to all Europe's main centre-right parties.
""Joining the EPP would seem to be the logical consequence,"" said Roberto D'Alimonte, a politics professor at Rome's Luiss University. However, he predicted Salvini would change tack if the Draghi experiment failed. 
""This is a strategic choice that will be consolidated only if things go well. If things go badly, then it is all over. He will return to the nationalist camp,"" he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Alexei Borisov was diagnosed by doctors as having a punctured lung, three fractured ribs and a broken tooth after he attended a rally on Jan. 31 in support of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.
The 42-year-old truck driver said he was injured by police who detained him after he led a march in central Ryazan, 200 km (120 miles) southeast of Moscow, shouting ""Freedom to Alexei Navalny"" and slogans against President Vladimir Putin.
""I was lying face down on the (police car) floor... They began to hit me, I didn’t even see how many of them there were,"" Borisov said.
Reuters did not witness the incident Borisov described but he provided medical documents that confirmed his injuries and a photograph showing him lying in hospital. The documents did not show where or how he sustained the injuries. 
Asked about his case by Reuters, the interior ministry, which is in charge of the police, did not comment.
Borisov is one of more than 11,000 people who have been detained at protests in recent weeks over Navalny's arrest and imprisonment, according to OVD-Info, a non-governmental group that monitors arrests during mass protests and seeks to prevent human rights abuses and political persecution. 
An OVD-info representative said the group knew of about 116 cases of alleged police violence following the recent protests and feared many more had not reported their injuries. 
Reuters has been unable to determine how widespread complaints of police brutality have been at protests that have involved tens of thousands of people in the last few weeks. 
The vast majority of protesters have not complained of being hurt and no deaths have been reported. But reporters say police have been much more forceful, and in some cases more violent, than at most other political protests in recent years. 
The interior ministry, the Investigative Committee which investigates major crimes and Russia's National Guard did not respond to requests for comment about the police conduct.
The Kremlin has denied repression by the police. It has said any cases of alleged police brutality are being looked into but that there have been many more cases of riot police officers being attacked by protesters than vice versa.
The authorities have called the protests illegal because they have not received official approval to go ahead, and said such rallies risk spreading COVID-19. 
TASERS AND BATONS
Navalny was arrested in January after returning to Russia from Germany, where he was treated after being poisoned in Siberia with what many Western countries said was a nerve agent. Navalny blamed Putin for the attack but the Kremlin has dismissed the accusations and questions whether he was poisoned.
Reuters reporters in Moscow and St Petersburg have seen protesters tasered and beaten with truncheons, and have spoken with eight who say police used violence against them. 
A Reuters reporter in Moscow witnessed a protester falling to the ground and screaming in pain during his arrest at a protest on Jan. 31, and asking the police to stop tasering him.
After a week in jail, the same protester, 30-year-old fitness trainer Soso Glonti, told Reuters a policeman had tasered him even though he was not resisting arrest.
""I know how to endure (pain), but the fifth or sixth time they tasered me I lost my temper. It was the fifth time when I started screaming,"" he said.
Medical records of four protesters viewed by Reuters detailed injuries including a broken arm, concussion, a head injury, bruises, and an eyelid wound.
The RIA news agency said the National Guard is looking into an incident in which an officer hit cameraman Fyodor Khudokormov, 18, who told Reuters he was beaten around the head with a baton on Feb. 2 even though he was clearly identified as a journalist. 
Victor Lipatov, a 49-year-old lawyer, told Reuters he was hit on the head and arm with a baton while standing in front of riot police and holding hands with other protesters. 
OVD-info group says Russia has opened 36 criminal cases against people who attended rallies over alleged use of force against riot police.
The Investigative Committee said 21 criminal cases were opened after the first rally on Jan. 23, including against protesters accused of striking policemen. It has not said how many have been opened since then. 
The Investigative Committee says it has opened criminal cases against protesters who threw fireworks or other objects at policemen, kicked or punched them, or sprayed pepper gas.
Russia's Committee Against Torture monitoring group said it had filed six complaints to the Investigative Committee over alleged use of violence by riot police but had not yet received any answers. They included Lipatov's case. 

No criminal cases have been announced against police officers or National Guardsmen.

Democratic Taiwan has become a safe haven for many Hong Kongers who have fled the Chinese-run city in the face of a mounting crackdown on dissent after Beijing unveiled a new tough security law last year following months of protests.
Tsai and her government have offered strong support for the protesters, to the fury of Beijing, which considers Taiwan its own territory and has denounced the island for encouraging violence and criminality.

""We are supportive of the democratic process in Myanmar but what is most important today is to maintain good relations because it impacts the people, the economy, border trade, particularly now,"" Prayuth said.
""Thailand supports the democratic process. The rest is up to him to see how to proceed,"" he said.
Since the coup, Myanmar has been convulsed by the biggest protests in more than a decade as Suu Kyi's supporters challenge the coup that halted a tentative decade-long transition to democracy.
Thailand witnessed its biggest protests in decades last year as Prayuth's opponents demanded that he step down, accusing him of engineering the last election to continue the domination of Thai politics by the army and monarchy. He denies any interference.

The Thai and Myanmar armies have had close working relationships in recent decades despite a distant history of enmity between the countries.

600,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 03:20AM ET</span>",Thai opposition party pushes to amend royal insult law,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai opposition party on Wednesday submitted a proposal to amend the country's strict royal insult law, a potentially groundbreaking move that it said could ease political tension and improve freedom of expression amid anti-government protests.
The proposed amendment by 44 lawmakers from the opposition Move Forward Party comes a day after four leaders of youth-led demonstrations were jailed pending trial under the royal insult law, known as lese majeste, which carries penalties of up to 15 years in prison.
The move is significant in a country where criticising the king - who is revered among the military and many conservative Thais - has long been taboo and even talking about lese majeste can trigger a criminal charge.
At least 58 activists have been charged with royal insult since November over protests where calls were made for reform of the monarchy and an end to military involvement in government. 
Move Forward wants to allow honest criticism of the monarchy, sharply reduce punishment terms and allow only the Royal Household Bureau, instead of private citizens, to file lese majeste complaints with police, which it said would prevent abuse.
Those who defame or threaten the king would still face imprisonment under the proposal, but for up to one year, or a 300,000 baht ($10,027) fine, or both. 
""This is a proposal that we think all sides can talk about, can accept and live with, and it will ease the political tension,"" said Move Forward lawmaker Chaithawat Tulathon.
The amendment would need majority support from the military-appointed Senate and the elected lower house, where the army-backed coalition of former coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha holds a firm majority after disputed 2019 elections.
Royalist party Thai Pakdee on Wednesday submitted a rival proposal signed by more than 100,000 people to stop any lese majeste law amendment.

""Some groups wanted to topple the monarchy, but they are telling society that they are only want to reform,"" said Warong Dechgitvigrom, of Thai Pakdee Party.

The briefing follows one held for families on Tuesday in Pontianak, the doomed flight's destination, and comes as divers search for the missing memory unit from the plane's cockpit voice recorder. 
The 26-year-old Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-500 jet crashed into the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta, marking Indonesia's third major airline crash in just over six years and shining a spotlight on the country's poor air safety record.
Rafik Alaydrus, whose wife died in the crash, said investigators on Tuesday told family members that the cause had not been determined but that various factors, including the plane's autothrottle system, were being investigated.
""For family of victims, we do not understand about technical issues,"" he said. ""We responded this incident had happened and the victims should get their right compensation."" 
Investigators quickly located and read the plane's flight data recorder (FDR) and sent parts of the plane, including the autothrottle system that controls engine power automatically, to the United States and Britain for examination.
Citing sources close to the investigation, the Wall Street Journal last month reported the FDR data showed the autothrottle system was not operating properly on one of the plane's engines as it left Jakarta.
Instead of shutting off the system, the FDR indicated the pilots tried to get the stuck throttle to function, the WSJ said. That could create significant differences in power between engines, making the jet harder to control.
National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Chief Soerjanto Tjahjono last week said that the WSJ report was incorrect and that more information would be provided in KNKT's preliminary report.

Safety experts say most air accidents are caused by a combination of factors that can take months to establish. Under international standards, the final report is due within a year of the crash.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s swift vaccination rollout has made it the largest real-world study of  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine. Results are trickling in, and they are promising.
More than half of eligible Israelis - about 3.5 million people - have now been fully or partially vaccinated. Older and at-risk groups, the first to be inoculated, are seeing a dramatic drop in illnesses.
Among the first fully-vaccinated group there was a 53% reduction in new cases, a 39% decline in hospitalizations and a 31% drop in severe illnesses from mid-January until Feb. 6, said Eran Segal, data scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel.
(Graphic: Trends in COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations in Israel following vaccination - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/ISRAEL-RESULTS/yzdvxwojdpx/TRENDS-PCT.jpg)
In the same period, among people under age 60 who became eligible for shots later, new cases dropped 20% but hospitalizations and severe illness rose 15% and 29%, respectively.
Reuters interviewed leading scientists in Israel and abroad, Israeli health officials, hospital heads and two of the country's largest healthcare providers about what new data shows from the world's most efficient vaccine rollout. 
The vaccine drive has provided a database offering insights into how effective the vaccines are outside of controlled clinical trials, and at what point countries might attain sought-after but elusive herd immunity.
More will be known in two weeks, as teams analyse vaccine effectiveness in younger groups of Israelis, as well as targeted populations such as people with diabetes, cancer and pregnant women, among a patient base at least 10 times larger than those in clinical studies.
""We need to have enough variety of people in that subgroup and enough follow-up time so you can make the right conclusions, and we are getting to that point,"" said Ran Balicer, chief innovation officer of HMO Clalit, which covers more than half the Israeli population.
Pfizer is monitoring the Israeli rollout on a weekly basis for insights that can be used around the world.
As a small country with universal healthcare, advanced data capabilities and the promise of a swift rollout, Israel provided Pfizer with a unique opportunity to study the real-world impact of the vaccine developed with Germany's BioNTech 
But the company said it remained ""difficult to forecast the precise time when herd protection may start to manifest"" because of many variables at play, including social distancing measures and the number of new infections generated by each case, known as the reproduction rate.
Even Israel, in the vanguard of the global vaccine drive, has lowered expectations of emerging quickly from the pandemic because of soaring cases.
A third national lockdown has struggled to contain transmission, attributed to the fast-spreading UK variant of the virus. On a positive note, the Pfizer/BioNTech shot appears to be effective against it.
""We've so far identified the same 90% to 95% efficacy against the British strain,"" said Hezi Levi, director-general of the Israeli Health Ministry.
""It is still early though, because we have only now finished the first week after the second dose,"" he said, adding: ""It's too early to say anything about the South African variant.""
WHICH ARM?
Israel began its vaccination programme Dec. 19 - the day after Hanukkah - after paying a premium for supplies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
Four days later, the more contagious UK variant was detected in four people. While the vaccine is preventing illness in older people, the variant now makes up about 80% of new cases.
Finding themselves in a race between the vaccine and the new variant, Israel began giving shots to those over 60 and gradually opened the programme to the rest of the population.
Every detail was digitally tracked, down to in which arm the patient was jabbed and what vial it came from.
One week after receiving the second Pfizer dose - the point at which full protection is expected to kick in - 254 out of 416,900 people were infected, according to Maccabi, a leading Israeli healthcare provider. 
(Graphic: COVID-19 infections among vaccinated people - https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/ISRAEL-RESULTS/qmyvmwnxdvr/INFECTIONS-AMONG-VACCINATED-POP.jpg)
Comparing this against an unvaccinated group revealed a vaccine efficacy of 91%, Maccabi said.
By 22 days after full vaccination, no infections were recorded. 
Israeli experts are confident the vaccines rather than lockdown measures brought the numbers down, based on studying different cities, age groups and pre-vaccine lockdowns.
The comparisons were ""convincing in telling us this is the effect of the vaccination,"" said Weizmann Institute's Segal.
With 80% of senior citizens partially or fully vaccinated, a more complete picture will begin to emerge as soon as this week.
""And we do expect further decline in the overall cases and in the cases of severe morbidity,"" said Balicer, of HMO Clalit.
VACCINES AND TRANSMISSION
There may be early signs that vaccinations are tamping down virus transmission in addition to illness
At Israel's biggest COVID-19 testing centre, run by MyHeritage, researchers have tracked a significant decrease in the amount of virus infected people carry, known as cT value, among the most-vaccinated age groups.
This suggests that even if vaccinated people get infected, they are less likely to infect others, said MyHeritage Chief Science Officer Yaniv Erlich.
""The data so far is probably most clear from Israel. I do believe that these vaccines will reduce onward transmission,"" said Stefan Baral, from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Maryland.
DIMINISHING RETURNS
It is unclear whether Israel will be able to keep up its world-leading vaccination pace.
""When you vaccinate fast and a lot, you eventually get to the hardcore - those who are less willing or harder to reach,"" said Boaz Lev, head of the Health Ministry's advisory panel. 
The vaccination pace is seen even more crucial with the British variant's rapid transmission.
""In the race between the UK variant spreading and the vaccinations, the end result is that we are seeing a kind of plateau in terms of the severely ill,"" said Segal.
The big question is whether vaccines can eradicate the pandemic.
Michal Linial, a professor of molecular biology and bioinformatics at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, said data from past decades suggests viruses become endemic and seasonal. 
She predicted this coronavirus would become far less aggressive, perhaps requiring a booster shot within three years.

""The virus is not going anywhere,"" she concluded.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 10, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Australian media say 'sorry' for breaching gag order in Cardinal Pell child sex assault case,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian media companies apologised in court on Wednesday for breaching a suppression order on reporting a child sex assault conviction, since overturned, of former Vatican treasurer George Pell in 2018.
A dozen Australian media outlets pled guilty for breaching the gag order in a deal with the state, which has dropped all other charges against the companies and their reporters, editors and presenters, sparing them potential jail sentences.
Lawyers for News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA), Nine Entertainment Corp and its subsidiaries and online service mamamia gave an ""unqualified and sincere apology"" to the Supreme Court of Victoria, the County Court of Victoria and its Chief Judge Peter Kidd, who issued the suppression order in 2018.
Pell was found guilty in December 2018 on five charges of sexually assaulting two choirboys. Reporting on the case was gagged as he was due to face another trial the following year, but that second case was eventually dropped.
Foreign media reported on his conviction, naming him and the charges, and only after that did Australian media publish stories saying a prominent unnamed person had been convicted of a major crime which they were unable to report on. Some referred to foreign reporting of the case.
Pell was acquitted in April 2020, after serving more than a year in jail.
Lawyer Will Houghton, representing News Corp's Courier Mail, Daily Telegraph and news.com.au told the Supreme Court that the breach of the media gag order came about ""because of an error of judgment"".
""This case involved a decision to publish that was made after a lot of deliberation, a lot of consideration, and having had the benefit of legal advice in all three cases,"" said Houghton.
""Why, therefore, do we have a plea of guilty? Because those publications acknowledge and admit that there was a breach of the proceeding suppression order,"" he said.
With Supreme Court Judge John Dixon set to decide penalties in the case, the media firms' affidavits discussed at the hearing expressed remorse, spelled out measures they have taken to improve staff training on legal issues, listed awards they had won and their philanthropic efforts.
Each breach of a suppression order can be punished with nearly A$500,000 for companies.

The penalty hearing continues on Thursday and is due to finish on Feb. 17.

605,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 11:51PM ET</span>",New Zealand Maori leader ejected from parliament for not wearing a necktie,"By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A New Zealand Maori leader who was ejected from parliament this week for refusing to wear a necktie in the chamber said forcing him to a Western dress code was a breach of his rights and an attempt to suppress indigenous culture.
On Tuesday, Speaker Trevor Mallard twice prevented Rawiri Waititi from asking questions in the debating chamber, insisting that MPs could only ask a question if they were wearing a tie.
When Waititi continued with his question after being stopped a second time, Mallard ordered him to leave.
""It's not about ties, it's about cultural identity, mate,"" Waititi said as he exited the chamber.
The New Zealand parliament is the most inclusive ever elected in the country. Nearly half of the 120 seats in parliament are held by women.
It has a 11% LGBTQI representation and 21% Maori representation. The parliament saw its first MP of African origin and of Sri Lankan origin after the election last October. 
Waititi, who has called ties ""a colonial noose,"" was told last year that he would be ejected from the House if he did not wear one. On Tuesday he wore a taonga, a Maori greenstone pendant, instead. 
Mallard said on Tuesday that while ties were outdated in his view, an overwhelming majority of members asked that the rule be retained in consultations on the issue in the last few months.
Writing in the New Zealand Herald on Wednesday, Waititi said his action was not about ties, but about the right of Māori to be Māori, whether in Parliament or in the pub.
""I took off the colonial tie as a sign that it continued to colonise, to choke and to suppress out Māori rights that Mallard suggests gives us all equality,"" Waititi said.
""This is about more than just the tie or the taonga, this has everything to do with equality.""
Asked to comment, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said that it was not something she had a strong opinion on, and that she had no objection to someone wearing a tie in parliament or not. 

""There are much more important issues for all of us,"" Ardern said.

Fresh political turmoil engulfed the volatile Caribbean nation this weekend after Moise alleged there was an attempt to overthrow the government and 23 people were arrested, including a Supreme Court judge and a senior police official.
The detained judge was one of three Supreme Court justices who the opposition approached as possible candidates to be interim leaders of a transitional government to take over from Moise until elections are held.
On Monday, the government issued an executive decree ordering the three judges to be retired from the court.
The U.S. Embassy in Port-Au-Prince said in a statement that it had seen the executive order about the judges.
""We are deeply concerned about any actions that risk damaging Haiti's democratic institutions. The Executive Order is now being scrutinized to determine whether it conforms to Haiti's constitutions and laws,"" the embassy said.
Haiti's opposition claims Moise should step down as his five-year term in office expired on Feb. 7 following 2015 elections, which were disputed and the result cancelled by the electoral counsel.
Moise rejects those claims, pointing out he took power in February 2017 after winning fresh elections in 2016 and has pledged to step down next year.
Washington last week appeared to back Moise's timeline, with a State Department spokesperson saying a new leader should replace Moise in February 2022.
The U.S. Embassy said ""all political actors should focus on restoring to the Haiti people the right to choose their lawmakers by organizing overdue legislative elections as soon as technically feasible and presidential elections soon after"".

The opposition accused Moise of violating the constitution as his government failed to hold legislative elections in 2019, leaving the parliament without lawmakers and allowing the president to rule by decree since January 2020.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy's top admiral on Tuesday condemned two new racist incidents involving hate symbols on warships, which sources said included a noose that was left on a Black sailor's bed.
The incidents, which occurred in recent weeks, underscore deep concerns about racism in the ranks. The cases come as Pentagon leaders face growing pressure to show progress in combating extremism after current and former military servicemembers were found to have participated in the siege of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
In one case being investigated by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), hate speech graffiti was discovered in a bathroom aboard the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier. NCIS is also investigating the noose incident aboard the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain. Two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed the details.
While he did not give details of the incidents, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Mike Gilday cautioned in a message to the fleet on Tuesday that racial divisions in the ranks cut at the military's ability to protect the country.
""If we must first question the intentions of our shipmate standing the watch with us, now, and especially, when taking fire, we will fail when the Nation needs us must in combat,"" Gilday said.
Gilday's message came days after Lloyd Austin, the first Black defense secretary, ordered military-wide standdowns, pausing regular activity, to address white nationalism and other extremism. 
Gilday acknowledged that addressing extremism is a leadership issue, adding ""we will own this.""""Some sailors may think their voices do not matter right now, or feel frustrated seeking to be seen and be heard. But let me be clear, each of your voices matter,"" Gilday said.'
""This standdown is another in our efforts to listen, to learn, and to improve.""

Reuters was first to report last month that nearly a third of Black U.S. military servicemembers reported experiencing racial discrimination, harassment or both during a 12-month period, according to results of a long-withheld Defense Department survey.

608,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 08:16PM ET</span>","For Hong Kongers, Canada is beaten path out of China’s grip","By Sarah Wu
TORONTO (Reuters) - A second generation of Hong Kongers is heading to Canada for refuge from political uncertainty, but unlike their parents in the 1980s and 1990s, this time seems for good.
Cities such as Vancouver and Toronto are a magnet for those looking to escape as China tightens its grip on the territory of 7.5 million people. Some 300,000 already have Canadian citizenship after many families initially moved there ahead of Hong Kong's return from British to Chinese rule in 1997. 
Back then, many families separated, with one parent staying in Hong Kong for work, usually fathers who were dubbed ""astronauts"" as they soared through the sky on visits. Among those who went to Canada, many eventually returned, lured by the booming economy and what still seemed to be a relatively free environment.
Things have changed.
With recent pro-democracy protests virtually snuffed out and Beijing enshrining control last year via a national security law, bags are being packed once more.
""Staying in Hong Kong is not an option anymore,"" said Maria Law, 39, who moved to Vancouver last year with her two girls ahead of her husband. ""I'd rather have a free future for my daughters instead of making money while they have to keep their mouths shut.""
For Law, a former flight attendant, history has repeated itself.
She is part of a rare cohort of double political emigres.
Taken to Vancouver when she was 12, Law remembers daily speakerphone calls from the living room with her father, who was earning the family bread as a hotel chef back in Hong Kong.
Enthusiasm for the calls waned as it became clear he was staying. Yet like many such ""satellite"" children, separated from one or both parents, Law eventually followed in her father's footsteps to return to Hong Kong herself for work in 2004. 
""When I was young, I asked my father why I had to move. But now I am in his position, I understand,"" she said. ""He sacrificed more than we did. He's the one who had to be alone.""
LEARNING FROM MISTAKES
Thanks to Canada's liberal immigration system, 335,646 Hong Kongers moved there between 1984 when Britain's handover was declared and 1997, according to the Canadian International Council think tank. That was most of the half-million exodus.
This time, Britain may take most Hong Kongers as it offers visas to potentially 300,000 people.
The flow to Canada may also be large, with existing Canadian passport-holders in Hong Kong from the first wave and new immigration pathways for the younger generation.
A Hong Kong government spokesman said concerns about erosion of freedoms were ""totally unsubstantiated"" and that the security law had stopped chaos. ""People's decisions to remain in or leave Hong Kong, or anywhere for that matter, are based on many factors including job situation, schooling, business and investment opportunities or personal/family reasons,"" he added.
China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and the Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing's top representative body, did not respond to requests for comment.
The scars of the first uprooting are informing the second. 
""I'm not going to make the same mistakes as my parents, like having a satellite family,"" said Tsang, a 36-year-old legal compliance officer who did not want to give her first name because she was yet to resign from work in Hong Kong. 
Her parents' marriage did not survive separation, but Tsang hopes to do better. Her daughter and husband move to Vancouver this month and she is to join them after selling their home.
In Law's case, she is eagerly waiting for her husband, for whom it is a wrench to leave his wider family and career as a university IT officer, to rejoin the family in Vancouver.
In October, she gave him the sponsorship paperwork and urged him not to miss their girls' growing up. To her relief, he returned the forms on Jan. 1. While he waits to travel, he watches his younger daughter's growth spurt via a screen and waits for both girls to say hello before he sleeps. 
It is hard to track exactly how many Hong Kongers are moving to Canada as so many can travel freely between the two. 
New visa applications from Hong Kong rose more than 20% to 10,819 in 2020, Canadian immigration says.
The Hong Kong government did not have data, but the Security Bureau estimated 7,000 people may have emigrated in 2019, 1,300 to Canada. However, that methodology is based only on applications for documents showing no criminal records, which many departing Hong Kongers do not in fact request.
BUNS AND NEWSPAPERS FROM HOME
Social media posts about paperwork, schools, real estate and jobs abound for Hong Kongers returning to Canada. 
One frequently-asked-questions group by the ""Return Vancouver"" Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page has 5,800 members.
Miu Chung Yan, a University of British Columbia professor of social work, and himself from Hong Kong, said those returning to Canada were often giving up better-paying jobs at home but had long known they would return for children's education or retirement.
Violent scenes of blazing streets and protesters clashing with police in 2019, plus China's subsequent response, hastened their decision-making. 
Pre-handover immigrants created ethnic enclaves with strip malls featuring Hong Kong-style cafes, Cantonese-speaking dentists and Chinese supermarkets.
In Richmond, a Vancouver suburb, 21.9% of residents counted Cantonese as their first language, followed by 20% for Mandarin, the main language in the rest of China, in a 2016 census.
In Markham, just north of Toronto, the vast Pacific Mall shares the same name as Hong Kong's centrally-located Pacific Place shopping centre. 
Pacific Mall's corridors bear the names of major arteries in Hong Kong, such as Hollywood Road or Hennessy Road.
In nearby plazas, those nostalgic for Hong Kong fare can pick up warm pineapple buns with a cold slab of butter and Chinese-language newspapers Sing Tao and Ming Pao.
Jason, who plans to move back to Canada with his wife and nine-year-old twins, acknowledges he is ""a little bit confused"" about his identity.
His father moved to Hong Kong during Mao Zedong's rule after four of 10 siblings starved to death in mainland China, he said. His parents sent him to high school in Canada in 1993 at 13. 
But in 2001, his father's construction company was struggling and he had to drop out of college to return to Hong Kong, where he later became a furniture salesman.
Over the years he noticed Hong Kong transforming: the luxury flats he fitted were increasingly owned by mainland Chinese. Mandarin became the more common language with customers in the famous IFC and ICC commercial towers. 

""It's kind of sad,"" said Jason, who did not give his full name as he is yet to tell his twins about leaving. ""Every time I have a gathering with friends or chit-chat with colleagues, the only topic is 'where are you going to live'?""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the paths for his ruling Workers' Party to take with South Korea and external affairs, state media KCNA said on Wednesday.
Kim called last month for more advanced nuclear weapons and said the United States was ""our biggest enemy,"" presenting a stark challenge to U.S. President Joe Biden just days before he took office.
Kim, who cemented his power at January's party congress with his election as general secretary, further discussed Pyongyang's five-year policy plan on the second day of the plenary meeting on Tuesday. 
""The General Secretary in the report evinced the militant tasks to be carried out by the People's Army and the munitions industry this year,"" KCNA reported, ""and the direction of future action to be taken by the sector in charge of affairs with South Korea and the sector in charge of external affairs, before underscoring the need to thoroughly carry them out without fail."" 
While raising the issue of reshaping relations with South Korea ""as required by the prevailing situation and the changed times"", Kim has criticised Seoul for offering cooperation in ""non-fundamental"" areas such as COVID-19 aid and tourism and said it should stop buying arms from and conducting military drills with the United States.
South Korea's new foreign minister said on Tuesday he was confident about coordinating North Korea policy with the United States despite earlier signs of differences.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said last month that Biden should hold talks with North Korea to build on progress that former President Donald Trump made with Kim.
Kim's unprecedented personal meetings with Trump failed to lead to a breakthrough in denuclearisation talks or a loosening of sanctions.

KCNA did not provide further details of the meeting, but said the meeting would continue at least until a third day.

The 12 senators, led by Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bob Menendez, said the bill was a response to a draconian national security law introduced by China in Hong Kong last year that was the focus of mass street protests.
The Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act would make ""Hong Kongers who participated peacefully in the protest movement and have a well-founded fear of persecution"" eligible for processing as refugees in Hong Kong or a third country.
Refugees from Hong Kong would not be subject to a numerical limitation, a statement from the senators said.
The proposed law would also make it easier for dissidents to seek asylum by waiving provisions that make suspected intent to immigrate or a criminal record disqualifying factors for non-immigrant visas.
Additionally, it would make Hong Kongers who have their residency revoked eligible for refugee status as victims of political persecution.
""The U.S. must do all it can to assist those Hong Kongers who have courageously stood up to defend the city they love from the CCP’s persecution and open our doors to them,"" Rubio said.
Menendez said the aim was ""to reiterate to the Chinese Communist Party that the United States stands foursquare with the people of Hong Kong"" and to show they would not ""fall through the cracks of our broken immigration system... .""
The bill was reintroduced because a previous version expired when a new Senate was seated last month.
The new Biden administration's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said the United States should accept people fleeing the Hong Kong crackdown. 

""If they're the victims of repression from Chinese authorities, we should do something to give them haven,"" he told NBC news late last month.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's political parties on the left and right enthused at the prospect of backing a Mario Draghi government after meeting the prime minister-designate on Tuesday as he wrapped up his second round of consultations.
Draghi, 73, a former head of the European Central Bank, was expected to report back to Italy's head of state and propose his list of cabinet ministers by Thursday.
However, late on Tuesday the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, the largest group in parliament, postponed an online ballot of its members which was due to take place over the next two days to decide the party's stance.
It remains unclear whether the postponement will also push back the formation of Draghi's government.
While most of 5-Star's top brass is keen to back Draghi, many of its rank and file as well as some of its lawmakers are reluctant to get behind a former ECB chief.
""Let's wait a minute, until he (Draghi) has got his ideas clear,"" the movement's founder, former comedian Beppe Grillo, said in a video on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Shortly afterwards, 5-Star leader Vito Crimi said in a television interview that the party was ""taking a little time"" to get a get a clearer picture of Draghi's programme. Neither Grillo nor Crimi said when the online vote would now take place.
Earlier in the day, Crimi said after meeting Draghi that he had received important reassurances over his intentions on welfare policy and the transition to renewable energy, two priorities dear to the party.
Draghi also gave no suggestion he planned to apply for a loan from the euro zone's bailout fund, something 5-Star staunchly opposes, Crimi said after the last of Draghi's meetings with all the groups in parliament.
Previously, Draghi had secured the virtually unconditional backing of the right-wing League, the centre-left Democratic Party and the conservative Forza Italia led by the 84-year-old, four-time former premier Silvio Berlusconi.
All the party chiefs said they were pleased with Draghi's ideas on how to stimulate economic growth, safeguard the environment and tackle the coronavirus crisis.
""We are all required to give up calculations, tactics and electoral interests to put the salvation of the country first,"" Berlusconi told reporters.
While there seems no doubt that Draghi will get a majority, he faces a tough task putting together cabinet team and policy programme to please the long-time bitter political enemies that are now queuing up to join his coalition.
The parties said after their meetings that there had been no discussion of ministerial posts.
Draghi could either fill his cabinet with non-partisan technocrats, or pick representatives of each party to be more sure of their support when tough policy decisions crop up. Many commentators expect a mix of technocrats and politicians.

Political sources told Reuters that among the favourites for the key post of economy minister are Daniele Franco, currently the number two at the Bank of Italy, and Dario Scannapieco, vice president of the European Investment Bank.

(Reuters) - An elderly gunman opened fire inside a Minneapolis-area health clinic on Tuesday, wounding five people before police arrested the suspect, described by authorities as a disgruntled former patient who was well known to local law enforcement.
The suspect, identified as Gregory Paul Ulrich, 67, was taken into custody after the violence, which local media reported also involved an explosion inside the Allina Clinic in Buffalo, Minnesota, about 35 miles (55 km) northwest of Minneapolis.
Buffalo Police Chief Pat Budke told reporters hours later that he was unsure whether reports of an explosion were accurate, saying: ""There may have been one prior to our going into the facility, but I can't confirm.""
Bomb squad investigators called to the scene were examining a suspicious package found in the corner of the clinic's lobby, and additional ""suspicious devices"" were found at a nearby motel where Ulrich had been staying, said Wright County Sheriff Sean Deringer.
The sheriff cited records of ""calls for service"" relating to the suspect dating back to 2003, adding, ""he's no stranger to law enforcement.""
Based on known background, Budke said, investigators believe the gunman, a longtime Buffalo resident, acted alone and singled out the clinic over a personal grudge against the facility or its staff.
""The history we have as a department with this individual makes it most likely that this incident was targeted at this facility or at someone at this facility,"" Budke said, referring to an unspecified past ""conflict"" the suspect had with the clinic and ""those who had treated him or attempted to treat him at the facility.""
Five people wounded by gunfire were transported to area hospitals, Allina Health executive Kelly Spratt said at the news conference. Spratt declined to say whether the victims were clinic patients or staff. Their conditions were not immediately known, Spratt said.
Earlier, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz told a separate briefing he understood that ""improvised explosive devices"" were involved but did not say whether any had been detonated. 
The Minneapolis Star Tribune, citing an emergency dispatch audio, reported that a bomb exploded in the clinic about 30 minutes after the shooting.
Live footage broadcast from the scene by Minneapolis television station KMSP-TV showed several windows at the front of the clinic had been shattered, and an empty wheelchair left on the sidewalk near the entrance.
Walz said the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, were assisting in the probe of the incident.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's administration plans to continue to seek to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange from the United Kingdom to the United States to face hacking conspiracy charges, the U.S. Justice Department said.
Justice Department spokesman Marc Raimondi on Tuesday said the U.S. government will continue to challenge a British judge's ruling last month that Assange should not be extradited to the United States because of the risk he would commit suicide.
In a Jan. 4 ruling, the judge, Vanessa Baraitser, said, ""I find that the mental condition of Mr. Assange is such that it would be oppressive to extradite him to the United States of America.""
The British judge set Friday as a deadline for the United States to appeal her ruling forbidding Assange's extradition. 
Raimondi said the United States will challenge Baraitser's ruling. ""We continue to seek his extradition.""
WikiLeaks drew fury from the U.S. government after publishing thousands of pages of once-secret reports and documents generated by American military and intelligence agencies, including detailed descriptions of CIA hacking capabilities. WikiLeaks also published emails hacked from Democrat Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign and a key adviser, which Clinton and some of her supporters say was a factor in her election defeat to Republican Donald Trump.
Debate over possible American moves to seek Assange's extradition from Britain first arose nearly a decade ago when Barack Obama served as president and Joe Biden as his vice president. 
Obama's Justice Department decided not to seek Assange's extradition on the grounds that what Assange and WikiLeaks did was too similar to journalistic activities protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.
Trump administration officials stepped up public criticism of Assange and WikiLeaks only weeks after taking office in January 2017 and subsequently filed a series of increasingly harsh criminal charges accusing Assange of participating in a hacking conspiracy.

Assange supporters have been pressing the Biden administration to drop charges against him during Biden's first 100 days in the White House.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - China poses a serious strategic threat to Canada, both through attempts to steal secrets and a campaign to intimidate the Chinese community, the head of Canada's spy agency said on Tuesday in a rare public appearance.
The remarks by Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) Director David Vigneault mark the second time in a few months that Ottawa - mired in a broad diplomatic and trade dispute with Beijing - has identified China as a problem actor.
Vigneault told an online forum that hostile activity by state actors seeking among other things to purloin business secrets and sensitive data ""represents a significant danger to Canada's prosperity and sovereignty"" and singled out China.
""The government of China ... is pursuing a strategy for geopolitical advantage on all fronts – economic, technological, political, and military – and using all elements of state power to carry out activities that are a direct threat to our national security and sovereignty,"" he said.
The biopharmaceutical and health, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, ocean technology and aerospace sectors were most at risk from state-sponsored hackers, he said.
China regularly denies it is trying to steal secrets.
Vigneault also said China had used its Operation Fox Hunt - a search for what Beijing says are corrupt officials and executives who have fled abroad with their assets - to routinely threaten and intimidate political opponents in Canada.
""These activities ... cross the line by attempting to
undermine our democratic processes or threaten our citizens in a covert and clandestine manner,"" he said.
Last November, the Communications Security Establishment signals intelligence agency identified state-sponsored programs in China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as major cyber crime threats for the first time.

The Chinese Embassy in Ottawa was not immediately available for comment.

615,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 03:25PM ET</span>",U.N. in talks with U.S. on Central American refugees applying for asylum from home,"By Oliver Griffin
BOGOTA (Reuters) - The United Nations Refugee Agency has held initial talks with U.S. President Joe Biden's administration about Central American asylum claimants being processed in their own countries, but it is too early to estimate how many people could benefit from the policy, agency head Filippo Grandi said on Tuesday. 
The Biden administration has already said it plans to restore a program which allows certain children in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to apply for refugee status in the United States from home.
""This is a complex situation,"" Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told Reuters in an interview as he wrapped up a visit to Colombia. ""It's very early days to come to conclusions or make comments because the work is in progress.""
Investment in migrants' home countries will be key to strengthening economies and security and diminishing incentives to leave, he said.
""We need to also... work very much with Mexico to strengthen its own capacity to deal with the movement (of migrants),"" Grandi said.
Thousands of Central Americans have attempted to travel north in recent months following back-to-back hurricanes in November which displaced more than 500,000 people, according to data from the International Organization for Migration.
Biden's government has suspended 2019 agreements with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador which sought to force asylum seekers to first seek refuge in those countries if they passed through them, before applying in the United States.
Grandi's Colombia visit was crowned by a Monday announcement that the country will allow Venezuelan migrants to seek temporary protective status for a 10-year period.
The new rules allow Venezuelans already in the country and those who arrive during the first two years of the scheme to apply for the status. 
The U.N. will up its efforts to help Colombia prepare for potential increases of Venezuelan immigrants, Grandi said. 
""We are certainly stepping up our operation,"" Grandi said. ""It's a variety of interventions that we're doing, but we're also helping the government at the legal and institutional level to strengthen this preparation.""
Colombia's migration agency estimated on Tuesday that as many as 2.5 million Venezuelans could benefit from temporary protection, including some 770,000 it projects may arrive over the next two years.

Of the more than 1.7 million Venezuelan immigrants currently in Colombia, over 50% lack legal status. Colombia has been the top destination for people fleeing economic and social collapse in neighboring Venezuela.

Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) said sports stars, musicians and their families had been targeted by the scam in which criminals gain access to their victim's phones or accounts.
This allowed them to steal money, bitcoin and personal information, as well as hack their victims' social media accounts to post content and messages, the NCA said.
The investigation, which involved the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), discovered a network operating in Britain. The British police said eight suspects, aged between 18 and 26, had been arrested in England and Scotland.
""This network targeted a large number of victims in the U.S. and regularly attacked those they believed would be lucrative targets, such as famous sports stars and musicians,"" said Paul Creffield, head of operations in the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit.
""As well as causing a lot of distress and disruption, we know they stole large sums from their victims, from either their bank accounts or bitcoin wallets.""
SIM-swapping involves cyber crooks taking control of a victim's phone number by essentially deactivating their SIM and switching the allocated number to a SIM belonging to one of the criminal gang.
The criminals then reset passwords on apps, giving them access to their victims contacts, banking details, emails and social media accounts.

GAZA (Reuters) - Rival Palestinian factions agreed on Tuesday on steps aimed at ensuring Palestinian elections are held as planned later this year and pledged to respect their results, a joint statement said.
No Palestinian elections have been conducted in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem for 15 years amid a deep rift between President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah nationalist group and the Hamas Islamist movement.
The two dominant factions - Fatah holds sway in the West Bank, and Hamas rules Gaza - convened on Monday for talks in Cairo to prepare for parliamentary elections on May 22 and a presidential vote on July 31.
A joint statement at the end of the two-day session said both groups and 12 other Palestinian factions, including the militant Islamic Jihad movement, pledged ""to abide by the timetable"" for balloting and ""respect and accept"" the results.
There has been widespread scepticism the elections will even happen.
Many Palestinians believe they are mainly an attempt by Abbas to show his democratic credentials to new U.S. President Joe Biden, with whom he wants to reset relations after they reached a new low under Donald Trump.
At the Cairo talks, the groups agreed on the formation of an ""election court"", with judges from the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, to rule in any election legal disputes, the statement said.
It said Fatah police would guard voting sites in the West Bank and Hamas police would deploy in Gaza, effectively freezing out more secretive security services whose presence might intimidate voters.
Fatah and Hamas also agreed to release detainees held on political grounds in the West Bank and Gaza and allow unrestricted campaigning.
Abbas, 85, announced in January the dates for the elections, and he is expected to run.

There are 2.8 million eligible voters in Gaza and the West Bank. The last ballot, in 2006, ended in a surprise win by Hamas in its first parliamentary elections. That set up a power struggle between Hamas in Gaza and Fatah in the West Bank.

618,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>",Factbox: What Biden is doing to bring more refugees into the U.S.,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is proposing to raise refugee admissions this year to 62,500 from the record-low 15,000 set by his predecessor Donald Trump.
U.S. State Department officials are expected to meet this week with key lawmakers in a formal consultation that is part of the process to set refugee levels, according to three people briefed on the meetings.
Here is Biden's plan, based on a proposal submitted to Congress and people familiar with it.
REGIONAL ALLOTMENTS
Biden will create spots for 22,000 refugees from Africa, 13,000 from South Asia, 6,000 from East Asia, 5,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 4,000 from Europe and Central Asia, according to the plan. Another 12,500 unallocated spots will also be available.
In Biden's proposal to Congress, he argues the expansion this year is needed in part to resettle refugees from more than a dozen nations whose humanitarian situation is worsening. The president's stance contrasts sharply with Trump's depiction of refugees as a security threat and economic burden.
Biden said on Feb. 4 that he intends to raise annual refugee admissions to 125,000 in the coming fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1, 2021.
Current refugee admissions slowed to a crawl amid Trump's restrictions and the coronavirus pandemic. 
From Oct. 1 to Feb. 5, the United States resettled only 1,501 refugees, according to State Department data shared with refugee groups.
REFUGEE POPULATIONS
Biden's plan specifically mentions the plight of refugees from more than a dozen countries, including Syria, where it says ""regime forces have forcibly displaced, raped, starved, and massacred civilians.""
Nearly 12,600 Syrian refugees were allowed into the United States during fiscal year 2016, the last full year under former President Barack Obama. Syrian admissions plunged under Trump to roughly 500 in fiscal year 2020.
Other refugee populations mentioned in Biden's proposal are those in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, Uighur  Muslims from China and residents of Hong Kong. In the Western Hemisphere, the plan cites refugees from Venezuela, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua, among other nations.
More broadly, Biden's proposal says that increased admissions could provide safety to refugees facing an increased threat of gender-based violence due to confinement and economic struggles during the coronavirus pandemic.
PRIVATE SPONSORSHIP PILOT
Biden intends to launch a pilot refugee program that would allow private sponsors to fund costs associated with resettlement in the United States, according to his proposal to Congress.
The pilot program will focus on refugees reuniting with relatives in the United States and would not be limited by nationality, the proposal said.
Some refugee advocates see the effort as a step toward a broader economic sponsorship program that could also include businesses, universities and charity groups.
REFUGEES FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN
Biden issued an executive order on Feb. 4 that aims to speed up refugee processing and remove barriers that blocked some applicants. 
The order called for a review of the Special Immigrant Visa (NYSE:V) program for refugees who aided U.S. interests in Iraq and Afghanistan to determine whether there have been ""undue delays"" for applicants.
The Trump administration carved out 4,000 spots for Iraqi refugees in its 2020 cap for admissions but only 537 were resettled in the fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2020.
CLIMATE CHANGE REFUGEES
Biden's order highlighted the role of climate change in the displacement of people around the world, calling on heads of several U.S. agencies to produce a report on the matter by early August. 
ROLLBACK OF TRUMP POLICIES
Biden's executive order rescinded several restrictive Trump policies, including a 2019 order that required U.S. states and localities to consent to receive refugees.
The rollback of that Trump policy will be partly symbolic since a Maryland-based federal judge blocked it nationwide more than a year ago, a decision that was upheld in January by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Biden also rescinded a Trump order that called for ""enhanced vetting"" of refugees and specifically targeted 11 countries. Ten of the 11 affected countries were in the Middle East and Africa.

619,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 01:05PM ET</span>",Spain to reform free speech laws after rapper ordered jailed,"By Emma Pinedo
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will ease its restrictions on free speech, the government said on Tuesday, in response to a nationwide furore over a rapper ordered jailed over a song and tweets.
A change in the law would not by itself prevent the jailing of Pablo Hasel, who has been ordered to surrender by the end of this week to serve a nine-month prison sentence imposed in 2018 under a security law known in Spain as the ""gag law"". He has said he will not turn himself in.
Hasel's lyrics and tweets, which included references to banned guerrilla groups, compared a court to Nazis and called former king Juan Carlos a mafia capo, were found under the 2015 law to have encouraged violence and insulted the monarchy.
More than 200 artists, including film director Pedro Almodovar, actor Javier Bardem and singer Joan Manuel Serrat, have signed a petition against Hasel's jailing, calling for the law to be changed. Hasel's supporters have demonstrated demanding he not be jailed.
Government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said that in response to the Hasel case, the government had ""expressed its willingness to provide a much more secure framework for freedom of expression"". The reform was in its early stages, she said.
In a statement, the leftist coalition government said the reform would introduce milder penalties rather than prison, and target only actions that ""clearly involve the creation of a risk to public order or provoke some kind of violent conduct"".
Hasel, who is known for his radical leftist views and whose real name is Pablo Rivadulla, said in a tweet the government was doing nothing to prevent his imprisonment.
""With empty declarations like so many other false promises, they want to extinguish solidarity,"" he wrote.
The 2015 law was enacted by a previous, rightwing government, which said it was needed to prevent the glorification of banned armed groups such as the Basque separatists ETA. It bans speech not only for glorifying violence, but also for insulting religions or the monarchy.
Opponents say it has been applied far too restrictively, imposing criminal penalties on legitimate criticism of the state. Amnesty International says around 70 people were convicted under the law in 2018 and 2019.
Another rapper fled to Belgium in 2018 after being sentenced to 3-1/2 years in prison on charges including insulting the monarchy and praising terrorist groups. 
The artists' petition likened Spain to countries such as Turkey or Morocco, where artists have been jailed. 

""The imprisonment of Pablo Hasel makes even more evident the Sword of Damocles hanging over the heads of all public figures who dare to publicly criticise the actions of any of the state institutions,"" it said.

""We cannot stay locked down all our lives,"" the mayor, Louis Aliot, said inside Perpignan's Rigaud museum, where, for the first time in months, members of the public were admiring artwork including a portrait of Marie Antoinette, the queen executed by guillotine in the French Revolution.
The French government has forbidden restaurants, museums, cinemas and theatres from opening to the public as it tries to contain the new coronavirus, which has contributed to the deaths of more than 79,000 people in France since the pandemic began.
But there is growing impatience from businesses forced to close, and from right-wing politicians, for President Emmanuel Macron to ease the restrictions.
The Perpignan mayor is an ally of Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Rally party who, opinion polls indicate, will be Macron's main challenger in the presidential election scheduled for next year.
Responding to Aliot's decision to reopen the museums, the representative of the French interior ministry in Perpignan applied to a court for an order forcing them to close again. A decision from the court is pending.
At the Rigaud museum, visitors perusing the collection of portraits of French queens described the opportunity to walk around a museum again as a breath of fresh air.
""We've been deprived too much, too frustrated by the lack of pleasure, culture, lack of joie-de-vivre,"" said one visitor, a pensioner who gave her name as Francoise. ""So here we are.""

The workers were among 197 people who officials said were still unaccounted for as the death toll from the disaster - which also broke apart bridges, cut off villages and scarred tracts of mountain landscape - rose to 28.
Packing rocks, dirt and construction debris and thought to have been triggered when a glacier lake fed by India's second highest peak, Nanda Devi, collapsed, the flood swept down the Dhauliganga river on Sunday.
Officials said most of those still missing were shift workers at either the Tapovan Vishnugad hydroelectric project, where the tunnel was situated, or at Rishiganga, a smaller dam which was swept away in the flood.
Soldiers using bulldozers had cleared away rocks at the mouth of the 2.5-km (1.5-mile) tunnel, and video posted by the Indo-Tibetan border police service showed rescuers checking the water level deeper inside.
Rescuers hoped to open the tunnel up by Tuesday afternoon, said Ashok Kumar, director general of police in Uttarakhand state, where the flash flood occurred. 
Officials said thermal imaging equipment had also been deployed to help locate would-be survivors, and Uttarakhand's chief minister, Trivendra Singh Rawat, said 28 bodies had been recovered so far.
Thirteen villages had been cut off by the floodwaters were being resupplied from the air, Home Minister Amit Shah told parliament. 
A government official said many locals had apparently managed to escape the waters by fleeing to higher ground as soon as they heard the rumble of the water racing down the valley. 
""The workers in the tunnel may not have heard anything and got stuck,"" the official said.
The 520 MW Tapovan project, being built by state firm NTPC, is one of many run-of-river projects being developed to upgrade Uttarakhand's power network.
Officials have yet to conclusively determine what caused the disaster, though scientists investigating it believe heavy snowfall followed by bright sunshine combined with a rise in temperatures may have triggered the glacier's collapse.

A clearer picture of the circumstances is expected to emerge later this week, officials said.

626,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 12:21PM ET</span>","Four years into voyage and metres from land, tanker crew still stuck aboard","DUBAI (Reuters) - Nearly four years into their odyssey at sea, the five-member crew of oil tanker MT Iba is tantalisingly close to shore, yet still unable to set foot on dry land.
Bleary-eyed and wearing tattered clothes, the men are exhausted from an ordeal that has kept them from their families and aboard the 5,000-tonne vessel long after its owner abandoned it in the Gulf.
What started out as a regular seafaring job turned into what the men call a nightmare, when the tanker's owner, Alco Shipping, fell into financial trouble and stopped paying their salaries 32 months ago.
The crew was left to fend for itself, relying on donations from charities they contacted for food and hygiene supplies.
The tanker ran aground in Umm Al Quwain, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, in late January, after rough seas severed both of its anchors and pushed it to shore. 
Life aboard the ship has been arduous, said Indian engineer Vinay Kumar.
""We've seen hell during this voyage,"" Kumar told Reuters during a recent visit aboard the battered ship. ""We are like slaves ... We're begging for food.""
Alco Shipping did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Mission to Seafarers, a charity which offers emergency assistance and support to sailors, has been providing regular food aid and checking on the sailors' wellbeing since their ship was first abandoned.
The crew is collectively owed around $230,000, said the charity's regional director Andy Bowerman, who is helping mediate negotiations between the sailors and Alco Shipping.
Bowerman said the company had just offered to settle with the sailors for $150,000, although it is not clear if the crew will accept the lower sum.
Bowerman said if they did not accept the offer, they would remain on board until a resolution was reached, as the vessel provided their only leverage against the company.
Maritime laws also mean that if they abandon the ship, they could be detained and held responsible.
For Nay Win, an engineer from Myanmar, there is an added complication: his passport, still in the company's possession, expired while he has been at sea. And with the recent military coup at home, he is unsure how to get a new one.

""For 43 months how would you feel?"" said Pakistani engineer Riasat Ali. ""It's like we are staying in jail - they are not giving a salary nor sending us home.""

627,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 12:15PM ET</span>","'Merciless' Russia may face new sanctions, EU says","By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's top diplomat warned Moscow on Tuesday it could face new sanctions over the jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, describing the government of President Vladimir Putin as ""merciless"", authoritarian and afraid of democracy.
Josep Borrell said his visit last Friday to Moscow had cemented his view that Russia wanted to break away from Europe and divide the West, in a speech marking the EU's harshest criticism of Moscow since Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
""The Russian government is going down a worrisome authoritarian route,"" said Borrell, who pleaded for Navalny's release in Moscow and sought in vain to visit him in prison. 
""There seems to be almost no room for the development of democratic alternatives ... they are merciless in stifling any such attempts,"" he told the European Parliament, saying that he believed the Kremlin saw democracy as an ""existential threat"".
Borrell's remarks suggested a hardening of EU attitudes to Russia, a big energy provider to Europe, after years of seeking better ties despite Western sanctions imposed in 2014.
""Russia seeks to divide us,"" Borrell said.
Navalny was arrested in January after returning to Russia for the first time since being poisoned last August in Siberia with what many Western countries said was a nerve agent.
Navalny blamed Putin for the attack but the Kremlin has dismissed the accusations and questioned whether the opposition politician was really poisoned. His arrest and imprisonment has caused big protests in Russia. 
During Borrell's talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, which Borrell described as heated, Moscow expelled three EU diplomats from Germany, Poland and Sweden, provoking tit-for-tat expulsions by Berlin, Warsaw and Stockholm. 
Borrell said he only learned about the expulsions from Russia via social media during his visit, which included a news conference in which Lavrov chided the EU as ""an unreliable partner"". 
Many EU lawmakers said the Kremlin wanted to try to humiliate Borrell on Friday in Moscow to send a message that the West should stay out of Russian domestic affairs. At least 81 deputies have called for Borrell's resignation.
Borrell said targeted sanctions were now an option for Russia, but it was up to EU states to decide. ""Yes, this includes sanctions,"" Borrell said of next policy steps. 
SANCTION TARGETS
Two allies of Navalny have urged Western envoys to impose sanctions on senior Russian business and political figures, judges and security chiefs, Western diplomats said on Tuesday.
The appeal for sanctions by Vladimir Ashurkov and Leonid Volkov during a video call on Monday was denounced by Moscow on Tuesday as treachery.
Ashurkov and Volkov joined the video call with European Union states and envoys from Britain, the United States, Canada and Ukraine to propose names of senior figures in business, political and security circles who could face sanctions, according to two Western diplomats who were on the call.
The two Western diplomats declined to disclose names, but said Volkov and Ashurkov told the call that sanctions should target the assets and freedom to travel of those affected. The aim would be to weaken those who have amassed fortunes and influence while ordinary Russians struggle to make ends meet.

RIA news agency quoted Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova as saying Navalny's allies had received instructions on how to disrupt Russian politics during Monday's video call. She described members of Navalny's Anti-corruption Foundation as ""agents of influence"" acting on behalf of the NATO military alliance.

628,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 11:15AM ET</span>",Polish court orders historians to apologise over Holocaust book,"By Alan Charlish and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk
WARSAW (Reuters) - A Warsaw court ruled on Tuesday that two historians tarnished the memory of a Polish villager in a book about the Holocaust and must apologise, in a case some academics warn could deter impartial research into Poles' actions during World War Two.
More than seven decades on, the conflict remains a live political issue in Poland, where the ruling nationalists say studies showing complicity by some Poles in the killing of Jews by Nazi Germany are an attempt to dishonour a country that suffered immensely in the conflict.
The court ruled that Barbara Engelking and Jan Grabowski, editors of the two-volume work ""Night without an end. Fate of Jews in selected counties of occupied Poland"", must apologise for saying Edward Malinowski gave up Jews to the Nazi Germans.
But it stopped short of ordering them to pay compensation.
""The court's ruling must not have a cooling effect on academic research. In the opinion of the court the demanded sum of 100,000 zlotys ($27,017) would constitute such a factor,"" said judge Ewa Jonczyk.
Polish academics and Jewish organisations such as Israel's Yad Vashem had expressed concern that the trial may undermine freedom of research, and Engelking said the case aimed to have such an effect.
""There is no doubt this is some sort of an effort to create a freezing effect, to show academics that there are issues on which it is not worth focusing on,"" she said.
The World Jewish Congress said in a statement it was ""dismayed"" by the ruling.
Engelking and Grabowski plan to appeal Tuesday's verdict.
BATTLE OVER THE PAST
The case had been brought by Malinowski's 81-year-old niece, Filomena Leszczynska, and funded by the Polish League Against Defamation, which opposes claims of Polish involvement in the murder of Jews.
Leszczynska's lawyer, Monika Brzozowska-Pasieka, argued that Engelking and Grabowski failed to follow correct research methodology when compiling the book, an accusation Grabowski denied.
""Filomena is extremely pleased with this verdict,"" Brzozowska-Pasieka said after the trial. ""The question of compensation from the beginning was a secondary issue.""
Almost all of Poland's 3.2 million Jews are understood to have died during more than five years of Nazi rule, accounting for around half the Jews estimated to have been killed in the Holocaust. A further 3 million non-Jewish citizens also died under Poland's Nazi occupation.
A significant body of research suggests that, while thousands of Poles risked their lives to help Jews, thousands also participated in the Holocaust. Many Poles do not accept such findings.
In 2018, an international backlash forced the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party to drop a law that would have made it a crime to suggest Poland bore any responsibility for Nazi atrocities. 
Grabowski told Reuters before Tuesday's ruling that the case covered similar ground to the proposed law by attempting to establish offence to national dignity as grounds for suing over any such claims in the future.
Brzozowska-Pasieka denied the case aimed to introduce new avenues for litigation, but simply sought to protect her client's personal rights.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 10:16AM ET</span>",'Rude and insolent': fraught talks preceded Myanmar's army seizing power,"By Poppy McPherson
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Late on Jan. 28, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi destroyed her phone to prevent it falling into the hands of the military, according to two people close to her. Some of her friends and colleagues started to pack their bags, either preparing to flee or in expectation of being arrested.
Talks had been held that day in the capital Naypyitaw between representatives of Suu Kyi and army leader Senior General Min Aung Hlaing over the legitimacy of Suu Kyi’s party’s sweeping victory in November’s general election. The meeting had ended badly, with no agreement.
Reuters spoke to nine people, including government advisers and others who worked closely with Suu Kyi, to reconstruct the events that led to her arrest and the toppling of her civilian government by the military on Feb. 1. The people spoke on condition of anonymity; the army has been jailing opponents of the coup. Most of the details have not previously been reported. 
The coup ended a brief, decade-long experiment in democracy in the Southeast Asian nation of 53 million, shattering hopes that it would emerge from more than half a century of military rule that kept the country isolated and impoverished. It is the latest example of democracy in retreat in Asia, as Thailand’s military-backed monarchy resists calls for change and China is stamping out dissent in Hong Kong. 
Jan. 28 was the low point of several days of fraught discussions between the two sides, according to two people with knowledge of the talks. The army’s two representatives twice demanded a response from Suu Kyi’s representatives to the army’s request to examine the results of the election, according to the people familiar with the talks.  
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi, whose five years in power ended half a century of rule directly by the military or by governments backed by it, stood firm against the army’s demand, the people said.
During the talks, Min Aung Hlaing’s representatives rebuked the civilian government side, saying “you people are going too far, rude and insolent,” according to a person briefed on the matter. From the head of the army, it was a jarring admonishment in a formal setting. 
Another two people briefed on the talks told Reuters that the army's representatives said the military was insulted.
After the meeting Kyaw Tint Swe, Suu Kyi’s right-hand man and one of her representatives in the talks, appeared shaken, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. Kyaw Tint Swe could not be contacted for comment by Reuters. 
“The civilian government couldn’t do anything,” said one of the people with knowledge of the failed talks. “They have no armed forces, they have no power.”
Neither Suu Kyi nor the army could be reached for comment. Army chief Min Aung Hlaing, now Myanmar’s de facto leader, could not be reached for comment. 
As talks were breaking down, armoured vehicles were already moving around Yangon, the commercial capital, and other cities across Myanmar. Hundreds of army supporters rallied outside the country’s holiest Buddhist site, Shwedagon Pagoda in downtown Yangon, threatening reporters who tried to interview them.
In Naypyitaw, the grandiose and sparsely populated capital built by army generals, trucks filled with raucous pro-army demonstrators drove through empty city streets.
On Jan. 30, the army quieted concerns it was on the verge of carrying out a coup by saying it would protect the constitution and act according to the law. The 2008 constitution, drafted by the military, enshrines democratic elections but allows the army to take power in a state of emergency. 
It was a hollow promise. At 3 a.m. the following Monday, Feb. 1, the army began sweeping up government ministers, lawmakers, writers, filmmakers, and activists. Later that morning, it announced a return to military rule.
Suu Kyi, one of the world’s most famous political prisoners during more than 15 years of house arrest, was once again imprisoned in her home. She was later charged with the obscure crime of illegally importing walkie-talkies.
Suu Kyi’s political party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), has said the charges the army pressed against her are politically motivated and has called for her release. On Feb. 1, the NLD issued a statement on behalf of Suu Kyi, protesting against the coup.  
“The actions of the military are actions to put the country back under a dictatorship,” said the statement, which carried Suu Kyi’s name but not her signature.
The following day, state media said Min Aung Hlaing told the first meeting of his new government that the army had to take power after its protests over alleged election fraud were ignored. Independent international poll watchers have said there were no major irregularities in the election. 
FRAUGHT TALKS
A succession of military and military-backed governments ruled Myanmar from 1962 to 2015, when Suu Kyi’s NLD won the first free and fair elections. Nevertheless, the army-drafted constitution assigns significant powers to the military, including control over the security forces and key ministries.
The build-up to this month’s military coup started on Nov. 8, when Suu Kyi’s NLD won more than 80% of contested seats in the general election, trouncing the army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party.
Before, during and after the election, the military cast doubts over the vote and made unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. In mid-January, Min Aung Hlaing called on the election commission to consider its complaint that as many as a third of the 30 million or so votes cast were potentially fraudulent. 
The election commission said it is investigating some errors in voter lists but the outcome would not be enough to change the result of the election. It has not publicly released the final list of eligible voters as the military has demanded. The military has said it wants to check the list to verify voters’ eligibility. Representatives of the election commission could not be reached for comment. 
Fears of a possible coup spiked on Jan. 26, when military spokesman Zaw Min Tun refused to rule it out. The following day, army chief Min Aung Hlaing said the constitution should be revoked if it was not observed. 
Suu Kyi, 75, and Min Aung Hlaing, a 64-year-old career army officer who was set to take compulsory retirement in July, had a testy relationship and had not spoken directly for months, according to one person close to Suu Kyi. 
Instead, representatives of each sat down in Naypyitaw for hurriedly arranged talks, six people said. There were also talks in Yangon, the former capital and Myanmar’s largest city, one of those people said. 
In Naypyitaw, Suu Kyi was represented by Kyaw Tint Swe, her right-hand man and formerly a stout defender of the military, according to six people with knowledge of the talks. In Yangon, Suu Kyi’s representative was her long-time friend and personal doctor Tin Myo Win, according to one of the people. Tin Myo Win could not be reached for comment. 
Senior army negotiator Lieutenant General Yar Pyae was one of the two military representatives in the Naypyitaw talks, two of the people said. Reuters could not determine the other. Yar Pyae could not be reached for comment. 
The talks, and other exchanges between the two sides, extended over at least four days, to Jan. 31, the people familiar with the talks said. 
The army representatives made at least three demands, according to three of the six people familiar with the talks: reschedule the Feb. 1 opening of parliament, disband the election commission, and re-examine the vote under military supervision. The army set a deadline of 5 p.m. on Jan. 29.
Reuters was not able to establish what, if any, terms were offered by Suu Kyi’s representatives to the military. An announcement in state media later on Jan. 29 said the opening of one of the two houses of parliament - scheduled for Feb. 1 - would be delayed by one day.
But even before the Jan. 29 afternoon deadline, it became clear that the talks were effectively over. The two sides’ representatives “could not establish good personal rapport,” said one of the people familiar with the talks. “We had a long period of misperception, mistrust, before everything started,” the person said, referring to the dispute over the election. The military and the NLD have been at loggerheads since the party was founded in the late 1980s.
Suu Kyi “seemed resolute” not to bend to the military, one person close to her told Reuters.  
Another person close to Suu Kyi said the military was trying to create a narrative that there was civil unrest and popular support for the military, “hence justify a takeover, in some twisted logic.”
Win Htein, one of Suu Kyi’s close aides and a senior member of the NLD, told Reuters by phone on Jan. 29 that his bags were packed and he was waiting to be arrested because he feared a coup was imminent. 
NO COMPROMISE
By Jan. 30, some of the tension eased after the army released its conciliatory statement vowing to protect the 2008 constitution. It accused the media of misinterpreting the comments made earlier in the week by Min Aung Hlaing. 
Suu Kyi is barred from the presidency by a clause the army put in the constitution stipulating that people with foreign relatives cannot serve. She has two British sons with her late British husband. As a result, she governed as state counselor, a position crafted for her that was equivalent to head of state. After her party won the election, she was due to appoint a president, as she did when her party won the last election in 2015. 
Some people close to the government expected Suu Kyi to appoint Min Aung Hlaing or one of his allies as president, as a compromise to keep the army onside.
“I think people were, myself included, expecting to see a slightly depressing line-up of presidential candidates, thinking that might be the place that both sides could find some common ground,” another adviser to the civilian government said.
The Jan. 29 deadline set by the military came and went without any agreement. On Jan. 30, the military said it would honor the constitution, but the next day, fears of a military takeover were rising again. 
Early on Jan. 31 there were sightings of troops moving through Naypyitaw. One of the people familiar with the talks told Reuters that on that day one of the government’s representatives in the talks told them negotiations had collapsed and warned of a coup.
The warning was accurate. Starting about 3 a.m., while most of Myanmar’s 53 million inhabitants slept, soldiers fanned out across the country to the homes of ministers, lawmakers, prominent activists and even Buddhist monks known for their opposition to the army. The targets were either arrested or forced to stay in their homes.
According to one person who worked with the former civilian government, soldiers turned up at telecommunications companies’ facilities to cut off access to the internet. By 3 a.m., the companies had lost about half of their connectivity to the internet, according to independent cybersecurity monitoring group NetBlocks. None of Myanmar’s four telecoms companies responded to requests for comment.  
The military could not be reached for comment on the internet outage.  

The time and date of the move, that person and two others suggested, may have been chosen on purpose by Myanmar’s numerology-obsessed generals. The digits of 3 a.m. on Feb. 1 – or 0300 on 2/1/21 – add up to nine. The number is traditionally considered auspicious in Myanmar.

The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo since the 1990s, has committed a succession of brutal reprisal attacks against civilians since the army began an operation against it in late 2019.
The group killed around 850 people last year, according to U.N. figures.
""So far a provisional assessment is of about ten people killed. It is attributed to the Islamist ADF fighters,"" said Rosette Kavula, deputy administrator of Beni territory.
An army spokesman confirmed the attack and said troops had been deployed to the area at the foot of the Rwenzori mountains on the border with Uganda.
The Kivu Security Tracker, a research initiative that maps unrest in the region, said suspected ADF fighters had killed 10 people in the village of Kabembeu, near Mwenda. 
It follows a similar massacre in the nearby village of Mabule on Friday night.
""The victims are all those who left the village Mwenda to hide in the mountains, but unfortunately the ADF pursued them,"" said Mbweki Juvenal, head of a civil rights group in Mwenda.
Islamic State has claimed responsibility for several suspected ADF attacks in the past, although U.N. experts have not found any direct link between the two groups.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A Hungarian opposition radio station lost an appeal against the removal of its licence on Tuesday, cutting by one the already dwindling ranks of media outlets critical of the country's nationalist government.
The media authority said in September it would not renew Klubradio's licence due to what it called a string of regulatory offences by the station during a seven-year licence term that expires on Sunday.
Klubradio, broadcasting for 19 years and whose political and talk show guests often criticise government policies, will be forced off the air then, after a Budapest court on Tuesday rejected its appeal against that decision.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's growing control over Hungary's media is one of several issues behind strong criticism from the European Union over what it considers the erosion of democratic standards within the country, criticism that his government rejects. 
Judge Regina Antal told the court the two offences committed by Klubradio meant ""the Media Council had no room to deliberate"" over whether to renew the licence.
The station has said it was twice late with filing reports on programming content, a mistake made by other broadcasters whose licenses had nevertheless been renewed.
The court's decision, which Klubradio board chairman Andras Arato said it would appeal, means it will be able to operate online only from Sunday. 
""The media space that is independent from the governing party continues to shrink significantly, and this (case) is another important step in that process,"" Agnes Urban, analyst at Mertek Media Monitor think-tank said. 
Under Orban, state-owned broadcasters have become little more than government mouthpieces, while several other media outlets have been shut or taken over in recent years by government-friendly owners. 

Orban had called for an increase in Hungarian ownership of the country's media and said last week this had increased to 55% from 34%.

The remarks made in a television interview are a rare suggestion that Iran might have an interest in nuclear weapons, which Western nations have accused Iran of pursuing.
Iranian officials have repeatedly dismissed this charge, citing a fatwa or religious decree issued in the early 2000s by the Islamic Republic's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that bans the development or use of nuclear arms.
The United States and the other Western powers which originally signed up to a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran appear to be at an impasse over which side should return to the accord first, making it unlikely U.S. sanctions that have crippled its economy can be quickly removed. 
""The Supreme Leader has explicitly said in his fatwa that nuclear weapons are against sharia law and the Islamic Republic sees them as religiously forbidden and does not pursue them,"" the minister, Mahmoud Alavi, told state TV. 
""But a cornered cat may behave differently from when the cat is free. And if they (Western states) push Iran in that direction, then it's no longer Iran's fault,"" Alavi said in the interview broadcast late on Monday.
Details from the interview were published by Iranian news websites on Tuesday. 
Iran has insisted its nuclear programme is to generate power and for other peaceful purposes. But U.S. intelligence agencies and the United Nations nuclear watchdog believe Iran once had a nuclear weapons programme that it halted. [L1N2JF0J2]
U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration is exploring ways to restore the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with major world powers but that was abandoned in 2018 by former President Donald Trump, who restored sanctions. Iran retaliated by breaching the terms of the accord in a step-by-step response.
Biden has said that, if Tehran returned to strict compliance with the pact, Washington would follow suit, using that as a springboard to a broader agreement that might restrict Iran's missile development and its regional activities.

Tehran has insisted that Washington must first ease sanctions before it resumes compliance. It has ruled out any negotiations on wider security issues.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Americans, who turned out in huge numbers at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rock star-like rallies in the United States, are divided over the direction India is headed, a new survey showed on Tuesday.
Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party has extolled the achievements of the Indian diaspora in America and elsewhere, seeing them as a large support base to advance India's interests in host countries.
But only 36% Indian Americans believe India is on the right track, while 39% think it is not, according to the survey of Indian Americans released by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Johns Hopkins-SAIS and the University of Pennsylvania.
One-fifth of the respondents did not have any opinion. The survey was conducted between Sept. 1 and Sept. 20, 2020, in partnership with the research and analytics firm YouGov.
""A significant minority of Indian Americans is concerned with political and social changes under way in India,"" the authors Sumitra Badrinathan, Devesh Kumar and Milan Vaishnav said in their assessment of the survey results.
Modi's government, which first came to office in 2014 promising to turn India into a political and economic power, has faced criticism of promoting a Hindu-first India and of trying to suppress dissent.
A massive months-long protest by farmers on the borders of the capital Delhi against free market reforms in agriculture has again thrust the Modi government into the international glare, with figures from pop star Rihanna to climate activist Greta Thunberg declaring their support for the growers.
The survey found that 18% of Indian Americans believed government corruption to be India's most pressing challenge, followed by 15% who listed the economy as their area of concern. Another 10% of respondents cited religious majoritarianism as the country's most important challenge.
Indian Americans are the second largest immigrant group in the United States, and many of them joined a boisterous ""Howdy Modi"" rally in Houston in 2019 also attended by then-U.S. president Donald Trump.

Despite their misgivings about where India was headed, 49% of the respondents gave a thumbs-up to Modi's performance as prime minister. The survey said that 32% disapproved of him, while the rest said they had no opinion.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - An ally of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny urged Russians on Tuesday to gather near their homes for a brief Valentine's Day protest, shining their mobile phone torches and lighting candles in heart shapes to flood social media. 
Tens of thousands have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest against the jailing of Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, who says he is being persecuted for political reasons.
Police have detained more than 11,000 people who have taken part in what they said were unsanctioned protests which the Kremlin has condemned as illegal and dangerous. 
Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally based outside Russia, called on people to gather in the residential courtyards near their homes at 1700 GMT on Sunday and to stand there for several minutes shining their mobile phone torches. 
He said the format, which is reminiscent of tactics used by the anti-government opposition in neighbouring Belarus, should help distance protesters from the police. 
He suggested people bring candles and make heart shapes with them to mark Valentine's Day, and photograph them from above in an event he said would last just 15 minutes.
Supporters, he said, could then flood social media with images of the protest. The idea for the candles was inspired by the heart sign Navalny made to his wife in court as he was jailed, Volkov said. 
""Thought you were the only one in the whole big block who is not indifferent to what's happening in the country? You'll see that's not the case,"" Volkov wrote in a post on the Telegram messenger. 
""No OMON (riot police), no fear. Maybe it'll seem like these 15 minutes will change nothing - but in fact they will change everything.""
""CAT AND MOUSE""
His announcement prompted the Russian foreign ministry to accuse Navalny's allies of acting as NATO agents and of receiving instructions from the military alliance to disrupt Russian politics. 
Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Volkov had planned to halt the protests, but had changed his mind after holding a virtual meeting on Monday with representatives of the European Union, Britain and the United States. 
""This is essentially a meeting of NATO countries. NATO has instructed the 'opposition', or rather its agents of influence, on how to continue their undermining work more deviously.""
The Kremlin said anyone who broke the law would be brought to account. 
""We're not going to play cat and mouse with anyone, but there's no doubt our law enforcement agencies will hold the guilty parties to account if the law is broken,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. 
Navalny was arrested in January after returning to Russia for the first time since being poisoned last August in Siberia with what many Western countries said was a nerve agent. The Kremlin has questioned whether he was really poisoned. 
He was jailed on Feb. 2 after a court ruled he had violated the terms of a suspended sentence in an embezzlement case he says was trumped up.

The case has sparked new tensions between Russia and the West and renewed talk of sanctions. Navalny's allies have urged the West to target individuals close to Putin with punitive measures.

Yekaterina Andreeva and Darya Chultsova, a reporter and a camerawoman for Belsat, were arrested in November after a demonstration.
Months of protests took place in Belarus after President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory over opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya in an election in August. The opposition said the result was rigged.
Prosecutors accused Andreeva and Chultsova of coordinating the protests by broadcasting live reports. They have denied the charges, for which they could be sentenced to three years in prison. They appeared in court inside a cage.
International human rights organisations have condemned the detention of Andreeva and Chultsova.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists urged Belarusian authorities to drop the ""absurd"" charges against Andreyeva and Chultsova and release them unconditionally.
""The Belarus government must stop punishing journalists for reporting on important political events, and allow them to work freely and without fear of reprisal,"" it said in a statement on Monday.

Thousands of protesters were rounded up and nearly all opposition political figures were driven into exile or jailed as the government cracked down.

Leaders of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah faction, which controls the West Bank, and of Hamas, the armed Islamist movement that opposes any negotiations with Israel, began Egyptian-brokered talks on Monday to address long-standing divisions ahead of elections planned for later this year.
The 365-sq km (141-sq mile) Gaza strip, controlled by Hamas, is home to around 2 million Palestinians. An Israeli-led blockade has put restrictions on the movement of people and goods for years. 
Egypt had been opening the Rafah crossing for only a few days at a time to allow stranded travellers to pass.
The crossing was opened early on Tuesday and a bus carrying Palestinians arrived in Egypt, two Egyptian sources at the crossing said.
Rafah will remain open ""until further notice"", one source at the checkpoint and an Egyptian security source said. 
The Palestinian embassy in Cairo said Egypt had decided to open the crossing as a result of ""intensive and bilateral talks between the Palestinian and Egyptian leaderships to facilitate the passage of Palestinians to and from the Gaza Strip"".
Palestinian sources attending the Cairo talks said they had been told by Egyptian intelligence officials that the move was designed to create a better atmosphere at the negotiations.
Egypt has tried in vain for 14 years to reconcile the two factions, and the talks are unlikely to bridge the ideological divide between Abbas's Fatah, whose strategy is to seeks peace with Israel, and Hamas, which refuses to recognise Israel and advocates armed resistance.
It would, however, be a significant achievement if the factions could agree to hold an election in both Gaza and the West Bank, with the aim of installing a single elected government for both.

The current round of talks is due to end on Tuesday.

637,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 06:47AM ET</span>","Myanmar police fire to disperse protest, four hurt, one critical","(Reuters) - Myanmar police used force on Tuesday to disperse protests against military rule and one woman was in critical condition and not expected to survive after being shot in the head with a bullet, a doctor said.
Police fired guns, mostly into the air, and used water cannon and rubber bullets to try to clear protesters in the capital Naypyitaw, and four people were taken to hospital with what doctors initially said they believed were wounds caused by rubber bullets.
One of them, a woman, had what was most likely a fatal head wound, said a doctor who declined to be identified. The bullet could be seen lodged in her in an X-ray, the doctor said.
""She hasn't passed away yet, she's in the emergency unit, but it's 100% certain the injury is fatal,"" the doctor, who said senior colleagues involved in her treatment had assigned him to speak to the media, told Reuters.
""According to the X-ray, it's a live bullet.""
Neither police nor the hospital responded to a request for comment.
A man had a chest wound but was not in critical condition. It was not clear if he was hit with a bullet or rubber bullet, the doctor said.
Protesters have taken to the streets in cities and towns in the largest demonstrations in Myanmar for more than a decade against a Feb. 1 military coup that ousted the elected government of veteran democracy campaigner, Aung San Suu Kyi.
The unrest has revived memories of almost half a century of direct army rule, and spasms of bloody protests against it, until the military began a process of withdrawing from civilian politics in 2011.
Suu Kyi's party won a 2015 election but the transition to democracy was brought to a halt by the Feb. 1 coup that ousted her government as it was preparing to begin its second term after her National League for Democracy (NLD) swept a Nov. 8 election.
The military cited election fraud as justification for its takeover. The electoral commission dismissed accusations of fraud.
Earlier, witnesses said police fired guns into the air in Naypyitaw as a crowd refused to disperse. Police then fired water cannon at the protesters, who responded with stones, the witness said.
Video footage posted on social media apparently of the woman who was killed, showed her with some other protesters by what appeared to be a bus-stop shelter some distance from a row of riot police as a water cannon sprayed and several shots could be heard.
The woman, wearing a motorbike helmet, suddenly collapsed. Pictures on social media of her helmet showed what appeared to be a bullet hole.
Reuters was not able to verify the video footage or photographs. 
PROMISE OF DEMOCRACY
Earlier, video from the central town of Bago showed police confronting a crowd and blasting them with jets from water cannon.
Police arrested at least 27 demonstrators in the second-biggest city of Mandalay, domestic media reported.
Promises on Monday from junta leader General Min Aung Hlaing to eventually hold a new election in his first address since seizing power drew scorn. He repeated unproven accusations of fraud in the election.
Min Aung Hlaing said the junta would form a ""true and disciplined democracy"", different to previous eras of military rule, which brought years of isolation and poverty.
""We will have a multiparty election and we will hand the power to the one who wins,"" he said. 
He gave no time frame but the junta has said a state of emergency would last one year.
State media signalled possible action against the protests on Monday when it said the public wanted rid of ""wrongdoers"".
Orders banning gatherings of more than four people and a curfew from 8 p.m. to 4 a.m. have been imposed on Yangon and Mandalay.
A growing civil disobedience movement affecting hospitals, schools and government offices shows no sign of ending but the crowds in Yangon appeared smaller on Tuesday than the previous day.
""The main thing is we don’t want a coup,"" said a 24-year-old woman protester in Yangon. ""If we young people don’t come out who will?""
Activists are also seeking the abolition of a 2008 constitution drawn up under military supervision that gave the generals a veto in parliament and control of several ministries, and for a federal system in ethnically diverse Myanmar.
Western governments have widely condemned the coup, although there has been little concrete action to press the generals.
The Philippines on Tuesday issued a second statement on Myanmar, calling for ""complete restoration of the status quo"" - one of the few among Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbours to comment on the military intervention.
New Zealand has suspended all high-level political and military contact and will ensure aid does not benefit the military and impose a travel ban on its leaders.
The U.N. Security Council has called for the release of SuuKyi and others. The U.N. Human Rights Council will hold a special session on Friday to discuss the crisis.
Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy and spent nearly 15 years under house arrest.
The 75-year-old faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkies and is being held in detention until Feb. 15. Her lawyer said he has not been allowed to see her. The U.S. State Department said it tried to reach her but was denied.

Suu Kyi remains hugely popular at home despitedamage to her international reputation over the plight of theMuslim Rohingya minority.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Police in the Indian capital arrested a man on Tuesday accused of leading a group of farmers who clashed with police and stormed the historic Red Fort last month during the worst day of violence in months of protests against agriculture reforms.
Tens of thousands of farmers have been camping out on main highways on the outskirts of New Deli for more than two months in a bid to force the government to withdraw new agricultural laws they say benefit private buyers at the expense of growers.
When India celebrated its Republic Day with a military parade on Jan. 26, farmers organised a procession of tractors that turned violent when some protesters deviated from the route and broke into the Red Fort complex.
One person died and hundreds were injured.
In the first arrest linked to that violence, police arrested a little-known actor from the northern state of Punjab, Deep Sidhu, and several others suspected of joining him at the Red Fort.
Sidhu is a Sikh and many farmers from Sikh-dominated Punjab have been at the vanguard of the protest.
Police did not give details of charges against Sidhu but would interrogate him, said officer Chinmoy Biswal.
Disassociating themselves from the violence, leaders of farmers' unions, said Sidhu had not been a part of the protest and had infiltrating their tractor procession on Jan 26.
Farmer union leaders have accused Sidhu of being sympathetic to fringe groups demanding an independent Sikh state called Khalistan, carved out of India.
Sikh separatists waged an insurgency against the government in the 1980s and activism by Sikhs can risk reviving painful memories.
The farmers say the new laws will mean the end of guaranteed prices for their crops but Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging farmers to end the protest, has assured them the government would still buy grain at set prices.

Rakesh Tikait, a prominent farmer leader, said the protest would go on until the government withdraws the laws, makes it mandatory for buyers to pay guaranteed prices for all crops and drops police cases filed against protesters.

639,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 04:50AM ET</span>","""Power in solidarity"": Myanmar protesters inspired by Hong Kong and Thailand","(Reuters) - Using one hand to photograph this moment in Myanmar's history, Myat gave a three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salute of defiance to authoritarian rule as she stood with tens of thousands of other protesters gathered around the Sule Pagoda in downtown Yangon.
Passers-by and storekeepers returned the salute as Myat and her fellow demonstrators sang protest songs, while police watched on.
That was on Monday, the third day of protests by people opposed to a military coup against a civilian government that won a landslide election in November.
The three-finger salute was first adopted by activists in neighbouring Thailand opposed to a government there that is headed by a former army chief, who had also come to power in 2014 by overthrowing an elected government.
Before joining demonstrations, 28-year-old Myat says she reads a manual of Hong Kong protest tactics that has been translated into Burmese and shared thousands of times on social media.
Online, some opponents of Myanmar's Feb. 1 coup are connecting with users of the #MilkTeaAlliance hashtag that brought together campaigners in Thailand and Hong Kong.
""We saw how youths are participating in political movements in nearby countries,"" Myat said. ""It inspired us to get involved.""
Protesters told Reuters that social media helps them borrow symbols and ideas from elsewhere, like using Hong Kong-style flashmobs, rapidly shifting hashtags and colourful meme artworks.
Anticipating stronger action by police, protesters returned to the streets for mass protests on Tuesday, many wearing yellow construction helmets and carrying umbrellas, just as protesters in Hong Kong and Thailand had done.
The biggest protests in more than a decade have swept Myanmar to denounce the coup and demand the release of Aung San Suu Kyi. The deposed 75-year-old elected leader first came to prominence in 1988 during a very different generation of protests against an earlier junta.
For the first time in Myanmar, mass protests are joined by a Generation Z who grew up with greater freedom, prosperity and access to technology in what remains one of Southeast Asia’s poorest and most restrictive countries.
They are forming bonds with activists who took on Beijing's rule in Hong Kong and Thailand's government and its monarchy, which is accused of enabling decades of military domination.
""There's power in solidarity,"" said Sophie Mak, a Hong Kong human rights researcher and activist.
""Milk Tea Alliance is a pan-Asian solidarity movement basically comprising young people who are fed up by their governments' oppression,"" she told Reuters. 
Allies abroad can amplify the message from Myanmar's activists, particularly when communications blackouts make it hard to get out information, she said.
The exchange in political campaigning culture is accompanied by protest art, with graphic artists preparing work to support each other.
One of the newest artworks shows the addition of a cup of Myanmar's own strong sweet tea to the image of milky tea drinks from Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
""Youths gained more exposure to the rest of the world during the last five years of the civilian government,"" said 24-year Nadi told Reuters at the same protest in Yangon.
""We witnessed what happened in Hong Kong and Thailand and it is a big influence on today's movement,"" she added. 
Nearby, a bridge pillar had been covered in colourful post-its with anti-coup messages, copying Hong Kong's popular ""Lennon Walls.""
Pro-democracy campaigner ""mhonism"" - who asked to be identified only by his Twitter handle - dubbed Myanmar the newest member of the Milk Tea Alliance in a tweet sent hours after the coup that was shared more than 22,000 times.
He then helped to coordinate protests against Myanmar's coup in Thailand by Thais and people from Myanmar to demonstrate "" solidarity.""
Thai pro-democracy groups have now hung banners supporting Myanmar protesters in Bangkok - despite the disapproval of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, himself a former junta leader, who has said Thais should stay out of Myanmar's ""internal affairs"". 
The exchange of ideas goes both ways.
Thailand's largest youth protest group, Ratsadon, has announced a protest on Wednesday with the banging of pots and pans - something the Myanmar anti-coup protesters have been doing nightly as a way to drive out evil spirits.
The aim is to protest against both governments.

""We went through the same thing,"" said Rathasat Plenwong , a Thai protester and Milk Tea Alliance activist. ""Now we support and inspire each other.""

Airlines have been brought to their knees by the pandemic, with travel restrictions forcing once fast-growing brands like Norwegian to fight for survival while established names like British Airways have raised cash and laid off thousands of staff.
 ITV  (LON:ITV) reported that all international arrivals would have to be tested for COVID-19 on the second and eighth days of their self-isolation.
""We are constantly looking at refining our approach to the border simply because there is a risk from new variants coming from other countries around the world,"" Environment Secretary George Eustice told Times Radio.
""Until we have fully rolled out the vaccine and identified a way to be able to update the vaccine to meet new challenges we do have to exercise some caution about international travel,"" he said.
Arrivals in England must currently have proof of a negative COVID-19 test in the past three days and then self isolate for 10 days from departure. 
The British government is due to require travellers arriving from COVID-19 hot spots to quarantine in hotels from Feb. 15. Travellers from countries deemed high risk such as South Africa would have to stay for 10 days in such hotels.
But the government is still in talks with hotels on the measures, which were introduced in places such as Australia in March 2020.

""Those discussions haven't yet concluded so there aren't hotels yet,"" Eustice told LBC Radio.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 03:20AM ET</span>",Two U.S. carrier groups conduct exercises in South China Sea,"By Se Young Lee
(Reuters) - Two U.S. carrier groups conducted joint exercises in the South China Sea on Tuesday, days after a U.S. warship sailed near Chinese-controlled islands in the disputed waters, as China denounced the United States for damaging peace and stability.
The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group and the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group ""conducted a multitude of exercises aimed at increasing interoperability between assets as well as command and control capabilities"", the U.S. Navy said, marking the first dual carrier operations in the busy waterway since July 2020.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the frequent moves by U.S. warships and aircraft into the South China Sea in a ""show of force"" was not conducive to regional peace and stability. 
""China will continue to take necessary measures to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and security and work with countries in the region to firmly safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea,"" he said.
The exercise comes days after China condemned the sailing of the destroyer, the USS John S. McCain, near the Chinese-controlled Paracel Islands in what the United States calls a freedom of navigation operation - the first such mission by the U.S. navy since President Joe Biden took office.
Last month, the U.S. military said Chinese military flights over the South China Sea fit a pattern of destabilising and aggressive behaviour but posed no threat to a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier strike group in the region.
The United States has contested China's extensive territorial claims in the region, accusing it of militarising the South China Sea and trying to intimidate neighbours such as Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, who have claims that overlap with China's in the resource-rich area. 
""We are committed to ensuring the lawful use of the sea that all nations enjoy under international law,"" Rear Admiral Jim Kirk, commander of the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group, said in a statement. 
China has been infuriated by repeated U.S. sailings near the islands it occupies and controls in the South China Sea. China says it has irrefutable sovereignty and has accused the United States of deliberately stoking tension.
China has also been angered by U.S. warships sailing through the Taiwan Strait, including one last week, also the first such operation under the Biden administration.
Speaking in Taipei, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said U.S. ships and aircraft carrying out freedom of navigation operations was reassuring.

""This demonstrates the clear U.S. attitude towards challenges to the security status quo in the Indo-Pacific region,"" she said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's new foreign minister said on Tuesday he was confident about coordinating North Korea policy with the United States despite earlier signs of differences. 
Chung Eui-yong, 74, took office as South Korea's top diplomat, replacing Kang Kyung-wha, who had held the post for nearly four years. As President Moon Jae-in's first national security adviser until last year, Chung helped facilitate Moon's summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and sought to meditate between Pyongyang and Washington. 
Chung's nomination came two days after Moon called for U.S. President Joe Biden to hold a dialogue with North Korea to build on progress made by Kim and former U.S. President Donald Trump at their first summit in Singapore.
Chung played an incremental role in arranging the 2018 Singapore summit between Kim and Trump. But he was accused of misleading both Pyongyang and Washington about the potential for agreement ahead of their failed second summit in Vietnam in 2019.
The allies have shown signs of friction since then, with Seoul keen to reopen inter-Korean economic initiatives while Washington urges those projects should keep step with North Korea's progress on dismantling its nuclear programmes. 
Chung expressed confidence in coordinating with the new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden, saying an early denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula is a shared goal. 
""Resolving the issue a very key task that can no longer be postponed,"" Chung told reporters. 
""Basically there is no big difference in the two sides' positions. Given the solid alliance, I believe there won't be major problems coordinating even if there are slight differences."" 
Biden has not announced any new North Korea policy, but said during a presidential debate in October he would meet Kim only if he agreed to ""draw down"" the country's nuclear capacity.
South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told Reuters that the two sides should pursue an interim deal including a halt to the North's nuclear activity and a cut in its programmes in return for some sanctions relief.

North Korea had offered to abolish its main nuclear facility in exchange for the lifting of key U.N. sanctions, but the United States said Pyongyang should also hand over its nuclear weapons and bomb fuel.

China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has increased its military activity around the island in recent months, responding to what Beijing calls ""collusion"" between Taipei and Washington, Taiwan's most important international backer.
Speaking after a meeting with senior security officials, Tsai said Taiwan was in close contact with ""relevant countries"" about the situation in the Taiwan Strait, which separates the island from its huge neighbour.
Chinese military aircraft and warships operating around Taiwan are not conducive to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, she added.
""I would like to reiterate that Taiwan's consistent position on cross-strait relations is neither to succumb to pressure nor to advance rashly when we get support,"" Tsai said.
Taiwan wants ""meaningful talks"" with China on the basis of equality and mutual respect, as long as Beijing wants to ease the stand-off, she added. 
""Cross-strait peace is not a unilateral issue for Taiwan. The key lies in China's hands. Historical experience has proven that verbal attacks and military threats against Taiwan will not help cross-strait relations.""
Taiwan and China this week both mark the Lunar New Year, traditionally the most important holiday of the year for both, marking the arrival of spring.
""We would also like to wish the people on the other side of the strait a happy new year and hope to jointly promote peace and stability on both sides of the strait,"" Tsai said.
There was no immediate response from China, which has rebuffed previous calls from Tsai for dialogue, believing she is a separatist bent on Taiwan's independence.
In January, China said Taiwan was engaging in a ""cheap trick"" after Tsai again called for talks.

Tsai has repeatedly said Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

646,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 09, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Hong Kong tycoon Jimmy Lai denied bail in national security case,"By James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's top court denied bail on Tuesday to media tycoon and Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, the most high-profile person to be charged under the city's national security law.
Lai had been in custody since Dec. 3, except when he was released on bail for about a week late last year. He was granted a HK$10 million ($1.3 million) bail by a lower court on Dec. 23 only for the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) to bring him back into custody on Dec. 31 for another hearing following an appeal by the government.
His return to custody was related in part to Article 42 of the security law, which says that ""no bail shall be granted to a criminal suspect or defendant unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing that the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security"".
On Tuesday, the CFA's five judges said in a written judgment the lower court applied an ""erroneous line of reasoning"" and ""misconstrued"" Article 42. The decision was unanimous.
The judges said Lai's team could make a ""fresh application"" for bail, as Tuesday's decision was of ""a limited nature,"" focusing on how the lower court arrived at its decision, rather than whether Lai should be bailed out or not.
Lai, wearing a dark grey suit and sporting his trademark buzz cut, stood in the dock impassively as the judges delivered their decision.
Outside the court, a small number of pro-China protesters shouted ""Jail Jimmy Lai for life ... safeguard Hong Kong's peace"" through a loud-hailer. Inside, Lai's supporters shouted ""Hang in there,"" and ""Add oil,"" an encouragement used frequently in Hong Kong.
Lai was arrested in August when about 200 police officers raided the newsroom of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid newspaper.
Beijing imposed the sweeping national security law on the former British colony last June after months of pro-democracy protests. The law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent and it erodes freedoms in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city. Its supporters say it restores stability after months of unrest.
Prosecutors have accused Lai of breaching the law over statements he made on July 30 and Aug. 18, in which they allege he requested foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.
Lai has been a frequent visitor to Washington, meeting with officials, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor"".
Under the new law, the onus is on the defendant to prove they would not be a national security threat if released on bail. Under Hong Kong's common law-based legal system, the onus has traditionally been on the prosecution to prove its case.
""We’ve lost the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty,"" said Avery Ng, a pro-democracy activist in the courtroom who himself faces illegal assembly charges related to mass anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019. 
Lai stepped down last year as chairman of Next Digital, which publishes Apple Daily, a popular tabloid newspaper known for its feisty and critical coverage of China and Hong Kong.

Separately, the national security trial of Tong Ying-kit, who allegedly drove his motor-bike into police officers while flying a protest flag, will be held without a jury, AFP reported, citing a legal source.

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - The Haitian opposition on Monday escalated a constitutional crisis by naming a magistrate as an interim leader for the troubled Caribbean country amid a dispute over when the term of President Jovenel Moise ends.
Political tension was exacerbated on Sunday when Moise alleged there had been an attempt to overthrow the government and 23 people were arrested, including a Supreme Court judge and a senior police official.
The opposition dismissed the suggestion of a coup attempt, and said Moise should have stepped down on Feb. 7 when it says his five-year term ended. 
The president has vowed to stay in power until February 2022, pointing out that an interim administration had governed for a year after he was elected in a disputed poll that was canceled by the electoral council. 
Moise took power in 2017 after fresh elections.
Magistrate Joseph Mecene Jean Louis, 72, said in a video message that he had been chosen by the opposition to replace Moise, who the opposition accuses of being authoritarian and presiding over a crippling economic crisis.
""I declare to accept the choice of the opposition and the civil society to be able to serve my country as the provisional president,"" Jean Louis said.
Moise, who has ruled by decree since January last year, has stated he would hand over power to the winner of the September presidential election but would not step down until his term expires in 2022.
The United States, which is the biggest donor to Haiti, appears to have backed Moise's timeline, saying the new president should take office in February next year.
On Monday, Moise held a cabinet meeting and said on Twitter the government is ""taking all measures to ensure the safety of the population"".
Haiti's executive branch, consisting of the president, prime minister and ministers, published a decree announcing three Supreme Court judges who were approached by the opposition to replace Moise as president are to be retired.
Haiti's military on Monday said it was concerned about political events but appeared to back Moise, saying it would defend the rule of law and ""legitimate authorities democratically elected by the population"".
Earlier in the day, two journalists covering a small protest were shot in the capital and one of them is in a serious condition, according to news outlets and videos uploaded on social media. 
Andre Michel, an opposition figure, told Reuters that the opposition would keep up its protests against the government this week.
""The mobilization must continue to force Jovenel Moise to leave office,"" Michel said. ""We hope that the international community will support our approach.""

Cuban Ambassador Jose Luis Ponce on Monday sent ""a communication about a supposed terrorist attack being planned...by the Eastern Front of the ELN,"" Defense Minister Diego Molano said in a video broadcast on social media. 
Cuba was the site of brief peace talks between the Marxist ELN and the Colombian government, which collapsed after the ELN bombed Bogota's police academy in 2019, killing more than 20 people.
""Our armed forces and police have all deployed capacity in all Colombia cities, regionally, to protect all Colombians,"" Molano said.
Ponce's two-paragraph letter said the attack was planned for the coming days. But it added the embassy could not evaluate the ""verisimilitude"" of the information.
Cuba asked the ELN delegation - which remains in Havana - about the possible attack, the letter said, and the delegation ""expressed total ignorance.""
Cuba should extradite the ELN negotiators, Colombia's High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos said in the broadcast with Molano. 
Colombia has repeatedly urged Cuba to extradite the negotiators on charges related to the police academy bombing. 
""This declaration and official communication from the Cuban government confirms the great division there is within the ELN,"" Ceballos said. ""The Eastern Front insists on standing in the way of the real will for peace.""
The ELN, founded by radical Catholic priests in 1964, is widely considered to be less centrally controlled than the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebel group, which inked a peace deal in 2016.

Former President Donald Trump officially granted U.S. recognition of the Golan as Israeli territory in 2019 - a dramatic shift from decades of U.S. policy. Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in 1981 in a move that is not recognized internationally.
""As a practical matter, the control of the Golan in that situation I think remains of real importance to Israel’s security,"" Blinken told CNN. ""Legal questions are something else and over time if the situation were to change in Syria, that's something we look at, but we are nowhere near that.""
He added that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government as well as the presence of militia groups backed by Iran pose a 'significant security threat' to Israel.
Biden’s advisers had said previously that he would not withdraw U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan.
Blinken also reiterated the Biden administration's commitment to keep the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem, after the Trump administration recognized the city as the capital of Israel, reversing previous U.S. policy.
Trump was broadly in lockstep on Middle East policy with his closest ally in the region, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Biden and his team have said they will restore ties with the Palestinians that were cut by Trump, resume aid and reject unilateral actions, such as construction of Israeli settlements on occupied territory.
Biden’s failure to speak with Netanyahu so far among his calls with foreign leaders has raised eyebrows in Israel and among Middle East experts. Obama and Trump both spoke to him within days of taking office.

When asked why Biden has not spoken with Netanyahu, Blinken said: ""I'm sure that they'll have occasion to speak in the near future.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - North Korea maintained and developed its nuclear and ballistic missile programs throughout 2020 in violation of international sanctions, helping fund them with some $300 million stolen through cyber hacks, according to a confidential United Nations report seen by Reuters on Monday.
The report by independent sanctions monitors said Pyongyang ""produced fissile material, maintained nuclear facilities and upgraded its ballistic missile infrastructure"" while continuing to seek material and technology for those programs from abroad.
The annual report to the Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee comes just weeks after U.S. President Joe Biden took office. 
A State Department spokesperson said on Monday the administration planned a new approach to North Korea, including a full review with allies ""on ongoing pressure options and the potential for any future diplomacy.""
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former U.S. President Donald Trump met three times in 2018 and 2019, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea's demands for an end to sanctions.
In the past year, North Korea displayed new short-range, medium-range, submarine-launched and intercontinental ballistic missile systems at military parades, the U.N. report said.
The U.N. report said an unnamed member state had assessed that, judging by the size of North Korea's missiles, ""it is highly likely that a nuclear device"" could be mounted on to long-range, medium-range and short-range ballistic missiles. 
""The Member State, however, stated it is uncertain whether the DPRK had developed ballistic missiles resistant to the heat generated during re-entry,"" into the atmosphere, the report said. North Korea's formal name is Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
While there were no nuclear or ballistic missile tests in 2020, Pyongyang ""announced preparation for testing and production of new ballistic missile war heads and development of tactical nuclear weapons.""
North Korea's U.N. mission in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. 
NORTH KOREA, IRAN, MISSILES
North Korea blew up tunnels at its main nuclear test site, Punggye-ri, in 2018, saying it was proof of its commitment to end nuclear testing. However, an unidentified member state told the U.N. monitors there were still personnel at the site, showing it had not been abandoned. 
According to an unidentified country, North Korea and Iran have resumed cooperation on long-range missile development projects, including the transfer of critical parts, the monitors said. The most recent shipment was last year, they said.
In a letter in December to the U.N. sanctions monitors, annexed to the report, Iran's U.N. Ambassador Majid Takht Ravanchi said a preliminary review of the information given to it by the monitors indicated that ""false information and fabricated data"" may have been used in their investigation. 
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. sanctions since 2006. They have been strengthened by the 15-member Security Council over the years in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The U.N. monitors assessed that in 2020 North Korea-linked hackers ""continued to conduct operations against financial institutions and virtual currency exchange houses to generate revenue"" to support its nuclear and missile programs.
""According to one member state, the DPRK total theft of virtual assets, from 2019 to November 2020, is valued at approximately $316.4 million,"" the report said. 
In 2019, the sanctions monitors reported that North Korea made at least $370 million by exporting coal, which is banned under U.N. sanctions. But last year, they said coal shipments appeared to have been largely suspended since July 2020.

The isolated Asian nation imposed a strict lockdown last year amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slashed its trade, hurting an economy already burdened by international sanctions. [L4N2JU23B]

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called on his ruling Workers' Party to thoroughly implement the five-year economic plan, posited at a rare congress last month, state news agency KCNA reported on Tuesday.
The announcement comes as Kim chaired a plenary meeting of the ruling party's central committee on Monday, following a rare congress in January where he said his past five-year economic plan had failed.
Kim sharply criticized the ""passive and self-protecting tendencies revealed by the state economic guidance organs in the course of setting this year's goals"", KCNA said.
He stressed the need to provide the party members with practical means of innovation that would help bring about realistic change and substantial progress from the first year of the five-year plan, KCNA said.
Kim laid out detailed tasks for the party to attain the economic goals of increased iron and steel production and investment, as well as a push for better infrastructure, transportation, construction and commerce. 
He had sought to accelerate economic growth and boost electricity supply, but U.N. agencies reported chronic power and food shortages, exacerbated by sanctions, the COVID-19 pandemic and severe floods.
""He evinced the determination and will of the Party Central Committee to take important measures to push forward the economic construction and provide the people with more stable and improved living conditions despite the persistent emergency anti-epidemic situation,"" KCNA reported.
North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the coronavirus, but it has imposed strict border closures, domestic travel restrictions and other measures to prevent an outbreak.

Kim made an appearance for the first time in a few weeks after he was seen at a parade in Pyongyang that showed off what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) last month.

LONDON (Reuters - Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced on Monday plans to approve a set of new draft laws designed to enhance the efficiency and integrity of the kingdom's judicial system, a step that would eventually lead to an entirely codified law.
The prince, often referred to by his initials MBS, has launched a series of social and economic reforms aimed at modernising the conservative kingdom, which has no codified system of law to go with the texts making up sharia, or Islamic law.
The state news agency (SPA) quoted the prince on Monday as saying that four new laws - the personal status law, the civil transactions law, the penal code of discretionary sanctions and the law of evidence - are currently being finalised and will then be submitted to the cabinet and relevant bodies as well as the advisory Shura Council, before they are finally approved.
""The new laws represent a new wave of reforms that will ... increase the reliability of procedures and oversight mechanisms as cornerstones in achieving the principles of justice, clarifying the lines of accountability,"" Prince Mohammed said in the statement.
A Saudi official told Reuters On Monday that setting clear codes to four major and fundamental laws through applying the best international practices and standards means the kingdom is ""definitely moving towards codifying the entire law"" to meet the needs of the modern world while adhering to Islamic Sharia principles. 
""While there is a decent and independent judiciary, the main criticism is that it is not consistent and judges have significant discretion on many of these issues, which leads to inconsistency and unpredictability,"" the Saudi official said.
Having no written laws that govern certain incidents had for decades resulted in discrepancy in court rulings and prolonged litigation, hurting many Saudis, mostly women.
Riyadh has, for example, long endured international censure over the guardianship system that assigns each women a male relative - a father, brother, husband or son - whose approval was needed for various big decisions throughout a woman’s life. The law was reformed in August 2019.
""This was painful for many individuals and families, especially women, permitting some to evade their responsibilities. This will not take place again once these laws are promulgated pursuant to legislative laws and procedures,"" MbS said.

Prince Mohammed said in the statement that the new laws will be announced consecutively during 2021.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Chicago's teachers union on Monday was reviewing a compromise plan on COVID-19 safety proposed by the school district that could allow in-person classes to resume, as Philadelphia school district agreed to let a mediator decide when classrooms could safely reopen there.
The Chicago Teachers Union's leadership is expected to decide on Monday night whether to send the plan to its 28,000 rank and file members for a vote on Tuesday. 
If approved, the plan would avert either a threatened lockout by the third largest U.S. school district or a strike by teachers, who have demanded stronger protocols to prevent the spread of the virus in classrooms. 
The deal would allow for 67,000 students to gradually return to school buildings over the next month, starting with pre-kindergarten and special education pupils later this week.
Across the nation, pressure to reopen or expand in-person learning has been building, with the negative impacts of remote learning on education and family life becoming more apparent as time passes. As a consequence, a debate over how and when to safely re-open schools, many of them closed since the pandemic began last spring, has become heated in many districts. 
""We'll get there,"" American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten (NYSE:WRI) wrote on Twitter on Monday, referring a full return to the classroom nationwide. ""But we need the resources, the plan and roadmap, and the basic safety precautions we've been asking for since April."" 
In Philadelphia, the district backed down on its order that some 2,000 pre-kindergarten through second-grade teachers to their classrooms return to the classroom on Monday to prepare for students coming back on Feb. 22. Instead of disciplining teachers who failed to show up, the district said it would allow an independent arbitrator to decide when classrooms could safely reopen. 
""There is a lot of uncertainty about the process of re-opening,"" said Pennsylvania State Senator Nikil Saval on a Twitter video as he protested with Philadelphia teachers outside his child's school. ""We want an eventual return to schools but only when it is safe ... for teachers and students."" 
President Joe Biden on Sunday addressed the issue on Sunday, describing school closures and their negative impact on families as a national emergency. During a Super Bowl interview on CBS, Biden said it was time for schools to reopen if they can do it safely, with fewer people in classrooms and proper ventilation. 
""I think about the price so many of my grandkids and ... kids are going to pay for not having had the chance to finish whatever it was,"" he said. ""They are going for a lot, these kids.""
Leading health organizations, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have said there is little evidence that schools contribute to the spread of the virus, which has killed more than 460,000 people in the United States since the pandemic began. 
In Michigan, more than 350 physicians and psychologists signed a letter to Ann Arbor Schools officials urging the resumption of in-person classes by March 1. They warned of the ""harmful impact of delayed school reopening on our community."" 
Dr. Kim Monroe, a pediatrician who helped organize the Michigan effort, told radio station WEMU, ""We are seeing so much mental illness in children due to the virtual schooling."" 
In Atlanta, third through fifth grade students went back to school on Monday after prekindergarten through second grade returned to schools on Jan. 25.
In New York City, in-person classes in the nation's largest school system will resume for middle school students on Feb. 25. About half of the public school system's 471 middle schools will offer five-day-a-week classroom learning with the remainder working toward that goal, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza said at a press briefing.

""If we're in an environment where the city is overwhelmingly vaccinated, we're able to bring school back as it was. Same physical proportions. Same number of kids in classrooms,"" De Blasio said, adding he hopes to have all schools back to full-time in-person learning in the fall.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said on Monday it would consult members on whether it should back a government led by former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, increasing the uncertainty over the make-up of his coalition. 
5-Star, the largest party in parliament, had initially ruled out backing Draghi. But after meeting him on Saturday its leader Vito Crimi said he was open to consider supporting Draghi on the basis of the policies he proposes.
The vote will begin on Wednesday at 1 p.m. (1200 GMT) and will end 24 hours later, 5-Star's official website said. 
After the resignation of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte due to a coalition rupture, Italy's head of state asked Draghi last week to try to form a government with broad parliamentary backing.
He is currently holding a second round of talks with political parties to try to muster a majority and put together a cabinet. These are due to end on Tuesday.
It is unclear whether he will wait until the results of the 5-Star vote before reporting back to President Sergio Mattarella.
The 5-Star vote could be close, opinion polls suggest. A survey by the Ipsos agency for daily Corriere della Sera last week showed 55% of 5-Star voters wanted the party to back Draghi, against 40% who opposed him.
However, the online vote, to be held on 5-Star's internet platform dubbed Rousseau, will involve only signed up-members, a much smaller number of hard-core followers.
Holding online votes on important issues is standard practice for 5-Star, reflecting its credo of direct democracy, and it followed such procedures to decide whether to participate in the last two governments.
The results normally reflect the recommendation of 5-Star's top brass, but not always. In 2019, members rejected a call from the then-party chief Luigi Di Maio to pull 5-Star out of upcoming regional elections.
Moreover, on this occasion the party is split. One of its most popular figures, Alessandro Di Battista, is particularly hostile to Draghi and said on Monday it would be ""absolutely and totally a mistake"" for 5-Star to support him. 
To secure an outright majority in both houses of parliament, Draghi needs the backing of either the 5-Star or Matteo Salvini's rightist and traditionally eurosceptic League, the second largest group in parliament.

The centre-left Democratic Party, Silvio Berlusconi's conservative Forza Italia and Matteo Renzi's centrist Italia Viva have guaranteed their backing for Draghi.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Yemen mediator Martin Griffiths and Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif discussed on Monday how to make progress toward a nationwide ceasefire and reviving the political process in Yemen, a U.N. spokesman said. 
A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-aligned Houthis. The more than six-year long conflict is widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
It is Griffiths first visit to Iran since becoming the U.N. envoy three years ago. 
Zarif and Griffiths ""exchanged views on Yemen and how to make progress towards a resumption of the political process"", U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. 
""Mr Zarif and Mr Griffiths further discussed the urgent need to make progress towards a nationwide ceasefire, the opening of Sanaa airport and the easing of restrictions on Hodeidah ports.""
He added that Griffiths welcomed Iran's expression of support for the U.N. efforts to end the conflict in Yemen. 
While Griffiths office said the visit to Iran had been planned for some time, it comes after new U.S. President Joe Biden declared last week that the war in Yemen ""has to end"" and said Washington would halt support for the Saudi Arabia-led military campaign against the Houthis.

The United States also said on Friday it intends to revoke its terrorist designation of the Houthis to avoid worsening Yemen's humanitarian crisis. The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need and millions on the verge of famine.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former business partner of Lev Parnas, a onetime associate of Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, was sentenced on Monday to one year and a day in prison for duping investors in a start-up insurer and lying to the Federal Election Commission.
David Correia, 45, had pleaded guilty in October to wire fraud conspiracy over his role in Fraud Guarantee, a Florida startup that ostensibly protected consumers from fraud.
Prosecutors said Correia and Parnas conned victims into investing more than $2 million over seven years, but then withdrew much of it for family or personal use.
""It is not just a momentary lapse of judgment,"" said U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken, who imposed Correia's sentence.
Correia also admitted to making false statements concerning an alleged illegal $325,000 donation that Parnas and Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate, made to Trump's unsuccessful campaign for a second term as U.S. president.
Prosecutors had sought a 33- to 41-month prison term, but Oetken said the small profit Correia received, and concerns about Correia's health in prison, justified less.
Correia was also ordered to forfeit $43,650, and pay $2.32 million of restitution.
""I feel true remorse for my previous actions,"" the married father of two said before being sentenced. ""These actions do not reflect what I want to be in life and I will never repeat them.""
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against Parnas and Correia related to Fraud Guarantee on Thursday.
Giuliani has not been implicated in wrongdoing.
Correia's case was part of a broader prosecution against Parnas and Fruman.
They had worked with Giuliani to dig up damaging information about President Joe Biden, who was then running for the White House, and his son Hunter.
Parnas, who later broke with Giuliani, and Fruman were also charged over a scheme to channel donations to U.S. politicians from a Russian businessman to support a legal marijuana business. Both have pleaded not guilty.

SAKHAROVO, Russia (Reuters) - Anti-Kremlin protesters freed from detention in Russia say they are ready to keep demonstrating and have lost their fear of the authorities.
Police detained more than 11,000 people during three unsanctioned protests over the past weeks calling for the release of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, jailed for parole violations he denied. 
Navalny allies have put protests on hold for now until warmer weather and say they are focused on trying to achieve a breakthrough at a parliamentary election in the autumn.
Some of those detained for taking part in the protests said they were ready to take to the streets again when the time was right. 
""We need to keep fighting, it's impossible to scare us,"" Artem Medvedev, a 32-year-old marketing specialist, told Reuters minutes after being freed after five days in a detention centre outside Moscow.
""Amazing people are kept here and they only strengthened their beliefs. It was a mistake by people in power to hold us here all together,"" he said.
With jails overwhelmed, Medvedev, with hundreds of other protesters, was transported to a facility near the village of Sakharovo outside Moscow, usually used as an immigration detention centre.
POOR CONDITIONS
Protesters said conditions were poor and many were forced to spend nights in police buses before being jailed and then hours in overcrowded stuffy cells before being found beds.
One video sent to Reuters by Darya Stebletsova, an arrested protester, showed a rusty sink and a hole in the floor, used as a toilet.
Another protester, Veniamin, 54, said his cell only got access to soap, toilet paper and toothbrushes on the third day of his five-day arrest.
The Kremlin has acknowledged overcrowding and problems with finding proper jails for protesters due to the large number of arrests, but has blamed the demonstrators for ignoring warnings against taking part in illegal protests.
It has said any future protests would also be illegal, if unsanctioned in advance by the authorities, and would be handled by the police in the same way.
Outside, relatives and friends of the arrested protesters and volunteers waited for days to be able to pass them clothes, food, water and cigarettes.
Andrei Prokofiyev, a member of a Moscow municipal council, brought supplies for jailed activists. He said he had spent 14 hours waiting. 
""Is there panic in the Kremlin? ... Why are there so many illegal detentions? ... In terms of public opinion, it will work against the authorities,"" he said.
Boris Krit, the father of one of the arrested protesters, was waiting outside the jail for the release of his son.
He likened the opposition's decision to put protests on hold to the strategy employed by the Polish Solidarity protest movement against communism in the 1980s. 

""The winter is yours but the spring will be ours,"" he said. ""What they (the police) do, it only makes people angry. This generation has no fear.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities are considering a new social spending package worth at least $6.7 billion to address discontent over falling living standards before an autumn election, according to two government sources.
The package, which one of the sources said President Vladimir Putin was likely to unveil in an annual speech to senior political figures in coming weeks, follows unsanctioned nationwide protests last month that hit the value of the rouble.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not comment specifically on the plans for a new social spending package, but denied any such move by the government would be designed to dampen protests. He said any such link ""did not correspond to reality.""
A spokesman for Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said he was not immediately aware of the proposal.
The trigger for the recent protests was the arrest of opposition politician and Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, who was detained on his return to Russia following treatment in Germany after he was poisoned by a nerve agent in Siberia last August.
Some protesters also said they had taken to the streets to vent their frustration over declining living standards and the perceived gap between a small number of wealthy people and the rest of the population.
The two government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to the media, told Reuters the spending package was meant to make people feel the authorities are aware of their financial concerns and are doing something to help them. 
The new aid package would be worth around 500 billion roubles ($6.74 billion), the first government source said.
The second said the package would be worth 0.5% of Russia's 2021 projected gross domestic product, which, according to Reuters calculations, would amount to around 580 billion roubles ($7.81 billion).
While the average wage rose to the equivalent of around $660 in late 2020, real incomes that are adjusted for inflation fell 3.5% last year and unemployment was close to 6% for first time since 2011. 
The economy, hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, suffered its sharpest contraction in 11 years in 2020. Inflation hit 5.2% last month - above the central bank target of 4% - and is accelerating. 
PROMISES TO RAISE LIVING STANDARDS
The sources disclosed no details of how the money might be spent. Such programmes have in the past targeted low-income families with small children, offering allowances for first-time mothers and higher payments for families with more children. 
Putin has repeatedly promised to lift living standards but the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with low oil prices saw incomes fall 8.4% in the second quarter of 2020, year-on-year, in what became the deepest quarterly decline since 1999.
The West has condemned Moscow over the treatment of Navalny and said it will consider new sanctions against Russia.
Fitch Ratings, affirming Russia's sovereign ratings last week, said the risk of sanctions remained high and ""weighs on Russia's rating.""
Fitch said the possibility of further social unrest posed no short-term risks to the stability of the government, but that it could complicate the ruling United Russia party's efforts to secure a constitutional majority in an election to the lower house of parliament, or Duma, that is due on Sept. 19

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Indian rescuers searched on Monday for more than 200 people missing after part of a remote Himalayan glacier broke away, sweeping away bridges, breaking dams and sending a torrent of water, rocks and construction debris down a mountain valley.
Sunday's disaster below Nanda Devi, India's second-highest peak, swept away the small Rishiganga hydro-electric project and damaged a bigger one further down the Dhauliganga river being built by state firm NTPC.
Eighteen bodies had been recovered so far, officials said. 
Most of the missing were people working on the two projects, part of the many the government has been building deep in the mountains of Uttarakhand state as part of a development push.
""As of now, around 203 people are missing,"" state chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said.
Mohd Farooq Azam, assistant professor, glaciology & hydrology at the Indian Institute of Technology in Indore, said a hanging glacier fractured.
""Our current hypothesis is that the water accumulated and locked in the debris-snow below the glacier was released when the glacier-rock mass fell,"" he said.
Videos on social media showed water surging through a small dam site, washing away construction equipment and bringing down small bridges.
""Everything was swept away, people, cattle and trees,"" Sangram Singh Rawat, a former village council member of Raini, the site closest to the Rishiganga project, told media.
Experts said it had snowed heavily last week in the Nanda Devi area and it was possible that some of the snow had started melting and may have led to an avalanche. 
Rescue squads were focused on drilling their way through a 2.5 km (1.5 miles) long tunnel at the Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower project site that NTPC was building 5 km (3 miles) downstream where about 30 workers were believed trapped. 
""We are trying to break open the tunnel, it's a long one, about 2.5 km,"" said Ashok Kumar, the state police chief. He said rescuers had gone 150 metres (yards) into the tunnel but debris and slush were slowing progress. 
There had been no voice contact yet with anyone in the tunnel, another official said. Heavy equipment has been employed and a dog squad flown to the site.
On Sunday, 12 people were rescued from another much smaller tunnel. 
Uttarakhand is prone to flash floods and landslides and the disaster prompted calls by environmentalists for a review of power projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains. In June 2013, record monsoon rains there caused devastating floods that killed nearly 6,000 people.
Environmental groups have blamed construction activity in the mountains.
Himanshu Thakkar, co-ordinator of the South Asia Network of Dams, Rivers and People, said that there were clear government recommendations against the use of explosives for construction purposes. ""There have been violations.""
The disaster also raises questions about the strength of the dams.

""The dams are supposed to withstand much greater force. This was not a monsoon flood, it was much smaller.""

Fire brigade chief Pascal Leprince said his services had evacuated about 400 people in Saintes and he estimated that up to 800 people had left their houses on their own. 
To the southeast of Bordeaux, where the river Garonne last week flooded large areas between Marmande and La Reole, floodwaters were receding, but the waters of the Charente were not expected to fall before Wednesday. 
""We are at a peak level now. We expect water levels to rise a little more in coming days, and to subside from mid-week,"" a Charente-Maritime spokeswoman said.
The city of Cognac, centre of brandy production on the Charente river, also saw several streets flooded. 
FLOOD ALERT
The France Meteo weather service put seven departments on flood alert on Monday, including Charente-Maritime, two areas along the Loire river, the Somme and Oise regions in northern France and the Seine-et-Marne region east of Paris. 
In Paris, parts of quays on the river Seine have been inaccessible for days after the river broke its banks, but water levels, at 4.35 metres on Monday morning, remained well below recent highs of 5.88 metres seen in January 2018 and 6.10 metres in June 2016.

Along the river Marne, which flows into the Seine on the eastern edge of the capital, the river broke its banks in several towns, notably in Conde-Sainte-Libaire and Esbly, where several streets were flooded.

KOJO, Iraq (Reuters) - Thikran Kamiran Yousif was 15 when Islamic State fighters surrounded his village in northern Iraq, rounded up residents and slaughtered several hundred of them, including his father, brother, grandfather and aunt.
    Nearly seven years later, Yousif has returned to the village of Kojo in Sinjar district for the reburial of his father and 103 other Yazidis whose bodies had been dumped by IS in mass graves and have now been identified by DNA samples.
Yousif, now 22 and living in Germany, is still haunted by the massacre of August 2014.
""The most painful moment was when they separated me from my father. That was the last time I saw him,"" Yousif told Reuters.
""To be able, after seven years, to bury (these people) where they were killed... means so much to us,"" said Yousif, whose other slain relatives have not yet been identified.
The Yazidis are an ancient religious minority who combine Zoroastrian, Christian, Manichean, Jewish and Muslim beliefs.
IS, which views the Yazidis as devil worshippers, killed more than 3,000, enslaved 7,000 Yazidi women and girls and displaced most of the 550,000-strong community from its ancestral home in northern Iraq.
UNITAD, the U.N. team investigating IS crimes in Iraq, has discovered more than 80 mass graves in Sinjar and has exhumed 19 of them since March 2019. It has so far identified 104 bodies by DNA samples.
""You can almost see the territory controlled by Daesh by the number of mass graves in the area,"" said Karim Khan, head of the United Nations team investigating IS crimes in Iraq (UNITAD). Daesh is another name for Islamic State.
PERILOUS ESCAPE
During the year-and-a-half he spent in the hands of IS, Yousif was moved around several times, used as a human shield in Mosul and forced to attend an IS-run Koranic school, where he was indoctrinated with the group's teachings on violent jihad.
    ""They taught us that killing Yazidis is allowed,"" he said. ""They worked on our minds.""
    As bombings by the U.S.-led coalition intensified over IS-held territory in northern Iraq, Yousif feared he would be killed or forced to fight for IS. In early 2016, he fled to Iraqi Kurdistan with his mother and sister.
    ""In the beginning it was very hard, psychologically. I was confused. I was telling myself that I should not forget what IS taught me,"" Yousif said.
    A year ago, Yousif, his mother and sister found refuge in Germany with the help of Air Bridge Iraq, a non-profit organisation that advocates for the treatment and rehabilitation of Yazidi survivors of IS captivity outside of Iraq.
Iraqi President Barham Saleh and Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi attended an official funeral ceremony for the 104 identified Yazidi victims on Feb. 4 in Baghdad, ahead of the burials in Kojo, which remains in ruins and uninhabited.
A reparation law for female survivors of IS captivity is awaiting ratification by the Iraqi parliament, but it excludes men and boys like Yousif who were also held captive.
And the Yazidis are demanding much more, including the legal recognition of their suffering as genocide.
    ""There is no legal architecture in place in Iraq to allow judges to conclude that the conduct of Daesh constituted an act of genocide, of crimes against humanity or war crimes,"" Khan said, adding that UNITAD's mandate was to provide evidence to bring the culprits to trial eventually.
About 30% of Sinjar district's population has returned since the departure of IS, but the region is still racked by political instability and lacks basic services.
At his father's graveside in Kojo, surrounded by other grieving Yazidis, mostly widows, Yousif said his community simply wanted justice.

""We want the world to see that there is a minority in Iraq that suffers,"" he said. ""We want the world to see us as human beings who have rights just like everyone else.""

(Reuters) - A year after a Colombian oil tanker captain was murdered by Venezuela's military, his widow says she still cannot claim his pension to support their two sons as the Venezuelan government refuses to authenticate his death certificate.
Jaime Herrera, 59, was shot dead on board the tanker in February 2020 by officers tasked with guarding his crew, according to a Reuters investigation published last year that highlighted his death as an example of Venezuela's lawlessness. https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/venezuela-crime-shipping
Now, Herrera's widow, Claudia Fortich, says the breakdown of diplomatic relations between Venezuela and Colombia has left her in a desperate limbo without the legal right to access his savings. Venezuela's government has denied requests she sent to obtain the required document, and Colombia's foreign ministry told her in an email that it was ""impossible"" to help her.
""Although nothing will bring back my husband, I feel victimized again by the Venezuelan government because besides killing him, they won't give me what I need to continue with my life,"" she told Reuters.
In a statement, Colombia's foreign ministry said Fortich's case was a matter for Venezuelan authorities. Venezuela's Information Ministry did not respond to requests to comment.
Herrera captained the tanker, the San Ramon, during a voyage to the Venezuelan port of Puerto La Cruz, where it intended to load a shipment of diesel. On arriving, Venezuela's military seized the vessel after Herrera declined to pay bribes to officers, crew members told Reuters.
For six months, the crew was held prisoner on board. Then, one night in February, masked soldiers raided the boat, stealing valuables and shooting Herrera. A Venezuelan court later ordered the arrest of seven officers on charges that included murder.
Herrera's death left Fortich back home in the Colombian city of Cartagena with their two young sons, one of whom has been diagnosed with autism and needs her full-time care, preventing her from working. She says that without Herrera's savings, held at Colombian pension fund Porvenir, she could lose her house.
To grant her access, Porvenir required an authenticated death certificate, which Fortich requested from Colombia's National Civil Registry. The registry told her that since Herrera died in Venezuela, the certificate had to be authenticated there. But Venezuelan authorities ignored her, she said.
She filed a lawsuit against Porvenir, the civil registry, and Colombia's foreign ministry to obtain an exemption, but in October a judge ruled against her, saying she should continue seeking the document in Venezuela.
Porvenir, in a statement, said once Fortich ""has the required documents, Porvenir will give priority attention to her case."" The civil registry did not respond to an email.
Fortich says one of her few options remaining is to ask Colombian authorities to declare Herrera dead in absentia, even though she witnessed his interment.
""The body of my husband is buried in Cartagena,"" she said. ""But I can't prove his death.""

Mark Cassayre, U.S. charge d'affaires at the U.S. mission to the U.N. in Geneva, told a council organisational meeting: ""I am pleased to inform you that this morning, Secretary (Antony) Blinken will announce that the United States will reengage with the United Nations Human Rights Council as an observer.

The forum, set up in 2006, has a permanent standing agenda item on suspected violations committed by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territories, which Washington has long wanted removed.
Since quitting, the U.S. delegation has only attended reviews to examine the human rights records of all U.N. member states - not the council's regular sessions held three times a year.

""While recognizing the Council's flaws, we know that this body has the potential to be an important forum for those fighting tyranny and injustice around the world. By being present at the table, we seek to ensure it can live up to that potential,"" Cassayre said on Monday.

672,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",Dutch freeze international adoptions after abuses uncovered,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Netherlands is freezing international adoptions after a government commission found some children had been stolen or bought from their birth parents in cases going back to the 1960s.
The commission was set up under pressure from increasing numbers of grown up adopted children who began to research their roots and often found that their birth documents had been forged or lost, or that their adoption had been illegal.
It looked at adoptions from Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia and Sri Lanka from 1967 to 1998. 
Dutch parents adopted around 40,000 children from 80 countries in the previous half century. The practice has declined in recent years, with just 145 children adopted in 2019.
In some of the most difficult cases, children adopted via intermediaries were found to have been stolen or purchased under duress from their birth parents.
Rights Minister Sander Dekker said on Monday that despite recent reforms ""too much remains out of our sight"" in some foreign countries.
""I understand that this will be painful for some people, but let us not forget the reason for this decision: by suspending adoptions we are protecting children and their biological parents,"" he said.
In a letter announcing the halt, Dekker apologised to the adopted children, adoptive parents and birth parents who were harmed in varying degrees by the practice.
""The positive sentiment around adoption in the previous century -- with the leading idea that we were doing good by adoption -- may be an explanation, but it is not a justification,"" Dekker said.
He said it would be up to the next government to decide whether any foreign adoption system could be designed that would not be vulnerable to such abuses. 
Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government resigned last month over a tax scandal and is acting in a caretaker capacity until an election due in March.

Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement on Saudi state media that the attack was aimed at ""civilians and civilian objects"" in southern Saudi Arabia.
On Sunday, the coalition, which has been battling the Houthis for nearly six years, said it had intercepted four armed drones launched towards the kingdom's southern region which borders Yemen.
The military alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis after they ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in the capital, Sanaa. 
The conflict is largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.

GAZA/RAMALLAH (Reuters) - Leaders of rival Palestinian factions began Egyptian-brokered reconciliation talks in Cairo on Monday to try to heal long-standing internal divisions, ahead of planned Palestinian elections later this year.
Egypt has tried in vain for 14 years to reconcile Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas's nationalist Fatah faction and its bitter rival Hamas, the armed Islamist movement that opposes any negotiations with Israel.
No Palestinian elections have been held in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem for 15 years. 
As well as Hamas and Fatah there are thought to be around a dozen other factions represented in the Cairo talks. Among those invited was Islamic Jihad, a militant group which boycotted the 1996 and 2006 elections and which, Palestinian sources said, is now considering whether to take part this year.
But such is the mistrust between the rivals that issues on the agenda include electoral basics such as how ballot stations will be guarded and how courts will adjudicate election disputes. 
There is widespread scepticism that the elections will even happen. 
Many Palestinians believe they are primarily an attempt by Abbas to show his democratic credentials to the new administration of President Joe Biden, with whom Abbas wants to reset relations after they reached a new low under President Donald Trump.
""There are equal chances for success and failure,"" said Hani Al-Masri, a political analyst in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, who is taking part in the talks as an independent.
Abbas's western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA), which has limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, plans to hold parliamentary elections on May 22 and a presidential vote on July 31.
There are 2.8 million eligible voters in Gaza and the West Bank, and more than 80 percent of them have so far been registered with the Central Election Commission. Palestinian voting age is 18 years old.

The last ballot in 2006 ended in a surprise win by Hamas in its first parliamentary elections. That set up a power struggle between Hamas, with its power base in Gaza, and Fatah in the West Bank.

The condemnation comes after dozens of police cases have been filed against leaders of youth-led demonstrations that have broken taboos by openly criticising the Thai king, risking prosecution under a strict law known as lese majeste that is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
Since November, at least 40 youth activists have been charged under the law, according to records compiled by the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. All of the legal cases are pending.
""We are profoundly disturbed by the reported rise in the number of lese majeste prosecutions since late 2020 and the harsher prison sentences,"" a group of seven U.N. special rapporteurs and members of a working committee on arbitrary detention said in a statement on Monday. 
The U.N. human rights office in December called on Thailand to amend the law.
Monday's statement singled out the case of Anchan Preelert, a 65-year-old woman sentenced to 43 years in prison in January in what lawyers said was the harshest punishment yet for royal insult.
The military-backed government briefly stopped using the lese majeste law in 2018, but police started to invoke it again late last year after young protesters began openly criticising the monarchy.

Thailand is officially a constitutional monarchy, but the king is revered by the predominantly Buddhist country's conservative establishment. Until recently, open criticism was extremely rare.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will hold a video call on Monday with allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, joined by envoys from Britain, the United States, Canada and Ukraine, after Russia expelled diplomats from EU states last week, diplomats said.
The meeting at 1200 GMT is likely to be the first forum for the West to consider any possible joint response to Navalny's jailing last week and Friday's expulsions, which took place while the EU's top diplomat was visiting Moscow.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a blog late on Sunday that he had learned of the expulsion of the diplomats from Germany, Poland and Sweden via social media during his talks with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Friday.
Borrell said the expulsions by Moscow, his fruitless appeals to halt them, and a denial of his request to visit Navalny had cemented his view that ""Europe and Russia are drifting apart"".
""Russia is progressively disconnecting itself from Europe and looking at democratic values as an existential threat,"" wrote Borrell, a veteran Spanish politician who had hoped the rare trip to Moscow might help to rebuild East-West ties.
""It will be for member states to decide the next steps, and yes, these could include sanctions,"" Borrell wrote in his blog.
Since the Kremlin's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in March 2014, Russia is under Western economic sanctions, with NATO accusing Moscow of seeking to undermine the West through disinformation and covert operations.
However, the West still needs Russia as an energy supplier and as a regional power in diplomacy, such as upholding the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, and tackling climate change.
Last week, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Romania and the Czech Republic pushed for fresh sanctions on Russia, with Germany, Italy and France arguing to give Moscow more time to reconsider its jailing of Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic.
On Feb. 2 Navalny was sentenced for almost three years by a court which ruled he had broken the terms of a suspended 3-1/2 year prison sentence in an embezzlement case he says was trumped up. 
Borrell's visit, which included a news conference in which Lavrov called the EU an ""unreliable partner"", is likely to have hardened attitudes in Western capitals towards Moscow.

Navalny's allies have published a list of Russian business and political figures whom they want the West to sanction. EU leaders, who have condemned Navalny's jailing, are due to discuss their response at a summit in March.

DEPOK, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian single mother Puryanti bows stiffly like a robot, as she and her five-year-old son, their bodies gleaming in silver paint, appeal to passersby for an occasional coin at a busy intersection outside the capital Jakarta.
They are among a group of people dubbed ""manusia silver"", or ""silver people"" who use the strategy to draw attention, while struggling to make ends meet after the coronavirus pushed Southeast Asia's largest economy into recession last year.
""Some give, some don't,"" said Puryanti, 29, after three months of such daily performances, accompanied by her nephew Raffi, 15. ""Sometimes someone gives enough.""
On good days, the Javanese, who was a housewife before her divorce, can earn about 70,000 rupiah ($5), enough to scrape by and pay the rent.
Puryanti uses a homemade paint, a mixture of screen-printing powder and cooking oil, to coat their bodies and add dramatic effect to the robot act. She says the silver paint causes no ill-effects. 
""I am not ashamed to work like this,"" she added. ""The important thing is this is all for my children.""
The pandemic, which brought Indonesia's first recession in more than two decades, with the economy shrinking almost 2.2% in the fourth quarter, has been tough for millions in the informal sector who need to leave their homes to make a living.
Indonesia's poor account for 26.42 million of a population of over 270 million, government statistics show, a number that grew by 1.63 million over the period from September 2019 to the March 2020 onset of the pandemic. 
Puryanti has checked with the police that she can continue to work as a ""silver person"" for now, as long as she follows coronavirus measures such as wearing a mask, but she has higher ambitions. 

""I want to have my own business,"" she added. ""I want to open a small shop but I don't have money for that.""

679,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 05:06AM ET</span>",Monks and nurses join nationwide protests against Myanmar coup,"(Reuters) - Police turned water cannon on protesters in Myanmar's capital on Monday as tens of thousands of people joined a third day of nationwide demonstrations against the military's removal of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi a week ago.
Calls to join protests and to back a campaign of civil disobedience have grown louder and more organised since last Monday's coup, which drew widespread international condemnation.
""We health workers are leading this campaign to urge all government staff to join,"" Aye Misan, a nurse at a government hospital said at a protest in the biggest city of Yangon. 
""Our message to the public is that we aim to completely abolish this military regime and we have to fight for our destiny.""
Reuters has been unable to contact the junta for comment on the protests but state media signalled possible action against them in the first comment from any government channel, saying the public wanted rid of ""wrongdoers"".
""We, the whole people who value justice, freedom, equality, peace and safety, not only refuse to accept the lawless wrongdoers but also request that they be prevented and removed through cooperation,"" the MRTV television station said in a comment. 
Though not attributed to any authority or group, it was later read out on a military-owned network.
Gatherings have been good natured and largely peaceful, unlike bloody crackdowns on previous protests, in 1988 and 2007 in particular. A convoy of military trucks was arriving in Yangon late on Sunday, raising fears that could change.
Earlier, police in the capital Naypyidaw fired brief bursts from a water cannon at a group of the protesters, video showed.
Thousands also marched also in the southeastern city of Dawei and in the Kachin state capital in the far north, the massive crowds reflecting a rejection of military rule by diverse ethnic groups, even those who have been critical of Suu Kyi and accused her government of neglecting minorities.
In Yangon, a group of saffron-robed monks, who have a history of rallying community action in the overwhelmingly Buddhist country, marched in the vanguard of protests with workers and students. They flew multicoloured Buddhist flags alongside red banners in the colour of Suu Kyi's National league for Democracy (NLD), which won a landslide election in November.
""Release Our Leaders, Respect Our Votes, Reject Military Coup,"" said one sign. Many signs were light-hearted while firmly opposed to the military intervention in politics.
The protests are the biggest since the ""Saffron Revolution"" led by monks in 2007, which led over subsequent years to the military's gradual withdrawal from politics after decades of direct rule, a process brought to a jarring halt by the Feb. 1 coup.
CALL FOR STRIKE
In a development likely to worry the military, some government workers have been seen joining doctors and some teachers in rallying to the call for a campaign of civil disobedience and strikes.
""We request government staff from all departments not to attend work from Monday,"" said activist Min Ko Naing, a veteran of the 1988 demonstrations that brought Suu Kyi to prominence.
The government lifted a day-long internet ban at the weekend. The block prompted even more anger in a country fearful of returning to the isolation and poverty before the transition to democracy began in 2011.
""Everyone uses social media and we copy what we see,"" said Paing Soe Win, 26, at a protest in Yangon where people have been brandishing the three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salute, a symbol of defiance adopted from the Hollywood movie and copied around the region.
Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy and spent nearly 15 years under house as she struggled to end almost half a century of army rule.
The 75-year-old has been kept incommunicado since army chief Min Aung Hlaing seized power in the early hours of Feb. 1 to counter what the military said was widespread fraud in the Nov. 8 election. The election commission rejected complaints of fraud.
Suu Kyi faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkies and is being held in police detention until Feb. 15. Her lawyer said he has not been allowed to see her.
The daughter of the former British colony’s independence hero Aung San, Suu Kyi remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of the Muslim Rohingya minority.
While Western governments have condemned the coup, there has been little in the way of concrete action to press the generals.
The U.N. Security Council has called for the release of Suu Kyi and other detainees and the United States is considering targeted sanctions.
Australia condemned the coup and demanded the immediate release of a citizen who was working as an economic adviser to the Suu Kyi government, who was arrested over the weekend. [L1N2KE09G]
""Protesters in Myanmar continue to inspire the world,"" Thomas Andrews, the U.N. special rapporteur on Myanmar, said on Twitter.

""Myanmar is rising up to free all who have been detained and reject military dictatorship once and for all. We are with you.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pleaded not guilty on Monday to corruption charges at the resumption of his trial, six weeks before voters again head to the polls to pass judgment on his leadership.
""I confirm the written answer submitted in my name,"" Netanyahu said, standing before the three-judge panel in the heavily guarded Jerusalem District Court.
He was referring to a document his lawyers gave the court last month in which they argued that Netanyahu, 71, was not guilty of charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud.
Wearing a coronavirus mask, Netanyahu, the first serving Israeli leader to be charged with a crime, seemed intent on projecting an air of business as usual, thanking the court and leaving without explanation some 20 minutes into the session.
Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in long-running cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage.
On entering the courtroom, Netanyahu sat in a corner with his lawyers, his back to cameras. The session itself was not broadcast but reporters could monitor a closed-circuit feed elsewhere in the building.
His quick departure from the court building seemed aimed at showing the public that he would not allow the trial to interfere with government business as Israel begins to emerge from a month-long coronavirus lockdown.
At the session, Netanyahu sat, arms crossed, and coughed occasionally into his mask, before taking it off to sip water.
Last May, at the opening of his trial, Netanyahu put on a display of defiance that opponents condemned as a challenge to the rule of law.
Before that session got under way, Netanyahu delivered a speech from a podium in the corridor, condemning his prosecution as a left-wing witch hunt aimed at ousting a right-wing prime minister as a phalanx of cabinet officials stood at his side.
This time, he issued a public appeal to supporters to stay away, citing high contagion numbers in the coronavirus pandemic.
They largely heeded his call, while dozens of opponents, some holding signs reading ""crime minister"", demanded his resignation at a protest they held near the court building.
Israel will hold its fourth parliamentary election in two years on March 23, with Netanyahu's handling of the health crisis and his alleged corruption the main issues stoking weekly protests against him.

Opinion polls show the race too close to call, as right-wing rivals and centre-left opponents muster against Israel's longest-serving leader. Netanyahu has been prime minister continuously since 2009 after a first term from 1996 to 1999.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani military helicopters continued to search for three missing climbers on the world's second highest mountain K2 on Monday, as hope of their survival faded rapidly.
Muhammad Ali Sadpara, 45, of Pakistan, John Snorri, 47, of Iceland, and Juan Pablo Mohr, 33, of Chile, were last seen Friday around noon at what is considered the most difficult part of the climb: the Bottleneck, a steep and narrow gully just 300 metres shy of the 8,611 metre (28,251 ft) high K2.
The spot is just above the ceiling of helicopters, which have been searching for three days now. 
Sadpara, one of Pakistan's most celebrated climbers who had ascended eight of the world's highest mountains, was accompanied by his 20-year-old son Sajid Sadpara, who was told by his father to climb down when an oxygen mask he was using malfunctioned.
He told repoters on Sunday he waited overnight at a camp just below the Bottleneck, believing the three had summitted and would be coming down. 
""I kept the light of my tent on at night thinking they would see it when they return,"" he said. 
""I think if they search for the bodies it makes sense to continue the operation, but their chances of surviving, if you are at 8,000 (metres) in winter for two or three days, a person's chances of surviving are next no none.""
It was the group's second attempt at climbing K2 this winter, in a season that has already seen three other climbers die in the area. 
Bulgarian Atanas Skatov's body was picked up by a helicopter on February 5, and officials believe he fell while trying to climb K2. 
Last month a team of 10 Nepali sherpas became the first people to summit K2 in the winter. 
The same day, Spanish climber Sergio Mingote, 49, died after he fell down a crevasse attempting to make his way down to Base Camp. And last month American Alex Goldfarb-Rumyantzev died trying to scale nearby Pastore Peak in preparation for attempting to summit 8,047 metre (26,400 feet) high Broad Peak.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - An alliance of Somali opposition parties proposed the creation of a national council of lawmakers, opposition leaders and civil society to govern the war-ravaged Horn of Africa nation after the president's term expired on Monday with no clear plan for succession. 
The power vacuum and divisions between political leaders was a boost to the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency, a Somali security analyst warned, citing a spate of recent attacks in a relatively peaceful part of the country. 
The opposition alliance said they would reject any attempt to extend the term of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed and suggested the council could elect a transitional leader to govern until a new president can be chosen by lawmakers. 
""We are against time extension, suppression, violence and further delay to the election,"" the alliance said in a statement. ""An election schedule should immediately without delay be displayed with agreed upon specified time.""
There was no immediate comment from the presidency. Aides had previously privately floated the idea of extending his term. 
Somalia was initially planning to hold its first direct election since civil war erupted in 1991, but delays in preparations and continuous attacks by al Shabaab forced Somalia to plan another indirect vote. 
Clan elders should have chosen lawmakers in December and the lawmakers were due to choose a president on Monday. 
But selection of lawmakers was delayed after the opposition accused President Mohamed - who was seeking a second term - of packing regional and national electoral boards with his allies.
Leaders in two of Somalia's five federal states, Puntland and Jubbaland, have said they will no longer recognise President Mohamed.
On Sunday night at midnight, the capital Mogadishu lit up with gunfire and drums as residents said they were celebrating the end of the president's term. 
""We are firing into the sky to say goodbye to the dictator Farmajo, he has burnt Somalia these four years,"" said a soldier Aden Ali, using President Mohamed's common nickname.
Hussein Sheikh Ali, Somalia's former national security advisor and founder of the Mogadishu-based Hiraal think-tank, said al Shabaab had already taken advantage of the security vacuum to launch attacks in portions of central Somalia that had been relatively peaceful for around a decade. 
""They (al Shabaab) are laughing out loud,"" he said. ""This is a failure by the president, Somalia's political elite and the international community. They didn't have a plan B to move forward."" 
On Sunday, 12 security agents were killed by a roadside bomb outside the town of Dhusamareb in central Somalia where political leaders were meeting to try to resolve disagreements over the presidential selection process. Al Shabaab also launched repeated mortar attacks on the town.

The attack came a week after four al Shabaab suicide attackers killed five people at a hotel in Mogadishu.

Women gave birth unattended in the dark because their hospital had no electricity or staff at night. 
Accounts from residents, medical workers and humanitarian groups illustrate people's plight as Ethiopia struggles to revive a heavily damaged healthcare system in Tigray three months after fighting erupted between the military and the region's former ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
Some hospitals are barely functioning, with no water, electricity or food, they said. Most were looted of medicines; staff members fled. 
""The health system in Tigray is reportedly nearly collapsing,"" the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a Feb. 4 report, noting that only three of the region's 11 hospitals were working properly. 
Ethiopian Health Minister Lia Tadesse said conditions were improving rapidly. The government has sent supplies to 70 of the region's 250 health facilities, along with 10 ambulances, she told Reuters last week. 
""So many health facilities have been looted, so we are working to get more equipment to the region,"" she said. ""The focus is to restore services, supporting health workers to come back and ensure they have the supplies."" 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed declared victory over the TPLF two months ago, but details of the devastation have been slow to emerge as communications to the region remain patchy, and the government tightly controls access for journalists and aid workers. Reuters has not been able to visit the region and could not independently verify accounts provided by residents and medical workers.
Prior to the outbreak of fighting on Nov. 4, most people in Tigray had easy access to a hospital or clinic, according to the Ministry of Health. 
The conflict disrupted basic services, including diabetes treatment and maternal care, leading to ""too many preventable deaths"", the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a Jan. 27 statement. 
Only 30 of the region's 280 ambulances are still available, according to OCHA. 
One woman described searching the northern Tigray town of Sheraro, on Dec. 22 for pills to prevent pregnancy after a friend told her she had been gang-raped by five men. 
""Not a single worker was in the hospital,"" the woman told Reuters by phone, saying she was too afraid to be identified. ""The whole hospital was looted ... Apart from the roof and doors, nothing was left."" 
She tried a health centre, but said it too had been looted.
SLOW RECOVERY
When French aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) visited the northern city of Adigrat in mid-December, the hospital was mostly deserted, it said in statement last week. There were hardly any medicines, and no food, water or money.
Some injured patients were malnourished, the group's emergency coordinator for Tigray, Albert Vinas, said in the statement. 
Some services have since resumed, but the hospital still has no chemicals for its laboratory and no therapeutic food for malnourished children, an Ethiopian medical worker stationed there told Reuters on Saturday. He asked not to be identified, because he was not authorized to speak to journalists.
Hospitals in the towns of Adwa and Axum, in central Tigray, also had no electricity or water when MSF visited. All the medicines had been stolen from Adwa hospital and furniture and equipment broken, Vinas said.
""I saw people arrive at hospital on bicycles carrying a patient from 30 km (19 miles) away, and those were the ones who managed to get to hospital,"" he said. ""People die at home."" 
MSF is now supporting four regional hospitals along with smaller health centres, and running mobile clinics in 15 locations. 
RURAL AREAS OUT OF REACH
Most rural parts of Tigray remain out of reach to humanitarian groups because of continuing insecurity, or because they lack permission to go there, aid workers told Reuters. The TPLF withdrew from the regional capital Mekelle and major cities, but low-level fighting has continued in some areas.
Ethiopia's Ministry of Peace said on Saturday that it was ""moving with urgency to approve requests for international staff movements into and within Tigray"" to ensure humanitarian assistance is expanded without delay.
A team from international aid group Action Against Hunger reached a town west of Mekelle for the first time on Jan. 23 and found it ""pretty deserted"".
""We want to start having mobile health and nutrition clinics to operate in the rural areas,"" the group's country director Panos Navrozidis told Reuters, but added security was still fragile. 
Staffing at medical facilities also remains a problem.
As many as 20 or 30 women were giving birth unattended daily in the central town of Shire because the hospital is not staffed overnight, an aid worker who visited last week told Reuters. 
Almost all healthcare workers in Tigray had gone unpaid since the conflict began, a regional government report noted on Jan. 8, and three healthcare workers told Reuters last week they had still not been paid. 
Health Minister Tadesse said money was being sent to local authorities as quickly as possible. Hospitals in Shire and Axum were functioning again, she said, although Adwa hospital remained out of service. 
Help is coming too late for some.
One woman told Reuters her 55-year-old mother died in Mekelle on Dec. 4 after the family was unable to find insulin.
Mehbrit, who asked to be identified by one name for safety reasons, said she tried hospitals, the Ethiopian Red Cross Society and other diabetics, but no one had spare insulin. 
For days, she said, she jolted awake each night to check her mother's laboured breathing. 

""I was praying to God to bring mercy in the house,"" Mehbrit said. ""The insulin came 13 days after my mother died.""

Joseph Flavill, 19, suffered a traumatic brain injury when he was hit by the car in the central English town of Burton-on-Trent on March 1 last year, about three weeks before a first national lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of the virus.
During that time his family has been largely unable to be near him and hold his hand due to coronavirus restrictions, mostly trying to communicate with him via video link.
""Recently Joseph has started to show small signs of recovery, which we are thrilled about... We know now he can hear us, he responds to small commands,"" his aunt, Sally Flavill, told Reuters.
""When we say to him 'Joseph, we can't be with you, but you are safe, this is not going to be forever', he understands, he hears you, he just can't communicate,"" she said, adding that he now signalled 'yes' with a blink and 'no' with two blinks.
Since Joseph's accident, Britain has registered nearly four million COVID-19 cases, including more than 110,000 deaths, in a pandemic that has turned life upside down worldwide, shuttering schools, universities, shops and many other places.
""I don't know how Joseph will ever understand our stories of this lockdown,"" his aunt said, adding that he was still very ill and faced a ""very, very long journey"" back to some kind of normal life.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The family of an Australian journalist arrested in China has pleaded with authorities to grant the former high-profile state TV news anchor access to her two school-age children. 
Australian authorities confirmed on Monday that Cheng Lei, 49, was arrested on Feb. 5 on suspicion of illegally supplying state secrets overseas, around six months after she was first detained in mid-August. 
""We are absolutely convinced of her innocence,"" a family representative said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
Cheng, a business news anchor on Chinese state media's English-language channel CGTN, where she had worked for almost a decade, had regularly attended business functions and embassy events for the Australian community while working in Beijing.
Payne said the Australian government ""has raised its serious concerns about Ms Cheng’s detention regularly at senior levels, including about her welfare and conditions of detention.""
Tensions between Australia and China have been high for the past year, after Canberra called for an international investigation into the source of the coronavirus pandemic and Beijing responded with trade reprisals. 
Cheng was born in China but moved with her parents to Australia as a child, and attended university in Queensland. Her children, aged nine and eleven, were visiting their grandparents in Australia amid school closures in Beijing caused by the coronavirus pandemic when the journalist was detained.
""Whilst a long time Australian citizen, Lei also has a great love for the country of her birth and is highly respected across the globe,"" the family statement said.
""We respect China’s judicial process and urge the authorities bring this matter to a swift, compassionate and timely conclusion whilst at all times respecting her rights with the knowledge that she is the mother of two young and vulnerable children who need her.""
As well as contact with her children, her family requested Cheng be given access to reading material to safeguard her mental health.
Payne said officials had visited Cheng six times during her detention, most recently at the end of January. 
Australia's former ambassador to China, Geoff Raby, said Cheng's case ""would seem to go beyond issues in the bilateral relationship"" between the two countries. 
""Support for Lei is, however, made much more difficult in the absence of high-level contact between the governments,"" Raby told Reuters.
In the days after Cheng's August detention was made public, two Australian foreign correspondents were flown out of China, helped by Australian consular officials after the pair were questioned by China’s state security ministry.
China's Foreign Ministry subsequently revealed that Australia's security agency had questioned Chinese journalists working in Australia in the weeks before Cheng was detained.

Another Australian, writer Yang Hengjun, is facing trial in Beijing on espionage charges that he denies, after being arrested in January 2019 at Guangzhou airport.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Myanmar authorities should immediately release Sean Turnell, an economist and adviser to deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi, following his weekend arrest, Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Monday.
Turnell said on Saturday he was being detained, the first known arrest of a foreign national since the Feb. 1 military coup that overthrew Suu Kyi's elected government.
Australia - which summoned Myanmar’s ambassador over the detention - has been in contact with Turnell, Payne said.
""We have called for the immediate release of Australian citizen Professor Turnell from detention in Myanmar. Our embassy has been providing Professor Turnell with extensive support during this ordeal,"" Payne told reporters in Sydney.
Turnell is a professor of economics at Macquarie University in Sydney and has been advising Suu Kyi on economic policy for several years.
Payne did not specify where Turnell was being held but she earlier said an unnamed Australian was being held at a police station.
Police fired a water cannon at protesters in the Myanmar capital Naypyidaw on Monday as tens of thousands of people across the country joined a third day of demonstrations against the military's removal of Suu Kyi's government a week ago.
Turnell told Reuters on Saturday he expected to be charged following his detention.

""I guess you will soon hear of it, but I am being detained,"" Turnell said. ""Being charged with something, but not sure what. I am fine and strong, and not guilty of anything,"" he said, with a smile emoji.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorean economist Andres Arauz on Sunday won a first round victory in the country's presidential election, moving the Andean nation a step closer to socialism following years of austerity measures made more painful by the pandemic. 
The 36-year-old protege of former president Rafael Correa advances to an April 11 run-off, but it was still too close to call whether he would face environmental activist Yaku Perez or conservative banker Guillermo Lasso.
The surprisingly strong showing by Perez, whose is running on a platform of banning industrial mining, shakes up an election that has so far been defined by dueling ideologies of social welfare versus free markets.
National Electoral Council Diana Atamaint said the quick count showed Arauz with 31.5% of the vote, Perez with 20.04% and Lasso with 19.97%. The count was based on some 2,400 poll statements from a representative sample of voting centers. 
But the council's web-site as of 10 p.m. EST showed that it had only processed around 17% of the votes. 
Shortly after the announcement, Perez told reporters that he had won enough votes to enter the second round, and said he was holding a vigil outside the election council's headquarters in Quito to prevent vote manipulation. 
""We've come with a plan to hold a vigil, in an active and respectful manner, but to defend the will of the vast majority of Ecuadoreans who see hope for a change,"" said Perez. 
Lasso led a celebratory rally from the country's biggest city, Guayaquil, where supporters shouted ""Second round"" and ""Lasso president.""
""When we see 100% of the poll statements reviewed, it will be reconfirmed that we are in the second round,"" Lasso said.
President Lenin Moreno, a former Correa ally, drove a pro-market agenda in hopes of reviving a sluggish and heavily indebted economy. His efforts sparked an angry backlash, with a proposed fuel hike leading to violent street protests in 2019.
Moreno, who took office in 2017, did not seek a second term.
To avoid the April 11 runoff, Arauz needed more than 50% of valid votes, or 40% total with 10 percentage points more than the runner-up.
A brutal coronavirus outbreak last year left bodies uncollected on the streets of Guayaquil. 

Lockdowns around the world slashed fuel demand and prices for oil, Ecuador's main export, battering an economy also reeling from sharp cuts to government spending.

QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuadorean economist Andres Arauz on Monday prepared to campaign for a presidential run-off election as authorities continued counting votes to determine whether he would face a conservative banker or an environmental activist. 
The race for runner-up between pro-market candidate Guillermo Lasso and anti-mining indigenous leader Yaku Perez was too close to call, with Perez ahead by less than one percentage point and manual recounts appearing likely.
Perez's strong performance marks the best-ever showing for an indigenous presidential candidate and throws open a race that had been for months been defined by ideological rifts between free markets on one hand and socialist largesse on the other.
Elections council figures early on Monday morning showed that with 81.25% of the vote counted, Arauz had 32.33% of votes compared with 19.80% for Perez and 19.33% for Lasso. 
Perez and his supporters began a vigil on Sunday night outside a Quito hotel where election authorities were counting votes, vowing to prevent voter fraud from getting in the way of his advancing to the April 11 runoff.
Lasso in a celebratory rally in his home city of Guayaquil vowed that a full review of poll statements would show he would make the runoff.
Either candidate could request hand recounts.
Arauz, 36, a protege of former president Rafael Correa, has promised to make direct cash payments of $1,000 to 1 million families upon taking office, and says he will disavow the conditions of a $6.5 billion IMF financing package.
Lasso has promised to spur the economy with increased foreign investment and tax reductions. 
Perez' activism has focused on protecting rivers from mining, and has promised to balance the country's fiscal accounts by recovering funds stolen under previous governments. 
Also making a surprise showing was little-known businessman, Xavier Hervas, a center-left candidate who drew 16% of the vote despite never having run for office.
President Lenin Moreno, a former Correa ally who was elected in 2017, did not seek a second term.
Financial markets are watching, and Arauz's rhetoric has already sparked a bond selloff.
He has said he will continue paying the country's debts, but has said social investment will take priority and also has called for an investigation of last year's $17.4 billion bond restructuring.

Last month, Ecuadorean bonds were the worst performers among the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) EMBI Global Diversified index, with a -15% total return.

690,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 08, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>","After a decade of change in Myanmar, fear of the past drives anti-coup protests","(Reuters) - A communications blackout, the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi without word, wild rumours fed by a paucity of information. 
All recalled the darkest days of a succession of military juntas that ruled Myanmar during half a century of ruinous isolation - driving many people to mass protests in fear that such times could return.
That included a Generation Z who grew up with somewhat greater freedom and prosperity in what nonetheless remains one of Southeast Asia's poorest and most restrictive countries. 
“We don’t want a dictatorship for the next generation or for us,” said Thaw Zin, a 21-year-old among the sea of people massed in the shadow of Sule Pagoda in the center of the commercial capital of Yangon on Sunday.
Some carried posters that read: “You fucked with the wrong generation”.
Shaking with emotion, Thaw Zin said, “If we don’t stand this time for our country, our people, there is no one. Evil will fall on us. We will never forgive them for the trouble they have brought to us.”
Myanmar's army seized power last Monday, detaining Suu Kyi and halting an unsteady transition to democracy, citing unsubstantiated fraud in the election landslide won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy in November.
Successive military juntas ruled Myanmar from 1962 until 2011, when a quasi-civilian government started opening up the country and its economy after Suu Kyi was freed from a spell of what totalled nearly 15 years under house arrest.
In 2012, only 1.1 per cent of the population used the internet and few people had telephones, according to the International Telecommunication Union. 
But after liberalisation in 2013, the price of SIM cards dropped from more than $200 to as little as $2 almost overnight. By 2016, nearly half the population had cell phones and most were smartphones with internet access.
Pre-publication censorship was abolished and private media proliferated. While journalists remained under heavy scrutiny and arrests continued, it was a far cry from the days when the only news was state-produced propaganda that glorified the generals and lambasted “foreign axe-handles of the West”.
After the military seized power, activists responded with calls for a mass civil disobedience movement that spread rapidly online, something that would not have been possible before.
The parliament that had been due to be sworn in on Monday, the day of coup, held a symbolic first session by Zoom.
Anger over the internet shutdown on Saturday – so reminiscent of the old days – drove both older generations all too familiar with isolation and younger ones suddenly cut off.
“Most of us youths work at I.T companies,” said one 22-year-old protester. “Since the whole server is shutdown, we can’t do anything. It affects our business as well as our opportunities.”
'WE HATE DICTATORSHIP'
“We all know how terrible it was,” said 40-year-old Maw Maw Aung, who was also among the crowds beside Sule Pagoda, of direct army rule. “We cannot live under the boot of the military. We hate dictatorship. We really hate it.”
She remembered the legacy of crippled education and healthcare systems under the junta. When the World Health Organization last did rankings, in 2008, Myanmar’s health system came last.
“We lived in fear everyday,” she said. “We are behind our neighboring countries in everything.”
As the generals shut the internet on Saturday, echoes of the old era reappeared.
Activists and politicians went into hiding. Wild rumours began to spread: that various high-profile NLD leaders were dead, that Suu Kyi had been freed, and the army chief toppled.
Without explanation on Sunday evening, the internet was switched back on. But there was no sign of the protests abating. Many are fearful about what comes next: previous uprisings against the military – in 1988 and 2007 – have been subdued with deadly force. 
“With the anti-coup protests gaining steam, we can well imagine the reaction to come,” author and historian Thant Myint-U wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).

“But Myanmar society is completely different from 1988 and even 2007,” he said. “I have tremendous faith in today’s younger generation. Anything is possible.""

TALLINN (Reuters) - Small Estonian firm Fermi Energia said on Monday it was raising capital to start the official planning process for a new generation small modular reactor (SMR) which would be one of the first in Europe and the first nuclear plant in Estonia.
The small EU member state of 1.3 million people has for decades generated most of its energy from burning oil shale.
""Estonia has set an ambitious goal to end electricity production from oil shale by 2035,"" Fermi Chief Executive Kalev Kallemets told Reuters. ""The reactor would solve this challenge for Estonia and is relevant for the wider region.""
Fermi aims to apply to the government to start the planning process in late 2021, with the process -- which includes environmental, societal, economic and national security reviews -- expected to take up to five years.
""This matches the timeframe of technology development as small modular reactor technology is expected to become available for deployment by 2028,"" Kallemets said.
Fermi could then start construction in 2030 and the plant would be producing electricity in 2035, he said. 
The company has so far raised 560,000 euros from private investors and U.S. venture capital fund Last Energy VC. On Monday the firm said it seeks to raise 1 million euros through crowdfunding platform Funderbeam.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial resumes on Monday, when Israel's longest-serving leader will have to enter his plea to charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
Involving secret recordings, media moguls, gifts of cigars and champagne and aides' betrayals, the three corruption cases have all the makings of a political thriller. 
WILL IT BRING HIM DOWN?
Netanyahu has managed to stay in office throughout the investigations and three election campaigns - with a fourth election due on March 23. 
He denies wrongdoing and a trial is likely to take years. He will fight to remain prime minister in March and possibly for years afterwards. If he wins, he could try to secure parliamentary immunity, or pass laws to exempt a serving prime minister from standing trial.
HOW HAS HE REMAINED IN OFFICE? 
Under Israeli law, a prime minister is under no obligation to stand down unless convicted. No other government minister is protected in this way, so there are legal and political reasons why Netanyahu wants to stay at the top. 
DO ISRAELIS CARE?
Yes. The corruption case has had a polarising impact on Israelis. Thousands of demonstrators gather weekly outside his official residence and across Israel under the banner of ""Crime Minister"", demanding he quit. 
But his right-wing voter base has stayed loyal. Supporters see the man they call King Bibi as strong on security and an influential voice for Israel abroad.
WHAT ARE THE CHARGES? 
CASE 4000 alleges Netanyahu granted regulatory favours worth around 1.8 billion shekels (about $500 million) to telecommunications company Bezeq Telecom Israel. In return, prosecutors say, he sought positive coverage of himself and wife Sara on a news website controlled by the company's former chairman, Shaul Elovitch. 
In this case, Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Elovitch and his wife, Iris, have been charged with bribery and obstruction of justice. The couple deny wrongdoing. 
CASE 1000, in which Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust, centres on allegations that he and his wife wrongfully received almost 700,000 shekels worth of gifts from Arnon Milchan, a Hollywood producer and Israeli citizen, and Australian billionaire businessman James Packer. 
Prosecutors said gifts included champagne and cigars and that Netanyahu helped Milchan with his business interests. Packer and Milchan face no charges. 
CASE 2000 alleges Netanyahu negotiated a deal with Arnon Mozes, owner of Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, for better coverage and that, in return, he offered legislation that would slow the growth of a rival newspaper. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust. Mozes has been charged with offering a bribe, and denies wrongdoing. 
WHAT DOES NETANYAHU SAY? 
Netanyahu says he is the victim of a politically orchestrated ""witch hunt"" by the left and media to oust him from office, and that receiving gifts from friends is not against the law.
COULD HE GO TO JAIL?
Bribery charges carry a jail sentence of up to 10 years and/or a fine. Fraud and breach of trust carry a sentence of up to three years.
WILL A VERDICT COME SOON? 

Unlikely. The trial could take years. But proceedings could be cut short if Netanyahu seeks a plea deal.

The Philippines in November suspended its decision to terminate the VFA for a second time to allow it to work with Washington on a long-term mutual defence pact.
""The suspension was intended that we should continue working and I am narrowing down the issues and soon we will meet...and iron out whatever differences we have,"" Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin told ANC news channel on Monday, adding a meeting was likely in the last week of February. 
He declined to elaborate on the terms of a potential agreement. 
President Rodrigo Duterte notified Washington in February last year that he was cancelling the deal amid outrage over a senator and ally being denied a U.S. visa.
But he has extended the termination process, which has now reached U.S. President Joe Biden's term.
The VFA provides the legal framework under which U.S. troops can operate on a rotational basis in the country and experts say without it their other bilateral defence agreements, including the Mutual Defence Treaty (MDT), cannot be implemented.
Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken stressed the importance of the MDT and its clear application if Manila came under attack in the South China Sea.
Blinken's comments came as Manila had filed a diplomatic protest over China's passing of a law allowing its coastguard to open fire on foreign vessels, describing it as a ""threat of war"".
China claims almost all of the South China Sea, which is a major trade route. The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.

Locsin said he would continue to press for a code of conduct in the disputed waters that ""will never exclude"" the United States to ensure the balance of power between Washington and Beijing in the region.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken will announce on Monday that the United States will return to the Geneva-based council as an observer, a senior State Department official said on Sunday.
""We intend to do so knowing that the most effective way to reform and improve the Council is to engage with it in a principled fashion,"" the official said.
""We know that the Council has the potential to be an important forum for those fighting tyranny and injustice around the world. By being present at the table, we seek to reform it and ensure it can live up to that potential,"" the official said.
The plan was first reported by the Associated Press.
Trump, a Republican whose ""America First"" agenda contributed to his decisions to withdraw from multiple international organizations and agreements, quit the Human Rights Council in 2018 - halfway through its three year term - over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform.
The 193-member U.N. General Assembly is due to elect new members to the council later this year. Members are elected for three years and cannot serve more than two consecutive terms. Candidates are elected by secret ballot in geographical groups to ensure even representation.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and the leaders of Germany's 16 federal states are due to meet virtually on Wednesday to discuss whether to ease the restrictions from Feb. 15, or extend a lockdown that began in mid-December. 
""I think, basically, the lockdown will have to be extended for the time being,"" Soeder told broadcaster ARD.
""There is no point in just breaking it off now. Imagine: we open everything in one fell swoop, then within two, three weeks we will be in a situation maybe even worse than before,"" he said. ""If we make a mistake now, we will have a third wave.""

Wednesday's meeting would nonetheless have to produce a vision for a way out of lockdown, but how to do so would have to be discussed, Soeder said. Once a role model for fighting the pandemic, Germany is still struggling with a second wave.

Prime Minister Joseph Jouthe told a news conference at his private residence that a senior police official was also among the 23 people detained with money, guns and ammunition.
""These people had contacted national palace security officials, high-ranking officers of the national palace whose mission was to arrest the president ... and also to facilitate the installation of a new president,"" Jouthe said, speaking alongside the minister of justice and the chief of police. 
President Moise, speaking later at the Port-Au-Prince airport on his way to launch the annual carnival in the coastal town of Jacmel, said the plotters' aim was to make an ""attempt on my life"".
The arrests come after leading opposition figures this week announced a plan to replace Moise with a new head of state, accusing the president of being authoritarian and presiding over economic chaos in the Western hemisphere's poorest country.
Earlier on Sunday, anti-government demonstrators in Port-Au-Prince clashed with police, who responded with tear gas. There were also street protests against Moise in some other towns.
The opposition plan called for members of civil society and opposition leaders to pick a new president from one of the sitting Supreme Court judges, instead of waiting for general elections scheduled for September.
Moise, who has ruled by decree since mid-January, has stated he would hand over power to the winner of the elections but would not step down until his term expires in 2022.
The U.S. government on Friday urged talks to resolve the crisis while underlining ""a new elected president should succeed President Moise when his term ends on February 2nd, 2022.""
Moise has also put in place plans to hold a referendum on amending the constitution in April, with the opposition voicing concerns the vote will not be free or fair and could give Moise too much power.
Haiti has been badly hit by a crippling economic crisis made worse by the coronavirus pandemic.

The country has also been paralyzed over the past year by a spike in kidnappings and a sharp rise in overall crime, which has weighed on the economy and dealt a huge blow to the quality of life for ordinary people.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's state-backed Human Rights Commission said on Sunday that three young Shi'ite Muslims sentenced to death when they were minors have had the penalty reduced to 10 years in prison.
Ali Al-Nimr, the nephew of prominent Shi'ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr whose 2016 execution sparked demonstrations in Saudi Arabia and Iran, was 17 when he was detained in February 2012 for participating in protests in the country's Eastern Province.
Along with Dawood al-Marhoun and Abdullah al-Zaher, 17 and 15 when they were arrested, Nimr was sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court and faced beheading.
Nimr has served more than nine years in jail since his arrest. His sentence was commuted on Sunday, while Marhoun's and Zaher's were commuted in November 2020, the HRC told Reuters. 
Time served would apply in all three cases, the HRC said, and they would be released in 2022.
""Freedom soon, God willing,"" Nimr's mother said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post celebrating the news.
The government's Center for International Communications (CIC) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The move comes more than five months after the Saudi public prosecutor ordered a review of the death penalties issued against all three.
The review followed a royal decree last year that individuals sentenced to death for crimes committed while minors would instead serve up to 10 years in juvenile detention centres.
However, the decree was never carried on state media nor published in the official gazette as would be normal practice.
Human rights groups and western lawmakers had repeatedly raised concerns about its implementation, as Nimr, Marhoun, Zaher and two other juvenile offenders had yet to have their death sentences revoked. 
One of the five has appealed and eight others originally detained as minors still face charges that could result in execution, rights groups who follow the cases closely told Reuters in January. 
The HRC on Sunday reiterated that the royal decree would be applied retroactively to all cases where an individual was sentenced to death for offences committed under the age of 18.
Anti-death penalty charity Reprieve welcomed the news, but cautioned that the kingdom should ensure the decree was applied to all juvenile offenders. 
""True change isn't about a few high-profile cases; it means making sure no-one is ever sentenced to death for a childhood 'crime' again in Saudi Arabia,"" Reprieve director Maya Foa said.

Although Saudi Arabia executed a record 185 people in 2019, the HRC said in January that it had reduced the number by 85% in 2020, noting it had documented 27 executions.

700,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2021 02:56PM ET</span>",Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz dies at 100,"By Will Dunham
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - George Shultz, the U.S. secretary of state who survived bitter infighting in President Ronald Reagan's administration to help forge a new era in American-Soviet relations and bring on the end of the Cold War, died on Saturday at age 100, the California-based Hoover Institute said.
A man of broad experience and talents, Shultz achieved success in statesmanship, business and academia. Lawmakers praised him for opposing as sheer folly the sale of arms to Iran that were the cornerstone of the Iran-Contra scandal that marred Reagan's second term in office.
His efforts as America's top diplomat from 1982 to 1989 under the Republican Reagan helped lead to the conclusion of the four-decade-long Cold War that began after World War Two, pitting the United States and its allies against the Soviet Union and the communist bloc and generating fears of a global nuclear conflict.
Shultz, a steady, patient and low-key man who became one of the longest-serving secretaries of state, steered to completion a historic treaty scrapping superpower medium-range nuclear missiles and set a pattern for dealings between Moscow and Washington that made human rights a routine agenda item.
He achieved the rare feat of holding four Cabinet posts, also serving as secretary of the Treasury, as secretary of labor and as director of the Office of Management and Budget.
His record as secretary of state was tempered by his failure to bring peace to the Middle East and Central America, areas in which he personally invested considerable effort.
Shultz remained active into his 90s through a position at Stanford University's Hoover Institution think tank and various boards. He also wrote books and took stands against the Cuban embargo, climate change and Britain's departure from the European Union.
His most recent book, written with James Timbie, a longtime State Department adviser and published in November 2020 ahead of Shultz's 100th birthday, was entitled ""A Hinge of History."" It suggested the world was at a pivot point not unlike the one it faced at the end of the second World War.
""We seem to be in an upset state of affairs where it's hard to get things accomplished,"" he told the New York Times, lamenting the Trump administration’s resistance to international accords. ""They seem to be skeptical of these agreements, of any agreement. Agreements aren't usually perfect. You don't get everything you want. You compromise a little bit. But they're way better than nothing.""
SERVED EISENHOWER, NIXON BEFORE REAGAN
Before joining the Reagan administration, the New York City native served in senior positions under Republican President Richard Nixon, who made him labor secretary (1969–70), the first director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (1970–72) and treasury secretary (1972–1974). He previously was on Republican President Dwight Eisenhower's Council of Economic Advisers.
Shultz's background was in economics. After leaving the Nixon administration in 1974, he went to Bechtel Corp, the international construction firm, eventually becoming its president. He stayed there until Reagan asked him to replace Alexander Haig, who resigned under pressure as secretary of state in 1982.
Shultz was unable to stop the arms-for-hostages deals with Iran that generated funds for the Contra rebels fighting against Nicaragua's leftist government. He did help broker agreements that eased the disputes of Nicaragua's civil war.
The arms sales to Iran came during an arms embargo on that country. The proceeds from the sales were secretly diverted to the Contra rebels at a time when Congress had banned such funding. National security adviser John Poindexter and aide Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North took the blame for the scheme.
Shultz told a 1987 congressional hearing that he was lied to repeatedly by the head of the CIA and Reagan's national security advisers who withheld information from him and the president in order to keep the Iran arms sales going.
Shultz previously had advocated support for the U.S.-backed Contra rebels, known to Reagan's team as ""freedom fighters.""
Asked whether the United States had benefited from the Iran-Contra efforts to fund the rebels, Shultz bluntly told lawmakers, ""I don't think desirable ends justify means of lying, deceiving, of doing things that are outside our constitutional processes.""
He said he threatened to resign three times during the scandal. But, believing Reagan needed him, Shultz stayed to try to mend the damage to U.S. foreign policy. His price: reassertion of State Department power over foreign policy.
RIVALRY WITH WEINBERGER
Shultz steadily accumulated power, sometimes at the expense of Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, a Reagan confidant once seen as his chief administration rival.
He won control of policy in the Middle East, resulting in a diplomatic campaign to isolate Iran that led to a U.N. ceasefire order in the lengthy Iran-Iraq war. Shultz's tough stance was adopted by Reagan when U.S. planes bombed targets in Libya in April 1986 over Weinberger's opposition.
Weinberger won and Shultz lost when Reagan opted in 1986 not to be bound by the unratified 1979 SALT-2 arms control treaty.
In achieving the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in 1987 and helping forge new relations with the Kremlin, Shultz prevailed over hard-liners. The Cold War ended in 1989 after he had left office and the Soviet Union broke up in 1991.
Shultz had degrees from Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and taught at MIT and the University of Chicago. Following his State Department stint, Shultz became an economics professor at Stanford.
Born in New York on Dec. 13, 1920, the son of a historian, Shultz joined the Marine Corps in World War Two. He met Army nurse Helena O'Brien in the Pacific and they were married in 1946 and had three daughters and two sons.
A man of usually impassive demeanor, Shultz was an enigma to the public and intimates alike. Revealing moments were rare, such as when State Department colleagues bid him an emotional farewell on Jan. 19, 1989, at the end of Reagan's presidency.
Visibly moved, he clutched the arm of his wife, who accompanied him on his many travels. ""We came as a package deal and we leave as a package,"" Shultz said.
Helena died in 1995 and Shultz married San Francisco socialite Charlotte Mailliard Swig in 1997.
He had a love of dancing, swimming, tennis and quirky clothes, such as a peach-colored sports coat and multicolored golf slacks.

His most tantalizing accouterment was said to be a tiger tattoo on his left buttock, a souvenir of his student days at Princeton University, whose mascot is a tiger. Shultz was coy about whether he really had one, but he did not deny it.

DUBAI/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday that Tehran's ""final and irreversible"" decision was to return to compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal only if Washington lifts sanctions on the Islamic Republic, Iranian state TV reported. 
The comment, as well as U.S. President Joe Biden's separate statement that the United States would not lift sanctions simply to get Iran back to the negotiating table, appeared to be posturing by both sides as they weigh whether and how to revive the pact.
The deal between Iran and six major powers limited Iran's uranium enrichment activity to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear arms - an ambition Iran has long denied having - in return for the easing of U.S. and other sanctions. 
But former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, denouncing it as one-sided in Iran's favour, and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. 
""Iran has fulfilled all its obligations under the deal, not the United States and the three European countries ... If they want Iran to return to its commitments, the United States must in practice ... lift all sanctions,"" state TV quoted Khamenei as saying during a meeting with Air Force commanders. 
""Then, after verifying whether all sanctions have been lifted correctly, we will return to full compliance ... It is the irreversible and final decision and all Iranian officials have consensus over it.""
While Iran has insisted the United States first drop its sanctions before it resumes compliance, Washington has demanded the reverse.
In a segment of a CBS News interview taped on Friday and broadcast on Sunday, Biden said ""no"" when asked whether Washington would lift sanctions to get Tehran to the negotiating table.
Asked if Iran had to stop enriching uranium first, Biden nodded. It was not clear exactly what he meant, since Iran was allowed to enrich uranium to 3.67% under the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).
A senior U.S. official later said Biden meant Iran had to stop enriching beyond the deal's limits, not that it had to stop enriching entirely before the two sides might talk.
""They have to stop enriching beyond the limits of the JCPOA,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""There is nothing changed in the U.S. position. The United States wants Iran to come back into (compliance with) its JCPOA commitments and if it does, the United States will do the same.""
Iran in January said it has resumed 20% uranium enrichment at its underground Fordow nuclear site, well above the deal's limit but far short of the 90% that is weapons-grade.
In response to Trump's withdrawal, Tehran has breached the deal's key limits by building up its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, refining uranium to a higher level of purity and using advanced centrifuges for enrichment.
Biden has said if Tehran returned to strict compliance, Washington would follow suit and use that as a springboard to a broader agreement on other areas of concern for Washington including Iran's missile development and regional activities.
Those activities include support for proxies in conflicts roiling countries such as Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.

Iran has said it could quickly reverse its JCPOA violations if U.S. sanctions are removed but has ruled out talks on its missile programme and its influence in the Middle East, where Iran and Saudi Arabia have fought proxy wars for decades.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 07, 2021 08:47AM ET</span>","Protests sweep Myanmar to oppose coup, support Suu Kyi","(Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people rallied across Myanmar on Sunday to denounce last week's coup and demand the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, in the biggest protests since the 2007 Saffron Revolution that helped lead to democratic reforms.
In a second day of widespread protests, crowds in the biggest city, Yangon, sported red shirts, red flags and red balloons, the colour of Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy Party (NLD).
""We don’t want military dictatorship! We want democracy!"" they chanted.
On Sunday afternoon, the junta ended a day-long blockade of the internet that had further inflamed anger since the coup last Monday that has halted the Southeast Asian nation's troubled transition to democracy and drawn international outrage.
Pope Francis expressed ""solidarity with the people"" on Sunday and asked Myanmar's leaders to seek ""democratic"" harmony.
Massive crowds from all corners of Yangon gathered in townships, filling streets as they headed towards the Sule Pagoda at the heart of the city, also a rallying point during the Buddhist monk-led 2007 protests and others in 1988.
A line of armed police with riot shields set up barricades, but did not try to stop the demonstration. Some marchers presented police with flowers. One officer was photographed giving a surreptitious three-finger salute.
Protesters gestured with the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of protest against the coup. Drivers honked their horns and passengers held up photos of Suu Kyi.
""We don’t want a dictatorship for the next generation,"" said 21-year-old Thaw Zin. ""We will not finish this revolution until we make history. We will fight to the end.""
There was no comment from the junta in the capital Naypyidaw, more than 350 km (220 miles) north of Yangon and state-run television news carried no mention of the protests.
An internal note for U.N. staff estimated that 1,000 people joined a protest in Naypyidaw while there were 60,000 in Yangon alone. Protests were reported in the second city of Mandalay and many towns and even villages across the country of 53 million people that stretches from Indian Ocean islands to the fringes of the Himalayas. The Yangon protesters dispersed after dark.
The demonstrations have largely been peaceful, unlike the bloody crackdowns seen in 1998 and 2007.
But shots were heard in the southeastern town of Myawaddy as uniformed police with guns charged a group of a couple of hundred protesters, live video showed. Pictures of protesters afterwards showed what appeared to be rubber bullet injuries.
'ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE'
""Anti-coup protests show every sign of gaining steam. On the one hand, given history, we can well expect the reaction to come,"" wrote author and historian Thant Myint-U on Twitter. 
""On the other, Myanmar society today is entirely different from 1988 and even 2007. Anything's possible.""
With no internet and official information scarce, rumours swirled about the fate of Suu Kyi and her cabinet. A story that she had been released drew crowds out to celebrate on Saturday, but it was quickly quashed by her lawyer.
Suu Kyi, 75, faces charges of illegally importing six walkie-talkies and is being held in police detention for investigation until Feb. 15. Her lawyer said he has not been allowed to see her.
She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy, and spent nearly 15 years under house arrest during decades of struggling to end almost half a century of army rule before the start of a troubled transition to democracy in 2011.
Army commander Min Aung Hlaing carried out the coup on the grounds of fraud in a Nov. 8 election in which Suu Kyi's party won a landslide. The electoral commission dismissed the allegations of malpractice.
More than 160 people have been arrested since the military seized power, said Thomas Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on Myanmar.
""The generals are now attempting to paralyse the citizen movement of resistance - and keep the outside world in the dark - by cutting virtually all internet access,"" Andrews said in a statement on Sunday.
""We must all stand with the people of Myanmar in their hour of danger and need. They deserve nothing less.""
Pope Francis, who met Min Aung Hlaing during a visit to Myanmar in 2017, appeared to come down against the military leaders at his Sunday address, saying he prayed the leadership would promote a ""harmonious and democratic co-existence.""

There are fewer than 800,000 Roman Catholics in the predominantly Buddhist country.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - It's Saturday night in Jerusalem and a group of protesters dressed in fluorescent pink are preparing to join a weekly demonstration outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's official residence demanding he quit.
They call themselves ""The Pink Front"", and participate in anti-Netanyahu protests that are held across the country each Saturday, drawing thousands of people calling for Israel's longest-serving leader to step down over corruption allegations, which he denies.
Many Pink Front members are artists and performers, a community that has been hit hard by coronavirus lockdowns.
With theatres closed, the demonstration becomes a street performance venue. Amid a splash of pink bandannas, flags and shirts, other groups wear black to lament Netanyahu's continued stewardship, permitted by law, while under criminal indictment.
The demonstrations begin peacefully but often end with police moving in to arrest protesters who refuse to disperse.
At one protest, Sharon Saguy, 54, a flamenco dancer and choreographer, is surrounded by activists painting their faces pink.
She teaches them that night's rhythm as they bang on their makeshift drums. On some nights she shows up as a ""Goddess of Justice"" in a golden-green gown with a matching crown, coronavirus mask and scales of justice. 
""Creativity is a way of life,"" Saguy says from her home in Jerusalem, where a megaphone and pink protest outfits sit beside her flamenco costumes. 
Pink Front has a few thousand supporters on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Pink, group members say, represents love, optimism and female leadership. Netanyahu has called the protesters ""anarchists"", accusing them of failing to take coronavirus precautions at the demonstrations and seeking to topple a democratically-elected leader.
Karin Brauner, 34, a set and costume designer and Pink Front member who crafts some of the protesters' outfits, shrugs off criticism from Netanyahu, who is seeking a sixth term in a March 23 election.

""Through our optimism and the smart performances, we can make a great impact, because those who don't agree with us, we make them listen,"" she said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - As many as 150 people were feared dead in northern India after a Himalayan glacier broke and swept away a hydroelectric dam on Sunday, with floods forcing the evacuation of villages downstream.
A witness reported a wall of dust, rock and water as an avalanche roared down the Dhauli Ganga river valley located more than 500 km (310 miles) in the state of Uttarakhand, north of New Delhi.
""It came very fast, there was no time to alert anyone,"" Sanjay Singh Rana, who lives on the upper reaches of the river in Raini village told Reuters by phone. ""I felt that even we would be swept away.""
Om Prakash, chief secretary of Uttarakhand, said 100 to 150 people were feared dead but the actual number had not yet been confirmed. 
State police chief Ashok Kumar told reporters more than 50 people working at the dam, the Rishiganga Hydroelectric Project, were among those feared dead though some others had been rescued. Kumar also said authorities had evacuated other dams to contain the water rushing in from the flooded Alakananda river.
Uttarakhand is prone to flash floods and landslides and the latest disaster prompted calls by environment groups for a review of power projects in the ecologically sensitive mountains. 
State utility NTPC said Sunday's avalanche had damaged a part of its Tapovan Vishnugad hydropower plant that was under construction further down the river. It gave no details but said the situation is being monitored continuously.
India's air force was being readied to help with rescue operations while disaster-response teams were airlifted in to help with relief and rescue. Army soldiers have already been deployed and helicopters were doing reconnaissance.
""India stands with Uttarakhand and the nation prays for everyone’s safety there,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Twitter.
Footage shared by locals showed the water washing away parts of the Rishiganga dam as well as whatever else was in its path.
Videos on social media, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed water surging through a small dam site, washing away construction equipment.
""Currently no additional water flows are being reported and there is no flood situation anywhere,"" Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said.
""No loss has been reported from villages along Alaknanda.""
The neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous, put its riverside areas on high alert.
'HIMALAYAN TSUNAMI'
It was not immediately clear what had set off the avalanche at a time when it is not the flood season. In June 2013, record monsoon rains in Uttarakhand caused devastating floods that claimed close to 6,000 lives.
That disaster was dubbed the ""Himalayan tsunami"" because of the torrents of water unleashed in the mountainous area, which sent mud and rocks crashing down, burying homes, sweeping away buildings, roads and bridges.
Uma Bharti, India's former water resources minister and a senior leader of Modi's party, criticised the construction of a power project in the area.
""When I was a minister I had requested that Himalaya is a very sensitive place, so power projects should not be built on Ganga and its main tributaries,"" she said on Twitter, referring to the main river that flows from the mountain.
Environmental experts called for a halt to big hydroelectric projects in the state.
""This disaster again calls for a serious scrutiny of the hydropower dams building spree in this eco-sensitive region,"" said Ranjan Panda, a volunteer for the Combat Climate Change Network that works on water, environment and climate change issues.

""The government should no longer ignore warnings from experts and stop building hydropower projects and extensive highway networks in this fragile ecosystem.""

""What we won't do is reopen the controversial dossiers,"" Petros Mavromichalis told the Swiss newspaper. ""The negotiations are done.""
Switzerland has said in the past it seeks clarifications on issues including state aid, EU citizens' access to Swiss welfare benefits and unilateral Swiss rules designed to protect the country's high-wage labour market from competition from cross-border workers.
Mavromichalis said Swiss demands including requiring companies from the European Union to register their intent to work in Switzerland eight days in advance are unacceptable, saying a four-day registration rule is sufficient.
""Four days are long enough,"" he said, adding that a requirement that EU companies also pay a deposit before working in Switzerland to cover prospective financial penalties for breaking work rules is out of the question.
""When you assume that a company is criminal just because it isn't Swiss, that's rather insulting,"" Mavromichalis told Blick.
The unresolved treaty would formalise ties in five areas - free movement of people, civil aviation, land transport, mutual recognition of industrial standards and processed farm goods. Switzerland would agree to take on EU single market rules in these areas.

It has been long delayed on opposition from right-wing Euroskeptics who oppose immigration from the bloc, as well as labour unions wary of any deal that could allow wage dumping by companies based beyond high-cost Switzerland.

The protests began last month over Erdogan's appointment of Melih Bulu, an academic and former political candidate, as rector of Istanbul's Bogazici University. Students and faculty say the process was undemocratic.
Istanbul Anadolu prosecutor's office said four people were jailed pending trial over protests at Istanbul's Kadikoy district. They were variously charged with crimes including damaging public property and terrorism propaganda.
Two others were placed under house arrest, it said.
Hundreds of people gathered in Kadikoy this week in support of students protesting at the university. Authorities detained around 165 people on two separate days and two of them were jailed pending trial.
About 600 people have been detained since Jan. 4 as protests spread in Istanbul and Ankara, authorities have said. Most have been released but the government has dismissed protesters' criticism, saying the demonstrations are politically driven.
Officials have also deployed what the United States and United Nations have both described as homophobic rhetoric, with one minister describing students as ""LGBT deviants"".
Erdogan established two new faculties at the university in a decree published in the Official Gazette on Saturday, in a move critics said was aimed at increasing Ankara's influence.
Ali Babacan, a former Erdogan ally and the current head of the Democracy and Progress Party (DEVA), said on Saturday the move would lead to appointments of people closer to Erdogan.
""New academics will be easily employed there and people of a similar profile will be appointed there,"" he told broadcaster Halk TV in an interview. 

""The game plan in the background needs to be seen,"" Babacan said, pointing to similar steps being taken at other institutions in the past.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has approved the shipment of COVID-19 vaccine to Cambodia and plans to supply Mongolia and Pacific Island states, officials said on Sunday, as supplies arrived in Afghanistan - all part of the country's widening vaccine diplomacy.
Seeking to steal a march over rival Asian giant China, which has also promised to deliver shots, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been giving nearby countries millions of doses of the locally made AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC vaccine, even as its domestic immunisation programme has just begun. 
Modi is using India's strength as the world's biggest maker of vaccines for various diseases to improve regional ties and push back against China's political and economic dominance. 
New Delhi has approved 100,000 doses for Cambodia on an urgent basis following a request to Modi from Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, India's envoy to Phnom Penh said. 
Cambodia is an important ally of China, which is expected to provide a million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, mainly developed by state firm Sinopharm.
""The supply has been assured through the Serum Institute of India despite innumerable competing requests from partner countries and our commitment to our domestic population,"" said Ambassador Devyani Khobragade.
India has given doses to Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives to help them get started with frontline workers as part of its Vaccine Friendship initiative.
On Sunday it sent 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Afghanistan, the first to arrive in the war-ravaged country, which is still waiting for emergency approval from the World Health Organization to administer them.
India has invested millions of dollars in Afghanistan over the years in an expansive effort seen as pushing back against arch rival Pakistan's influence in the country. ""The vaccines are being provided on a grant basis,"" a government source said. 
So far, India had supplied 15.6 million doses of the vaccine to 17 countries either through donations or commercial contracts, said foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava.
Consignments will be sent to Mongolia, Caribbean countries and Pacific Island states in the coming weeks, he said. ""External supplies are an ongoing process, depending on availability and domestic requirement,"" he said. 

India, which has the world's second-highest caseload of coronavirus, plans to immunise 300 million people by August. It vaccinated about 3 million healthcare workers in the first two weeks of the campaign that began on Jan. 16 and will need to step up the pace to meet the summer target.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has appointed two women to Vatican posts previously held only by men, in back-to-back moves giving women more empowerment in the male-dominated Holy See. 
He appointed Nathalie Becquart, a French member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters, on Saturday as co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops, a department that prepares major meetings of world bishops held every few years on a different topic.
The previous day, Francis named Italian magistrate Catia Summaria as the first woman Promoter of Justice in the Vatican's Court of Appeals.
Becquart's position, effectively a joint number two spot, will give her the right to vote in the all-male assemblies, something many women and some bishops have called for. She is 52, relatively young by Vatican standards. 
Women have participated as observers and consultants in past synods but only ""synod fathers"", including bishops and specially appointed or elected male representatives, could vote on final documents sent to the pope.
During a synod in 2018, more than 10,000 people signed a petition demanding that women get the vote.
""A door has been opened. We will see what other steps could be taken in the future,"" Cardinal Mario Grech, the synod's secretary-general, told the official Vatican News website.
While upholding the Church's tradition barring female priests, Francis has set up commissions to study the history of women deacons in the early centuries of the Catholic Church, responding to calls by women that they be allowed to take up the role today.
Last year, in one fell swoop, Francis appointed six women to senior roles in the council that oversees Vatican finances.

He has also appointed women to the posts of deputy foreign minister, director of the Vatican Museums and deputy head of the Vatican Press Office.

In a statement, State Department Secretary Antony Blinken said the United States had ""suspended and initiated the process to terminate the Asylum Cooperative Agreements with the Governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras as the first concrete steps on the path to greater partnership and collaboration in the region laid out by President Biden.""
The so-called ""safe third country"" agreements, inked in 2019 by the Trump administration and the Central American nations, force asylum seekers from the region to first seek refuge in those countries before applying in the United States.
Part of a controversial bid by Trump to crack down on illegal immigrants from Central America who make up a large part of migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border, the policies were never implemented with El Salvador and Honduras, the State Department said on Saturday.
Transfers under the U.S.-Guatemala agreement have been paused since mid-March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, the statement added.
The moves announced Saturday came after Biden unveiled a host of measures last week aimed at revamping the U.S. immigration system, including a task force to reunite families separated at the United States-Mexico border and another to increase an annual cap on refugees. 

One of the orders called for Blinken to ""promptly consider"" whether to notify the governments of the three countries that the United States intended to suspend and terminate the safe third country deals. It also called on the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General to determine whether to rescind a rule implementing the agreements.

The Rohingyas, mostly women, boarded a boat from Tanjung Balai in Indonesia and landed in Selangor, on the west coast of Malaysia on Jan. 6, police said.
Seeking refuge, Muslim Rohingya have for years boarded boats fleeing persecution in Myanmar and refugee camps in Bangladesh, some taking the dangerous option of travelling with people-smugglers to Southeast Asia.
Malaysia does not recognise refugee status, but the Muslim-majority country is a favoured destination for Rohingyas seeking a better life.
Seventeen Rohingya women, seven men and seven children, as well as five Indonesian women, were on board, police said of the arrivals, which were reported by AFP on Friday.
The Royal Malaysia Police internal security director, Abdul Rahim Jaafar, said 21 of the migrants have been charged with entering the country without valid documents, and two others charged under anti-trafficking laws.
More than a dozen of them have been handed over to the Malaysian Immigration Department, Abdul Rahim said.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Friday during Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's visit that both countries discussed Rohingya issues.

A Saudi Arabia-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. Saudi Arabia and Iran compete for influence across the Middle East, from Syria to Iraq and Yemen. 
""The U.N. Special Envoy Martin Griffiths has arrived in Tehran for a two-day visit, during which he will meet with Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and other Iranian officials,"" state TV said.
Griffiths' office said the visit was part of his diplomatic efforts to support a negotiated political solution to the conflict. His immediate priority was to support agreement between the warring parties on a ceasefire, urgent humanitarian measures and a resumption of the political process, it said in a press release. 
Griffiths' spokeswoman, Ismini Palla, said the visit had been planned for some time, adding it comes at a time when he is trying to bring together more diplomatic, regional and international support to his efforts to end the war.
""Griffiths will consult with Iranian officials on ways to alleviate sufferings of the Yemeni people,"" Iranian state news agency IRNA reported. 
On Saturday, Iran welcomed President Joe Biden's move on Thursday to end Washington's support for offensive operations in the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen as a ""step towards correcting past mistakes"".

Reversing one of former President Donald Trump's most criticised last-minute decisions, Washington also said on Friday it intended to revoke a terrorist designation for the Houthi movement in response to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, where the United Nations says some 80% of the population is in need.

So far 16 of the victims have been identified, including two Mexican nationals and 14 Guatemalans, the prosecutor's office of the state of Tamaulipas said in a statement.
Authorities have been working to identify the bodies using DNA collected by people who believe their relatives, many of whom are Guatemalan migrants, may be among the victims. The bodies, some badly charred and with gunshot wounds, were found along a popular migrant smuggling route in a remote area of Tamaulipas, which borders the United States in northeastern Mexico.
The killings have caused renewed consternation in Mexico about the perils faced by migrants, many of whom come from the three violent and impoverished Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A first shipment of 88 liters of active ingredients to make AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s COVID-19 vaccine in Brazil arrived from China on Saturday, essential input to speed the country's troubled vaccination program.
With those supplies flown into Rio de Janeiro on a cargo plane, the Fiocruz biomedical center can begin filling and finishing 2.8 million doses. The federally funded center expects to receive more ingredients this month to make a total of 15 million shots of the vaccine developed with Oxford University.
The Fiocruz production line, originally scheduled to start producing in December, has sat idle due to delays getting the first shipment of supplies from China. 
The AstraZeneca Plc vaccine is the central pillar of Brazil's national inoculation program and the federal government has ordered material for Fiocruz to make up to 100 million shots.
To start inoculating its 210 million people, Brazil has relied initially on the Chinese vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech Ltd and 2 million ready-to-use AstraZeneca shots imported from India last month.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) applied on Friday for full regulatory approval in Brazil of its COVID-19 vaccine developed with BioNTech Se, the company said.
It is the second vaccine submitted for registration in Brazil. AstraZeneca applied on Jan. 29 for full regulatory approval of its vaccine.
President Jair Bolsonaro, who says he will not take any COVID-19 shot, is under pressure after a slow and patchy vaccine roll-out in Brazil, which now faces a second wave of infections.
Bolsonaro referred to the virus as a ""little flu"" but his government faces mounting criticism over its handling of the world's second-deadliest coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 231,000 Brazilians.
Sao Paulo's Butantan biomedical institute said on Saturday it has begun to fill-and-finish 8.6 million doses of Sinovac's vaccine called Coronavac with ingredients that arrived from China on Wednesday.

Butantan said it expects to receive another supply of ingredients on Wednesday to make an additional 8.7 million doses.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Any unilateral step by Ethiopia to fill its hydropower project, called the Renaissance Dam, in July would directly threaten Sudan's national security, Sudanese Irrigation and Water Resources Minister Yasser Abbas said on Saturday.
Sudan is also proposing a mediation role for the United States, European Union, United Nations and African Union as a way of breaking the deadlock in talks about the dam between Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia, Abbas told Reuters in an interview.
His comments come at a time of increased tension between Sudan and Ethiopia over disputed farmland near their shared border. 
This is on top of tension over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, close to the border with Sudan.
Ethiopia began filling the reservoir behind the dam after the summer rains last year despite demands from Egypt and Sudan that it should first reach a binding agreement on the dam's operation.
Egypt views the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam as a major threat to its fresh water supplies, more than 90% of which come from the Nile. The Blue Nile flows north into Sudan then Egypt and is the Nile's main tributary. 
Ethiopia says the dam is crucial to its economic development. 
""The filling of the Renaissance Dam by one side next July represents a direct threat to Sudan's national security,"" said Abbas.
He said unilateral filling of the reservoir threatened electricity generation from Sudan's Merowe Dam and Roseires Dam, as well as the safety of the Roseires Dam and of 20 million Sudanese living downstream of the GERD.
Sudanese drinking water stations could also be put at risk, he added.
The African Union has convened recent negotiations over the GERD between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt but talks have repeatedly stalled. Talks hosted by the United States last year also failed to secure a deal.
""Sudan is now leading a diplomatic and political campaign to clarify its position and reach a legal and binding solution,"" Abbas said.

""We are optimistic that if there is political will, a mutually agreed solution can be reached.""

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian authorities on Saturday released a journalist working for Qatar's Al Jazeera television network who was held in pre-trial detention for more than four years, his brother and a lawyer told Reuters.
Mahmoud Hussein, an Egyptian detained in December 2016‮ ‬after arriving in Cairo from Doha on vacation, was held on charges of spreading false news, joining a banned group and receiving foreign funds. 
He was released after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt agreed in January to restore diplomatic, trade and travel ties with Qatar, severed in 2017 over allegations that Qatar supported terrorism, a charge Doha denies.
A Cairo court ordered Hussein's release with ""precautionary measures"", pending investigations on Feb. 1, his brother, Nageh Hussein, and lawyer Taher Abou al-Nasr told Reuters. 
Abou al-Nasr said prosecutors had not appealed against the decision, as they had against a similar decision in 2019. 
It was not immediately clear what the release conditions were but Nageh Hussein said his brother may have to spend several hours a week in a police station.
Al Jazeera Media Network welcomed the news.
""No journalist should ever be subjected to what Mahmoud has suffered for the past four years for merely carrying out his profession,"" the TV network said in a statement on its website.
A video posted by his brother on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showed relatives and neighbours receiving him with hugs, chants and drums beating in his village near Cairo.
Egypt freed three Al Jazeera journalists, an Australian, an Egyptian-Canadian and an Egyptian, in 2015 after more than one year in detention pending trial. 
The Committee to Protect Journalists has accused Egypt of putting journalists behind bars to muzzle dissent, saying that 27 were in prison as of late 2020.

Egyptian authorities say legal action has only been taken against those who break the law.

Arsonists attacked several public buildings in Panguipulli late on Friday including the municipal headquarters, which was still smoldering early on Saturday. Protesters also set burning barricades and threw rocks at the police station, according to official and local media reports.
Wider protests since late 2019 have put the country's Carabinero police force under intense scrutiny, with local and international watchdog groups alleging excessive use of force and human rights violations.
Chilean police have detained the officer involved in the shooting while it is investigated, according to officials, who said the protests had slowed the evidence-gathering process.
Interior Minister Rodrigo Delgado, who convened his staff on Saturday to discuss the events, condemned the arson and promised justice would be served in the shooting.

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - Many Palestinians see a ruling by the International Criminal Court that it has jurisdiction over the Palestinian territories as a belated chance of justice for victims of Israeli attacks.
But for many Israelis, Friday's ruling is worrying because they say they are the ""good guys"" defending themselves against Palestinian violence. 
The ruling, delivered by a pre-trial chamber of three ICC judges, could lead to criminal investigations of Israel and Palestinian militant groups including Hamas. No probe was expected in the near future, however. 
ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said she would now examine the decision and pointed to the 2014 Gaza war between Israel and militant groups in Hamas-controlled Gaza, the 2018 Gaza border protests and Israeli settlements in occupied territory.
In Khan Younis in Gaza, Palestinian Tawfiq Abu Jama said 24 members of his extended family had been killed in an Israeli air strike during the seven-week conflict in 2014 - in which the dead included more 2,100 Palestinians, many of them civilians, as well as 67 Israeli soldiers and six Israeli civilians. 
Abu Jama said he regarded the ICC decision as ""possible justice that came late and better than never ... we don't trust Israeli courts."" 
An investigation into the Khan Younis strike, carried out by the Israeli military's judicial arm, concluded that it was lawful, and had targeted a militant.
On the Israeli side of the border, Israeli Gadi Yarkoni, who lost both his legs in a Palestinian mortar bomb attack during the same war, said he was angered by the ruling.
""We are the good guys here, we don't fire in order to kill innocent children but they fire at us in order to kill civilians,"" said Yarkoni, who is head of the Eshkol Regional Council, bordering Gaza. ""I weep for every civilian killed in Gaza and the West Bank but we are defending our borders.""
The two sides agreed on one thing – neither expects a swift outcome from the ICC.
An Israeli official who requested anonymity said ""it's not like arrest warrants are going to be issued tomorrow morning,"" adding that Israel would coordinate steps with Washington over the court's ruling. 
The official described the ruling as political. 
HURDLES AHEAD
Diana Buttu, an international lawyer and former legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization, said the Palestinians still faced many hurdles.
""The road to actual justice is a long one, for the ICC will undoubtedly face political pressure not to proceed,"" Buttu said.
She said it was not the first time an international court had declared Israeli acts illegal, and previously ""the world did nothing in response.""
The ICC decision was just three weeks the end of Donald Trump's presidency, during which the United States imposed sanctions on two ICC officials, including Bensouda. 
After U.S. President Joe Biden's inauguration last month, the State Department said Washington would ""thoroughly review"" the Trump-era sanctions. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday's ruling was anti-Semitic and that Israel would ""fight this perversion of justice with all our might.""
Palestinian Foreign Affairs Minister Riyad al-Maliki said it was an ""historic day"" and that Israel had previously been treated ""above the law.""
But Palestinians are not exempt from the court’s scrutiny. Hamas, designated by Israel and the West as a terrorist organisation, has been accused of intentionally attacking civilians and using Palestinian civilians as human shields.
But a Hamas official in Gaza welcomed the ruling and said it did not fear investigation.
""Hamas resistance and the resistance of the Palestinian people is legitimate and consistent with International Humanitarian law,"" said spokesman Hazem Qassem. 

The Israeli military (IDF) said it regretted the ICC ruling and would continue to defend the security of Israel and its citizens ""while adhering fully to the IDF Code of Ethics, the values of the IDF, and national and international law.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia has approved Sinovac Biotech's COVID-19 vaccine for use in the elderly, a letter from the food and drug agency shows, potentially changing the country's strategy which has prioritised its working population first.
That strategy was partially due to limited data on the vaccine's safety for the elderly, authorities have said.
The food and drug agency (BPOM) said in a letter seen by Reuters that it had authorised the use of Sinovac's CoronaVac for the elderly ""taking into account the emergency situation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the limited information on the benefits and safety of that vaccine"".
It was sent to Sinovac's Indonesian partner, state-owned Bio Farma.
Wiku Adisasmito, spokesman for the country's COVID-19 task force, confirmed the authenticity of the letter. 
Bio Farma confirmed receiving the letter, though did not provide further details. 
A rollout of Sinovac's vaccine in Indonesia last month involved 3 million doses and was aimed at medical workers and public servants. 
Government data shows nearly 800,000 have received their first shot, but authorities said they are set to produce 25 million more by the end of March.
Indonesia, which has suffered more than 31,000 deaths from COVID-19, aims to vaccinate more than 180 million people, or roughly two-thirds of its population of 270 million, within a year. 
Several countries such as the United States and Britain that have already begun vaccinations are giving priority to elderly people who are more vulnerable to the respiratory disease.
Indonesia's health ministry declined to comment, though it has said the elderly are set to receive the vaccine by April.
China's Sinovac said on Saturday that CoronaVac had been approved for use by the general public by China's medical products regulator.
A Phase I and II trial in China showed the vaccine could safely trigger immune response for older participants but Sinovac cautioned that data for the protection rate among people aged 60 and above was ""limited"".
""When the relevant institutions ...use this vaccine, the necessity of inoculating this product should be evaluated in consideration of the health status and exposure risk of this age group,"" it said.

Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia, said that ""if we want to stem the number of hospitalisations, we should chase immunisation for the elderly.""

TUNIS (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters backed by Tunisia's powerful labour union gathered in central Tunis on Saturday in the country's biggest demonstration for years, defying a police lockdown that blocked roads in a large area of the capital. 
The rally was held to mark the anniversary of the 2013 killing of a prominent activist and to protest against police abuses that demonstrators say have imperilled freedoms won in the 2011 revolution that triggered the ""Arab Spring"". 
Riot police deployed cordons around the city centre, stopping both cars and many people from entering the streets around Avenue Habib Bourguiba as thousands of people gathered, a Reuters witness said. 
""I lived 10 years in freedom ... I am not ready to lose it,"" said Haytem Ouslati, a 24-year old demonstrator. Protesters raised placards condemning police violence and chanted ""No fear. The street belongs to the people."" 
Unlike previous marches in a wave of protests that have spread across Tunisia in recent weeks, Saturday's rally was backed by the UGTT union, the country's most powerful political organisation with a million members.
Samir Cheffi, a senior UGTT official, said the protest was needed to protect liberties. ""Today is a cry of alarm to defend the revolution, to protect freedoms under threat,"" he said. 
Protests which began last month over inequality have increasingly focused on the large number of arrests and reports - denied by the Interior Ministry - of abuse of detainees. 
Mohammed Ammar, a member of parliament for the Attayar party, said he had phoned the prime minister to protest against the closure of central Tunis. 
Protesters chanted against the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, a member of successive government coalitions, and reprised the Arab Spring slogan: ""The people want the fall of the regime"". 
A decade after Tunisia's revolution, its political system is mired in endless squabbling between the president, prime minister and parliament while the economy stagnates. 
While some Tunisians, disillusioned by the fruits of the uprising, are nostalgic for the days of autocracy, others have decried a perceived erosion of the freedoms that democracy secured. 
For some, the febrile climate has recalled the political polarisation after a suspected hardline Islamist assassinated secular activist and lawyer Chokri Belaid in February 2013. 
His death triggered a wave of protests in Tunisia that led to a grand bargain between the main Islamist and secular political parties to stop the country sinking into violence. 

""We won't accept Tunisia becoming a barracks. We ask the president to intervene and protect freedoms,"" said Naima Selmi, a woman in the protest.

Its qualified statement of support - leaving scope to oppose the move later - illustrates the challenges that may face the U.N.-led efforts to find a political solution to a decade of chaos, division and violence. 
Libya has been split between east and west since 2014, with the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, and a rival administration in Benghazi backed by Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).
On Friday, participants in U.N. talks in Switzerland voted on a new presidency council and government head to oversee the run-up to national parliamentary and presidential elections planned for December. 
Losing candidates in the vote - including the eastern-based parliament head Aguila Saleh and western-based interior minister Fathi Bashagha and defence minister Saleh Namroush - have made public statements of support for the new government. 
Under rules agreed by the Libyan talks participants picked by the U.N. to represent the country's rival political currents, the new prime minister, Abdulhamid Dbeibeh, has three weeks to form a new government and present it to the parliament. 
The parliament split in 2019 as a group of lawmakers broke off, making any agreement by a full quorum difficult. If it does not ratify the new government, however, the U.N. talks participants have agreed that they have the power to do so themselves. 
The parliament had opposed the formation of the GNA, appointing its own parallel eastern-based administration under Abdullah Thinni. He said on Saturday his administration would not stand down until a full parliamentary assembly approved the new government. 
Haftar, who was appointed army chief by the eastern-based parliament, did not issue an immediate statement. However, his general command headquarters said it welcomed the agreement and called for all to help reaching the December elections. 

The United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which both backed Haftar during the war, and Turkey, which supported the GNA, have all publicly voiced support. The U.N. has previously said those foreign powers broke an arms embargo on Libya that they had publicly endorsed.

Slim, a Shi'ite publisher in his late fifties, ran a research centre, made documentaries with his wife and led efforts to build an archive on Lebanon's 1975-1990 sectarian civil war.
He was a vocal critic of what he described as armed group Hezbollah's intimidation tactics and attempts to monopolise Lebanese politics.
He was shot dead and found in his car on Thursday in south Lebanon - the first killing of a high-profile activist in years.
Slim had gone missing the night before. He had four bullets in his head and one in his back. 
On Saturday morning Slim's wife, Monika Borgmann, tweeted for the first time since his death, sharing a two-word banner with a black background that said ""zero fear"" in Arabic.
The same two words appeared on a banner at the protest where activists blamed the Iranian-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah for the killing. 
""If Hezbollah is really innocent of this crime or refuses it and condemns it, then they have to help the security apparatus and Lebanese judicial authorities especially that Lokman Slim was killed in their area of security influence,"" said one of the protesters, Youssef Diab.
""If that doesn't happen then they are still suspects."" 
Hezbollah condemned the killing on Thursday, which Lebanese officials, including the president, called an assassination. 

""We will not kill him again with our silence,"" said one demonstrator who gave her name as Nelly. ""My one fear is that people will be scared and remain silent, then Lebanon will be in danger.""

“Time is running out for the Americans, both because of the parliament bill and the election atmosphere that will follow the Iranian New Year,” Zarif said in an interview with Hamshahri newspaper published on Saturday
Iran’s new year begins on March 21.
The parliament, dominated by hardliners, passed the legislation in December that set a two-month deadline for an easing of sanctions.
President Joe Biden’s administration is exploring ways to restore the 2015 nuclear deal that Iran signed with major world powers but that was abandoned in 2018 by former President Donald Trump, who restored sanctions.
Iran retaliated by breaching the terms of the accord in a step-by-step response. Last month, it resumed enriching uranium to 20% at its underground Fordow nuclear plant - a level it achieved before the accord.   
Biden has said that if Tehran returned to strict compliance with the pact, Washington would follow suit and use that as a springboard to a broader agreement that might restrict Iran's missile development and regional activities.
Tehran has insisted that Washington ease sanctions before it resumes compliance, and ruled out negotiations on wider security issues.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken discussed Iran on Friday in a virtual meeting with his British, French and German counterparts as the group weighed how to revive the deal.
“The more America procrastinates, the more it will lose … it will appear that Mr. Biden’s administration doesn’t want to rid itself of Trump’s failed legacy,” Zarif said in the interview.
“We don’t need to return to the negotiating table. It’s America that has to find the ticket to come to the table,” he added.

On Monday, Zarif hinted at a way to resolve the impasse over which side moves first, by saying the steps could be synchronized.

728,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2021 07:36AM ET</span>",U.S. to drop Houthi terrorist designation due to Yemen crisis,"By Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States intends to revoke the Houthi movement's terrorist designation in response to Yemen's humanitarian crisis, reversing one of the Trump administration's most criticised last-minute decisions.
The move, confirmed by a State Department official on Friday, came a day after President Joe Biden declared a halt to U.S. support for the Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen, which is widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
""Our action is due entirely to the humanitarian consequences of this last-minute designation from the prior administration, which the United Nations and humanitarian organizations have since made clear would accelerate the world’s worst humanitarian crisis,"" the official said. 
Houthi official Mohammed Ali al-Houthi on Saturday told Al Mayadeen TV that the group had heard the U.S. administration's recent statements on Yemen, but had yet to see anything happen. 
The U.N. describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need.
Last month the United Nations' aid chief warned the new sanctions would push Yemen into a famine on a scale not seen for nearly 40 years. Famine has never been officially declared but indicators have deteriorated across the country. 
""We welcome the stated intention by the U.S. administration to revoke the designation as it will provide profound relief to millions of Yemenis who rely on humanitarian assistance and commercial imports to meet their basic survival needs,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. 
Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blacklisted the Houthis on Jan. 19, one day before Biden took office.
The Trump administration exempted aid groups, the United Nations, the Red Cross and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine and medical devices from its designation. But U.N. officials and relief groups called for the designation to be revoked.
Aid groups working in Yemen welcomed the move. 
""This is a sigh of relief and a victory for the Yemeni people, and a strong message from the U.S. that they are putting the interests of Yemenis first,"" said Mohamed Abdi, country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, and urged the Biden administration to push for an immediate nationwide ceasefire. 
The State Department official stressed that the action did not reflect the U.S. view of the Houthis and their ""reprehensible conduct"". 

A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-aligned Houthis. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks as the country also faces an economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ramaphosa, who is the outgoing chair of the African Union (AU), told the bloc's summit that even though the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have deployed significant financial resources for the coronavirus outbreak response, more needed to be done.
""Assess to concessional finance will remain crucial as countries rebuild their economies,"" Ramaphosa told the virtual summit.
""An injection of fresh resources by the IMF through reallocating and issuing new special drawing rights, with bias to the developing world, will correct the glaring inequality in fiscal stimulus measures between advanced economies and the rest of the world."" 
Concessional loans generally offer terms that are more favourable to those available on the open market.
The precarious debt burdens of a number of African nations have worsened due to the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Among a population of 1.3 billion, Africa has so far reported more than 3.6 million coronavirus infections and over 94,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. South Africa has recorded the most infections of any African nation.
While wealthier nations push ahead with mass vaccination drives, only a few African countries have started vaccinations. The 55-member African Union hopes to see 60% of the continent's population immunised in the next three years.

Ramaphosa said on Monday the AU has so far secured 1 billion vaccines, of which 700 million will come from the global COVAX facility, co-led by the World Health Organization, and 300 million had been facilitated by the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT).

730,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 06, 2021 05:26AM ET</span>",Myanmar generals shut down internet as thousands protest coup,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's junta shut down the internet in the country on Saturday as thousands of people took to the streets of Yangon to denounce this week's coup and demand the release of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
In the first such demonstration since the generals seized power on Monday, activists in the country's largest city chanted, ""Military dictator, fail, fail; Democracy, win, win"" and held banners reading ""Against military dictatorship"". Bystanders offered them food and water.
Many in the crowd wore red, the colour of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) which won Nov. 8 elections in a landslide, a result the generals have refused to recognise claiming fraud.
The protesters largely dispersed in the afternoon, but several hundred remained sitting on the road in a standoff with police, residents said. Another group of around 100 were blocked by police from reaching the main demonstration. 
As the protest swelled and activists issued calls on social media for people to join the march, the country's internet crashed.
Monitoring group NetBlocks Internet Observatory reported a ""national-scale internet blackout"", saying on Twitter that connectivity had fallen to 54% of ordinary levels. Witnesses reported a shutdown of mobile data services and wifi.
The junta did not respond to requests for comment. It extended a social media crackdown to Twitter and Instagram after seeking to silence dissent by temporarily blocking Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which counts half of the population as users.
Norwegian mobile network provider  Telenor ASA  (OTC:TELNY) said authorities had ordered all mobile operators to temporarily shut down the data network, although voice and SMS services remained open.
Many activists had sidestepped the Facebook ban by using virtual private networks to conceal their locations, but the more general internet disruption will severely limit their ability to organise and access independent news and information.
Myanmar civil society organisations appealed to internet providers and mobile networks to resist the junta's orders, saying in joint statement they were ""essentially legitimising the military’s authority"".
Telenor said it had stressed to the authorities that access to telecom services should be maintained. However it added it was bound by local law and its first priority was the safety of its local workers. 
""We deeply regret the impact the shutdown has on the people in Myanmar,"" it said in a statement.
Amnesty International’s deputy regional director for campaigns, Ming Yu Hah, said shutting down the internet amid a coup and the COVID-19 pandemic was a ""heinous and reckless decision"". 
INTERNATIONAL FALLOUT 
Army chief Min Aung Hlaing seized power alleging fraud, although the electoral commission says it has found no evidence of widespread irregularities in the November vote. 
The junta announced a one-year state of emergency and has promised to hand over power after new elections, without giving a timeframe.
Suu Kyi, 75, has been charged with illegally importing six walkie-talkies, while ousted President Win Myint is accused of flouting coronavirus restrictions. Neither has been seen since the coup, although their lawyer said they were being held in their homes. 
Sean Turnell, an Australian economic adviser to Suu Kyi, said in a message to Reuters on Saturday he was being detained.
Without naming Turnell, Australia said it had summoned the Myanmar ambassador to register ""deep concern"" over the arbitrary detention of Australian and other foreign nationals in Myanmar.
""In particular, we have serious concerns about an Australian who has been detained at a police station,"" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement.
Saturday's protest is the first sign of street unrest in a country with a history of bloody military crackdowns on protesters. There were also anti-coup protests in Melbourne, Australia, and the Taiwanese capital Taipei on Saturday.
A civil disobedience movement has been building in Myanmar all week, with doctors and teachers among those refusing to work, and every night people bang pots and pans in a show of anger.
The coup has sparked international outrage, with the United States considering sanctions against the generals and the United Nations Security Council calling for the release of all detainees.
It has also deepened tensions between the United States and China, which has close links to Myanmar's military. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken pressed top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi in a phone call on Friday to condemn the coup, the State Department said.
The generals have few overseas interests that would be vulnerable to international sanctions, but the military's extensive business investments could suffer if foreign partners leave - as Japanese drinks company Kirin Holdings said it would on Friday.
Nobel Peace laureate Suu Kyi spent 15 years under house arrest after leading pro-democracy protests against the long-ruling military junta in 1988. 
After sharing power with a civilian government, the army began democratic reforms in 2011. That led to the election of the NLD in a landslide victory four years later.

The November election was meant to solidify a troubled democratic transition after the generals agreed to share power under a constitution guaranteeing the army a major role in government.

""I guess you will soon hear of it, but I am being detained,"" Turnell said. ""Being charged with something, but not sure what. I am fine and strong, and not guilty of anything,"" he said, with a smile emoji.
It was not subsequently possible to contact him.
Myanmar army generals, who seized power alleging fraud in a Nov. 8 election that Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide, shut down the internet on Saturday as thousands took to the streets of Yangon to denounce this week's coup.
Australia's foreign ministry said in a statement late on Saturday that it was ""deeply concerned about reports of Australian and other foreign nationals being detained arbitrarily in Myanmar."" 
The ministry did not name Turnell or provide further details on other foreign nationals being detained. It said it had particular concerns about an Australian who was detained at a police station.
""The Australian Embassy in Yangon continues to contact Australians in Myanmar to ascertain their safety, to the extent that communications allow,"" the ministry said.
Turnell is a professor of economics at Macquarie University in Sydney and has been advising Suu Kyi on economic policy for several years.
On Saturday, several thousand protesters gathered in Australia's second-largest city of Melbourne denouncing the coup and demanding the release of Suu Kyi.
Television and social media footage showed people wearing the red colour of the NLD, carrying portraits of Suu Kyi and singing ""We Won't Be Satisfied Until The End Of The World"", the Burmese language anthem from the country’s 1988 pro-democracy uprising, brutally put down by the military government.

KUNDLI, India (Reuters) - Thousands of farmers across India blocked roads on Saturday with makeshift tents, tractors, trucks and boulders to pressure the government to roll back agricultural reforms that have triggered months-long protests.
While the initial protests were started by rice and wheat growers from northern Indian who camped out on the outskirts of New Delhi, support for them has been growing especially in states not ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party.
The federal government has offered concessions to the farmers but refuses to repeal three laws passed last year that it says are crucial to bring new investment to the sector, which accounts for nearly 15% of India's $2.9 trillion economy and about half its workforce.
But farmers fear the reforms will leave them at the mercy of big corporate buyers, gradually ending the current practice of assured government purchases mainly for grain such as wheat and rice.
Saturday's three-hour ""chakka jam"", or road blockade, started around noon except in New Delhi and a couple of neighbouring states.
""Today, the support of the whole society is with farmers,"" Yogendra Yadav, a political activist who is one of the leaders of the farmers' movement, said on Twitter. ""Victory is certain.""
On a highway near the capital, some farmers smoked hookah as songs played on a loudspeaker.
Farmers squatted on the road in the eastern state of Odisha and Karnataka in the south with flags and banners protesting against the laws, with some carrying placards urging the government not to treat them as enemies.
'MAXIMUM RESTRAINT'
Tens of thousands of farmers have already been braving New Delhi's winter by sleeping in the open for months on national highways. Their protests have mostly been peaceful but a tractor rally on Jan. 26 flared into turmoil as some farmers clashed with police.
Since then, authorities have shut down the mobile internet in parts of the national capital and heavily barricaded border roads to prevent protesters from coming into the city again.
""The rights to peaceful assembly & expression should be protected both offline & online,"" the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Twitter, calling on authorities and protesters to exercise ""maximum restraint.""
""It's crucial to find equitable solutions with due respect to #HumanRights for all.""

The issue has also caught international attention with celebrities such as pop star Rihanna and environment campaigner Greta Thunberg announcing their support for the farmers. The United States has also urged India to resume talks with farmers.

Thousands of users on Twitter shared photos and videos of the village south of Pekalongan city in Central Java being flooded by crimson-coloured water, which some social media users said reminded them of blood. 
""I am so afraid if this photo gets into the bad hands of hoax spreaders,"" said a Twitter user Ayah E Arek-Arek. ""Fear mongering narratives about signs that it is the end of the world, bloody rain etc"". 
Pekalongan is a city known for manufacturing batik, a traditional Indonesian method of using wax to resist water-based dyes to depict patterns and drawings, usually on fabric.
It is not uncommon for rivers in Pekalongan to turn different colours. Bright green water covered another village north of the city during a flood last month. 
""Sometimes there are purple puddles on the road too,"" said Twitter user Area Julid, who claimed to be from the area. 
The head of Pekalongan disaster relief, Dimas Arga Yudha, confirmed that the photos being circulated were real.

""The red flood is due to the batik dye, which has been hit by the flood. It will disappear when it mixes with rain after a while,"" he said.

President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed flew back to the capital Mogadishu without a deal on the staffing of regional electoral commissions, Osman Dube, the information minister, said late on Friday.
""No agreement was reached,"" the minister said, adding that both houses of parliament would meet on Saturday to chart a way forward. Mohamed's office said he was set to address both houses of parliament.
Somalia, which has had only limited central government since 1991, is trying to rebuild with the help of the United Nations. 
It had initially aimed to hold its first direct election in more than three decades this year but delays in preparations, and the government's inability to rein in daily attacks by al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgents, meant switching to an indirect vote, with elders picking lawmakers who would choose a president.
Now even that plan is in tatters.
The United Nations, the African Union and other international partners on Thursday warned that the impasse over the election must be resolved.
""Any alternative outcomes, including a parallel process or partial elections, or other measures short of an agreed electoral process, would be a setback that would not obtain the support of partners,"" they said in a joint statement.
Regional authorities in at least two of Somalia's five federal states, Puntland and Jubbaland, oppose holding the election for now. National and regional forces have clashed in Jubbaland.
One sticking point in this week's three-day crunch talks held in the central town of Dhusamareb, was control of Gedo, an area of Jubbaland where President Mohamed's forces have been battling their regional counterparts for control.
""President Faarmajo insists he will rule Gedo region and hold its election,"" said Ahmed Mohamed Islam Madobe, Jubbaland's president, using President Mohamed's informal name. 
While the constitution sets out four-year mandates for the presidency, an extension of the government’s term by parliament is legally allowed by precedent, though analysts warn that the move is politically fraught.

“If the main politicians don't agree, there is still going to be a massive problem,,” said Omar Mahmood, senior analyst for Somalia at international think-tank International Crisis Group.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud congratulated Blinken on taking up his new appointment last week and said the kingdom hopes to work with the United States to face common challenges and maintain regional stability, state news agency SPA reported. 
The new administration of President Joe Biden said this week it will end U.S. support for a Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen and indicated it would step up diplomacy to end the Yemen war through the appointment of a Yemen envoy. Washington also said it expects Riyadh to improve its human rights record. 
The United States on Friday also said it intends to revoke a terrorist designation for Yemen's Houthi movement - against which the Saudi-led coalition is fighting - in response to the country's humanitarian crisis.

Blinken also pressed China to condemn the military coup in Myanmar, and he reaffirmed that Washington will work with allies to hold China accountable for efforts to threaten stability of Indo-Pacific, including across the Taiwan Strait, the department said in a statement.
Yang told Blinken that the United States should ""correct"" its recent mistakes and that both sides must respect each other's political systems and development paths, according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry. 
The relationship between the world's two biggest economies hit its lowest point in decades during the presidency of Donald Trump, and Chinese officials have expressed cautious optimism that it would improve under the administration of Joe Biden. 
Yang told an online forum on Tuesday that he hoped relations between the two countries could return to a predictable and constructive track, but he called on the United States to ""stop interfering"" on issues of Chinese sovereignty, including Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet.
Foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin also said on Friday that ""the common interests of the two countries outweighed their differences"" and urged the United States to ""meet China halfway"" to improve relations.
However, criticism of China's human rights record has continued unabated, with the State Department saying on Thursday that it was ""deeply disturbed"" by reports of sexual abuse against women in internment camps for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.. 
Biden himself has shown little sign he is in a hurry to engage with Beijing, describing China on Thursday as ""our most serious competitor"" and saying Washington would continue to confront what he described as China's ""attack on human rights, intellectual property and global governance"".
""But we're ready to work with Beijing, when it's in America's interest to do so,"" he added. 
The Global Times, a tabloid run by Chinese Communist Party paper the People's Daily, said in an editorial on Saturday that it expected the Biden administration to keep talking tough while improving cooperation in some areas.

""This is obviously different from the later period of Trump's administration, which had only hyped up antagonism between China and the U.S.,"" it said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - While the coronavirus pandemic tears through the sprawling Mexican capital, a team of public health workers going door-to-door in one of its poorest districts offers a glimmer of hope for hard-hit families.
Some 30 traveling public health workers clad in protective gear including gloves and face-shields quiz locals on any symptoms they may have and offer testing as well as oxygen treatments for residents of Iztapalapa, home to some of the city's grittiest, most densely-packed neighborhoods.
Noelia Granados, a 40-year-old nurse and Iztapalapa resident, comes from a family struggling with multiple infections, sadly typical in the district that is home to some 1.8 million.
""Right now, both of my parents are sick, so are two of my siblings as well as my brother's wife and my nieces and nephews,"" she told Reuters. She explained that the hit forced them to close a family-run shop last month.
Both Granados and her husband tested positive last month, but they are feeling better. That is not the case for her parents, whose health she described as ""delicate.""
The local public health program, one of the only such outreach efforts in the city, also lends dozens of oxygen concentrators plus still more refillable metal tanks to those receiving treatment at home.
The outreach comes at a time when the rate of vaccinations in Mexico has slowed to a trickle as the country copes with delays from vaccine makers, and the government's official death tally adds more than 1,000 fatalities daily, likely a significant undercount.
Cases to date total over 1.9 million, with 164,290 deaths.
Enrique Ruiz, the doctor in charge of the program, stresses that the goal is to quickly identify sick residents via mobile testing sites that can begin to bring the outbreak under control.

""If we detect any symptoms, we invite them to come get tested right away.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A second senior leader of a vast drug syndicate has been arrested, a Thai narcotics official said, as a transnational dragnet tightens on the Sam Gor group, which police say dominates the $70 billion annual Asia-Pacific drug trade.
    The October arrest of Hong Kong citizen Lee Chung Chak in Bangkok preceded last month's high-profile arrest in the Netherlands of Tse Chi Lop, a China-born Canadian national who police suspect is the top leader of the syndicate, also called ""The Company"".
    Lee, 65, is a former prison mate of Tse's suspected of being involved in drug trafficking for four decades. A 2018 Australian Federal Police (AFP) document reviewed by Reuters outlining the top 19 targets in the syndicate described Lee as a ""senior project manager responsible for big ventures of border controlled drugs"".
The two arrests on different continents within three months stem from a decade-long investigation by the AFP, which also leads the multinational Operation Kungur task force targeting the syndicate.
    It is rare for suspected senior drug traffickers to be arrested and successfully prosecuted in the Asia-Pacific region.
    ""The suspect was arrested by Thai Narcotics police on Oct. 1 based on an arrest warrant issued by a Thai court, which followed an extradition request by the Australian authorities,"" Lieutenant General Montri Yimyaem, head of Thailand's Narcotics Suppression Bureau, told Reuters when asked about Lee.
    ""The extradition is currently being processed by the court.""
In recent years, Lee has emerged as a rival to the Canadian as a major player in the region's drug trade, according to two investigators, who spoke to Reuters on condition they not be identified.
    ""We understand his star had risen to be an equal or even a bigger player,"" said one of the investigators. ""He's a very significant arrest in his own right."".
    Thai authorities seized a laptop and multiple phones when they searched Lee's serviced apartment in an upscale Bangkok area, a potential treasure trove of intelligence, the two investigators told Reuters. A third official added that a document and cash in several denominations were also seized.
    Lee is appealing the November approval by Thailand's Criminal Court of Australia's extradition request, said a source at Thailand's Ministry of Justice. Tse is in prison in the Netherlands, where a court has yet to rule on his extradition to Australia.
    Lee could not be contacted in prison, nor could his lawyer be identified by Reuters. A lawyer for Tse declined to comment. An AFP media officer declined to comment. 
    The alleged role of Tse - whose nickname is Sam Gor, or ""Brother Number Three"" in Cantonese - as leader of the syndicate and the investigation into his activities was revealed by Reuters in 2019.
(A link to the Reuters Special Report: https://reut.rs/3oOjiIc)
    The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has estimated the syndicate made up to $17 billion from methamphetamine trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region alone in 2018. The UNODC representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, Jeremy Douglas, compared Tse to the notorious Latin American cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
    Police also suspect the crime group traffics heroin, ketamine, cocaine and MDMA, known as ecstasy, multiple officials across the region have told Reuters.
    DRUG VETERAN
Tse and Lee were the subject of requests by the AFP for law enforcement authorities around the world to arrest them. They are expected to be charged in connection with importing illicit drugs a decade ago, the investigators say.
    The two men supplied drugs to a Melbourne-based drug ring and were recorded on intercepts directing the leader of the ring, Suky Lieu, the investigators alleged.
A judge's verdict rejecting Lieu's attempt to have his prison sentence reduced said that Lieu owned a small Asian grocery store and was regularly in touch with his Hong Kong-based drug suppliers, using as many as 60 phones and SIM cards and speaking in code. The verdict said Lieu was the leader of the drug ring. Tse and Lee were not named in the verdict.
    The two investigators told Reuters that Lee was arrested in Sydney in the 1980s, allegedly for being a manager of heroin couriers. He never went to trial because a key witness died, they said. Reuters could not independently confirm this.
Lee was sentenced to 140 months in prison in 1998 for playing a ""supervisory role"" in a conspiracy to import heroin into the United States, federal court filings there show. Lee - extradited from Thailand to face the charge - spent time in the Elkton penitentiary in Ohio while Tse was imprisoned there. 
    Tse was sentenced to nine years in prison for a separate conspiracy to import heroin into the United States. The two were released from Elkton within a month of each other after completing their sentences, U.S. Bureau of Prisons records show. 

Police suspect Lee later played a key role for the syndicate overseeing drug lab operators in Shan State in northern Myanmar and regularly travelled there, the two investigators said. Shan State, which is largely controlled by ethnic armed groups, has been the epicentre of drug manufacturing in Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle for decades.

The ministry said it had been informed by U.S. officials of the cancellation of the program that was negotiated under the administration of former President Donald Trump.
The agreement with Guatemala was signed in 2019, just as similar pacts were negotiated with El Salvador and Honduras, all in a bid by Trump to force other countries in the region to help the United States alleviate a surge of asylum-seekers arriving at the U.S. southern border by agreeing to take them in for prolonged waits.
The pacts were sharply criticized by rights groups which said they added to the misery of asylum-seekers, many of whom fled violent gangs from the same impoverished countries. 
Earlier this week, U.S. President Joe Biden ordered a review of asylum processing at the U.S.-Mexico border, part of a broad effort to chart a less-restrictive immigration system during the first weeks of his term.
Among the measures announced, Biden called for a review of the so-called Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), a Trump program also known as ""Remain in Mexico"" that ordered tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court dates.
He also signaled the imminent end of the asylum deals with the Central American countries.

Senior aides to Biden have nevertheless cautioned that administration's broader immigration agenda will take time to roll out, as the new president seeks to be both more accepting of migrants and asylum seekers while also seeking to prevent a surge in unlawful border crossings.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Saturday eased curfews on more than half a million restaurants and other businesses outside the capital Seoul, letting them stay open an hour later, amid a public backlash over tight curbs to contain COVID-19.
After using aggressive testing and tracing to blunt several earlier waves of the coronavirus without drastic lockdowns, the authorities have imposed increasingly rigid social distancing rules as they fight the latest wave of the epidemic.
The restraints have pushed small business owners and self-employed people to the limits of what they can endure, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told an intra-agency meeting on Saturday.
So businesses outside the capital will now be able to stay open until 10 p.m., but ""the 9 p.m. operations restriction remains as is in the metropolitan Seoul area, where more than 70% of total infections are concentrated and still faces the risk of virus transmission,"" Chung said.
The businesses include some 580,000 cafes, restaurants, indoor fitness facilities and karaoke bars, Vice Health Minister Kang Do-tae told a briefing. 
Businesses that flout the virus prevention guidelines will be ordered to close for two weeks, Kang said.
Most of the new cases were in Seoul, the neighbouring port city of Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province, home to over 25 million people.
Hundreds of restaurant and cafe owners across the country have complained about the impact of the bans on their businesses. Gym owners hurt by restrictions reopened in protest against strict social distancing rules.
Authorities extended the current level of social distancing until Feb. 14, ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday from Feb. 11, when tens of millions of Koreans usually travel across the country to family gatherings.
Kang urged people to stay home during the holiday, fearing travel could cause another surge in coronavirus cases, and said the authorities would maintain a ban on private gatherings of more than four people.

The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 393 daily new COVID-19 cases on Friday. That brings total infections reported in South Korea to 80,524, with a death toll of 1,464.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Judges at the International Criminal Court on Friday found the court has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in the Palestinian territories, paving the way for a possible criminal investigation, despite Israeli objections.
The decision prompted swift reactions from both Israel, which is not a member of the court and rejects its jurisdiction, and the Palestinian Authority, which welcomed the ruling. The United States objected to the decision.
ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office was studying the decision and would decide what to do next ""guided strictly by its independent and impartial mandate"" to prosecute grave war crimes and atrocities when countries are unable or unwilling to do so themselves.
The ICC judges said their decision was based on the fact that Palestine has been granted membership to the tribunal's founding treaty, and had referred the situation to the court. The judges said the jurisdiction decision does not imply any attempt to determine Palestinian statehood, which is uncertain, or national borders.
""The Court's territorial jurisdiction in the Situation in Palestine ... extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem,"" they said. 
Bensouda had found in December 2019 that ""war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.""
She named both the Israeli Defense Forces and armed Palestinian groups such as Hamas as possible perpetrators.
She said then that she saw no reason not to open an investigation, but asked judges to first rule on whether the situation fell under the court's jurisdiction.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denounced the decision, saying in a video statement: ""When the ICC investigates Israel for fake war crimes, this is pure antisemitism."" 
He condemned the court for investigating Israel when it ""defends itself against terrorists"" while refusing to investigate what he said were brutal dictatorships in Iran and Syria that committed horrific atrocities almost daily.
""We will fight this perversion of justice with all our might,"" Netanyahu said in the video, shaking a fist.
Human Rights Watch called the decision ""pivotal"" and said it ""finally offers victims of serious crimes some real hope for justice after a half century of impunity,"" said Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director.
""It's high time that Israeli and Palestinian perpetrators of the gravest abuses - whether war crimes committed during hostilities or the expansion of unlawful settlements - face justice.""
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was a ""historic day for the principle of accountability."" 
Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official, described the decision as ""an important development that contributes in protecting the Palestinian people."" 
""We urge the international court to launch an investigation into Israeli war crimes against the Palestinian people,"" said Abu Zuhri, who is currently outside Gaza.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price wrote on Twitter: ""The United States objects to today's @IntlCrimCourt decision regarding the Palestinian situation.""
""We will continue to uphold President Biden's strong commitment to Israel and its security, including opposing actions that seek to target Israel unfairly,"" Price added.
The Trump administration had vehemently opposed the ICC. 
Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Human Rights Program, said U.S. President Joe Biden should do nothing to undermine the ICC's independence. 

""It's important to remember that the ICC investigation would also target Palestinian perpetrators of war crimes in the context of hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups, especially in the Gaza Strip,"" Dakwar said on Twitter.

DENVER (Reuters) - A 95-year-old Colorado man facing charges he fatally shot an assisted-living employee over $200 he suspected the victim of stealing from him was ordered held without bond on Friday at the initial court hearing in the case.
Okey Payne was brought by wheelchair into Boulder County District Court, where the judge advised him he would remain jailed for investigation of first-degree murder in Wednesday's shooting death of Ricardo Medina-Rojas, prosecutors said.
The nonagenarian defendant was arrested at the Legacy Assisted Living center in Lafayette, Colorado, 20 miles northwest of Denver, shortly after the shooting there. Payne was a resident of the facility and Medina-Rojas its maintenance director.
According to an arrest affidavit, Payne confronted Medina-Rojas when the victim arrived for work, demanding to know, ""Where's my $200?"" and then shot the maintenance chief in the head with a .45-caliber pistol.
While in custody, Payne confessed to the shooting, telling an officer who took his statement that he ""blew Ricardo away,"" the affidavit said.
Although hard of hearing, Payne was lucid in his account of the shooting, and insisted that staff of the assisted-living center, in collaboration with his ex-wife, had been stealing from him since he arrived at Legacy in October 2019, the officer wrote in the affidavit. 
Police said the claims of theft were unsubstantiated.
A housekeeper at the facility told investigators Payne particularly disliked Medina-Rojas and another maintenance worker. According to her account, the affidavit said, Payne had threatened to kill the two employees and suggested he had little to lose, telling her, ""What are they going to do? Give me life?”

Payne is set to be formally charged on Feb. 10. The state public defender's office, assigned to represent him, does not publicly comment on its cases.

(Reuters) - A former senior executive at private equity firm TPG Capital has agreed to plead guilty to paying $50,000 to rig his son's college entrance exam results and participating in a vast U.S. college admissions fraud scheme.
Bill McGlashan, the former managing partner of TPG Growth and co-founder of The Rise Fund, agreed to a three-month prison sentence and $250,000 fine in exchange for admitting to a wire fraud charge, federal prosecutors in Boston said on Friday. 
A plea hearing has yet to be scheduled. 
McGlashan is one of 57 people charged in the U.S. college admissions scandal, in which prosecutors said parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to secure their children's college admissions fraudulently.
The parents include ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman, who received a 14-day prison sentence, and ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin, who was sentenced to two months in prison.
Singer pleaded guilty in March 2019 to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and using bribery to secure the admission of students to colleges as fake athletic recruits.
Prosecutors said that McGlashan, 57, had agreed to plead guilty to paying Singer $50,000 to bribe a corrupt test administrator to allow an associate to proctor his son's ACT exam and secretly correct his answers.
Prosecutors had also originally charged McGlashan in March 2019 with conspiring to pay $250,000 in order to bribe a University of Southern California official and have his son admitted to the school as a fake football recruit.
He had denied those allegations. His decision to plead guilty to the exam-related offense will make him the 30th parent to plead guilty in the case.
His plea agreement includes a clause that will allow him to appeal a judge's earlier rejection of his argument that the test scores cannot legally constitute ""property"" for purposes of charging him with wire fraud.

Should he prevail, he can withdraw his plea. His lawyers had no comment

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Friday was a different sort of Opening Day at Yankee Stadium, the legendary home of baseball's ""Bronx Bombers,"" as New York ramped up its drive to vaccinate its most vulnerable residents, many who live in the hard-hit Bronx neighborhoods that surround the legendary sports venue. 
The stadium, which opened its doors as the city's newest COVID-19 vaccination hub, is the pride of the Bronx, the most recognizable landmark in the borough that has struggled with one of the highest death rates during the global coronavirus pandemic. The Bronx is predominantly Black and Hispanic, communities that have suffered higher infection and death rates. 
With that in mind, city and state health authorities have pointedly restricted to access to the stadium to eligible residents of the Bronx, at least initially.
Jacqueline Soto, a 55-year-old school secretary from the Bronx resident, was one of hundreds who lined up outside the towering stadium. Members of the National Guard, dressed in camouflage, tapped into iPads to check off names before allowing those with appointments to enter. 
""I was on a wait list for three weeks, desperate to get a vaccine,"" she said. ""I was unsuccessful. But today I'm here. I just went on the link yesterday and already I got the appointment today and I'm happy to be here.""
Dennis Flecha, 60, said he had been trying desperately to get a vaccine since January and heard about the Yankee Stadium site that morning on the news at home in the nearby Castle Hill neighborhood. 
He arrived about 10 a.m., carrying a note from his doctor in his bag explaining that because of his recent heart attacks and hypertension, ""He is very high risk.""
He worried he might be mistaken for someone trying to get a shot before others more deserving.
""But if I get COVID, I'm not going to survive,"" he said, speaking through two masks looped on top of each other. After waiting a couple of hours he received an appointment for Monday afternoon, but still he worried it may not come to pass. ""I could still get kicked out,"" he said.
Mayor Bill de Blasio toured the site, wearing a New York Yankee cap for the occasion even though the Boston native is a die-hard fan of the archrival Red Sox. 
""This is about equity,"" de Blasio said. ""This is about protecting people who need the most protection because the Bronx is one of the places that bore the brunt of this crisis of the coronavirus.""
The city has allocated 15,000 doses for the first week, and some 13,000 appointments had already been booked through next Friday to those in eligible groups, including health workers, some essential workers and people more than 65 years old.
Antonio Soto, a 60-year-old schoolteacher who is married to Jacqueline, said he got concerned as his appointment time passed as he was still waiting in a line.

    ""At first I was scared,"" he said. ""But once you got in there, smooth sailing, everything was beautiful.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A senior United Nations official warned on Friday that ""the risk of atrocity crimes in Ethiopia remains high and likely to get worse"" if the country does not urgently combat ethnic violence, stigmatization, hate speech and religious tensions.
U.N. Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu, said she had received reports of serious human rights violations and abuses by the parties to the conflict in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region and their allies.
""These include extra-judicial killings, sexual violence, looting of property, mass executions and impeded humanitarian access,"" Nderitu said in a statement, adding that she had also received ""disturbing reports of attacks against civilians based on their religion and ethnicity"" in other parts of the country.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered air strikes and a ground offensive against Tigray's former ruling party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - after regional forces attacked federal army bases in the region on Nov. 4. 
The TPLF withdrew from the regional capital, Mekelle, and major cities, but low-level fighting has continued. Both sides deny their forces have committed atrocities, and blame other forces for the killing of civilians.
In the region of more than five million people, thousands of people are believed to have died and 950,000 have fled their homes since fighting began. 
U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock warned the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that conflict in Tigray could trigger broader destabilization in the country and that a dire humanitarian situation in the north was set to worsen.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Friday that the U.N. and aid groups have nearly 80 humanitarian workers in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, who have been waiting for more than a month for government approval to travel to Tigray. 

""We continue to engage and call on the Government for immediate, safe, and unimpeded access of humanitarian personnel and supplies throughout Tigray,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A former Ohio police officer pleaded not guilty on Friday to murder and other charges in the shooting death of an unarmed Black man, the latest in a series of killings that have raised questions of racial injustice in U.S. law enforcement.
At the hearing in Franklin County court, Judge Elizabeta Saken agreed to release the former officer, Adam Coy, a 19-year-veteran of the Columbus police force, on $3 million bail. 
Coy, a 44-year-old white man, was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday in the Dec. 22 killing of Andre Maurice Hill, 47. Coy was responding to a nuisance call about car noise.
The former officer, shackled and dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, appeared at the hearing through a video monitor from a jail where he has been held since his arrest on Wednesday. 
Coy's attorney, Mark Collins, told the court Friday that his client is not a danger to the public and is not a flight risk, emphasizing his connections to the community and family ties.
""This case is unique,"" Collins said. ""It is not a who-done-it, but whether or not his use of force was justified. He is not a threat, your honor.""
Coy was indicted on one charge of murder, one charge of felonious assault and two counts of dereliction of duty.

The case is the latest in a series of police killings of Black people that have highlighted longstanding accusations of racial injustice in U.S. law enforcement. Last summer, a handful of high-profile deaths in Minneapolis, Atlanta and Louisville and elsewhere triggered nationwide protests that pushed police reform to the top of the U.S. political agenda.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The new military rulers of Myanmar on Friday ordered mobile operators and internet service providers to block access to Twitter and Instagram in the country until further notice, Norwegian telecom Telenor said.
The government had already ordered internet providers on Thursday to block Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which counts half of the population of 54 million as users, until Feb. 7.
The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology did not immediately answer a request for comment, but said previously it had blocked Facebook for the sake of ""stability"".
A spokeswoman for Twitter, which is also facing pressure from authorities in India, said it was ""deeply concerned about the order to block Internet services in Myanmar."" 
""It undermines the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard. The Open Internet is increasingly under threat around the world. We will continue to advocate to end destructive government-led shutdowns,"" she said. 
A spokesman for Facebook confirmed the block on Instagram.
""We urge authorities to restore connectivity so that people in Myanmar can communicate with family and friends and access important information,"" he told Reuters.
In a statement, Telenor expressed ""grave concern"" about the directive and said it had challenged its necessity to authorities.
Since the ban on Facebook, thousands in Myanmar have flocked to Twitter and Instagram to express their opposition to Monday's takeover by the army and the ousting and arrest of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
Many people are using social media and pro-democracy hashtags to criticize the army’s takeover and call for peaceful protests until the result of November’s election, which was won in a landslide by Suu Kyi’s party, is respected. 
The hashtags #RespectOurVotes, #HearTheVoiceofMyanmar, and #SaveMyanmar all had hundreds of thousands of interactions by Friday, according to hashtag tracker BrandMentions.

The military has made unsubstantiated claims that the election of Suu Kyi and her National Democracy League was fraudulent. The election commission said the vote was fair.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States expects Saudi Arabia to improve its human rights record, including releasing women's rights activists and other political prisoners, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Friday.
Pskai's comments underscored U.S. President Joe Biden's intention to make human right a key issue in U.S.-Saudi relations, which he pledged during the 2020 campaign to reassess.
Biden on Thursday unveiled a first step in taking a firmer line with the kingdom, announcing an end to U.S. support for offensive operations by the Saudi-led military coalition fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen. 
Psaki side-stepped a question at a White House briefing on whether the administration would impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia for the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul.
Calling Khashoggi's death a ""horrific crime,"" she reiterated the administration's intention to declassify a U.S. intelligence report on the murder, which the CIA assessed was approved - and possibly ordered - by defacto Saudi ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. 
The prince denied ordering the murder. 
""We, of course, expect Saudi Arabia to improve its record on human rights,"" Psaki continued. ""That includes releasing political prisoners such as women's rights advocates from Saudi jails.""
One of the most prominent of those advocates is Loujain al-Hathloul, 31, the leader of a campaign to allow Saudi women to drive, who was arrested in 2018. 
Riyadh drew international criticism in December when, according to her family, she was sentenced by a court to nearly six years in prison.
Psaki said the administration was ""encouraged"" by the release on Thursday of two dual Saudi-U.S. citizens pending their trials.

Bader al-Ibrahim, an epidemiologist and journalist, and Salah al-Haidar, a media commentator whose mother Aziza al-Yousef is a women’s rights campaigner, were arrested in 2019 on terrorism-related charges.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The Harvard Law Review has named a Los Angeles-born Egyptian-American as what it believes is its first Muslim president in its 134-year history, elevating him to the top of one of the most prestigious U.S. law journals.
Harvard Law School student Hassaan Shahawy said he hoped his election represented ""legal academia's growing recognition of the importance of diversity, and perhaps its growing respect for other legal traditions.""
Among the legal and political luminaries who have worked at the Harvard Law Review was former U.S. President Barack Obama, named the journal's first Black president in 1990. Three serving members of the U.S. Supreme Court were editors of the Harvard Law Review, as were the late Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia.
""Coming from a community routinely demonized in American public discourse, I hope this represents some progress, even if small and symbolic,"" Shahawy, 26, told Reuters in an email.
Law reviews are staffed by the top students at U.S. law schools, who are often recruited for judicial clerkships and other prestigious jobs in the profession.
The review's first female president, Susan Estrich, was elected in 1977. Other presidents have been Latino and openly gay. The first Black woman was elected president in 2017.
Shahawy graduated Harvard as an undergraduate in 2016 with a degree in History and Near Eastern Studies. He then attended the University of Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar to pursue a doctorate in Oriental Studies and studied Islamic law.

Shahawy said he has been active working with refugee populations and on criminal justice reform. His future plans are unclear, though he cited the possibility of becoming a public interest lawyer or working in academia.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell have accused the U.S. government of prosecuting her for aiding Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuses only because Epstein is dead and they want to hold someone else responsible.
The accusation was made in one of several Thursday night court filings seeking to dismiss or narrow the case against Maxwell, who is accused of helping Epstein recruit three teenage girls for sex between 1994 and 1997, and then lying about it.
Maxwell, 59, was charged last July, 11 months after Epstein killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting sex trafficking charges.
Her lawyers said the government's ""sudden zeal"" to concoct a case branding Maxwell as ""Epstein's equal - if not his superior"" reflected its effort to evade a 2007 non-prosecution agreement for Epstein that also covered associates like her.
""One does not need to engage in complex analysis to understand what has happened here: the government has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein,"" her lawyers wrote.
""In trying 'to get' Ms. Maxwell, the government compromised its standards, cut corners, and exceeded its authority under the law.""
A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment on Friday.
Maxwell is being held in jail in Brooklyn, and has been denied bail twice.
She has raised other arguments for dismissal, including that the suburban grand jury that indicted her included too few Blacks and Hispanics, depriving her of her right to diversity.
Epstein's nonprosecution agreement shielded him and his associates from federal charges over his alleged sexual abuses at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida.
He pleaded guilty to a Florida state prostitution charge and served just 13 months in jail.
Some of Epstein's accusers have said they were wrongly kept in the dark while the agreement was negotiated.
A federal appeals court in Atlanta is considering their effort to void it, which would let them discuss with prosecutors why Epstein's associates should be charged.
Strauss' office has said the agreement applies only in Florida.

The case is U.S. v. Maxwell, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-cr-00330.

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - India said on Friday it was restoring high-speed mobile internet in the federal territory of Jammu and Kashmir for the first time since August 2019, when the government withdrew the special rights of the restive Muslim-dominated region.
Jammu and Kashmir was India's only Muslim-majority state before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government split it into two, including an enclave with many Buddhists, and took direct control of both.
Much of the Himalayan mountain territory is also claimed by Pakistan, India's arch-rival in South Asia.
""4G mobile internet services being restored in entire J&K,"" local administration spokesman Rohit Kansal said on Twitter.
India broke up Kashmir in mid-2019 by sending additional troops mainly to the Kashmir Valley, and detaining political leaders to crack down on dissent in the region where India has been fighting an insurgency for decades.
One of those detained and released politicians, former J&K Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, tweeted his happiness at the New Delhi government's move on the internet.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The European Union's top diplomat appealed to Russia on Friday to free jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, a case he said had brought EU-Russian ties to a low, drawing a robust response from Moscow which called the EU an unreliable partner. 
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was jailed this week for almost three years for parole violations he called trumped up, a move the West sharply condemned. 
In Moscow for rare talks, Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, said he had pressed Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on the Navalny case. 
Borrell said there was not yet a formal proposal for new EU sanctions on Russia but that the 27-member bloc would have a discussion next month about relations between the EU and Russia.
""I have conveyed to Minister Lavrov our deep concern and our appeal for his (Navalny's) release and for the launch of an investigation over his poisoning,"" Borrell told a news conference alongside Lavrov. 
""Over the last years our relationship has been marked by fundamental differences and a lack of trust.""
Navalny was arrested at the Russian border on Jan. 17 on his return from treatment in Germany, where he was flown in August after being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent.
The Kremlin has questioned whether Navalny was poisoned last August and has denied any involvement in it if he was. 
Lavrov said it was up to Brussels if it wanted to impose sanctions on Russia, but that the EU was behaving more and more like Washington in its use of unilateral sanctions. 
He described the EU as an unreliable partner.
The veteran Russian foreign minister said Moscow and the EU were at odds over an array of issues, but that there appeared to be a readiness on both side to engage pragmatically where possible, something Borrell echoed. 
""We share the view that a further deterioration of ties is fraught with negative and highly unpredictable consequences,"" Lavrov said.
Despite close trade ties and energy interdependence, Russia's political relations with the European Union soured after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 
Navalny was back in court on Friday for a slander trial. 
He is accused of slandering a World War Two veteran who took part in a promotional video backing reforms last year that let Putin run for two more terms in the Kremlin after 2024 if he wants.
Navalny at the time described the people in the video as traitors and lackeys. He denies the slander charge. 
""This case in general was intended as a kind of PR process because the Kremlin needs the headlines: Navalny slandered a veteran,"" he told the court. 
""I find it really disgusting and unbearable... You've been using him (the veteran) as a puppet... you're making a mockery of a 95-year-old man."" 
In comments by video link at the trial, the veteran called on Navalny to apologise publicly to him before saying he could not continue taking part in the hearing for health reasons. 

Though the charge is currently punishable by up to two years in jail, his lawyers say he cannot face a custodial sentence because the alleged crime was committed before the law was changed to make it a jailable offence.

757,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 10:46AM ET</span>",Explainer: Can Scotland hold another independence referendum?,"By Michael Holden and Andrew MacAskill
LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish nationalists are pushing for an independence referendum to be held after this May's Scottish parliament election, but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said such votes should happen only once in a generation.
In a referendum in 2014, Scots voted 55%-45% to remain in the United Kingdom, but both Brexit and the British government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis have bolstered support for independence among Scots, and demands for a second vote.
MAY ELECTION 
The first step to a referendum is victory for the ruling nationalist Scottish National Party in the election of a Scottish Parliament on May 6. Surveys suggest they are on course to win a clear majority.
Scottish First Minister Sturgeon, who is also SNP leader, has said she then wants to put a bill before that parliament for a referendum to be held ""in the early part of the new term"". 
WHAT WOULD A REFERENDUM MEAN?
If Scots voted to leave, it would be the biggest shock to the UK since Irish independence a century ago - just as all of the UK grapples with the impact of Brexit, a move that Scotland's voters strongly opposed.
The nations of Britain have shared the same monarch since 1603, when King James VI of Scotland became James I of England. In 1707, a formal union created the Kingdom of Great Britain.
Today, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland binds England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland into an economy worth $3 trillion a year.
SECTION 30
Under the 1998 Scotland Act - which created the Scottish parliament and devolved some powers from Westminster - all matters relating to the ""Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and England"" are reserved to the UK parliament in London.
Westminster can grant the Scottish government the authority to hold a referendum using a so-called ""Section 30"" order, a process that was used to allow the 2014 plebiscite to go ahead.
In effect, that gives Johnson the say on whether or not Scotland gets a referendum.
WILL PERMISSION BE GIVEN?
In January 2020, Johnson refused Sturgeon permission to hold another referendum, saying the 2014 vote had been a ""once in a generation"" event, and he has ruled it out repeatedly since. 
The SNP says that, if it wins the election in May, Johnson will have ""no moral or democratic justification"" to refuse it another referendum.
If he does again say ""No"", the SNP says the Scottish government would push ahead with passing a referendum bill in the Edinburgh parliament, and that Johnson would have to go to court to ""block the will of the Scottish people"".
COURT BATTLE
Before any Scottish bill is enacted, it can be referred to the Supreme Court, the UK's highest judicial body, to decide whether it exceeds the Scottish parliament's powers under the Scotland Act.
It is almost certain that a referendum bill, if passed without explicit permission and over the opposition of the British government, would be referred.
Judge David Hope, former deputy president of the Supreme Court, said the Scotland Act was a major constraint on the Scottish government: ""They are trapped within a statute which is very carefully drafted.""
Others think it is not so clear-cut. ""There are respectable arguments for saying that a referendum bill would be within devolved competence,"" said Professor Aileen McHarg, an expert on constitutional law at Durham University.
TESTING THE WATERS
The question of the need for a Section 30 order, and the Scottish government's ability to hold a referendum without London's permission, is already being tested in the Scottish courts.
Edinburgh's Court of Session said on Friday, Feb. 5, that a case brought by independence campaigner Martin Keatings was premature, and declined to rule on the legal issues it raised. 
Keating said he would appeal, and the case could ultimately end up in the UK Supreme Court.
WILDCAT REFERENDUM? 
If a proposed referendum were blocked by Johnson and the courts, some in the SNP say the Scottish government should press ahead regardless, with an indicative vote. 
But others in the party and legal experts say that, because the legitimacy of such vote is questionable, opponents of independence would simply boycott it, and so undermine its credibility.
""Without a statutory underpinning, it seems to me to be a complete non-starter,"" McHarg said.

758,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 10:36AM ET</span>",China's latest weapon against Taiwan: the sand dredger,"By Yimou Lee
ON BOARD THE TAIWAN COAST GUARD SHIP PP-10062, East China Sea (Reuters) - Taiwanese coast guard commander Lin Chie-ming is on the frontline of a new type of warfare that China is waging against Taiwan. China's weapon? Sand.
On a chilly morning in late January, Lin, clad in an orange uniform, stood on the rolling deck of his boat as it patrolled in choppy waters off the Taiwan-run Matsu Islands. A few kilometers away, the Chinese coast was faintly visible from Lin's boat. He was on the lookout for Chinese sand-dredging ships encroaching on waters controlled by Taiwan.
The Chinese goal, Taiwanese officials say: pressure Taiwan by tying down the island democracy's naval defenses and undermining the livelihoods of Matsu residents.
Half an hour into the patrol, Lin's nine-man crew spotted two 3,000-ton dredgers, dwarfing their 100-ton vessel. Parked just outside Taiwan's waters, neither of the dredgers clearly displayed their names, making it difficult for a crew member to identify them as he peered through binoculars.
Upon spotting Lin's boat, armed with two water cannons and a machine gun, the dredgers quickly pulled up anchor and headed back toward the Chinese coast.
""They think this area is part of China's territory,"" said Lin, referring to Chinese dredgers that have been intruding into Matsu's waters. ""They usually leave after we drive them away, but they come back again after we go away.""
The sand-dredging is one weapon China is using against Taiwan in a campaign of so-called gray-zone warfare, which entails using irregular tactics to exhaust a foe without actually resorting to open combat. Since June last year, Chinese dredgers have been swarming around the Matsu Islands, dropping anchor and scooping up vast amounts of sand from the ocean bed for construction projects in China.
The ploy is taxing for Taiwan's civilian-run Coast Guard Administration, which is now conducting round-the-clock patrols in an effort to repel the Chinese vessels. Taiwanese officials and Matsu residents say the dredging forays have had other corrosive impacts - disrupting the local economy, damaging undersea communication cables and intimidating residents and tourists to the islands. Local officials also fear that the dredging is destroying marine life nearby.

Besides Matsu, where 13,300 people live, the coast guard says China has also been dredging in the shallow waters near the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which has long served as an unofficial buffer separating China and Taiwan.
Last year, Taiwan expelled nearly 4,000 Chinese sand-dredgers and sand-transporting vessels from waters under its control, most of them in the area close to the median line, according to Taiwan's coast guard. That's a 560% jump over the 600 Chinese vessels that were repelled in all of 2019.
In Matsu, there were also many Chinese vessels that sailed close to Taiwanese waters without actually entering, forcing the coast guard to be on constant alert.
The dredging is a ""gray-zone strategy with Chinese characteristics,"" said Su Tzu-yun, an associate research fellow at Taiwan's top military think tank, the Institute for National Defense and Security Research. ""You dredge for sand on the one hand, but if you can also put pressure on Taiwan, then that's great, too.""
'PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE'
Sand is just part of the gray-zone campaign. China, which claims democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory, has been using other irregular tactics to wear down the island of 23 million. The most dramatic: In recent months, the People's Liberation Army, China's military, has been dispatching warplanes in menacing forays toward the island. Taiwan has been scrambling military aircraft on an almost daily basis to head off the threat, placing an onerous burden on its air force.
Taiwanese military officials and Western analysts say China's gray-zone tactics are meant to drain the resources and erode the will of the island's armed forces - and make such harassment so routine that the world grows inured to it. China's sand dredging, said one Taiwanese security official investigating the matter, is ""part of their psychological warfare against Taiwan, similar to what they are doing in Taiwan's southwestern airspace,"" where the Chinese jets are intruding.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office said in a statement to Reuters that Taiwan's claims that Beijing is allowing sand-dredging boats to engage in ""illegal operations"" near Matsu and the median line are baseless. The office did say it has taken steps to stop illegal sand-dredging, without elaborating.
The office also said Taiwan is ""an inseparable part of China."" Taiwanese authorities, it alleged, are using their claims of control over the waters near the islands to ""detain mainland boats and even resorting to dangerous and violent means in their treatment of mainland crews.""
Asked about China's gray-zone actions, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees policy toward China, said the Chinese Communist Party was engaging in ""harassment"" with the aim of putting pressure on Taiwan. The council said the government had recently increased penalties for illegal dredging in its waters.
Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense did not respond to questions.
Chinese President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force to subdue Taiwan. If he succeeds - by gray-zone tactics or outright war - it would dramatically undermine America's decades of strategic dominance in the Asia-Pacific region and propel China toward preeminence in the area.
The Matsu Islands are almost an hour by plane from Taipei. They are one of a handful of island groups close to China's coast that Taiwan has governed since 1949, when the defeated Republic of China government, under Chiang Kai-shek, fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil war. The Matsu, Kinmen and Pratas island groups lie several hundred kilometers from mainland Taiwan. Their isolation, and their much-reduced Taiwanese military presence since the end of the Cold War, would make them highly vulnerable to a Chinese attack.
Matsu is just nine kilometers from the Chinese coastline at the closest point. The island has a total of just nine coast guard ships, ranging from 10 to 100 tons. On some days, government officials said, the coast guard has faced hundreds of Chinese vessels, ranging in size from 1,000 to 3,000 tons, in and around the island's waters. Taiwan says those waters extend six kilometers out from the coastline here. China doesn't officially recognize any claims of sovereignty by Taiwan.
At one point last year, more than 200 Chinese sand-dredging and transport boats were spotted operating south of Nangan, the main Matsu islet, three Taiwanese officials told Reuters. Lin, the coast guard commander, recalls a similar scene playing out on the morning of Oct. 25, when he and his colleagues encountered an armada of roughly 100 Chinese boats. That day, he said, his team expelled seven Chinese vessels that breached Matsu waters.
""People were frightened by the scene,"" he said, referring to local residents. ""They were speculating about the purpose of the mainland boats and whether they would pose a security threat to the Matsu region.""
NEW BOATS
In some stand-offs, Taiwan's coast guard has sprayed high-power water cannons at the Chinese ships in an attempt to drive them away. Last year, Taiwan impounded four Chinese vessels and detained 37 crew members, according to the coast guard. Ten of those arrested were given sentences of six to seven months in prison. The others are still on trial, the coast guard said.
Taiwan is in the process of beefing up its coast guard, partly in response to the dredging threat. Last year, President Tsai Ing-wen commissioned into service the first of a new class of coast guard vessel, based on the design of an ""aircraft-carrier killer,"" a missile boat for the navy.
More than 100 new coast guard boats will be built in the next decade, Tsai said in December, vowing to enforce a crackdown with ""no mercy"" on Chinese dredging in Taiwan waters. In the meantime, larger patrol boats were sent to temporarily reinforce the coast guard in Matsu, whose 117 members are now conducting 24-hour patrols.
The number of sand dredgers off the coast of Matsu dropped significantly at the end of last year, as winter weather brought rougher seas that make dredging difficult. When the seasons change and the seas are calmer, local residents fear that dredgers will be back.
From the late 1950s through to the late 1970s, Chinese forces occasionally bombarded the Matsu Islands with artillery shells. Remnants of that era are still visible across the island group, from old air-raid tunnels to anti-Communist slogans displayed on the rugged cliffs of Nangan island.
Today, Matsu is a popular tourist destination. Its picturesque old-stone homes have been turned into fashionable guest houses.
But locals say China's dredging tactics are hurting their livelihoods. Chen Kuo-chiang, who runs a seafood restaurant on Nangan, says the dredging has led to a drastic decline in the number of fish he catches off the island. Three years ago, he was hooking a dozen a day with his rod, said Chen, 39, as he stood fishing on some rocks in a Nangan port. Now, he said, he struggles to catch one or two.
The fears of a Chinese invasion are palpable on Nangan. Chen thinks the sand dredging might be a precursor to an attack by Chinese forces. ""We don't want to be ruled by mainland China,"" he said. ""We have freedom, which is limited over there.""
Tsai Chia-chen, who works at an ocean-front bed and breakfast, said concern was particularly high ahead of the U.S. presidential election in early November. At the time, said Tsai, rumors circulated that China might seize the window of opportunity with the United States distracted by the election to launch an attack on Taiwan. The large number of Chinese dredgers around the islands in late October added to the anxiety, she recalled.
""Our guests were obviously worried,"" she said. ""There was only one small Taiwan coast guard boat, surrounded by many huge dredgers.""
DAMAGED CABLES
On five occasions last year, the dredgers damaged undersea communication cables between Nangan and Juguang, another isle in the Matsu group, the three Taiwanese officials told Reuters. Mobile phone and internet services for the islanders were disrupted, they said. There were no such incidents in 2019.
State-backed Chunghwa Telecom said it spent T$60 million (about $2 million) to fix the cables last year. It also hired a local fishing boat to conduct daily patrols to ensure the safety of the cables.
The coast guard said most of the fully loaded Chinese vessels around Matsu have been seen heading with their sand in a northerly direction, towards the city of Wenzhou, where the local Chinese government has been touting a massive land reclamation project.
Known as the Ou Fei project, the area has been reclaimed for a new economic zone. It encompasses about 66 square kilometers - more than double the area of all the Matsu Islands. On its website, the Wenzhou local government describes the project as a ""major strategic development for the future"" of the city.
The Wenzhou city government didn't respond to a request for comment.
Following contact on the local level between the two sides, China detained several dredging boats last month, according to Taiwan's coast guard. But a Taiwan-initiated meeting with authorities in the port city of Fuzhou to discuss the dredging was ""postponed indefinitely"" and without explanation in late December, said Wang Chien-hua, who oversees economic development in the local government that administers Matsu.
Taiwan had been planning to use the online meeting to urge Chinese authorities to enforce mandatory registration for dredgers and punish those who go out to sea without reporting to the authorities, according to an internal government note reviewed by Reuters.
The Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing said the local authorities on both sides maintained ""necessary communication and collaboration"" to ensure order on the seas.
Aboard his patrol vessel, Taiwanese commander Lin sounded defiant. The coast guard, he said, ""will use force to drive away"" Chinese ships that enter Taiwan's waters.

""That way we can reassure the people in Matsu. At the moment, we are capable of doing this job.""

759,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 10:11AM ET</span>",Student protests highlight Erdogan's struggle to win over Turkey's Gen Z,"By Ali Kucukgocmen and Ece Toksabay
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish student Azelya Celik works late into the night typing up notes on molecular biology before grabbing a few hours sleep and heading into university - not to attend lectures but to support protests she says are crucial to shaping her country's future.
Celik is one of hundreds at Istanbul's prestigious Bogazici University who have protested for a month against the appointment of a university rector by President Tayyip Erdogan, a move the students say was undemocratic.
The demonstrations at the university, which overlooks the Bosphorus on the city's European side, grew this week as crowds took to streets elsewhere in the city and the capital Ankara.
Although dwarfed by protests which swept Turkey eight years ago, the demonstrations have defied authorities for four weeks and highlight a critical obstacle to Erdogan's hopes of extending his rule into a third decade at the next election - disaffected young Turks who think he has nothing to offer.
Police have detained over 600 people since Jan. 4 and the government has strongly criticised the protesters, labelling them terrorists.
Istanbul neighbourhoods have lent the students noisy support, banging pots and pans from their balconies at 9 p.m. The United States has expressed concern at the detentions, and condemned the language used by officials against demonstrators.
""We are holding art exhibitions, our friends are meditating outside the (rector's) building and we are being called terrorists,"" 25-year-old Celik said.
The protests against the rector were about ""the right to be able ... to have a say in the future of the country,"" she added, speaking outside the campus where barricades have been set up and riot police stationed for the past month.
""They want us to only study, put our heads down and not say anything about the future of the country. But that's not how it works.""
Erdogan said on Friday he chose the rector from a list of nine names submitted by education officials - a process he had done twice before.
'GENERATION Z DOESN'T KNOW'
Erdogan said there would be no repeat of the nationwide protests in 2013, when hundreds of thousands of people marched in Istanbul and elsewhere in the biggest popular challenge to then-premier Erdogan.
But after nearly two decades in power championing Islamic values and religious education aimed at raising a ""pious generation"" of Turks, the president has conceded that not everyone remains receptive to his message.
Those born after the mid-1990s, or Turkey's Generation Z who have few memories of life before Erdogan took power in 2003, don't appreciate his party's achievements, he said last week. That presents a challenge in elections due in 2023.
""Those who did not live in the old Turkey, our youth who didn't suffer those troubles ... we are struggling to tell them the importance of Turkey's gains,"" Erdogan said in parliament, pointing to huge advances in health and infrastructure.
""Generation Z doesn't know what state our patients were in at our public hospitals when (the opposition) was in charge.""
Successive polls have shown a gradual erosion of support for Erdogan's AK Party, partly because of economic slowdown in the last three years after a 15-year boom of 5% annual economic growth. That has left the AKP dependent on an alliance with nationalists for its parliamentary majority.
Critics say a crackdown following a 2016 coup attempt has muzzled dissent, with more than 90% of the media controlled by the government or its business allies, and new regulation putting potential constraints on social media companies.
Celik and other students say they bypass Turkey's media to get their news. Young people ""no longer consider information they get from TVs and mainstream media as correct,"" she said.
Kemal Ozkiraz, founder and chairman of Avrasya polling company, told Reuters the government was losing touch with the youth and that only around a third of some 5 million new eligible voters in 2023 would support the AK Party.
Ozkiraz was citing a survey last month based on face-to-face interviews with more than 5,000 people in some 25 cities across Turkey.
""While the youth expect promises, hopes and dreams about the future, the AK Party is promising them the past,"" he said.
A senior AKP official said polling which suggested younger voters would lean towards other parties at the next election was not realistic and ignored the opportunities which Erdogan's government had provided.
""Our duty as politicians is to catch up to them mentally, show them the realities. We are doing our best to keep their hopes alive,"" the official said. 
'FUTURE ELSEWHERE'
Increasingly disenchanted, more young people are looking to move abroad, Avrasya's Ozkiraz said, citing a survey of 8,000 people in September that showed 76% of people between the ages of 18-29 wanted to emigrate.
Korcan Yaksi, a master's degree holder from Bogazici University, is moving to Canada this year.
""In the last five to 10 years, this country has made me feel like I don't belong here. I cannot see myself living in Turkey in the long term, nor can I dream of a future here,"" the 29-year-old LGBT man said.
The biggest factor for him was ""the discriminating and violent rhetoric used by politicians in Turkey constantly in an effort to marginalize me and people like me.""
The AK Party sees the LGBT community as a threat against family values which hold society together.
According to official data, the number of people who emigrated from Turkey in 2019 increased by 2% from the previous year to 330,000. More than 40% of those who moved abroad were aged between 20 and 34.
Authorities say the number of Turks leaving is more than compensated by other 677,000 people who moved to Turkey.
Celik, the biology student, said she was also considering leaving Turkey, saying AKP governments had ruined a school system that enabled her to get into one of the country's most prestigious universities despite her modest background.
Pointing to changes in the education system and syllabus, including a 2017 decision to remove evolution from school lessons, she said the moves looked foolish now as the government warned people about the evolving COVID-19 strains.
""We're seeing now what coronavirus is doing to us, they are talking about mutations. I say: 'So evolution didn't exist?'""
As a woman and LGBTI+ person, Turkey also felt unsafe, she added.

""The only place I felt safe was this school,"" she said of Bogazici. ""You cannot imagine how much it upsets us to see this school in this way ... encircled by barricades everywhere.""

760,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 10:06AM ET</span>",Turkish authorities detain 65 more people over university protests,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police detained 65 people late on Thursday over protests which first started last month at a top university, authorities said on Friday, continuing a crackdown on the protesters despite growing international criticism.
The Istanbul governor's office said the protesters had violated a ban on public demonstrations, gatherings and marches imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, by carrying out ""illegal acts"" in the Kadikoy district.
Some 600 people have been detained since January 4 after protests spread in Istanbul and Ankara, authorities have said. Most have been released, despite repeated statements from officials that the protesters are terrorists. 
The protests were triggered by Erdogan's appointment of a new rector at Istanbul's Bogazici University, a process that students say was undemocratic. 
The government has dismissed the criticism, saying the protests are politically driven. Officials have also deployed what the United States and United Nations have both described as homophobic rhetoric in their criticism of the students.
Officials have condemned an art display at the university that included a picture blending Islamic and LGBT images. One minister labelled the protesters deviants. 
The EU Commission said the detention of students ""exercising their legitimate right to freedom of assembly"" was deeply worrying, and the COVID-19 pandemic should not be used as a reason to silence critical voices. 
""Hate speech displayed by high-level officials against LGBTI students during these events is unacceptable,"" it said. 
On Wednesday, Erdogan had said his government will not allow the protests to swell into a repeat of widespread demonstrations in 2013, calling protesters terrorists. 
Asked about the international criticism on Friday, Erdogan said the United States should handle its own domestic issues, adding that the Bogazici protests ""have nothing to do with the students whatsoever"" and were supported by opposition parties.
""Let me say this to the United States: Are you not ashamed of what happened in the United States before the election in terms of democracy?"" he said, referring to the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests.

""Racism reached a new high. How will you explain to the world how your police killed your Black citizens?"" he told reporters in Istanbul.

761,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 09:56AM ET</span>","In Saddam strongholds that fought America, Iraqis fear a U.S. departure","By John Davison and Ahmed Rasheed
FALLUJAH, Iraq (Reuters) - Abu Arkan Ibrahim picked up a rifle and joined the Iraqi insurgency against U.S. troops when they occupied his hometown of Fallujah in 2003. He was badly burned in the fighting. Now, he fears the departure of the Americans he once battled.
Over the past 17 years, the municipal employee has watched his city fall to the United States, al Qaeda, Islamic State and, most recently, Iraqi forces fighting alongside Iran-backed paramilitaries. Ibrahim said the presence of U.S. troops in recent years helped suppress remaining Islamic State militants and rein in the Iran-backed militias - mutual foes accused by Iraqi officials of attacking locals. The U.S. troop drawdown is creating a security vacuum, Ibrahim said, making Fallujah more dangerous.
“I’d rather have the Americans here than the alternatives,” the 37-year old said.
Ibrahim’s assessment is shared by many security officials, former fighters and residents in north and west regions of the country that comprise up to a third of Iraqi territory, former insurgent strongholds once loyal to Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein.
They say Islamic State and the Iran-backed paramilitaries stand to gain most from Washington’s troop reduction. They point to an increase in attacks by Islamic State, and fear the Iran-backed militias will use this violence to justify entrenching themselves.
Last month, the United States completed a reduction of its forces in Iraq to 2,500 troops. That’s about half the level of less than a year ago.
Recent months have witnessed more than 25 deadly attacks that Iraqi officials attribute to Islamic State militants. Last month, the group staged its biggest attack in years with a suicide bombing in the capital Baghdad that killed more than 30 people.
The U.S. embassy in Baghdad declined to comment.
The U.S.-led military coalition of 80 nations battling Islamic State in Iraq said it carried out 10 strikes against militant targets in Iraq in December alone.
A coalition official said there were no plans to reverse the drawdown and said Iraqi forces were capable of handling the ongoing Islamic State insurgency with current levels of coalition support.
Washington’s contingent is the largest in the coalition force, which includes 900 troops from other countries. Still, the U.S. presence in Iraq is tiny compared to the 170,000 troops it stationed in the country after its invasion.
Parts of Iraq’s 300,000-strong military operate across the country’s western and northern areas. The paramilitaries number at least 100,000, with a significant portion in the north and west. Security officials and analysts estimate there are thousands of Islamic State fighters.
One U.S. official acknowledged the withdrawal over the past year has reduced American military capabilities in Iraq but stressed that U.S. assistance has continued. “We’re still working hard to enable and support our Iraqi partners,” said the official, adding the Iraqis were already operating more independently.
The official conceded Islamic State remains a determined enemy. “So it’s not a bloodless future,” the official said.
The administration of President Joe Biden has given no indication it intends to significantly reverse the drawdown started under predecessor Donald Trump. The Pentagon said the Biden administration is conducting a review of numbers and position of troops, including in Iraq.
An Iraqi government spokesman said the drawdown hasn’t affected its ability to contain Islamic State. “There is ongoing coordination” with the U.S. forces that remain, he said.
Most Iraqis oppose foreign influence. Some welcome the U.S. withdrawal. But many, especially in Sunni regions, say they would choose a small American military presence over increased power for the pro-Iran militias.
Paramilitaries aligned with Iran say the Islamic State insurgency against the Iraqi military requires them to stay in the Sunni-majority regions to fight the militants. They vow to drive foreign forces out of Iraq if Biden does not commit to a full withdrawal. The Iran-aligned paramilitaries deny involvement in any attacks or human-rights abuses.
Islamic State fighters controlled nearly a third of Iraq between 2014 and 2017. They now occupy remote desert areas and mountain ranges. They regularly claim attacks that kill soldiers and Shi’ite militiamen in Iraq.
EMBOLDENED ISLAMIC STATE
Fallujah and other major cities in Sunni regions once held by Islamic State have begun to revive. Newly paved main roads run past busy shops and restaurants. But outside urban centres, buildings flattened in battle remain in ruins. Thousands of displaced families have not yet returned.
Accompanied by his young son, Ibrahim spoke at a crowded Fallujah intersection that in October saw the city’s first motorcycle bomb in two years. Iraqi officials blamed Islamic State. There has been no claim or denial of responsibility from the group.
“In recent months, we’ve seen more Daesh attacks across all these areas,” said Salah al-Essawi, a Sunni paramilitary commander in the area, using an alternative term for Islamic State. The attacks include an assault that killed two security personnel after the Fallujah bombing in October. Essawi and other Iraqi security officials attribute the killings to Islamic State, which hasn’t commented.
Some Iraqi military officials say the rise in violence is due in large part to the reduced American presence.
An Iraqi army officer who works with the U.S.-led coalition cited an example of the Iraqi military’s reliance on America: a recent airstrike that killed a top Islamic State leader. It was a joint U.S.-Iraqi effort, he said.
“Our troops were pursuing him, but would have struggled to find where he was hiding if not for the U.S. air support,” the officer said. He said the coalition carries out fewer air strikes against Islamic State targets than it used to.
The coalition official said U.S.-led forces provided air support to Iraqi special forces for that operation. The Iraqi government spokesman said the operation was led by Iraqi forces.
IRAN-ALIGNED GROUPS
Shi’ite paramilitaries say that as Islamic State intensifies its insurgency, Iraqi forces need their help. The Iran-aligned groups are part of a Baghdad-run paramilitary umbrella that works alongside Iraqi security forces to police remote former Islamic State areas.
“Many threats still exist and the duty of the factions is to deal with Daesh or any other foreign threat,” Nasr al-Shammari, a senior official in the Harakat al-Nujaba paramilitary, told Reuters weeks before Biden’s inauguration.
Shammari wants the United States out, saying the presence of its troops fuels instability. Iraqis who want U.S. forces to stay are a politically-motivated minority, he said.
Many residents of Fallujah and nearby towns fear being caught up in reprisals for the increasing Islamic State attacks - both from Iraqi security forces and even more so from Shi’ite paramilitaries. 
Ibrahim said he has been detained by both over the years on suspicion of links with al Qaeda and Islamic State, which he denies. 
Essawi, the Sunni paramilitary leader, said the Shi’ite militias have been emboldened by talk of the U.S. drawdown. The Iran-aligned forces, Essawi said, have put their flags back up at some checkpoints they had planned to abandon.

“We hope Biden won’t leave us in their hands,” he said.

762,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 09:55AM ET</span>",Analysis: Russia's Navalny case casts shadow on German politics ahead of election,"By Thomas Escritt and Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Pity Germany's next chancellor.
The poisoning and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny has thrust Nord Stream 2 - a pipeline to take Russian gas to Europe - up Germany's political agenda. That has created a serious problem for Angela Merkel's likely successor before he has even got going, leaving prospects for a viable coalition government after the September election up in the air.
The man in pole position to succeed Merkel after the vote, new Christian Democrat leader Armin Laschet, firmly supports Nord Stream 2 but his would-be governing partner, the ecologist Greens, are stiffening their opposition to it.
The Navalny case has galvanised the Greens into ramping up their demand that the pipeline be stopped, and it threatens to hamstring the next chancellor, who must also contend with U.S. opposition and even doubts from France, Germany's closest ally.
Navalny, sentenced on Tuesday to 3-1/2 years in jail after a Moscow court ruled he had violated terms of his parole, was arrested on Jan. 17 after returning to Russia from Germany where he was treated for poisoning with a military-grade nerve agent.
His sentencing spurred Greens leader Annalena Baerbock to press Merkel's government to renounce the politically charged pipeline project, whose construction has been largely suspended since December 2019 following a threat of sanctions from the United States and the withdrawal of a pipe-laying company.
""We'll push hard for that now and in the future,"" Baerbock told broadcaster ZDF this week when asked if the project could not go ahead with her party in the German government.
More than 90% of the project has been completed and it is officially due to be launched later this year.
But Greens opposition has the weight of opinion of the United States and many around Europe. The pipeline's reliance on services provided by countries flanking the crowded Baltic Sea means there are many pressure points: withdrawals under U.S. pressure by safety certification firms in Denmark and Norway could yet torpedo the project, according to a Greens source.
Omid Nouripour, the Greens' spokesman on foreign affairs, told Reuters that Nord Stream 2 was ""a bet against climate protection, a divisive issue for the European Union, a terrible bet for our energy security"".
The Navalny affair has prompted the Greens to double down on their opposition to the project, which would pipe Russian natural gas into Germany, from where there could be onward flow elsewhere in Europe.
""Novichok, the arrest of the opposition leader, 3,300 arrests in one day, massive police violence - none of that is exactly weakening our position (against) Nord Stream,"" Nouripour said.
He refused to be drawn on the prospects of a ""Black-Green"" coalition in Berlin with the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), saying only: ""People talk a lot about Black-Green. People always talk a lot.""
Laschet, contrary to the Greens, said in an interview with Reuters this week that Nord Stream 2 was essential to securing Germany's energy security. 
He professed himself undaunted by the Nord Stream 2 flap, saying he did not think the pipeline would be an insurmountable obstacle to any coalition talks: ""I think consensus with the Greens, for example, is possible.""
INTRA-PARTY DISPUTES
Germany's increasingly fractured political landscape means a coalition of the CDU/CSU conservative alliance and the Greens is the most likely scenario after the September vote, when Merkel is stepping down after four terms in office spanning 15 years.
""Given the new chancellor will have to spend a lot of energy on intra-party disputes and coalition politics, prospects of over-delivering (on diplomacy) are low, at least in the short-term,"" said Naz Masraff at political risk consultancy Eurasia.
""A more inward-looking Germany is what we will get (on the) international stage. Merkel will be deeply missed,"" she said.
Complicating the diplomatic challenge for Berlin, French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune said on Monday France had urged Germany to drop Nord Stream 2, particularly after the mass arrest of Navalny supporters.
German diplomats said they had the impression Beaune was expressing his own view rather than the French government's, and Berlin's position was in any case unchanged.
Germany and Russia say Nord Stream 2 is just a commercial project. Washington has long argued the pipeline will dangerously increase Russian leverage over Europe. New U.S. President Joe Biden believes it is a ""bad deal for Europe"".
European Union lawmakers passed a resolution last month calling for the bloc to stop the completion of Nord Stream 2, in response to Navalny's incarceration.
With so many forces ranged against the pipeline, there is talk in some quarters of Berlin that it may never be finished, instead either suspended forever just a few kilometres (miles) short of German landfall - or completed but never switched on.

""Perhaps the trial of Navalny finally gives Germany an opportunity to make a strength out of a weakness and rethink our position on the pipeline,"" the Greens source said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The BBC came under renewed fire from Chinese officials on Friday in a diplomatic dispute a day after Britain's media regulator revoked the TV licence of Chinese state media outlet CGTN.
Britain and China have exchanged barbs for months over China's crackdown on dissent in the former British colony of Hong Kong, concern over the security of Huawei technology, and the treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region. 
On Thursday, Britain's Ofcom revoked the licence of CGTN, the English-language sister channel of state broadcaster CCTV, after concluding that China's ruling Communist Party had ultimate editorial responsibility for the channel. 
Minutes later, China's foreign ministry accused the British Broadcasting Corp of pushing ""fake news"" in its COVID-19 reporting, demanding an apology and saying that the broadcaster had politicized the pandemic and ""rehashed theories about covering up by China"".
The BBC said its reporting is fair and unbiased.
On Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin criticised the Ofcom ruling as ""politicising the issue on a technical point"" and warned that China reserves the right to make a ""necessary response"".
Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper separately reported on Thursday that Britain had in the past year expelled three Chinese spies who were there on journalism visas.
China's state media has ramped up attacks on the British public broadcaster in recent weeks.
""I highly suspect that the BBC has been closely instigated by the intelligence agencies of the US and the UK. It has become a bastion of the Western public opinion war against China,"" Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Communist Party-backed tabloid the Global Times, said on Twitter.
The foreign ministry's criticism of the BBC was among the top trends on China's Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platform on Friday. 
""BBC shall not become Bad-mouthing Broadcasting Corporation,"" ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Twitter.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman declined to comment directly when asked if it was appropriate for the Chinese government to criticise the BBC.
""The UK is committed to the promotion of media freedom internationally, and to championing democracy and human rights, around the world,"" the spokesman said.
BBC broadcasts, like those of most major Western news outlets, are blocked in China.
Some people called for the BBC to be expelled in response to CGTN's licence being revoked. 
""The BBC has long been stationed in Beijing, yet has always held ideological prejudice and broadcast fake news from its platform, deliberately defaming China. After so many years, it's past time that we took action,"" one Weibo user said.
The BBC's coverage of Xinjiang came under heavy criticism after it reported on Wednesday that women in internment camps for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the region were subject to rape and torture.

China's foreign ministry said the report had no factual basis. The Global Times said in an editorial on Friday that the BBC had ""seriously violated journalistic ethics"".

764,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 08:36AM ET</span>","Judges, not voters, may decide on Scottish independence vote","By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Scotland's top civil court dealt nationalists a blow on Friday by declining to rule that the Scottish parliament had the right to call an independence referendum without London's permission.
In the first skirmish of what is likely to become a major legal battle, the Court of Session in Edinburgh said it was premature and hypothetical to challenge Prime Minister Boris Johnson's power to block a new secession vote.
But, with the Scottish National Party (SNP) set for a big win in May's election to the Edinburgh parliament on the promise of a referendum, the fate of the 300-year-old union of Scotland with the rest of the United Kingdom is by no means assured. 
Surveys suggest that Scottish voters, who rejected secession in 2014 but are now frustrated by being taken out of the European Union against their will, would this time vote for independence. Johnson may therefore need the UK Supreme Court to uphold his veto on such a vote taking place.
""I don't see how you can avoid going to the court,"" said David Hope, former deputy president of the Supreme Court.
A poll last month indicated the ruling SNP would capture 71 of 129 seats in Scotland's parliament, the biggest majority since the assembly was formed. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader, has vowed to hold a referendum early in the new parliament. 
But the 1998 Scotland Act, which devolved some powers to Edinburgh and created the Scottish assembly, says matters relating to the union of the two countries can be decided only by the UK parliament in Westminster.
To stray from that, the UK parliament must agree to grant Scotland's government powers using a ""Section 30 order"" - as it did when approving the 2014 referendum, in which Scots rejected independence by 55%-45%.
'ONCE IN A GENERATION'
Johnson says that was a ""once in a generation"" vote and has ruled out granting permission for another.
""The political pressure may well prevail in the sense that in the end Boris Johnson has to simply give way for political reasons,"" Hope told Reuters. ""But without a Section 30 order, I don't see how a measure which directly attacks the union can get away with it."" 
The SNP says it will go ahead regardless, and force Johnson to test the issue in court.
Hope doubted whether it could succeed.
""They are trapped within a statute which is very carefully drafted,"" he said. ""There is an argument, I suppose, about the democratic will of the people, but I don't think that arrives in the provision of the Scotland Act, because it (the Act) is looking at both sides.""
However, Professor Aileen McHarg, a UK constitutional law expert from Durham University, said there were ""respectable arguments"" for concluding that the Scottish Parliament did have the right to pass a referendum bill without London's approval.
Facing such legal hurdles, some nationalists believe the SNP should either push ahead with a referendum, with or without a legal basis, or try to make May's election a proxy vote on whether Scotland should be independent.
""Court a gamble plus (Westminster) could bring in legislation to 'clarify' powers of Scot(tish) Parl(iament),"" Angus MacNeil, an SNP member of the Westminster parliament, tweeted last month. ""Then the opportunity is gone. Use the May Election"". 
Hope and McHarg both said a vote held without legal authority, similar to one in Catalonia in 2017, had little prospect of success.
For one thing, without international legitimacy, Scotland would have little prospect of rejoining the European Union, as the SNP wants. 

""I think we are talking about a lawful referendum or no referendum at all,"" McHarg said.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 07:28AM ET</span>",Indian protests against agriculture reforms attract new supporters,"By Devjyot Ghoshal
BHAINSWAL, India (Reuters) - Thousands of farmers in a politically important Indian state on Friday rallied in opposition to new agricultural laws, signalling growing support for a months-long campaign to have the government reforms scrapped.
Angry at what they see as legislation that benefits private buyers at the expense of growers, tens of thousands of farmers have been camped on the outskirts of the capital, New Delhi, for more than two months, calling for the withdrawal of laws introduced in September.
Much of the initial support for the protests has come from rice and wheat growers from northern India, particularly opposition-ruled Punjab state.
But in a sign of a growing challenge to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, more than 10,000 farmers from across the political and religious spectrum rallied on Friday in Uttar Pradesh state to show their support for the protests.
Ramkumar Choudhary, a local leader from Bagpat district, told the crowd of Hindu and Muslim farmers in Bhainswal village thousands more would head to Delhi unless the government rolled back the laws. 
""Only 1% of people have come out of the villages so far. The day we send 50% of our people, there will be no place to move in Delhi,"" he said. 
Devender Singh, a sugarcane farmer who attended the rally, said the agitation was drawing widespread support.
""100% farmers from all communities are joining the protest,"" he said, ""Farmers are unable to make ends meet.""
Hundreds of police, many armed and wearing riot gear, stood by but there was no trouble.
Uttar Pradesh is India's largest state and a critical battleground state in elections.
While Modi's party commands a comfortable majority in parliament, the support for the protests from Uttar Pradesh's politically influential sugarcane farmers will be a worry. 
The farmers say the laws mean the end of long-standing support prices for their crops and will leave them vulnerable to the whims of big buyers. They are demanding that the laws be annulled.
The government says reform of the inefficient agriculture sector will open up new opportunities for farmers and while it has offered some concessions, it has ruled out withdrawing the laws.
The protests have been largely peaceful but flared into turmoil on Jan. 26 as some farmers clashed with police in New Delhi and one person was killed and hundreds were injured.

To the government's annoyance the protests have drawn increasing international scrutiny, with celebrities including pop star Rihanna and environment campaigner Greta Thunberg announcing their support for the farmers.

China's military condemned the move, saying it had dispatched naval and air units to follow and warn away the ship. 
The busy waterway is one of a number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, which include a trade war, U.S. sanctions, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
China has been infuriated by repeated U.S. sailings near the islands Beijing occupies and controls in the South China Sea. China says it has irrefutable sovereignty and has accused Washington of deliberately stoking tensions.
The U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet said the destroyer USS John S. McCain ""asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law"". 
The freedom of navigation operation upheld the rights, freedoms and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging the ""unlawful restrictions on innocent passage imposed by China, Taiwan, and Vietnam"", it said.
The Southern Theatre Command of China's People's Liberation Army said the ship had entered into what it termed the territorial waters of the Paracels without permission, ""seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and security"".
The United States was ""deliberately disrupting the good atmosphere of the South China Sea of ​​peace, friendship, and cooperation"", it added.
China took full control of the Paracels in 1974 after a short battle with South Vietnamese forces. Vietnam, as well as Taiwan, continue to claim the islands.
Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines have claims to other parts of the South China Sea, where China has been building artificial islands and constructing air bases on some of them.
The same U.S. ship involved in this mission earlier this week transited the sensitive Taiwan Strait, drawing an angry response from Beijing.

Last month, a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group entered the South China Sea for what the Navy said was routine operations.

The incident occurred overnight when a guard spotted the man, an army statement said. It said the Palestinian assaulted the guard before being shot and killed by another guard.
The incident was being treated as a terrorist attack, the statement added, though no weapon was found on the Palestinian's body.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the killing of the 34-year-old man, saying he had been shot on land he owned which had been seized Israeli settlers.
Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are one of the most heated issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Palestinians envisage the West Bank and East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, along with Gaza as part of a future independent state.
Talks on a peace agreement have been frozen since 2014.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Olympic Games faced a ""major issue"" after the head of the local organising committee made sexist remarks, Tokyo's governor said on Friday, sending a clear signal the deepening controversy risked tarnishing the global event. 
Yoshiro Mori, 83, set off a storm on social media both at home and abroad this week by saying that women talked too much, in remarks made in a meeting with the Japan Olympic Committee (JOC). He later retracted the comments and apologised but refused to resign.
The incident has cast another dark shadow over the Games, postponed for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, with just months left before the opening ceremony.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday Mori's apology had settled the issue, but criticism of the octogenarian former prime minister only grew on Friday.
""The mission of the metropolis and the organising committee is to prepare for a safe and secure Games, and we are facing a major issue,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said.
She said she'd heard the Tokyo government was fielding complaint calls from city residents.
""I myself was struck speechless by his comments, which should not have been made.""
Later, she said Mori had called and apologised directly. But she sidestepped questions about whether she thought he was qualified for the job.
""The IOC is a big organisation that is steeped in history and requires a lot of negotiating, and in that sense, the question of who is qualified for the top job is one that requires a decision by the Tokyo 2020 organising committee,"" she said.
Anger over Mori's comments is likely to further alienate a Japanese public wary of the government's attempts to hold the Games during the pandemic. Nearly 80% of the public opposes holding the Games in July, according to the most recent poll.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he didn't have the authority to demand Mori's resignation, the Jiji news agency reported.
Yasuhiro Yamashita, head of the JOC, said Mori's comments went against the Olympic spirit and were inappropriate, a view cabinet ministers echoed.
Angry and frustrated Japanese athletes, activists and ordinary women see Mori's remarks as a clear signal that gender equality in Japanese sports, and society as a whole, remains a distant dream.
SAD REALITY
""This is the reality of what women in Japan are facing every day. Old guys with outdated mindsets continue to hold power and are making decisions,"" said a female staffer at the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, who declined to be identified because she was not authorised to speak to the media.
""Unfortunately in this country, social pressure prohibits women from speaking out about inequality - which makes yesterday's sexism row even more significant for Japan.""
Japan persistently trails its peers in promoting gender equality, ranking 121 out of 153 nations surveyed in the 2020 global gender gap report of the World Economic Forum.
""I felt anger for the first time in a while,"" pro soccer player Shiho Shimoyamada said in a tweet.
""It's absolutely meaningless to retract remarks already out in the open. Unless you actually acknowledge prejudice and take steps against it, the same thing will just happen again.
Momoko Nojo, the head of a group aiming to educate young people about politics, said the desire to make the anger of ordinary citizens clear to Mori and the people around him led her and other activists to launch a petition on Change.org.
""So many people around me on Twitter and so on were angry, but I felt that unless these voices were made visible, the fact that so many people are upset would never get across to them,"" she told Reuters.

By Friday night, their petition - ""Looking into 'Dealing with Mori' and Preventing Recurrences,"" launched on Thursday night - had gained nearly 68,000 signatures.

769,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 05:10AM ET</span>",Italy's Draghi will meet trade unions after talks with parties: source,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy's Prime Minister Designate Mario Draghi will hold talks with trade unions before wrapping up his consultations and deciding whether he has enough backing to form a new government, a source close to the matter said on Friday.
Draghi, a former European Central Bank chief, will end his round of consultations with political parties on Saturday. 
It is still unclear when he will meet with the trade unions.
President Sergio Mattarella anointed Draghi on Wednesday after the implosion of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's coalition, asking him to form a new government .
After his appointment, Draghi said Italy must seize the moment.
""We have the opportunity to do a lot for our country, with a careful look at the future of the younger generations and to strengthen social cohesion,"" he said.
So far the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and the small centrist Italia Viva party, led by former premier Matteo Renzi, have pledged their support to a government headed by Draghi.
The conservative party of four-time prime minister Silvio Berlusconi has made clear it would like to back Draghi, but in doing so it would strain its alliance with its rightist partners, the League and Brothers of Italy.
It is still unclear whether Draghi could win the support of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, the largest party in parliament, whose members have trouble with the idea of backing a government led by a former ECB president.
5-Star are scheduled to meet Draghi on Saturday at the end of a first round of consultations with the political parties.
Before reverting to the head of state, however, Draghi wants to meet trade unions and the industrialist association Confindustria, a source close to the matter said, adding that the timetable still had to be defined.
Mattarella said a new government must take office immediately to avoid Italy missing out on more than 200 billion euros ($243 billion) from a European Union fund designed to help overcome the economic slump.
Asked whether Draghi was the best option to lead Italy out of its political crisis, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the Commission never commented on internal politics.

But she said Draghi had ""played an extraordinary role at the ECB and everyone is aware of this"", according to an interview with daily La Stampa.

Wearing red ribbons and holding up protest signs, scores of lecturers and teachers gathered in front of campus buildings at the Yangon University of Education. 
""We don't want this military coup which unlawfully seized power from our elected government,"" said lecturer Nwe Thazin Hlaing.
""We are no longer going to work with them. We want the military coup to fail,"" she added, surrounded by other staff who held up held up three-finger salutes, now used by many protesters in Myanmar. 
The salute - three fingers pointing up with palm away from the body - stems from the Hunger Games movies, but in recent years, it has been adopted by protesters against authoritarian rule in Asia.
One member of staff estimated 200 of the 246 staff at the university joined the protest. 
""We aim to halt the administration system. We are now holding a peaceful strike,"" said another lecturer, Honey Lwin. 
There were also reports of a similar protest at Dagon University in Yangon. 
The opposition among professional groups like doctors and teachers comes as there have been other less formal protests including by people banging cans and saucepans and honking car horns to signal their opposition to the coup. 
Several dozen anti-coup protesters also marched on Friday in the southeastern city of Dawei, followed by supporters on motorbikes, video footage showed.
""We declare that we start our fight for democracy today in Dawei. We urge the people to join and stand with us,"" said one protester.
The military directly ruled the Southeast Asian country, also known as Burma, for almost 50 years after a 1962 coup and crushed pro-democracy protests several times over the years.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Twenty-four activists appeared in a Hong Kong court on Friday on charges related to a June 4 vigil last year marking the anniversary of China's military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989. 
Hong Kong traditionally holds the largest vigil in the world every year, although it was banned in 2020, with authorities giving the risk of spreading the coronavirus as the reason. The vigils have always been banned in mainland China.
But thousands of Hong Kong people defied the ban and took to the streets to stage candlelight rallies in the former British colony which was promised wide-ranging freedoms when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, including rights of expression and assembly.
Released from jail to attend the court hearing were media tycoon and staunch Beijing critic Jimmy Lai, 73, and prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong, 24.
Lai is being held pending a bail hearing after he became the city's most high-profile person to be charged under a controversial national security law. Wong is serving more than 13 months related to an unlawful anti-government rally in 2019.
Five of the group, including Wong, indicated they planned to plead guilty to charges related to illegal assembly and their case was adjourned to April 30. The rest were expected to plead not guilty and their case was adjourned to June 11.
Outside the court, more than a dozen supporters shouted slogans and held up placards that read, ""Against political suppression"" and ""Innocent to mourn June 4."" 
Last year's June 4 anniversary came nearly four weeks before Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong that Western governments and rights groups have widely condemned as a tool to crush freedoms in the global financial hub.
Hong Kong and Chinese authorities reject that and say the legislation was necessary to restore stability after a year of sometimes violent anti-China and anti-government demonstrations. 
China has never provided a full account of the 1989 violence. The death toll given by officials days later was about 300, most of them soldiers, but rights groups and witnesses say thousands of people may have perished.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong has unveiled controversial guidelines for schools in the Chinese-ruled city that include teaching students as young as six about colluding with foreign forces and subversion as part of a new national security curriculum.
Beijing imposed a security law on Hong Kong in June 2020 in response to months of often violent anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019 that put the global financial hub more firmly on an authoritarian path.
The Education Bureau's guidelines, released late on Thursday, show that Beijing's plans for the semi-autonomous Hong Kong go beyond quashing dissent, and aim for a societal overhaul to bring its most restive city more in line with the Communist Party-ruled mainland.
""National security is of great importance. Teachers should not treat it as if it is a controversial issue for discussion as usual,"" the guidelines said. 
Teachers should ""clearly point out that safeguarding national security is the responsibility of all nationals and that as far as national security is concerned, there is no room for debate or compromise"".
After the 2019 protests in which many of the demonstrators were teenagers, Chinese leaders turned to re-education in a bid to tame the city's youth and make them loyal citizens.
Head of the Professional Teachers' Union, Ip Kin-yuen, said the guidelines would cause ""uncertainty, ambiguity and anxiety"" for teachers and enforce a ""restrictive and suppressive"" education style that does not foster student development and independent thinking.
Raymond Yeung, a former teacher partially blinded by a projectile during 2019 protests, described the guidelines as ""one dimensional, if not brainwashing"".
Wong, mother of primary school children, said the law was ""clamping down on people's individual thoughts"" and adding national security to the curricula created a climate of fear.
""I am angry. They shouldn't be bringing this into classrooms,"" said Wong, who declined to give her first name due to the sensitivity of the issue.
However, not all parents were opposed to the changes.
""It’s a good start, no matter who you are and where are you from, you have to love your country,"" said Feng, mother of a six-year-old.
'WISE OWL'
Children in primary schools will learn how to sing and respect China's national anthem, and gain an understanding of the four main offences in the new security law, including terrorism and secessionism. 
In secondary schools, pupils will learn what constitutes such offences, which can carry sentences of up to life in prison. 
Some legal scholars have said the law's language is broad and vague, and the range of activities authorities might see as potential threats to national security was unclear and fluid.
An educational cartoon video released by the government shows an owl wearing glasses and a graduation hat explaining Hong Kong's institutional architecture, its duties to the central government in Beijing and the national security law.
At one point the video says ""national security affairs are of utmost importance to the whole country,"" while showing smiling faces of a student, a chef and an engineer.
Schools are encouraged to ""organise various game activities, such as puppet theatre, board games ... to establish a good atmosphere and improve students' understanding of national security"", according to the guidelines.
The guidelines said kindergartens can help students learn about traditional festivals, music and arts and develop fondness for Chinese customs to ""lay the foundation for national security education"". Kindergarten children were not expected to learn about national security crimes. 
The Education Bureau said it accepted international and private schools had different curricula, but said they had a ""responsibility to help their students (regardless of their ethnicity and nationality) acquire a correct and objective understanding ... of national security"".
Schools should also stop students and teachers from participating in activities deemed as political, such as singing certain songs, wearing various items, forming human chains or shouting slogans. 
Teachers and principals are required to inspect notice-boards, remove books that endanger national security from libraries and call police if they suspected any breaches.

The bureau said national security education will become part of subjects such as geography and biology to enhance students' sense of national identity.

Candidates for prime minister and for roles in a new presidency council have been auditioning through the week in livestreamed sessions and joined together into four lists on Thursday. 
Talks participants were expected to convene to vote on the four rival lists at 0730 GMT. 
Libya has had little peace since the NATO-backed intervention that ended Muammar Gaddafi's four-decade rule in 2011. Since 2014 it has been split between warring administrations in the west and east, backed by foreign powers. 
The latest U.N. process emerged from a Berlin conference last year and gathered pace in the autumn after Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based forces were repelled from a 14-month assault on Tripoli. 
The process has also involved a military ceasefire but not all its terms have been met - a sign of the continued mistrust on both sides and the internal fractures within both camps.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The leaders of Indonesia and Malaysia on Friday said they were seeking a special meeting of Southeast Asian nations to discuss the situation in Myanmar, where an elected government was overthrown in a coup this week. 
Throwing a wedge in Myanmar's transition to democracy, the military took power on Monday, alleging irregularities in a November election won in a landslide by the party of Aung San Suu Kyi.
After meeting visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said their foreign ministers had been asked to talk to Brunei, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), to try to set up the special Myanmar meeting. 
Muhyiddin referred to the coup as being ""one step backward in the process of democracy in that country"".
Such meetings are rare and arranging one could be a challenge, however, given ASEAN's policy of non-interference in its members' domestic issues and their contrasting responses to the army takeover.
ASEAN, of which Myanmar is a member, earlier this week said it had been watching developments there closely.
Jokowi, as Indonesia's president is known, and Muhyiddin also reiterated their commitment to eradicating ""discrimination"" against palm oil. 
Jokowi said it was ""optimal"" for the two countries, which are the world's top producers of palm oil, to work together to fight palm oil discrimination, while Muhyiddin said the anti-palm oil campaign in Europe misrepresented the industry. 
Reuters reported last month that Indonesia and Malaysia were looking to hire an advocacy firm to counter the criticism.
Jokowi and Muhyiddin said they would discuss further an agreement for official and business travel between their countries amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
Jokowi said the issue of Rohingya Muslims had been discussed. Indonesia has been historically sympathetic to the plight of the Rohingya, hundreds of whom have arrived there and in Malaysia in recent years after fleeing persecution in Myanmar.

Both leaders also stressed the importance of international law in the South China Sea and Muhyiddin called for self-restraint and to avoid militarization.

ROME/BERLIN (Reuters) - Maybe it was the stress. Maybe it was being cooped up with the mother-in-law. But the numbers are in, and one effect of the coronavirus lockdown is now clear: people made fewer babies. A lot fewer babies.
Births in Italy in December - exactly nine months after the country went into Europe's first lockdown - plunged by a whopping 21.6%, according to figures from a sample of 15 Italian cities released this week by statistics agency ISTAT.
And the impact is far from over. Marriages fell by more than half in the first 10 months of last year, which ISTAT chief Gian Carlo Blangiardo called ""a further factor in a probable decline in births in the immediate future"".
Demographics experts have been predicting a baby bust across Europe for 2021, as the impact of last year's lockdowns is felt.
A survey conducted in five European countries during the March and April lockdown showed many people calling off plans to have kids. Germans and French were more likely to say they were delaying, while Italians were more likely to say they had abandoned their plans altogether.
Last year, Britain recorded a plunge in imports of baby carriages https://tmsnrt.rs/3cNiwsi, to the lowest level since records began in 2000. (Yes, the Treasury counts imports of baby carriages. In tonnes.)
While its data is not yet complete, the German statistics office said 2020 was probably the first year since 2011 that the population did not grow, both because of declining births and because COVID-19 meant fewer people immigrated.
Still, there are signs some people who put off making babies in 2020 may be getting down to business at last. Sales of pregnancy tests and pregnancy vitamins in Germany jumped in the last few months, according to a poll conducted for pharmacy news service Apotheke Adhoc. 
""The bigger the economic fears, the bigger the impact on the birth rate,"" said Martin Bujard, deputy director at Germany's Federal Institute for Population Research. ""So in countries where the welfare state minimises the economic impact - like Germany - there might be less of a negative effect.""

777,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 05, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",Biden calls for expanded efforts to protect LGBTQ rights globally,"By Alexandra Alper and Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday issued a presidential memorandum aimed at expanding protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer and intersex (LGBTQI) people worldwide, including potentially through the use of financial sanctions.
""All human beings should be treated with respect and dignity and should be able to live without fear no matter who they are or whom they love,"" said the memorandum, building on a 2011 directive issued when Biden was serving as vice president.
""The United States belongs at the forefront of this struggle - speaking out and standing strong for our most dearly held values,"" the memorandum said.
While a presidential memorandum is largely symbolic, Biden campaigned on a pledge to pass LGBTQ rights legislation known as the Equality Act in the first 100 days of his administration and to make LGBTQ rights a top priority. 
The memo directs U.S. agencies working abroad to work harder to combat the criminalization by foreign governments of LGBTQ status or conduct, and directs the State Department to include anti-LGBTQ violence, discrimination and laws in its annual human rights report.
It calls for increased efforts to ensure that LGBTQ asylum seekers have equal access to protection, expanded training for U.S. federal personnel, and potential increased use of priority referrals to expedite resettlement of vulnerable people.
And it instructs agencies to consider appropriate responses, including the full range of diplomatic tools, and potentially financial sanctions and visa restrictions, when foreign governments restricted the rights of LGBTQ people.
Biden announced the push during a forceful speech at the State Department, vowing to rebuild U.S. credibility worldwide.
""To further repair our moral leadership, I’m also issuing a presidential memo to agencies to reinvigorate our leadership on the LGBTQI issues and do it internationally,"" he said.
""We'll ensure diplomacy and foreign assistance are working to promote the rights of those individuals, included by combating criminalization and protecting LGBTQ refugees and asylum-seekers.""
Biden's campaign pledge included protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination, ensuring fair treatment in the justice system and advancing LGBTQ rights globally.
Biden has already issued an executive order that extends existing federal nondiscrimination protections to LGBTQ people.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Thursday said Biden “stands by” his pledge to sign the Equality Act in his first 100 days but noted that Congress would need to take action to pass a bill first.

Taiwan had already begun initial operations at the office, in effect a de facto embassy, last month. It had been welcomed by Washington and condemned by Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said that because of Chinese pressure Guyana had ""unilaterally"" decided to back out of the deal, and Taiwan expressed deep regret it was unable to get the decision reversed.
""We express our strongest dissatisfaction and condemnation of the Chinese government once again bullying and compressing Taiwan's international space and Taiwan's participation in international affairs,"" the ministry said.
China's continued efforts to isolate Taiwan in the international arena runs counter to declarations by its leaders that it is against bullying and that ""no one with thick arms and big fists has the final say"", it added. 
""The Chinese government's way of saying one thing and doing another will only highlight its evil nature and alienate people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.""
China has gradually whittled away at the number of countries which still maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan and now only 14 do, almost all developing countries including Haiti, Nicaragua and tiny Nauru in the Pacific.
The United States has been particularly concerned at China's efforts to grab Taiwanese allies in Latin America and the Caribbean, a traditional area of influence for Washington.

In 2018, the United States attacked El Salvador's decision to ditch diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of China, saying the change was of grave concern to Washington and warning that China was offering economic inducements to seek domination.

Biden said the United States was working with allies and partners to address the generals' takeover, during which they arrested elected leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilians.
""There can be no doubt in a democracy force should never seek to overrule the will of the people or attempt to erase the outcome of a credible election,"" said Biden.
""The Burmese military should relinquish power they have seized and release the advocates and activists and officials they have detained, lift the restrictions on telecommunications and refrain from violence.""
Army commander Min Aung Hlaing took power on Monday, saying there were irregularities in a November election that Suu Kyi's party won in a landslide. The electoral commission had said the vote was fair.
A later White House statement said Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, spoke by phone on Wednesday evening with ambassadors from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-member bloc to which Myanmar - which is also known as Burma - belongs.
""Mr. Sullivan conveyed President Biden’s deep concern regarding the coup in Burma and expressed appreciation for ASEAN nations’ attention to this crisis, noting the importance of regional support for the immediate restoration of Burmese democracy,"" the statement said.
It said Sullivan also underscored the Biden administration’s commitment to expanding U.S. engagement with ASEAN including on combating climate change, addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, promoting economic recovery and advancing maritime security.
Biden threatened on Monday to reimpose sanctions on Myanmar following the coup and said the international community should come together to press the military to relinquish power. He also warned that the United States was ""taking note of those who stand with the people of Burma in this difficult hour.""

782,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 07:55PM ET</span>",Turkish minister says U.S. behind 2016 failed coup: Hurriyet,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's interior minister accused the United States on Thursday of being behind a 2016 failed coup that Ankara has blamed on a U.S.-based Muslim preacher, the Hurriyet daily reported, at a time when Turkey is seeking improved ties with its NATO ally.
The U.S. State Department said the accusation was ""wholly false.""
More than 250 people were killed in the attempt to overthrow President Tayyip Erdogan and his government on July 15, 2016, when rogue soldiers commandeered warplanes, helicopters and tanks to seize state institutions.
Ankara has long blamed preacher Fethullah Gulen, a former ally of Erdogan who lives in Pennsylvania, and launched a widespread crackdown on his network, which Ankara refers to by the acronym 'FETO'. Gulen denies any involvement.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu told Hurriyet the United States had managed the coup attempt while Gulen's network carried it out, adding ""Europe was enthusiastic about it,"" reaffirming a view he said he had been expressing since the putsch.
""It is blatantly clear the United States is behind July 15. It was FETO who carried it out upon their orders,"" he said.
The U.S. State Department said in a statement: ""The United States had no involvement in the 2016 attempted coup in Turkey and promptly condemned it. Recent assertions to the contrary made by senior Turkish officials are wholly false.""
It said ""unfounded and irresponsible claims of U.S. responsibility for events in Turkey are inconsistent with Turkey's status as a NATO Ally and strategic partner of the United States.""
Washington has repeatedly rejected Turkish demands for Gulen's extradition, citing a lack of credible evidence from Ankara.
Ankara is seeking to repair strained ties with Washington, which last year imposed sanctions on Turkey over its purchase of Russian air defence systems, and with the European Union. The EU has threatened measures against Ankara over a dispute with Greece in the east Mediterranean.
Turkey has said in recent weeks that it achieved a ""positive agenda"" with the EU, and that it wants to improve relations with the United States under President Joe Biden. He is expected to be tougher on Ankara over its record on human rights, which has worried Turkey's Western allies.
Since the failed coup, Turkey has detained some 292,000 people over suspected links to Gulen and has suspended or sacked more than 150,000 civil servants. Hundreds of media outlets have been shut and dozens of opposition lawmakers have been jailed.
The government's response to month-long protests at one of the country's top universities has also alarmed Washington and the United Nations, with both condemning ""homophobic"" rhetoric by officials.

Soylu has referred to some protesters as ""LGBT deviants"" and Erdogan said on Wednesday there was ""no such thing"" as LGBT, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 07:25PM ET</span>",'America is back' - Biden touts muscular foreign policy in first diplomatic speech,"By Steve Holland and Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday promised a new era after the scattershot foreign policy of his predecessor, Donald Trump, declaring ""America is back"" on the global stage in his first diplomatic address as president. 
In his speech, Biden signaled aggressive approaches to China and Russia, urged Myanmar's military leaders to halt their coup, and declared an end to U.S. support for a Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen.
""American leadership must meet this new moment of advancing authoritarianism, including the growing ambitions of China to rival the United States and the determination of Russia to damage and disrupt our democracy. We must meet the new moment ... accelerating global challenges from the pandemic to the climate crisis to nuclear proliferation,"" said Biden.
Trump angered European and Asian leaders with tariffs, fracturing of global alliances, and threats to withdraw U.S. troops. He did little to push back against a wave of authoritarianism in some countries. 
After a Trump-inspired mob attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, protesting Biden's election win, foreign allies and rivals alike expressed doubts about the health of American democracy.
Biden's speech on Thursday was a full-throated attempt to vanquish those doubts, and convince Americans of the value of a forceful international approach. 
""Investing in our diplomacy isn't something we do just because it's the right thing to do for the world,"" he said. ""We do it in order to live in peace, security and prosperity. We do it because it's in our own naked self-interest.""
Biden's choice of the State Department as venue for his first big diplomatic address was an important symbol of the value he places in career diplomats, who Trump largely saw as opponents.
""American alliances are our greatest asset. And leading with diplomacy means standing shoulder to shoulder with our allies and key partners once again,"" Biden said.
Biden in his early days has attempted to repair what he has called the damage to America's standing around the world, rolling back Trump policies. He is working to revive the Iran deal, and renewed U.S. membership in the Paris accord and the World Health Organization.
He challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""I made it clear to President Putin, in a manner very different from my predecessor, that the days of the United States rolling over in the face of Russia's aggressive actions, interfering with our elections, cyberattacks, poisoning its citizens, are over,"" he said.
Trump had initially sought a warm relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping but differences over trade, Hong Kong and what the U.S. military calls Beijing's destabilizing and aggressive behavior in the South China Sea prompted a rift.
China, which is expanding its military and working to grow its influence around the world, is perhaps Biden's biggest international challenge as he begins his presidency. He called Beijing ""our most serious competitor.""
""We'll confront China's economic abuses, counter its aggressive, coercive action to push back on China's attack on human rights, intellectual property and global governance. But we're ready to work with Beijing when it's in America's interest to do so,"" he said.
Not all U.S. allies may be happy at the sharp turn in U.S. foreign policy, including Poland, where Trump once pledged to deploy U.S. troops, or a host of nations that have criticized heavy-handed intervention by Washington in the past.

""We are a country that does big things. American diplomacy makes it happen and our administration is ready to take up the mantle and lead once again,"" said Biden.

China, which claims democratically run Taiwan as its own territory, has been angered by increased U.S. support for the island, including arms sales and sending warships through the Taiwan Strait, further souring Beijing-Washington relations.
The U.S. Navy said the guided missile destroyer USS John S. McCain had ""conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit Feb. 4 in accordance with international law"". Taiwan's Defence Ministry described it as a ""normal"" mission.
In a statement late on Thursday, the Eastern Theatre Command of China's People's Liberation Army said its forces had followed and tracked the ship. 
""The U.S. move is a repeat of its old trick of 'mixed manipulation' of the situation across the Taiwan Strait, deliberately creating tensions and disrupting regional peace and stability. We are resolutely opposed to this,"" it said.
""No matter how the situation in the Taiwan Strait changes, theatre troops will loyally perform their duties and mission, resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.""
Last year the U.S. Navy sailed through the narrow Taiwan Strait 13 times.
U.S. President Joe Biden's government has been keen to demonstrate its support for Taiwan, calling their commitment to the island ""rock solid"".
Last month Taiwan reported Chinese fighter jets and bombers had flown into the southwestern corner of its air defence identification zone, coinciding with a U.S. carrier strike group entering the disputed South China Sea.
The U.S. military said those Chinese military flights fitted a pattern of destabilising and aggressive behaviour by Beijing but posed no threat to the aircraft carrier group.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will succeed in inoculating its population despite ""momentary disruptions"" in the supply of COVID-19 vaccines and is working closely with the new U.S. administration to fight the disease, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday.
Trudeau's Liberal government is under pressure over the slow roll out of the vaccination program, caused in part by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) temporarily cutting its promised deliveries and a temporary slowdown of  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc doses.
""Obviously with this global supply chain around new products and manufacturing scale-ups ... there are momentary disruptions week over week. But we're still very much on track to get the commitments fulfilled and get many vaccines to Canadians as quickly as possible,"" Trudeau said in an interview.
Trudeau promised that tens of millions of doses would arrive in the months to come and reiterated that every Canadian seeking inoculation would be vaccinated by September.
As part of a bid to contain the spread of the disease, Canada and the United States have closed their joint border to non-essential travel. Trudeau said he and new U.S. President Joe Biden agreed on a joint approach to fighting COVID-19.
""We're working very, very closely on all aspects of it from borders to scientific research to indeed vaccines,"" he said.
""Our conversations are going to continue with the U.S. on supply chains,"" he said, without giving details. Last year, tensions arose between Canada and the administration of then President Donald Trump over delays in the supply of personal protective equipment.
Last year Trump also signed an executive order aimed at keeping U.S.-produced vaccines in the United States. Trudeau did not give a direct answer when asked whether he would press Biden to scrap the order.
Canada does not yet have a vaccine manufacturing facility of its own and is reliant on foreign suppliers.
Separately, federal Procurement Minister Anita Anand said deliveries of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine could begin before the end of March, if Canada's health regulator approves its use.
AstraZeneca Canada filed a rolling application for its vaccine with Health Canada in October and is waiting for approval from the drug regulator. Health Canada is expected to complete its review soon.
In a separate briefing, federal officials confirmed Canada's most recent shipment of Moderna Inc's COVID-19 vaccine contained 22% fewer doses than originally expected and said the next shipment, due in three weeks, would also be short.
Fortin added Moderna was working in ""good faith"" to deliver those doses as quickly as possible to Canada and noted the obstacles would be temporary. 
Shipments of Pfizer Inc's vaccine, meanwhile, are expected to ramp up later this month.
Trudeau's government is also facing criticism over tapping into COVAX, a global vaccine-sharing initiative meant to help low-income countries buy doses. Canada will get 1.9 million AstraZeneca doses from the initiative.

""Our government will never apologize for doing everything possible to get Canadians vaccinated as quickly as possible,"" Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told lawmakers.

787,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 05:00PM ET</span>",U.S. releasing hundreds of Central American families from increasingly busy custody,"By Mica Rosenberg and Frank Jack Daniel
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S. officials in Texas are releasing an increasing number of Central American migrant families from custody as local authorities in Mexico have baulked at taking them back and border patrol facilities risk becoming overcrowded. 
Two shelter managers told Reuters the U.S. Border Patrol began dropping off families last week at shelters in Laredo and Brownsville along the stretch of border with Mexico's Tamaulipas state, the busiest region for illegal immigration into the United States.
Sister Norma Pimentel, executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, said the Border Patrol has sent around 50 to 80 families to her shelter daily since Jan. 27, rising to 150 families on Wednesday. Most remain only briefly at the shelters before connecting with relatives or friends elsewhere in the United States, she said.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed some migrants were being released into the United States to await immigration hearings, saying some holding facilities were at maximum safe capacity. A CBP source cited COVID-19 and a change in Mexican law among factors that ""have forced us to adapt.""
Tamaulipas recently stopped accepting Central American families with children under the age of six expelled from Texas, a U.S. source said. If Mexico does not agree to take the migrants, U.S. authorities must either keep them in custody or free them until their immigration court hearings.
Mexico's foreign ministry confirmed there had been ""local"" adjustments to policy, citing the implementation of a child protection law passed late last year. A senior Mexican official said the changes were ""minor adjustments"" and appeared to be limited to Tamaulipas.
If such changes were to be applied more broadly, U.S. officials fear it could fan already rising migration from Central America, as word spreads that not all families will be expelled. 
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden is trying to undo some harsh Trump-era rules without creating a rush on the border.
Since a U.S. pandemic-related rule called Title 42 was implemented in March last year, Mexico has agreed to allow the United States to turn around Central Americans caught crossing the border illegally, including families with children.
But in November, Mexico added new child protections to a migration law that means accompanied and unaccompanied minors sent back to Mexico should be placed in the care of the child service agency rather than immigration detention centers with adults. 
The agency is underfunded and it is not immediately clear if the law will be widely implemented, or how it would affect migrant processing more broadly along the U.S. and Mexican border.
For now, the changes appeared to be narrow and not in place at other busy sections of the border for migration, such as El Paso and San Diego, where families are still being returned to Mexico, according to local shelter managers.
'NO HONEYMOON'
Biden signed an executive order on Feb 2. to review asylum processing at the U.S. border but his administration has said changes to the current system will take time.
With more migrant families arriving at the border, and some now being released into the United States, the Biden administration will have no ""honeymoon period"" to get new plans off the ground, said Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington.
""People are arriving, you can't just stop everything while they create the new system,"" she said. She said Mexican cooperation will be key to any new policy planning.
U.S. data shows that through December of this fiscal year, 5,175 families were apprehended by U.S. immigration authorities between Tamaulipas and Texas, more than anywhere else on the border, but less than the same period a year earlier.
Overall, border apprehension numbers have been rising, above 70,000 in recent months and expected to reach 80,000 in January. 
Experts attribute the rise to economic hardship in Central America, battered by two major hurricanes and the pandemic, as well as expectations of relaxed migration policy under Biden.
Advocates working in Tamaulipas say the Matamoros camp of mainly asylum seekers across from Brownsville has increased to about 1,000 from 750 in December as migrants return from other parts of Mexico with the hope they will be allowed to cross. 
Sister Pimentel welcomed the reduction in the number of families going back to Mexico. Tamaulipas, for example, has a record of violence against migrants, including a massacre of 19 people in January. A dozen state police have been charged with the crime.
""It is not a very humane response to send them to Mexico with all of the abuses they have to deal with. We have a better capacity to handle them,"" she said. 
Another Texas shelter manager, Mike Smith, director of The Holding Institute in Laredo, said families they had taken in recently reported that they had been given temperature checks for COVID-19 while in custody, but no tests for the coronavirus.
Tests carried out at his shelter had turned up three positive COVID-19 cases, he said.

The shelter has since run out of coronavirus tests and is attempting to socially distance migrants, Smith said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden on Thursday declared a halt to U.S. support for a Saudi Arabia-led military campaign in Yemen, demanding that the more than six-year war, widely seen as a proxy conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, ""has to end.""
Biden also named veteran U.S. diplomat Timothy Lenderking as the U.S. special envoy for Yemen in a bid to step up American diplomacy ""to end the war in Yemen, a war which has created humanitarian and strategic catastrophe.""
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need and millions on the verge of a large-scale famine.
""This war has to end,"" the Democratic president said during a visit to the U.S. State Department in Washington. ""And to underscore our commitment, we're ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.""
The move is a reversal of a policy of both the Democratic Obama and Republican Trump administrations. Biden was vice president in the Obama administration.
""At the same time,"" he said on Thursday, ""Saudi Arabia faces missile attacks, UAV (drone) strikes and other threats from Iranian-supplied forces in multiple countries. We're going to continue to support and help Saudi Arabia defend its sovereignty and its territorial integrity and its people.""
Saudi Arabia welcomed Biden's remarks, particularly his commitment to the country's defense and addressing threats against it, according to the country's state news agency.
The Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Iran-aligned Houthis. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country's suffering is also worsened by an economic crisis, currency collapse, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
'HOPE FOR YEMEN'
Under the Trump administration, policy on Yemen was secondary to a so-called ""maximum pressure"" sanctions campaign against Iran in a bid to force Tehran back into talks over its nuclear and missile programs and activities in the Middle East. 
Former President Donald Trump and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and a top aide, were also focused on maintaining their close ties with Saudi Arabia's effective ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which included U.S. arms sales.
This was despite demands by Republican and Democratic lawmakers for an end to U.S. support for Riyadh as the civilian death toll in Yemen mounted and the humanitarian crisis worsened.
Biden's national security adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier on Thursday that the end of U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition's operations in Yemen does not extend to efforts to combat the regional affiliate of the al Qaeda militant group.
Sullivan said the Biden administration already had halted two sales of precision-guided munitions and kept regional allies in the region informed of actions to avoid surprises.
""Any move that reduces the number of weapons, military activity, is to be welcomed and will give more space and more hope not only to the talks, but importantly more hope to the people of Yemen,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Thursday. 
The State Department is also reviewing a Trump administration designation last month of the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization.

The United Nations and aid groups have called for the designation to be reversed, warning it would push Yemen into a large-scale famine. The Biden administration last week approved all transactions involving Yemen's Houthi movement for the next month as it carries out the review.

PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S., British, French and German foreign ministers plan to discuss soon, possibly as early as Friday, how to revive the 2015 Iran nuclear deal abandoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Four of the sources said the virtual meeting, which was likely to cover other topics, could take place as soon as Friday, while two others said it could happen next week. All spoke on condition that they not be identified.
Such a high-level conversation would be the latest step by U.S. President Joe Biden's administration to seek a way to revive the pact, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities so as to make it harder to develop an atomic bomb in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions.
Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, restoring the U.S. sanctions the agreement had removed and placing more on Iran.
Iran has long denied any intent to develop nuclear arms.
Biden, who took office last month, has said that if Tehran returned to strict compliance with the 2015 pact, Washington would follow suit and use that as a springboard to a broader agreement that might restrict Iran's missile development and regional activities.
Tehran has insisted that Washington ease sanctions before it will resume compliance, but Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hinted on Monday at a way to resolve the impasse over who goes first by saying the steps could be synchronized.
While the U.S. State Department reacted coolly, a U.S. official said its stance should not be seen as a rejection.
The State Department declined comment on whether the four foreign ministers would meet soon. British, French and German spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Speaking to a U.S. think tank from Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the U.S. willingness to engage Iran, offered himself as an ""honest broker"" and said Saudi Arabia and Israel must ultimately be involved.
In 2019, he pushed to bring Washington and Tehran back to the negotiating table and to set parameters for wider future talks.
European and Western diplomats have said Britain, France and Germany have proposed sequencing for Iran to return to compliance in return for economic benefits. It is unclear if Washington would lift sanctions without Iran first complying.
In September 2019, France proposed offering Iran a $15 billion credit facility, which would be guaranteed by Iranian oil revenues if Tehran came back fully into compliance. Such an arrangement hinged on Washington giving tacit approval.

""We aren’t starting from a blank page. We know the parameters of the sequencing to get back to (the deal) and then to build on a deeper accord,"" said a senior European diplomat.

The Epstein Victims' Compensation Program said on Thursday it will stop offering payouts to victims through at least March 25, citing uncertainty about the liquidity of assets from the disgraced financier's estate that fund the payouts.
Jordana Feldman, the fund's administrator, said she regretted the suspension, but it was necessary to protect the rights of Epstein accusers whose claims have not been resolved.
""Issuing a compensation offer that cannot be timely and fully funded and paid, consistent with the way the Program has operated to date, would compromise claimants' interests and the guiding principles of the program,"" Feldman said in a statement.
Feldman worked for many years on a compensation fund for Sept. 11, 2001 attack victims.
The Epstein compensation program has received more than 150 claims since being created last June, and paid out more than $50 million. Victims have until Feb. 8 to register and March 25 to file claims.
Epstein signed his will on Aug. 8, 2019, two days before killing himself in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. His estate's executors have since been selling assets to pay victims.
Once valued at around $630 million, the estate ended December with approximately $240 million of assets.
According to a statement provided by the executors' lawyers, the ""great bulk"" of the remaining assets - including homes, aircraft and private investments - are illiquid, and the coronavirus pandemic has hamstrung efforts to sell them.
It also said the estate has spent heavily defending against civil litigation, including ""fraudulent"" ownership claims for Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida.
The executors nonetheless have a ""full expectation"" the compensation program will soon return to normal, the statement said.
Payouts began after Denise George, attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein also had a home, received assurances that Epstein's accusers would be treated fairly.

(Reuters) - A former Ohio police officer, who is white, will appear at a bail hearing on Friday after his arrest on a charge of murder in the fatal shooting on an unarmed Black man in December.
Adam Coy, 44, a 19-year-veteran of the Columbus police force, was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday in the Dec. 22 killing of Andre Maurice Hill, 47, officials said. Coy was responding to a nuisance call about car noise. 
Coy, who was fired a week after the shooting, told his fellow police officers that he thought Hill was holding a gun and he feared for his life. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost told a press conference on Wednesday that Hill had a cellphone and no weapons were found.
""Andre Hill should not be dead,"" Yost said, announcing the charges. ""No weapon was found at the scene.""
The case is the latest in a series of police killings of Black people that have highlighted longstanding issues of racial injustice in U.S. law enforcement. Last summer, a handful of high-profile deaths in Minneapolis; Atlanta; Louisville, Kentucky, and elsewhere triggered a wave of nationwide protests that pushed police reform to the top of the U.S. political agenda.
The grand jury indicted Coy on one charge of murder, one charge of felonious assault and two counts of dereliction of duty, Yost said. Coy was arrested at the office of his attorney Wednesday afternoon.
His attorney, Mark Collins, told Reuters he would enter a not-guilty plea for his client and ask the judge for a ""reasonable bond.""

""My client is not a flight risk, he voluntarily surrendered, and he is not a safety risk to the community,"" Collins said. ""The only question here is his judgment while acting in the course of his duty, not whether he is a danger.""

Castex said that the rate of infection had not significantly strengthened over the past two weeks, even if the pressure on French hospitals remained strong. 
""We must stick with the current restrictions we already have in place ... but the situation today does not justify a new national lockdown,"" he told a news conference on Thursday. 
Castex said it was true that other countries had started their vaccination campaign more quickly than France but that this was the result of the French government's choice to start with the most vulnerable people in retirement homes. 
He said that while they only made up one percent of the population, they represent one third of those who have died from COVID-19. France has registered more than 77,000 deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the epidemic.
Castex also said that the number of new cases affected by new variants of the virus has increased from 3.3% on Jan. 8 to 14% today. 

""We must fight the virus by applying the measures in place ... it is not the time to ease up now,"" he said, adding that he would not hesitate to tighten curbs on movement if there was a spike in infections.

Military ruler General Min Aung Hlaing has moved quickly to consolidate his hold after overthrowing elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and detaining her and allied politicians on Monday.
He told a business group on Wednesday night he could keep power for six months after a one-year state of emergency ends in order to hold fair elections.
But in a show of defiance to the generals, about a dozen of the lawmakers elected in a Nov. 8 ballot convened a symbolic parliamentary session in the quarters where they have been staying since the takeover.
Small protests took place in the main city Yangon and elsewhere, with activists saying three protesters had been arrested - among around 150 people who have been detained since the coup, according to one rights group.
Doctors were also spearheading a campaign of civil disobedience.
But in a country with a bloody history of crackdowns on demonstrations, there was no mass outpouring of opposition to the coup on the streets. 
The army seized power on Monday alleging irregularities in the election, derailing Myanmar's long and troubled transition to democracy. The move was condemned by the United Nations and Western governments, which called on the junta to respect Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy's landslide victory.
Opposition to the junta has emerged very strongly on Facebook, the country's main social media platform which underpins communications for business and government. 
The Ministry of Communications and Information said Facebook - used by half of Myanmar's more than 53 million people - would be blocked until this Sunday, Feb. 7, because users were ""spreading fake news and misinformation and causing misunderstanding"". Facebook's WhatsApp messaging was also blocked.
Demand for VPN services to evade the blockade surged 4,300%, said Simon Migliano, Head of Research at Top10VPN.com.
Facebook was still available sporadically and demonstrators in the second city of Mandalay used it to livestream the first such street protest since the coup.
""People's protest against military coup,"" read one banner.
The group of around 20 people chanted: ""Our arrested leaders, release now, release now.""
Three people were arrested after the protest, student groups said. Reuters was unable to contact police for comment.
A dozen or so people also staged a protest in the main city of Yangon later before dispersing quickly.
At least 147 people have been detained since the coup, including activists, lawmakers and officials from Suu Kyi's government, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said in a statement.
DISOBEDIENCE
Staff at some government hospitals stopped work on Wednesday or wore ribbons in the NLD's red colour. In response, the army announced on Thursday that people could get treatment in military hospitals.
Pictures shared on Wednesday showed workers at the agriculture ministry joining the campaign of disobedience too. 
Other signs of anger have emerged. For a third night, people in Yangon and other cities banged on pots and pans and honked car horns. 
""Lights are shining in the dark,"" said Min Ko Naing, a veteran of past campaigns against military rule, in a call to action. ""We need to show how many people are against this unfair coup.""
Suu Kyi, 75, has not been seen since her arrest along with other party leaders. Police have filed charges against her of illegally importing and using six walkie-talkie radios found at her home and she has been detained until Feb. 15.
The daughter of the former British colony's independence hero Aung San and the longtime leader of its democracy movement, Suu Kyi spent about 15 years under house arrest between 1989 and 2010. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. 
She remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of Muslim Rohingya refugees.
The new junta has declared a one-year state of emergency, but Min Aung Hlaing told a business group on Wednesday that he could stay on beyond that.
""The army had to take charge for several reasons, but will not go beyond the democratic path,"" he was quoted as saying by pro-army People Media.
The NLD won about 80% of the parliament seats in the November election and trounced a pro-military party, according to the election commission. The army refused to accept the result, citing unsubstantiated allegations of fraud.
A group of lawmakers who had been due to take up their seats on Monday before the coup stopped them held their own oath-taking session at the complex where they have stayed since then.
In Yangon, streets resounded to the sound of clapping at 5 p.m. (1030 GMT) as coup opponents applauded their act.
The United Nations said it would step up international pressure to ensure the will of the people is respected.
Washington said it was reviewing possible sanctions. U.S. President Joe Biden discussed the situation in calls with the leaders of South Korea and Australia, the White House said.
Norway's Telenor Asa, Myanmar's leading mobile network operator, said it had to comply with the directive to block Facebook but did not believe the request was based on necessity in accordance with international human rights law.

Facebook spokesman Andy Stone urged authorities to restore connectivity ""so that people in Myanmar can communicate with their families and friends and access important information"".

FETHARD, Ireland (Reuters) - As one of around 80 Irish publicans carrying on the tradition of doubling up as the local funeral director, Jasper Murphy has seen first hand how the pandemic is preventing people coming together in good times and bad.
The doors of his McCarthy's Pub and Restaurant in the small southern Irish town of Fethard have been shut for large parts of the last 10 months, with COVID-19 restrictions also limiting mourners at funerals to as few as 10 for much of that period.
In ordinary times, family and friends might remember a loved one over a meal and a pint at McCarthy's, but that's not possible with the country locked down again after a devastating third wave of infections led to more COVID-19 deaths in January than the previous eight months combined.
""People really do miss that,"" Murphy said, sorting orders for takeaway Sunday roast dinners - the only hospitality service allowed under COVID-19 curbs - before beginning to prepare a coffin for a funeral he was notified of early that morning.
""In a lot of cases, a funeral might be the only time a family meets. I know that's an odd thing to say. When you've got people living away, you might not see them again until the next funeral.""
Historically in Ireland, many bar owners juggled careers as undertakers, farmers, grocers, auctioneers and postmasters. McCarthy's was once a hotel and numbers still hang on the rooms upstairs, where Murphy, the fifth generation proprietor, changes into a suit to collect the body.
In this instance preparations include a trip to Marks & Spencer (OTC:MAKSY) to buy a suit for the deceased, whose home was too damp to retrieve one of his own after he died in care.
In an added coronavirus complication, Murphy had to ask the store owner for a dispensation to make the purchase, as non-essential retail is currently banned.
At the man's funeral three days later, friends, many of them elderly men, dotted around the outer walls of the graveyard in masks to pay their respects at a distance.
A few hundred, or even a few thousand often attended funerals in rural Ireland before the pandemic, Murphy said. With numbers restricted, the service and burial pass by quickly.
Murphy last pulled a pint on Christmas Eve and may not get to for another two months at least. His yard between the pub and a store room of coffins is full of unused beer kegs.
But with vaccines rolling out, the 53-year-old father-of-four - who like his wife also juggles homeschooling - is most looking forward to the return of McCarthy's Thursday night traditional music sessions, when he moonlights as a drummer and chief cameraman. 
""Playing a session every week is my release. One time I was literally between two funerals and the band said if you don't play, we're not playing,"" he recalled.

""So I hopped out of the hearse in my suit, hopped behind the drum kit and hopped back into the hearse again and headed off.""

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Louis Lakor was seven years old when Uganda's Lord's Resistance Army killed his family and kidnapped him to use as a child soldier. On Thursday the International Criminal Court found the commander responsible, Dominic Ongwen, guilty of war crimes. 
Lakor says Ongwen should be forgiven. 
    The verdict thrusts an uncomfortable spotlight on questions of culpability in a society still deeply traumatised by the militia, which rampaged through northern Uganda from 1987 to 2006. Families still grapple with the question: when does a terrified and traumatised child become responsible for the atrocities he commits to survive? 
Lakor, forced to murder his three-year-old sister, is inclined to forgiveness, even though Ongwen was a grown man when he destroyed Lakor's life. 
""He (Ongwen) was abducted when he was a young boy, he did not join willingly. And they also killed his relatives when he was young,"" Lakor told Reuters. ""Dominic Ongwen should be forgiven, because like me also, I killed but I was forgiven.""
Lakor's nightmare began in 2003, near the northern town of Gulu. LRA rebels killed his parents, raped one sister and killed her. Lakor and his two younger sisters were taken. 
""They gave us heavy luggage to carry,"" he said. ""They had been killing weak people ... one of my sisters, because she was only three years old, she could not move with luggage, I tried helping her but they stopped me from helping. They used me to kill her.""
Another sister became tired and ""just sat down ... one soldier came and just shot her,"" he said. ""That operation was commanded by Dominic Ongwen."" 
REJECTED BY FAMILY
Led by fugitive warlord Joseph Kony, the LRA terrorised Ugandans as it battled the government of President Yoweri Museveni from bases in the north of the country and its neighbours. In recent years it has been largely wiped out.
Lakor stayed with the LRA for eight months before escaping. His story echoes those of the tens of thousands of other children who were kidnapped and forced to work as fighters and sex slaves.
Ongwen, who rose to become a top LRA commander, was convicted on Thursday of dozens of crimes, including widespread rape, sexual enslavement, child abductions, torture and murder, including killings of babies.
Lakor's relatives rejected him when he returned and he lived on the streets for several years, he said. 
""Those uncles of mine they refused me, they said I am very bad, I am a rebel I might kill them,"" he said. Now 25, he eventually became a mechanic in Gulu.
He recalls Ongwen as ""a quiet guy"" who believed children who survived should be taught to kill.
""They would bring a prisoner and they would bring for example a panga (large knife) and say that you kill him. They would bring someone from your village and say 'you chop her',"" he said.

""They believed that we were young and if they train us in those things, we would have that heart of fighting and killing. ""He (Ongwen) told us we are doing these things because we have been trained to do them.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in New Delhi urged India's government on Thursday to resume talks with farmers whose months-long protests over agricultural reforms erupted into violence last week.
India's Foreign Ministry said it had ""taken note"" of the comments and underlined ongoing efforts between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and farmers groups to resolve the situation.
""We encourage that any differences between the parties be resolved through dialogue,"" a U.S. embassy spokesperson said in a statement that also offered general support for the government's efforts to ""improve the efficiency of India's markets and attract greater private sector investment"".
Modi's government has held multiple rounds of talks with representatives of thousands of farmers who have camped, mostly peacefully, on the outskirts of New Delhi since late last year. 
But no talks have been held since Jan 26., when some protesters clashed with police in the heart of the capital city following a military parade to mark Republic Day, and no indication has been given of when they might resume.
Television images of protesters occupying the ramparts of New Delhi's historic Red Fort and later clashing with police drew international attention to the confrontation between Modi's government and the farmers.
The farmers, who enjoy most support in northern India's breadbasket states, argue that three new farm laws will hurt their interests while benefiting large firms.
But the government says the reforms will bring much-needed investment to a farm sector that accounts for nearly 15% of India's $2.9 trillion economy but about half its workforce. 
BARRICADES UP, INTERNET DOWN 
Police remain on guard against further attempts by farmers to bring the protests into the capital, and have reinforced barricades at three main sites.
Earlier this week internet services were temporarily suspended in some areas, drawing widespread criticism, including from international activists and celebrities.
""We recognise that unhindered access to information, including the internet, is fundamental to the freedom of expression and a hallmark of a thriving democracy,"" the U.S. embassy spokesperson said.
In response to social media posts on the internet shutdowns, India's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that vested interest groups were mobilising international support against the country. 
""Any protests must be seen in the context of India's democratic ethos and polity, and the ongoing efforts of the government and the concerned farmer groups to resolve the impasse,"" ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said on Thursday.
Farm union leaders have been calling for a repeal of the new laws and to make the government's crop price guarantee scheme legally binding, and for the withdrawal of legal cases against protesters. 
But some farmer groups have expanded their list of demands.
At a rally in northern Haryana state on Wednesday, thousands of farmers from the politically influential Jat community backed a call to waive farm loans and increase crop prices paid by the government.

""If the government doesn't concede to our demands, thousands more farmers will march towards Delhi,"" Kek Ram Kandela, a leader among the Jat farmers, told the rally attended by more than 50,000 people.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - A member of the World Health Organization-led team searching for clues to the origins of COVID-19 in the central Chinese city of Wuhan said work was needed to try to trace genetic elements of the virus in bat caves.
Peter Daszak, a zoologist and animal disease expert, said the team in Wuhan had been receiving new information about how the virus, first identified in the city in late 2019, led to a pandemic. He did not elaborate but said there was no evidence to suggest it emerged from a lab.
The origin of the coronavirus has become highly politicised following accusations, especially by the United States, that China was not transparent in its early handling of the outbreak. Beijing has pushed the idea that the virus originated elsewhere. 
Daszak was involved in research into the origins of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003, tracing its roots to bats living in a cave in southwest Yunnan province.
""Similar research needs to be done if we are going to find the true wildlife origin"" of COVID-19, said Daszak, president of the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance.
""That sort of work to find the likely bat source is important because if you can find the sources of these lethal viruses you can reduce the contact with those animals,"" he told Reuters in an interview. 
It is unclear whether China is currently sampling its many bat caves, but viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 had previously been found in the southwest province of Yunnan. 
He said the team in Wuhan had been receiving new information about how the virus led to a pandemic, but did not elaborate.
""I'm seeing a picture coming through of some of the scenarios looking more plausible than before,"" he said.
One scenario being scrutinised more closely by the team is the possibility that the virus could have been circulating long before it was first identified in Wuhan. 
""That's something our group is looking at very intensely to see what level of community transmission could have been happening earlier,"" Daszak said.
""The real work we are doing here is to trace back from the first cases back to an animal reservoir, and that's a much more convoluted path, and may have happened over a number of months or even years.""
The investigators have visited hospitals, research facilities and the seafood market where the first outbreak was identified, although their contacts in Wuhan are limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts.
Daszak said Chinese authorities had not refused any of the team's requests to visit facilities or meet with key figures.

""It is of course impossible to know what you are not being told, but what I am seeing in China, and what this group is seeing in China, is that what we asked for, we are being allowed to do,"" Daszak said.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - A former Ugandan child soldier who became a commander of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army was convicted on Thursday of dozens of crimes, including widespread rape, sexual enslavement, child abductions, torture and murder, including killings of babies.
The International Criminal Court found Dominic Ongwen guilty of 61 out of 70 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. A hearing in mid-April will consider a possible sentence, which could be up to life imprisonment, with a decision expected later this year. 
Judges at the court said Ongwen, who himself was taken by the LRA as a young boy, had acted out of free will in committing ""innumerable"" crimes between 2002 and 2005, commanding several hundred soldiers.
""Mothers were forced to abandon their children in the bush. LRA fighters threw children, including babies, into the bush because the children were crying and making it difficult for their mothers to carry looted goods,"" Presiding Judge Bertram Schmitt said, naming the victims and describing the crimes.
""His guilt has been established beyond any reasonable doubt,"" he said, issuing the verdict after a 3-1/2-year trial that ended in March last year. 
Ongwen, wearing a tie and face mask, sat impassively in court, sometimes with his eyes closed, listening as the judgment was read out. 
His lawyer has argued that Ongwen's brutal life in the LRA affected his mental health and his capacity to make independent decisions.
Led by fugitive warlord Joseph Kony, the LRA terrorized Ugandans for nearly two decades as it battled the government of President Yoweri Museveni from bases in the north of the country and neighbouring countries. In recent years it has been largely wiped out.
In a legal first, Ongwen was also convicted for the crime of forced pregnancy for atrocities committed against seven women. 
""As a result of the sexual and physical violence and the living conditions to which they were submitted, the abducted women and girls suffered severe, barely imaginable physical and mental pain,"" Schmitt said.
Ongwen ordered the killing and abduction of many civilians during attacks on camps protected by Ugandan government forces and personally took sex slaves, raped women and forced children to fight in hostilities, the court found.
Ongwen, who was detained in 2015, remains in the court's custody. 
MIXED FEELINGS IN UGANDA
In Uganda, feelings were divided about how tough the court should be on Ongwen. 
    Grace Acan, an abductee who lost a child while being held captive, said Ongwen could have followed others and left the LRA when he became an adult, but chose not to.
    ""Based on the offences that he was found guilty of he deserves it, he needs to be in jail,"" Acan said.
    Louis Lakor, a 25-year-old vehicle mechanic in Gulu town, northern Uganda, who said he too was abducted by the LRA after rebel fighters killed his parents and raped his sister, hoped the court shows Ongwen leniency.
    ""He was abducted when he was a young boy, he did not join willingly,"" Lakor told Reuters. ""What I think is Dominic Ongwen should be forgiven, because like me also, I killed but I was forgiven.""
Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said Ongwen had been a victim himself at one stage. ""In time, however, he grew into one of the most senior military leaders, fervently committed to the LRA cause with infamous brutality.""

Ongwen is the fifth suspect to be convicted for atrocities at the ICC, a court of last resort established in 2002 to prosecute the most serious crimes when other countries are unable or unwilling to do so.

ROME (Reuters) - Former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi was due to start talks with Italy's divided political parties on Thursday to seek backing for a new government to deal with the entwined health and economic crises.
Draghi, one of the most respected figures in Italy who has received a mandate from the head of state to put together an administration, entered parliament in mid-morning and was due to see leaders of the smaller groups later in the day.
He was expected to meet the main parties on Friday, with many political leaders undecided over whether to endorse his appointment or even look to join his new cabinet.
Financial markets have cheered the sudden arrival of Draghi, hopeful he can spearhead long-awaited reforms to boost growth in the euro zone's third-largest but most sluggish economy, thereby bolstering the currency bloc.
However, he needs the backing of parties from across the political spectrum before he can take office.
The largest group in parliament, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which played a prominent role in Italy's last two coalitions, initially signalled it would not back Draghi, but struck a more cautious note on Thursday.
""In my opinion, the 5-Star Movement has the duty to meet (Draghi), listen and then take a position on the basis of what our parliamentarians decide,"" said Luigi Di Maio, the outgoing foreign minister and party big-wig.
""We did not seek the stalemate ... but it is precisely in these circumstances that a political force shows itself to be mature in the eyes of the country.""
Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi suggested he might be ready to support a Draghi government - a move that could cause a schism within the right-wing opposition bloc.
""The decision of the President of the Republic to appoint Mario Draghi to form the new government goes in the direction we have been indicating for weeks: that of a personality with a high institutional profile around whom we can try to build substantial unity,"" Berlusconi said in a statement.
One of his allies, the far-right Brothers of Italy, has ruled out voting for Draghi, while the largest party in the bloc, the eurosceptic League, has sounded at best lukewarm, saying early elections would be best for the country.
The president moved quickly to anoint Draghi after talks aimed at salvaging outgoing Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's 17-month-old coalition imploded on Tuesday evening. 
Mattarella warned that a new government had to take office immediately to prevent Italy from missing out on more than 200 billion euros ($243 billion) from a European Union fund designed to help overcome the economic slump.

Matteo Renzi, the head of the small Italia Viva party which triggered Conte's downfall by withdrawing from the cabinet, said he hoped a Draghi government could take office next week.

SUSIYA, West Bank (Reuters) - Home for Palestinian Barakat Mour is a hillside cave in the West Bank, which he says is often under threat from Israeli settlers in the occupied territory.
""You'll be sitting with your wife in the cave and the settlers will raid it without any notice,"" Mour, 60, told Reuters about his family's dwelling near the West Bank city of Hebron.
""Here is where I was born. I was born in this cave. Homeland is very dear and my land is very dear to me, it is part of me,"" he said.
The Israeli military said that in recent weeks ""there have been several reports of friction between settlers and Palestinians in caves near the village of (At-Tuwani)"" and that troops worked to ""separate the participants and restore order"".
Natural caves dot the southern Hebron hills. According to the Israeli rights group B'Tselem, Palestinian cave-dwellers have been living there at least since the 1830s, using some caves as shelter for sheep and goats and others as homes.
Most have openings carved from stone and are divided into a living space, a storage area and a kitchen.
Mour and his 12 brothers live in the Palestinian village of Yatta, but spend most days in a cave and rotate sleeping there to deter settlers from seizing it at night, he said. 
Mour said that in one incident last week around 70 settlers entered the cave and damaged property. 
Some 440,000 settlers live among more than 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and that Palestinians seek for a future state.
Most countries view Israeli settlements in occupied territory as illegal under international law. Israel disputes this, citing historic, biblical and political links to the land as well as security needs.
Israeli and Palestinian activists have staged demonstrations outside the cave to support Mour's family. 
At one recent protest, on Jan. 23, activists banged drums and chanted ""occupation, no more"" towards a group of settlers before being dispersed by Israeli troops firing stun grenades. 

The military said ""a disturbance developed"" during which a number of Palestinians violated an order to leave the area, resulting in soldiers employing ""riot dispersal means"".

ANTWERP, Belgium (Reuters) - An Iranian diplomat accused of planning to bomb a meeting of an exiled opposition group was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Thursday in the first trial of an Iranian official for suspected terrorism in Europe since Iran's 1979 revolution.
Assadolah Assadi was found guilty of attempted terrorism after a foiled plot to bomb a rally of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) near Paris in June 2018, Belgian prosecution lawyers and civil parties to the prosecution said.
The third counsellor at Iran's embassy in Vienna, he was arrested in Germany before being tranfered to Belgium for trial. French officials have said he was running an Iranian state intelligence network and was acting on orders from Tehran.
He did not attend his hearings, which were held behind closed doors amid high security, and neither he, not his lawyer, have commented.
In March, he warned authorities of possible retaliation by unidentified groups if he is found guilty, according to a police document obtained by Reuters. The courtroom was heavily guarded, with armoured vehicles outside and police helicopters overhead.
A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency on Jan. 24 that Assadi's diplomatic immunity from prosecution had been violated and that he was a victim of a Western trap.
Prosecution lawyer Georges-Henri said outside the court in Antwerp: ""The ruling shows two things: A diplomat doesn't have immunity for criminal acts ... and the responsibility of the Iranian state in what could have been carnage.""
COMMERCIAL FLIGHT
Investigators assessed that Assadi brought the explosives for the plot with him on a commercial flight to Austria from Iran, according to Belgium's federal prosecutor.
Former U.S. president Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani gave the keynote address at the rally, which was attended by diplomats from many countries.
The ruling comes at a sensitive time for Western relations with Iran. New U.S. President Joe Biden is considering whether to lift economic sanctions on Iran reimposed by Trump and rejoin fellow world powers in the historic 2015 nuclear accord with the Islamic Republic.
While the European Union has imposed human rights sanctions on Iranian individuals, Brussels has sought closer diplomatic and business ties with Tehran. 
But it says it cannot turn a blind eye to terrorism, including the two killings in the Netherlands and a failed assassination attempt in Denmark, blamed on Iran.
""It's an historic day, it's a day of justice,"" said Rik Vanreusel, a lawyer for one of the civil parties. ""We can be proud of brave little Belgium, who decided not to just expel diplomats but to prosecute, imprison and condemn heinous international acts of terrorism,"" he told reporters.
Three other Iranians were sentenced in the trial for their role as accomplices, with 15-, 17- and 18-year sentences handed down respectively by three judges who did not comment on Thursday. One of their lawyers said he would recommend an appeal, although it was not clear if Assadi would do so.
""It was established that the Iranian regime uses terrorism as statecraft and the highest levels of the Iranian regime are involved,"" Shahin Gobadi, a Paris-based spokesman for the opposition People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, which is part of the NCRI, said outside the court.

The Islamic Republic has repeatedly dismissed the charges, calling the attack allegations a ""false flag"" stunt by the NCRI, which it considers a terrorist group.

805,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 06:26AM ET</span>","Analysis: As polls tighten, Hungary's Orban steps up pre-election spending","By Gergely Szakacs
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Ahead of an election next year, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is spending money on key groups of voters as opinion polls show a neck-and-neck race with an opposition united against him for the first time.
The right-wing premier, in power since 2010, is under pressure to reopen the economy after a pandemic-driven crash that sent Hungary into its worst recession since the global financial crisis, ending seven years of steady growth.
A tally by news website hvg.hu showed about a quarter of the spending channelled via a $12 billion COVID recovery fund last year was linked to the pandemic as Orban spent on other items, including support for ethnic Hungarians living elsewhere in central Europe, who backed him in previous elections.
Orban is also handing out extra payments for pensioners from February, plans to scrap income tax for younger people from 2022 and is offering grants to families to renovate their homes - measures worth about 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) combined, or about $2 billion.
His government is also extending a generous family benefit regime that now costs nearly 5% of GDP per year and represents Orban's most popular policy among undecided voters, according to a 2020 survey by think tank Policy Solutions.
Orban's minister in charge of family policy, Katalin Novak, told Reuters that the latest measures were an extension of the governing Fidesz party's decade-old policies rather than electioneering ahead of a national vote due in just over a year.
""We are in a fortunate situation as Hungarian people are family-centric, therefore, they assess measures to help families or young people starting a family positively,"" said Novak, one of Orban's deputies at the helm of Fidesz.
""We are ready to continue on this path and pledge that we will not cut back on family benefits. On the contrary, we will continuously expand them.""
Orban, 57, has been criticised abroad for anti-immigration rhetoric and reforms that the European Union says amount to authoritarianism, which he denies. But he has been popular at home, winning three straight terms to become Hungary's longest-serving post-communist leader.
Peter Virovacz, an economist at ING in Budapest, said the government's scope to take measures that help its election prospects has been vastly increased by the pandemic, which has eroded budget discipline across Europe.
""The execution of an election-style budget is helped by the fact that the 2020 shortfall could be blamed on COVID, which meant there was nothing the budget could not take, and this had opened up the floodgates,"" Virovacz said.
In less than a year, Hungary has gone from targeting a balanced budget in the foreseeable future to a deficit worth around 9% of GDP.
COPY-PASTE FROM WARSAW
With the proposed income tax cut for people under 25, Orban is taking a page out of the playbook of his conservative Polish ally, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, whose PiS party launched a similar measure ahead of the 2019 national election.
PiS won fewer votes among people aged 18-29 than in other age groups, according to an Ipsos exit poll. A recent Hungarian survey showed a similar pattern among younger voters.
""This is a copy-paste proposal,"" said Andras Biro-Nagy at Policy Solutions. ""It is logical that they are trying to do something as this is Fidesz's weakest demographic. They are trying to avoid losing this age group at the next election.""
A December survey by Hungarian think tank Zavecz Research showed support for Fidesz at 33.1% in the 18-29 demographic, the lowest among all age groups and just below support for the joint opposition party list.
At the same time, the level of undecided voters was by far the highest in the same age group. The united opposition held a four-point lead over Fidesz among all voters, reflecting a tightening race seen in other polls.
Orban is also reviving a 13th month pension in a symbolic move as the payment was scrapped under a leftist government as part of an International Monetary Fund-led austerity programme that rescued Hungary from the brink of financial collapse.
The prime minister argues that any return of his leftist opponents to power would lead to similar recklessness in public finances, an area where Fidesz had a strong record prior to the pandemic.
Despite catching up with Fidesz at the polls, the opposition still faces hurdles, including agreeing on a joint candidate list and presenting a viable challenger to the combative Orban.

""Fidesz has been weakened by the pandemic, the government faces a highly unpredictable economic and public health environment in 2021 and polls show that a united opposition could become a serious headache for the ruling party,"" said Andrius Tursa, a political analyst at Teneo Intelligence.

806,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 04, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>","Canada says Hong Kong graduates can apply for work permits, slams China on rights","OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada said on Thursday that Hong Kong graduates of Canadian universities could apply for a new category of three-year work permit next week and expressed fresh concern about China's clampdown on the former British territory.
The announcement marks the latest step in Canada's campaign to help Hong Kong after China imposed a new national security law in late June 2020, aimed at anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession or terrorism. About 300,000 Canadian passport holders live in the city.
Under the new visa rules, unveiled last November, any Hong Kong resident who has graduated from a Canadian university in the past five years can apply to work for up to three years. Those with equivalent foreign credentials are also eligible.
Visa (NYSE:V) recipients will also be offered a way to transition more easily to permanent residency.
""Canada continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the
people of Hong Kong, and is deeply concerned about the new National Security Law and the deteriorating human rights situation there,"" the government said in a statement.
After China imposed the law, Ottawa moved quickly to suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and banned the export of sensitive military items.
Hong Kong residents currently in Canada temporarily, including visitors, students and workers, can apply online for the visas. Eligible spouses or common-law partners, as well as dependent children, can also apply for a study or work permit.

The measures apply to residents who hold a Hong Kong special administrative region or a British National Overseas passport, created under British law in 1987 that specifically relates to Hong Kong. China and Hong Kong say they no longer recognize the BNO passport as a valid travel document.

Cyprus talks,"NICOSIA (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called for flexibility ahead of a fresh bid by the United Nations to heal the decades-old division of Cyprus, a dispute harming ties between Turkey and Greece and energy projects in the eastern Mediterranean.
Raab represents one of three guarantor countries under a convoluted treaty which granted Cyprus independence in 1960. He and the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey are expected to attend a three-day summit the United Nations will call in early March on the future of Cypriot reunification talks.
Raab was holding talks on the island on Thursday with its Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders. Earlier in the week he spoke to his counterparts from Greece and Turkey.
""Ahead of informal UN talks on Cyprus, today I spoke to Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and reinforced the need for all sides to be flexible,"" Raab wrote on his official Twitter account late Wednesday.
Cyprus, with a combined population of just over 1 million, was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. 
The conflict is thrown into sharper focus by Ankara's attempts to join the European Union and to tap energy resources around the island. By extension, the dispute spills over to separate disputes between Greece and Turkey over their own maritime borders.
Greek and Turkish officials are likely to meet again at the end of Feburary or in early March to revive efforts to resolve the maritime boundary dispute, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told Reuters.
Cyprus talks have repeatedly stumbled over complex issues such as future co-governance or the demarcation of boundaries between the two sides, now split by a 180 km ceasefire line patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers.

The last attempt collapsed in disarray in mid-2017.

LONDON (Reuters) - Governments and developers around the world are exploring the potential use of ""vaccine passports"" as a way of reopening the economy by identifying those protected against the coronavirus.
Those developing the technologies however, say such tools come with consequences such as potentially excluding whole groups from social participation, and are urging lawmakers to think seriously about how they are used.
The travel and entertainment industries, which have struggled to operate at a profit while imposing social distancing regulations, are particularly interested in a way of swiftly checking who has protection.
Among those developing passports are biometrics company iProov and cyber security firm Mvine which have built a vaccine pass now being tested within Britain's National Health Service after receiving UK government funding.
iProov founder and chief executive Andrew Bud believes such vaccine passports only really need to hold two pieces of information.
""One is, has this person been vaccinated? And the other is, what does this person look like?""
You need only match a face to a vaccination status, you don't need to know a person's identity, he added.
Confirmation of patrons' vaccination status could help the night-time economy, which employs some 420,000 people in the northern English city of Manchester, off its knees, experts say.
""We have to look at how to get back to normal,"" said Sacha Lord, an industry adviser and co-founder of the city's Parklife music festival. 
While there have been experiments in socially distanced concerts and events over the last year, they weren't financially viable, he said.
""A gig isn't a gig or a festival isn't a festival unless you are stood shoulder to shoulder with your friends.
""I don't think we should be forcing people into the vaccine passports. It should be a choice. But on entry, if you don't have that passport, then we will give you another option,"" he added, suggesting the use of rapid result coronavirus tests.
Bud said vaccine certificates were being rolled out in some countries, and in the United Sates, some private sector health passes were being used to admit customers to sports events.
""I think vaccine certificates raise huge social and political issues. Our job is to provide the technology basis for making vaccine passports and certificates possible ... It is not our place to make judgments about whether they are a good idea or not,"" he said.

Potential issues could arise around discrimination, privilege and exclusion of the younger generation who would be last in line to be vaccinated, he said, adding he believed government was giving it careful consideration.

Indonesia officially recognises six religions, with nearly 90% of the population are Muslim, but concern has grown in recent years that more conservative interpretations of Islam are fueling religious intolerance.
The government's signing of the decree on Wednesday on religious attire in school dress codes came a few weeks after news emerged about a school in West Sumatra province forcing non-Muslim female students to wear a hijab.
The issue captured national attention because of a protest by the parents of one of the girls, news of which spread on social media. 
Yaqut Cholil Qoumas, Indonesia's religious minister, said the West Sumatra case was just the ""tip of the iceberg"".
""There are no reasons to infringe upon others' freedom in the name of religious expression,"" he told a news conference on Wednesday.
The special autonomous province of Aceh, which enforces sharia law, is exempt from the decree, Education Minister Nadiem Makarim said. 
Beka Ulung Hapsara, a commissioner at Indonesia's main rights body, Komnas HAM, said the decree respects people's choice to express their beliefs.
""Places of education are a space to develop independent souls free of discrimination, where respect is fostered,"" he said.
Andreas Harsono, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, said schools in more than 20 provinces still make religious attire mandatory in their dress code, so the decree was a positive step.

""Many public schools require girls and female teachers to wear the hijab that too often prompt bullying, intimidation, social pressures, and in some cases, forced resignation,"" he said.

Responding to a question in parliament about the report, Prime Minister Suga said: ""No matter who was involved, I want the ministry to check facts firmly and make a response based on rules."" 
Weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported on Wednesday that Seigo Suga and other Tohokushinsha Film executives had dined with senior officials from the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry several times last year.
""It has been confirmed that four officials in the report dined with (people from) Tohokushinsha,"" an official at the ministry's personnel division said.
""We are looking into whether Tohokushinsha is an interested party, and if infringement on the ethics code has taken place.""
Japan's National Civil Service Ethics Law prohibits government employees from receiving treats, gifts or entertainment from individuals or companies that could be seeking to curry favour.
The premier, who was minister of internal affairs and communications in 2006 and 2007, has already seen his support falling sharply, with critics saying he was too slow to act after COVID-19 cases began surging last year. 
A poll by the Asahi Shimbun daily showed late last month that support for Suga's government dropped to 33% from 39% in December.

Tohokushinsha said on its website that the company was looking into the report, and it will take appropriate steps based on its findings.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region could trigger broader destablization in the country, U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council on Wednesday as he warned that a dire humanitarian situation in the north was set to worsen. 
Hundreds of thousands of people in Tigray have not received help and the United Nations has been unable to completely assess the situation because it does not have full and unimpeded access, according to Lowcock's notes for the closed virtual briefing of the 15-member Security Council.
He said there were reports of increasing insecurity elsewhere, which could be due to a vacuum created by the redeployment of Ethiopian troops to Tigray, and that the United Nations was concerned about the potential for broader national and regional destablization.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed ordered air strikes and a ground offensive against Tigray's former ruling party - the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) - after regional forces attacked federal army bases in the region on Nov. 4. 
The TPLF withdrew from the regional capital, Mekelle, and major cities, but low-level fighting has continued.
In the region of more than five million people, thousands of people are believed to have died and 950,000 have fled their homes since fighting began. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was ""seriously concerned"" over the situation in Tigray, a U.N. spokesman said late on Tuesday. 
Lowcock said Abiy's government controls between 60% and 80% of the territory in Tigray, but does not have full command of the ethnic Amhara and Eritrean forces also operating in the region.
Dozens of witnesses say Eritrean troops are in Tigray to support Ethiopian forces, though both countries deny that.
The United Nations has received reports that police are operating at a fraction of their previous capacity and Lowcock said he could confidently say that if protection and aid were not quickly increased then the humanitarian situation would deteriorate.
He said there were troubling accusations of sexual and gender-based violence.

Several senior U.N. officials recently visited Ethiopia to push for greater access to Tigray. Lowcock said he was hopeful there would be concrete progress in coming days to allow aid to be scaled up.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong has denied access to foreign consulates seeking to provide assistance to detained dual nationals in the global financial hub, the Canadian foreign ministry said on Wednesday.
Semi-autonomous Hong Kong has traditionally accepted dual nationals unlike its Chinese sovereign, but it has the right to deny consular access under treaties signed when the former British colony returned to China in 1997.
Five diplomats say, however, that consular access to dual nationals had largely been granted by local authorities since Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule more than two decades ago.
That is now changing, the diplomats said.
The move signals Hong Kong is tightening enforcement of the consular treaties as tensions with Western governments escalate following the introduction of a sweeping national security law in June last year.
Consular access treaties are generally based on reciprocity but can be complicated by differences over recognition of dual nationals, Western and Asian diplomats say. 
Western governments and some local politicians fear the security law is being used to crush freedoms in the global financial hub, which Chinese and Hong Kong officials reject. 
Canada said it received a first notification of a Canadian dual-national prisoner in Hong Kong being required to declare their nationality on Jan. 18. It did not identify the prisoner or the reason they were in jail.
""We are aware of more such incidences involving dual nationals of other countries,"" Canadian foreign ministry spokeswoman Christelle Chartrand said, adding Ottawa had expressed its concern to the Hong Kong government. 
Canadians who wish to receive consular services should present themselves as Canadian to authorities at all times, she said.
There are roughly 300,000 people from Hong Kong with Canadian passports. 
""ESTABLISHED PRACTICE""
Florence Wong, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong government's Security Bureau, said ""unless a Hong Kong resident has made an application to the city's Immigration Department and was approved for the declaration of change of nationality, he is still a Chinese national.""
Wong cited the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and bilateral agreements between China and other countries, saying consular officers were entitled to visit a national of their respective country under the custody of the city’s Correctional Services Department, but not any detained Chinese nationals.
""This is in line with the established practice, and the relevant laws in Hong Kong,"" Wong said.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said they would continue to press for fair treatment, judicial transparency and regular visits by U.S. consular officials for any U.S. citizen arrested in Hong Kong, regardless of how they were categorised by the Hong Kong government. 
Both Western and Asian diplomats said they were monitoring developments closely and were seeking urgent answers from Hong Kong officials about the apparent change in policy. 
For years, local police have been quick to notify foreign consulates if dual nationals have been detained, and the city’s Correctional Services Department have provided smooth access to people in prison.
In recent weeks that access has ended, including to some people who have been in prison for years, two of the diplomats said. Dozens of prisoners been affected, five diplomats said.
""Any ambiguity in terms of consular rights has generally been ignored in our favour,"" said one Western diplomat familiar with the situation. ""It has always been out there hanging over us, and the change has finally come.""

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A faction of Nepal's ruling communist party declared a nationwide strike on Thursday to ramp up opposition against Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli for dissolving parliament and seeking fresh polls amid a pandemic-induced economic crisis.
The call to shutdown businesses, shops, educational institutions was part of protest campaign launched across the Himalayan nation, after Oli dissolved parliament on Dec. 20 citing a lack of cooperation from other leaders of his Nepal Communist Party (NCP).
Supreme Court judges hearing more than a dozen petitions challenging the legality of parliament's dissolution are expected to give a verdict this month. If they rule in Oli's favour elections have been scheduled in two phases, on April 30 and May 10. 
The call for a strike came after Oli earlier this week appointed senior officials to constitutional bodies, including commissions on human rights and investigations into abuse of authority. Opponents in the NCP accused Oil of bypassing a requirement for appointees to be approved by the parliament.
""Declaring the strike is our compulsion to oppose the prime minister's unrestrained move to avoid the due process of law to make the appointments,"" said Pampha Bhusal, a senior leader who along with her colleagues declared the strike.
The streets in the capital Kathmandu were deserted on Thursday morning and television channels reported that some protesters clashed with police but there were no immediate report of major violence.
""A taxi was set on fire and three other vehicles were vandalized in Kathmandu by activists,"" said Ashok Singh, a police officer, adding that more than 70 activists had been detained.
After their alliance won the last national election in 2017, 
Oli's communist UML party and a Maoist party of the former rebels merged to form the NCP, but the party has been plagued with infighting ever since.
In late December, the Chinese Communist Party sent senior officials to Kathmandu to see if they could mend ties between the factions in a party regarded as friendly to Beijing.

The Commission has come under fierce criticism for its handling of the vaccination strategy and, for a damaging row with British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) over a supply contract.
However Mitsotakis said the principle of centralized vaccine purchasing was the right one.
""I can tell you, as a small country, I don't want to be negotiating on my own with big pharma,"" he told Reuters. ""I'm happy that Europe negotiated as a whole. Yes, there were complications, yes there were issues but let's not lose sight of the big picture.""
As the pandemic broke out across Europe last year, there was widespread acrimony as EU member states vied with each other to obtain surgical masks and other scarce protective gear as well as vital equipment like ventilators.
Mitsotakis said he doubted Greece would have been able to obtain the number of shots it has done without centralized purchasing and distribution according to population size, and the same probably applied to smaller EU countries from Portugal to Estonia and even to larger states like Italy.
""We can argue about the delivery, and whether it was handled well but we cannot argue with the main decision,"" he said.
Mitsotakis said he was quite satisfied with the overall response to the pandemic in Greece, which has suffered proportionately fewer cases and deaths than many other EU countries despite a recent surge and a health system badly weakened by a decade-long debt crisis.

Overall, EU countries have so far given first doses to about 3% of their populations, compared with 9% for the United States and 14% for Britain, according to Our World in Data.

BERLIN (Reuters) - When Abdul Kader Tizini graduated with a master's degree in mechanical engineering from RWTH Aachen, one of Germany's top technical universities, he thought it would be a matter of weeks before he landed his dream job.
Just over a month later the coronavirus spread to Germany, stopping a decade-long employment boom in its tracks.
Now, some 800 job applications and 80 interviews later, the 29-year-old Syrian is still in search of work.
Being a foreigner was a disadvantage in getting employment in Europe's biggest economy even before the pandemic. It has become more of a barrier now there are fewer vacancies, Tizini said.
""Companies think, 'With a foreigner we'll have to explain the idea twice, with a native only once',"" he told Reuters.
Hiring freezes and layoffs at thousands of German companies mean foreign graduates like Tizini face fierce competition with native graduates and unemployed professionals.
Unlike German and European Union nationals, who are entitled to unemployment benefits and coronavirus aid, many foreign graduates do not qualify.
Hundreds of thousands of international students were drawn to Germany in the past decade, encouraged by a reputable yet almost free higher education system and strong post-graduation employment prospects.
The number of international students in Germany rose by around 70% between 2009 and 2019, data from the Federal Statistics Office showed.
LANGUAGE, CULTURE BARRIER
Anja Robert, a career adviser at RWTH Aachen, said international students in Germany were finding it more difficult to find jobs than native Germans.
The demand for her team's counselling sessions and for psychological support has risen since March, when Germany went into its first lockdown to battle the pandemic, she said.
""In such insecure times, one tends towards safety, relying on established language skills, cultural traits and understanding.""
Germany's unemployment rate rose to as much as 6.4% after the government imposed the first lockdown, from 5% in the previous months. It hit 6% in January this year.
The pandemic's impact on the German job market has been mitigated by the government's ""Kurzarbeit"" scheme that allows employers to cut hours during an economic downturn. But it also makes hiring more difficult.
Companies that are on the scheme can hire staff in exceptional cases if they have a compelling reason, Ludwig Christian, a spokesman for the Federal Labour Office, said.
Between April 2020 and January this year, the number of new vacancies in Germany fell by 430,000, or 26% year-on-year, Labour Office data showed.
DIGITAL NETWORKING
Another challenge foreign students face is a weaker professional and social network, exacerbated by job fairs and networking events being cancelled or moved online amid the pandemic.
""Digital networking is simply more difficult, especially if you come from another country and you are not familiar with how networking here works,"" said Jana Koehler, a Berlin-based international recruiter.
Two lockdowns in spring and winter last year also shuttered restaurants and retailers, meaning thousands fewer part-time jobs which students fill to support themselves financially. 
Last April, the German government included foreigners in an interest-free loan programme for students. Graduates, however, are not eligible.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison discussed how they can work together to deal with China and a recent military coup in Myanmar, the White House said on Thursday.
The first call between the leaders since Biden's inauguration comes amid heightened tension between Australia and China and just days after Myanmar’s military seized power in a coup against the democratically elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
The strength of the U.S.-Australia alliance ""remains an anchor of stability in the Indo-Pacific and the world,"" the White House said in an emailed statement.
Morrison declined to give details of the conversation with Biden about China and Myanmar.
""He said to me again today, he sees the Australia-U.S. relationship as providing the anchor for peace and security in our region,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
The United States is Australia's key strategic ally, a relationship that Morrison made a priority as ties between Canberra and China, its largest trading partner, soured.
The new U.S. administration's emphasis on addressing climate change is likely to put pressure on Morrison, who has been hesitant to match Biden's commitment to net zero emissions by 2050.
Morrison, however, said the call was ""warm"" and ""engaging"".
Morrison's predecessor Malcolm Turnbull had a testy first phone call with previous U.S. President Donald Trump, who said it was the ""worst call by far"" according to The Washington Post.

The call turned hostile after Turnbull pressed Trump to honour a previous agreement Canberra made with the Obama administration to accept refugees from Australian offshore detention camps.

CIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - U.S. authorities returned dozens of Haitians to the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez from El Paso, Texas, on Wednesday, a move that appeared to contradict a policy agreement in place with Mexico brokered under the previous U.S. administration.
Luis Garcia, a director at the Chihuahua state government agency COESPO in Mexico, which oversees attention to migrants, confirmed the return of dozens of Haitians by U.S. immigration authorities.
""The situation seems somewhat extraordinary for us, because they don't speak Spanish, and it puts them in a situation in which they are increasingly exposed to risk,"" Garcia said.
As the coronavirus pandemic spread in March, the United States partially closed its border to asylum seekers by invoking a public health law known as ""Title 42."" Mexico agreed to allow U.S. authorities to return Guatemalans, Hondurans, and Salvadorans who had previously transited through its territory.
But the agreement between the two countries was limited to those three nationalities and Mexicans, according to the text of a March 21 document published by Mexico's foreign ministry.
Under Title 42, the United States generally flies migrants of other nationalities back to their country of origin.
More than a dozen Haitian migrants from the group told Reuters they'd been held by U.S. immigration authorities for three or four days and then returned without any documentation of their expulsion.
""They returned us with nothing, they threw away our clothes and my children's shoes,"" said Johan Decopin, from Haiti, who was returned to Ciudad Juarez on Wednesday with her husband and three children. ""We asked for asylum but they told us no.""
Many of the group were wearing the same black sandals, which they said they'd received from U.S. immigration authorities, a Reuters witness said.
Immigrant advocates said as well as the expulsion of Haitians on Wednesday they had seen more South American and Caribbean migrants being returned to Mexico amid a rise in returns under Title 42 in some regions since Biden took office.
""Up to 140 people are being returned to Baja California each day,"" said Esmeralda Siu, coordinator of the Pro-Migrant Defense Coalition, which represents a series of migrant shelters in the Mexican state. ""From what we're seeing they are returning Venezuelans, Colombians, and Peruvians (to Mexico),"" she added.
Asked about the return of the Haitians, U.S. Customs and Border Protection confirmed that 86 people were expelled to Mexico from the El Paso Sector, although it did not specify their nationalities. Mexico's foreign ministry and federal immigration agency did not respond to requests for comment.
Taylor Levy, an immigration attorney working with clients in El Paso, expressed confusion about the return of the Haitians.

""This violates the agreements between the U.S. and Mexico as they have been announced by both governments,"" she said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's President Moon Jae-in pledged on Thursday to upgrade the country's alliance with the United States and prepare a comprehensive North Korea strategy in a phone call with U.S. President Joe Biden, Moon's office said.
The call comes as Moon, who had offered to be a mediator between the United States and North Korea, faces the challenge of getting the stalled talks between Washington and Pyongyang back on track.
The two leaders affirmed the necessity to prepare a comprehensive North Korea strategy aimed at denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, presidential spokesman Kang Min-seok said.
""President Biden appraised the efforts of South Korea, the key country involved to resolve the issue on the Korean Peninsula,... and said will work closely with the South towards a common goal,"" Kang said.
The White House said in a statement that Biden stressed his commitment to strengthen U.S.-South Korea alliance and the two countries had agreed to coordinate closely on North Korea.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula at their first summit in 2018, but a second summit and subsequent working-level talks fell apart.
Moon also welcomed what he described as ""America's return"" in the midst of mounting global challenges - the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and economic polarization.
Biden has said a response to climate change will create new jobs, while Moon has introduced his ambitious Green New Deal aimed at economic recovery from the coronavirus fallout.
During a call in November after Biden's election victory, Moon vowed to promote economic relations with the United States by building a carbon neutral economy.

Biden and Moon also agreed on the immediate need for the restoration of demacracy in Myanmar, the White House said, after the country's army seized power on Monday.

Henry Puna was named after talks stretched for more than 12 hours. He eventually defeated Gerald Zackious, the Marshall Islands ambassador to the United States, by nine votes to eight.
Puna will now lead the region's push for more aggressive global action in tackling climate change.
The process, however, threatens to fracture the 50-year-old grouping, which includes Australia and New Zealand and 16 other mostly smaller island states dotted across the South Pacific.
Micronesian states said last year it was their turn to fill the post and threatened to leave the forum if they were not permitted.
""This has been an incredibly damaging 24 hours for Pacific regionalism and unity, the repercussions of which will be felt for years to come,"" said Jonathan Pryke, Director, Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Car Wash anti-corruption unit has officially shut down, the end of an era for a team of prosecutors that helped send dozens of Latin American political and business leaders to jail, including several former presidents.
The task force, which stemmed from a routine money-laundering investigation into a car wash in Brasilia, ceased to exist on Monday, although its dissolution was not announced until Wednesday by the federal prosecutors' office (MPF).
Some of its prosecutors will be transferred to the organized crime unit of the MPF, where they will continue their work, the agency's statement said.
The Car Wash squad began its work in 2014, focusing on contracting graft at state-run oil company Petrobras, although its scope quickly expanded. Former presidents and major companies throughout Latin America, thought for years to be untouchable, were implicated in sprawling corruption schemes uncovered by the investigators.
Among prominent figures sent to jail because of the investigation were popular former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Outside of Brazil, ex-presidents in Peru, El Salvador and Panama were also jailed as a result of investigations started by the task force. Major international companies, such as Maersk and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY), have also come under the investigators' microscope.
But many leftists had grown wary of the investigation, in part because of the jailing of Lula, while a series of leaked conversations in 2019 raised questions about whether investigators were cutting corners to secure prosecutions.
Corruption probes into family members of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro have made some conservatives suspicious of efforts to fight corruption as well.
That had left the future of Car Wash in doubt, even as its work remained popular among Brazilians. In September, Brazilian Prosecutor-General Augusto Aras extended the task force's mandate until Jan. 31, but did not say if he would renew it.

According to its own data, the Car Wash task force was responsible for 295 arrests, 278 convictions and 4.3 billion reais ($803 million) in ill-gotten gains being returned to the Brazilian state during its roughly seven years of operation.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - New vaccination centers are due to open this month in the heart of two California communities especially hard hit by the coronavirus, as state and federal officials try to tackle racial and economic disparities hindering U.S. immunization efforts.
Joint plans to launch the two sites on Feb. 16, at the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum in Oakland and the California State University campus in east Los Angeles, were detailed separately on Wednesday by Governor Gavin Newsom and the Biden administration's COVID-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients.
The two sites, capable of administering up to 6,000 shots per day, will be among the first of more than 100 vaccination centers established in communities of color across the United States, Newsom said.
""Equity is the call of this moment,"" Newsom told reporters outside the Oakland coliseum. ""The reason this site was chosen was the framework of making sure that communities that are often left behind are not left behind.""
Black and Hispanic populations, overly represented among the working poor and accounting for a large share of high-risk jobs in food service, factories, warehouses and healthcare, have been ravaged by the pandemic.
They also suffer disproportionately from chronic underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, that put them at higher risk of severe illness if infected by the coronavirus.
Their risk of exposure, and the risk of transmitting the virus to others, is further amplified by rampant overcrowded housing in the greater Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay areas, where multi-generational households frequently live in cramped apartments of just one or two bedrooms.
Public health experts have pointed to extreme overcrowding in Los Angeles housing as a primary factor driving the year-end wave of infections that turned Southern California into a leading U.S. epicenter of the pandemic. 
VACCINE HESITANCY
Moreover, skepticism about the safety of vaccines has run particularly deep in minority and working-class communities long distrustful of government authorities and lacking access to healthcare services.
The race to achieve collective immunity through widespread vaccinations has grown increasingly urgent with the advent of more highly transmissible variants of the coronavirus, some of which may also be partially resistant to vaccines.
While rates of COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and deaths have leveled off in the United States in recent weeks, following an alarming months-long surge that pushed healthcare systems to their brink, case loads and mortality remain high.
The United States has reported 26.5 million known coronavirus infections to date, with nearly 450,000 proving fatal as of Wednesday.
U.S. President Joe Biden last month branded the nation's COVID-19 immunization launch a ""dismal failure,"" citing what he called a lack of detailed planning by the Trump administration that left the states to largely fend for themselves.
Biden has vowed to accelerate the immunization campaign, with a focus on ensuring equitable access to vaccines, regardless of geography, race or ethnicity.
The United States has administered over 32 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine so far, according to a Reuters tally.
But a study this week indicated that Blacks and Hispanics had received a smaller proportion of shots than their representation among two top-priority groups of vaccine recipients - healthcare workers and nursing home residents.
The two vaccination centers opening in Oakland and Los Angeles will be staffed and equipped largely by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), setting them apart from existing state-run inoculation sites launched at venues such as Dodgers Stadium, Disneyland, and the Cal Expo fairgrounds in Sacramento.
""These (FEMA) sites in California are just the beginning,"" Zients told reporters. ""We are working with, in partnership in states across the country, to stand up new sites.""
Zients added that the U.S. military would ""dedicate substantial personnel and sources to help manage many sites.""

The White House on Tuesday said it would start shipping vaccines directly to retail pharmacies alongside ongoing deliveries to states, increasing weekly supplies of shots nationwide to 11.5 million.

Melbourne returned to mandatory masks indoors and a cap on gatherings to 15 people after the state's run of 28 days of zero local infections came to an end.
Play at the six warm-up events for the Grand Slam at Melbourne Park, due to start February 8, was heavily disrupted with organisers Tennis Australia cancelling all matches for Thursday.
In a pleasing sign the outbreak will likely be contained as an initial round of tests carried after the Grand Hyatt worker contracted the coronavirus came back negative, Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters. 
The positive case was announced in a surprise late night press conference on Wednesday but will be reflected in Thursday's tally.
The Grand Hyatt was one of three main quarantine hotels used by players and officials arriving in Melbourne for the Australian Open. 
About 1,200 players, coaching staff and officials arrived in Australia at the middle of last month and went into a mandatory 14-day isolation. Most players were released from quarantine about two weeks ago.
In a press conference on Thursday, Andrews said the Australian Open was likely to go ahead though he added ""there were no guarantees"".
""At this stage, the tennis shouldn't be impacted by this. These things can change. Every Victorian knows these are uncertain time,"" he said.
Australia's national cabinet is set to meet on Friday where lawmakers will discuss whether the hotel quarantine programme should be moved to regional areas after recent cases where the virus has escaped from a hotel into the community.
The country has reported more than 22,000 local COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since March 2020. Australia has ranked among the top 10 in a COVID performance index for its successful handling of the pandemic.

The states of New South Wales and Queensland reported zero new cases, while Western Australia, which is in a five-day lockdown after one positive case was detected on Sunday, will report its numbers later in the day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is ""deeply disturbed"" by reports of systematic rape and sexual abuse against women in internment camps for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in China's Xinjiang region and there must be serious consequences for atrocities committed there, the U.S. State Department said on Wednesday.
A BBC report earlier on Wednesday said women in the camps were subject to rape, sexual abuse and torture. The British broadcaster said ""several former detainees and a guard have told the BBC they experienced or saw evidence of an organized system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture.""
Asked to comment, a State Department spokeswoman said: ""We are deeply disturbed by reports, including first-hand testimony, of systematic rape and sexual abuse against women in internment camps for ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang.""
The spokeswoman reiterated U.S. charges that China has committed ""crimes against humanity and genocide"" in Xinjiang and added: ""These atrocities shock the conscience and must be met with serious consequences.""
The official said China should allow ""immediate and independent investigations by international observers"" into the rape allegations ""in addition to the other atrocities being committed in Xinjiang.""
The official did not specify what the consequences might be, but said Washington would speak out jointly with allies to condemn the atrocities and ""consider all appropriate tools to promote accountability for those responsible and deter future abuses."" 
The previous U.S. administration of former President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on Chinese officials and firms it linked to abuses in Xinjiang, and the administration of new President Joe Biden, which took office on Jan. 20, has made clear it plans to continue a tough approach to Beijing on this and other issues.
China denies accusations of abuses in Xinjiang, and has said the complexes it set up in the region provided vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism. Those in the facilities have since ""graduated"", it says.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the BBC report was ""wholly without factual basis"" and charged that the people interviewed for it had been ""proved multiple times"" to be ""actors disseminating false information.""
The Biden administration was quick to endorse a Trump administration determination that China has committed genocide in Xinjiang.

Last year, a report by a German researcher published by a Washington think tank accused China of using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against Muslims in Xinjiang.

But attitudes and confidence vary widely in the 15 countries covered in the survey, with France showing high levels of scepticism and some Asian countries showing declining trust in vaccines, while some European nations see rising confidence.
Overall, vaccine confidence is higher than in November, when the same survey - conducted in 15 countries and covering 13,500 people each time - found that only 40% would be willing to get vaccinated.
The survey, co-led by YouGov and Imperial College London’s Institute of Global Health Innovation (IGHI), found that people in Britain were the most willing to have a COVID-19 vaccine, at 78%, followed by Denmark at 67%. 
France had the highest proportion of respondents who said they would not take a vaccine, at 44%, but saw a doubling in the proportion who strongly agreed that they would take a vaccine, from 15% in November to 30% in January.
In Australia, Japan, South Korea and Singapore, willingness to take a vaccine has dropped off since November, with Japan showing the least preparedness, followed by Singapore.
""As vaccines will play a vital role in controlling the pandemic, leaders must act now to help more people understand the benefits of being vaccinated against COVID-19 and make sure that no one is left behind,"" said David Nabarro, the IGHI's co-director and a World Health Organization expert on COVID-19. 
The survey is part of efforts by the WHO and other bodies to monitor health-related behaviour and attitudes during the pandemic. 
Since April 2020 researchers have surveyed more 470,000 people worldwide. This most recent survey ran from Jan. 4-24.

It found that most people trust vaccines, with two-thirds expressing strong or moderate confidence and only 12% reporting no trust at all. It also found that two-thirds of people believe getting vaccinated is important for their health.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When U.S. President Joe Biden appears for a CBS interview this Super Bowl Sunday, he will be following a recent White House tradition of using the country's most-watched sporting event to reach a national audience in the tens of millions.
Presidents have used the annual National Football League championship game to try to promote an image of being someone that viewers would like to have a beer with - or in teetotaler Biden's case, a bowl of ice cream. 
""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell, a former White House correspondent, will interview Biden, with excerpts to air on Friday and the whole session to be shown in the 4 p.m. EST hour on Sunday. CBS is broadcasting the Super Bowl this year, with the game starting around 6:30 p.m. EST.
Biden, known to be a Philadelphia Eagles fan, has given no indication of which team he will be cheering on in the showdown between the defending champion Kansas City Chiefs and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Last year's game, 2020's single most-viewed U.S. television event, was watched by an estimated 99.9 million people - a clue to how many people Biden might reach to promote his $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package and offer his first expansive views on any number of domestic and foreign topics. 
""It's an audience that is not just going to be the true believers,"" said Thomas Alan Schwartz, a presidential scholar at Vanderbilt University. 
""The Super Bowl is one of the secular national holidays we have that tends to promote unity, the idea being that we all like watching the game. It's an opportunity to hit an audience that he would otherwise have a hard time finding,"" he said.
Presidents in the past have joined in the festivities by calling the coach of the victorious team. In 1972, noted football fan Richard Nixon called Miami Dolphins Coach Don Shula before the Super Bowl to suggest a pass play he might try against the Dallas Cowboys.
George W. Bush began the tradition of an interview around the Super Bowl, appearing with CBS lead commentator Jim Nantz in 2004 for a light interview mostly about the game.
""I think it's going to be a very close contest, but what the heck do I know? I'm just the president,"" Bush said.
More recent interviews have been more serious. Democratic President Barack Obama was grilled in 2013 by then-Fox News Channel commentator Bill O'Reilly (NASDAQ:ORLY) about the rocky rollout of the website for his Obamacare healthcare plan and the militant attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya.
In 2019, then-President Donald Trump granted an interview to CBS' ""Face the Nation"" as part of the run-up to the game and talked about his differences with the U.S. intelligence community. 

He skipped a Super Bowl interview last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Wednesday reaffirmed U.S. recognition of opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president and ruled out negotiations anytime soon with President Nicolas Maduro, branding him a ""dictator"" and calling for free and fair elections.
In the most extensive explanation of President Joe Biden’s Venezuela policy since he took office on Jan. 20, State Department spokesman Ned Price said one of the main thrusts would be ""targeting regime officials and their cronies involved in corruption and human rights abuses.""
This suggested that the new administration could stick to former President Donald Trump’s sanctions campaign in some form, despite its failure to force Maduro from power. Price made no mention, however, of the crippling oil sanctions that Trump imposed on the OPEC nation.
Seeking to draw a contrast to Trump’s sometimes go-it-alone approach on Venezuela, Price told reporters the new administration would collaborate more ""with a number of allies and partners to bring about progress towards democracy in Venezuela.""
""Nicolas Maduro is a dictator,"" Price said. ""The overriding goal of the Biden-Harris administration is to support a peaceful, democratic transition in Venezuela through free and fair presidential and parliamentary elections.""
But he did not explicitly call for the Socialist leader's departure or removal, in contrast to Trump officials who left little doubt that was a central objective.
The State Department did not immediately provide a clarification requested by Reuters.
Maduro has remained in power, backed by the military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran.
Price made clear, however, that negotiations with Maduro – which Trump also rejected - are out of the question for now.
Pressed on the possibility of future dialogue if circumstances change, Price said: ""I’m talking about current policy ... We certainly don't expect any contact with Maduro anytime soon.""
Price said the United States would continue to recognize Guaido as interim president. Dozens of countries have backed Guaido’s claim following Maduro’s re-election in 2018 in a vote Western governments called a sham.
But last week, European Union states said while they regarded Guaido as a ""privileged interlocutor"" they no longer considered him interim president.

This came after Guaido lost his position as head of parliament following legislative elections in December that the opposition mostly boycotted. The EU did not recognize that vote. Neither did the United States, which Price said has retained its backing for the previous Guaido-led body.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An Iranian diplomat accused of planning to bomb a meeting of an exiled opposition group is to be sentenced on Thursday in the first trial of an Iranian official for suspected terrorism in the European Union since Iran's 1979 revolution.
After hearings last year, a court in Antwerp, Belgium will decide whether Vienna-based diplomat Assadolah Assadi and three others are guilty of attempted terrorism after a plot to bomb a rally of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) near Paris in June 2018 was foiled by German, French and Belgian police.
The ruling, due at around 0800 GMT, comes at a sensitive time for Western relations with Iran. New U.S. President Joe Biden is considering whether to lift sanctions on Iran reimposed by his predecessor Donald Trump and rejoin fellow world powers in the historic 2015 nuclear accord with the Islamic Republic.
Belgian prosecutors were seeking the maximum 20-year sentence for Assadi, who refused to appear in court and has notcommented on the charge that he was acting on orders from Tehran. 
Investigators assessed that Assadi brought the explosives for the plot with him on a commercial flight to Austria from Iran, according to a document by Belgium's federal prosecutor seen by Reuters. 
""The evidence is overwhelming about the role of the Iranian regime's senior leadership in the terrorist plot,"" said Shahin Gobadi, a Paris-based spokesman for the opposition People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, which is part of the NCRI. 
A spokesman for Iran's Foreign Ministry told the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency on Jan. 24 that Assadi's diplomatic immunity from prosecution had been violated and that he was a victim of a Western trap.
'FALSE FLAG'
Authorities in Germany, who arrested Assadi on holiday there, said his immunity as third counsellor at Iran's embassy in Vienna did not apply outside Austria and extradited him to Belgium, where a court ordered his detention. 
Two of Assadi's suspected accomplices were arrested in Belgium with the explosives and a detonator, prosecutors said. 
The Islamic Republic has repeatedly dismissed the charges,calling the attack allegations a ""false flag"" stunt by the NCRI,which it considers a terrorist group.
Assadi warned authorities in March of possible retaliationby unidentified groups if he is found guilty, according to apolice document obtained by Reuters.
Since the accord between Iran and world powers tocurb Tehran's nuclear programme, the EU has sought closer diplomatic and economic relations with Tehran, but saysit cannot turn a blind eye to human rights abuses or terrorism. 
Asked by the European Parliament on Jan. 25 if the trial had any bearing on relations with Iran, or if the EU had discussed Assadi's warnings of possible retaliation, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell declined to comment. 
European countries have blamed Iran for other suspectedmoves against dissidents, including two killings in theNetherlands in 2015 and 2017 and a foiled assassination inDenmark. The Islamic Republic has denied involvement.

Violence against human rights and environmental defenders, as well as community activists - known collectively in Colombia as social leaders - has become a major challenge for Duque's government, amid international criticism and demands more be done to stop the killings. 
""We want to keep strengthening our fight against the criminals that have been linked to these heinous crimes,"" Duque said following a meeting with Colombia's attorney general and other officials, including the prosecutor general and human rights ombudsman.
Duque did not offer a timeline or other details about the expanded military operations.
Officials have agreed to speed up the strengthening of the military's operational capacity across the country, as well as that of the attorney general's office, Duque said.
Duque repeated accusations that leftist rebels of the National Liberation Army (ELN), dissidents from the demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who reject a 2016 peace deal, and criminal groups of former right-wing paramilitaries are behind the attacks, as they seek territorial control for drug trafficking and illegal mining. 
The president did not give official figures about the number of social leaders killed in 2020, which vary widely depending on the source. 
The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights last year reported it had received information concerning 133 killings of human rights defenders, higher than the 117 cases reported in 2019.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee's vote on President Joe Biden's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has been delayed until Thursday, which could push her confirmation by the full Senate to next week or later.
Under committee rules, any member can delay the vote on a nominee until its next business meeting. The panel has scheduled another business meeting to consider Thomas-Greenfield's nomination for Thursday.
A committee aide said on Wednesday that Republican Senator Ted Cruz had asked for the delay because of Thomas-Greenfield's past remarks on China, including a speech the veteran diplomat gave in 2019 at a Confucius Institute, a center funded by the Chinese government at a U.S. university.
Cruz was among a few Republicans who questioned Thomas-Greenfield about the speech at her confirmation hearing.
Cruz later said on Twitter that he had slowed the nomination. ""China is the greatest geopolitical threat to our country,"" he wrote.
At her confirmation hearing last week Thomas-Greenfield stressed the importance of U.S. re-engagement with the 193-member United Nations in order to challenge efforts by China to ""drive an authoritarian agenda.""

Cruz, a vocal Biden critic, was a leader of a group of senators who objected to the certification of the Democratic president's election on Jan. 6, the day thousands of Donald Trump supporters attacked the Capitol building.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Opposition lawmakers booed Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday as he addressed a joint session of Congress to lay out his legislative priorities for the year.
Bolsonaro, who is facing criticism for his handling of the world's second-deadliest COVID-19 outbreak, said his government had earmarked enough funds to vaccinate Brazilians and the country would immediately acquire vaccines approved by its regulators.
Privatization of state companies, central bank independence, and administrative and tax reform were priorities of his government, he told Congress.
Bolsonaro also included in his priorities a planned ""federative pact"" reform bill that aims to revamp the financing ties between federal and local governments.
His agenda stands a good chance of passage after his allies took control of Congress on Monday in elections for the speakers of both chambers.
But as he began his address, opponents heckled the president. He replied: ""See you in 2022,"" in reference to next year's presidential election when he plans to seek a second term.
Arthur Lira, newly elected speaker for the lower house and member of the right-wing Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, said the country needs emergency measures to assist Brazilians hit by the pandemic, while observing fiscal responsibility in government spending.
Stipends paid last year to Brazilians who lost their livelihoods in the pandemic boosted Bolsonaro's popularity, but cost the Treasury more than 322 billion reais ($60 billion), a burden that has pushed government finances farther into the red.
The assistance program ended on Dec. 31 and lawmakers are looking for ways to extend it.

The newly-elected head of the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, of the center-right Democrats party, said the two leaders would meet with Bolsonaro's economic team to find a way to aid the needy without breaking a mandatory spending cap.

840,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 03:48PM ET</span>",Myanmar police file charges against Aung San Suu Kyi after coup,"(Reuters) - Myanmar police have filed charges against ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi for illegally importing communications equipment and she will be detained until Feb. 15 for investigations, according to a police document.
The move followed a military coup on Monday and the detention of Nobel Peace laureate Suu Kyi and other civilian politicians. The takeover cut short Myanmar's long transition to democracy and drew condemnation from the United States and other Western countries.
A police request to a court detailing the accusations against Suu Kyi, 75, said six walkie-talkie radios had been found in a search of her home in the capital Naypyidaw. The radios were imported illegally and used without permission, it said.
The document reviewed on Wednesday requested Suu Kyi's detention ""in order to question witnesses, request evidence and seek legal counsel after questioning the defendant"".
A separate document showed police filed charges against ousted President Win Myint for violating protocols to stop the spread of the coronavirus during campaigning for an election last November.
The charges against Suu Kyi ""just compound the undermining of the rule of law in Myanmar and the democratic process,"" United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Wednesday.
""We continue to call for her immediate release and the president's immediate release and all others who have been detained by the military in the last few days,"" he said.
Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won November's election in a landslide but the military, headed by Army chief General Min Aung Hlaing, claimed the vote was marred by fraud and justified its seizure of power on those grounds. The electoral commission had said the vote was fair.
The chair of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Parliamentarians for Human Rights, Charles Santiago, said the new charges were ludicrous.
""This is an absurd move by the junta to try to legitimize their illegal power grab,"" he said in a statement.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach the police, the government or the court for comment.
Suu Kyi spent about 15 years under house arrest between 1989 and 2010 as she led the country's democracy movement, and she remains hugely popular at home despite damage to her international reputation over the plight of Muslim Rohingya refugees in 2017.
The NLD made no immediate comment. A party official said on Tuesday he had learned she was under house arrest in the capital, Naypyidaw, and was in good health.
The party said its offices had been raided in several regions and it urged authorities to stop what it called unlawful acts after its election victory.
OPPOSITION EMERGES
Opposition to the junta has begun to emerge in Myanmar.
Staff at government hospitals across the country of 54 million people stopped work or wore red ribbons as part of a civil disobedience campaign.
The newly formed Myanmar Civil Disobedience Movement said doctors at 70 hospitals and medical departments in 30 towns had joined the protest. It accused the army of putting its interests above a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 3,100 people, one of the highest tolls in Southeast Asia.
""The first vaccines arrived in Myanmar only last week and the response to the COVID-19 pandemic must remain a priority for the foreseeable future,"" the U.N.'s Dujarric said. 
""We really cannot accept this,"" said 49-year-old Myo Myo Mon, who was among the doctors who stopped work to protest.
The junta has declared a one-year state of emergency and has promised to hold fair elections, but has not said when.
G7 CONDEMNS COUP
The Group of Seven largest developed economies condemned the coup on Wednesday and said the election result must be respected.
""We call upon the military to immediately end the state of emergency, restore power to the democratically-elected government, to release all those unjustly detained and to respect human rights and the rule of law,"" the G7 said in a statement.
China has not specifically condemned the coup in its neighbour but the foreign ministry rejected the suggestion that it supported or gave tacit consent to it.
""We wish that all sides in Myanmar can appropriately resolve their differences and uphold political and social stability,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a briefing.
On Tuesday, the United Nations special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, urged the Security Council to ""collectively send a clear signal in support of democracy in Myanmar"".
But a diplomat with China's U.N. mission said it would be difficult to reach consensus on the draft statement and that any action should avoid escalating tension or complicating the situation.
U.S. President Joe Biden has threatened to reimpose sanctions on the generals who seized power.

The military had ruled the former British colony from 1962 until Suu Kyi's party came to power in 2015 under a constitution that guarantees the generals a major role in government.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday his government would not allow month-long demonstrations at a Turkish university to grow into anti-government protests similar to those in 2013, calling the protesters ""terrorists"". 
Defying a government ban on demonstrations, students and teachers at Istanbul's Bogazici University have protested Erdogan's appointment of Melih Bulu, an academic and former political candidate, as rector. 
They say the process was undemocratic and want him to resign, causing a nationwide debate over the government's reach and separate protests elsewhere. More than 250 people were detained in Istanbul this week and 69 others in Ankara. 
The unrest marks some of the largest demonstrations since 2013 when hundreds of thousands of people marched against government plans to build replica Ottoman barracks in Istanbul's Gezi Park. 
""This country will not be run by terrorists. We will do whatever is needed to prevent this,"" Erdogan told members of his ruling AK Party. He said young protestors lack Turkey's ""national and spiritual values"" and are members of terrorist groups.
""Are you students or terrorists trying to raid the rector's room?"" Erdogan said. ""This country will not again live a Gezi event in Taksim, will not allow it. We have not stood with terrorists and we will not."" 
Bulu said earlier he would not step down despite growing calls. ""I am never thinking about resigning,"" Turkish media quoted him as telling reporters. 
The main opposition party leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, has called for Bulu's resignation. Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas urged Bulu in an open letter to ""sacrifice"" his position instead of ""academic peace, youth and our future"".
Bulu, who once applied to the AK Party to run for parliament, told broadcaster HaberTurk the ""crisis will be totally finished within six months."" 
On Tuesday, academics again gathered on the Bogazici campus with their backs turned to the rector's building in protest and chanted ""Melih Bulu resign,"" carrying signs reading ""159,"" the number of those detained on Monday. 
Students have shared images on social media of a picture displayed at the university that mixed LGBT symbols and Islam's holiest site, the Kaaba shrine in Mecca. The picture was condemned by Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu.
Erdogan said ""there is no such thing"" as LGBT. ""This country is national and spiritual, and will continue to walk into the future as such,"" he said.
Furkan Dogramaci, 23, a Bogazici graduate last year, said a ""lynching campaign"" against the LGBT community was launched to thwart the protest's real aim. The government response aimed at ""dividing, separating us and ending this movement,"" he said. 
University student Enes Gozukucuk, 23, who was among protestors on Monday when police detained 51 people, said the protests were against Bulu's appointment not the government. 

""We could have solved these issues amongst ourselves in the school. There was no need for violence from government forces,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres pledged on Wednesday to mobilize enough international pressure on Myanmar's military ""to make sure that this coup fails"" as the U.N. Security Council tries to negotiate a statement on the crisis. 
The Myanmar army detained the country's leader Aung San Suu Kyi and others on Monday in response to ""election fraud"", handed power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing, and imposed a state of emergency for one year.
""We will do everything we can to mobilize all the key actors and international community to put enough pressure on Myanmar to make sure that this coup fails,"" Guterres said during an interview broadcast by The Washington Post. ""It is absolutely unacceptable after elections - elections that I believe took place normally - and after a large period of transition.""
The military takeover cut short Myanmar's long transition to democracy and drew condemnation from the United States and other Western countries.
The 15-member Security Council is negotiating a possible statement. The initial draft put forward by Britain condemned the coup, and called for the military to respect the rule of law and human rights and immediately release those detained. 
However, such statements have to be agreed by consensus and diplomats said the language would likely need to be softened to win the support of China and Russia, who have traditionally shielded Myanmar in the Security Council. 
Myanmar police have filed charges against Suu Kyi for illegally importing communications equipment, according to a police document reviewed on Wednesday.
""Aung San Suu Kyi - if we can accuse her of something - is that she was too close to the military, is that she protected too much the military, namely in relation to what has happened with the dramatic offensive of the military army against the Rohingyas,"" Guterres said. 
A 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine State sent more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing into Bangladesh, where they are still stranded in refugee camps. Guterres and Western states have accused the Myanmar military of ethnic cleansing, which it denies.
Guterres said all those detained by the military during the coup must be released and constitutional order restored. 

""I hope that it will be possible to make the military in Myanmar understand that this is not the way to rule the country and this is not the way to move forward,"" he said.

843,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 03:11PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. mulls using law designed to prosecute Mafia against Capitol rioters,"By Mark Hosenball and Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is considering whether to charge members of far-right groups involved in the deadly Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol under a federal law usually used against organized crime, according to two law enforcement sources.
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, enables prosecutors to combat certain ongoing racketeering crimes such as murder, kidnapping, bribery and money laundering. The 1970 statute provides for hefty criminal penalties including up to 20 years in prison and seizure of assets obtained illegally through a criminal enterprise.
The sources, a current law enforcement official and a former official who recently left the federal government, said using the RICO statute to charge people involved in the Capitol violence is being debated within the Justice Department, with no final decision made. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.
The siege by supporters of former President Donald Trump left five dead including a police officer. It is not yet clear if cases arising from it meet ""statutory elements"" necessary for a RICO charge, the former federal official said.
""This is something that is being mulled over in the halls of DOJ,"" the official added, using the department's initials.
President Joe Biden's administration has warned that domestic extremism is a growing threat following the Capitol rampage, a sharp departure from the way Trump regarded extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers. In a September pre-election debate with Biden, Trump told the Proud Boys to ""stand back and stand by.""
Justice Department spokeswoman Kristina Mastropasqua declined to comment about the potential use of the RICO statute beyond pointing to prior statements by the senior federal prosecutor for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, that he would charge people based on what the evidence showed.
Sherwin has said a wide range of criminal charges are being contemplated, including trespassing, assault and seditious conspiracy. 
The RICO law was crafted to help prosecutors convict top Mafia leaders who ordered others to commit crimes. RICO cases are complex, often take years to develop, and require approval from Justice Department leadership. 
""RICO was designed to address the Godfather - the person who doesn't get their hands bloody,"" said Jeffrey Grell, an attorney who specializes in RICO law. ""You would really only use RICO to go after the kingpins or the leaders.""
Prosecutors have used it against other violent groups, such as one led by Omar Abdel Rahman, known as the ""Blind Sheikh,"" who was convicted of plotting to bomb the United Nations and George Washington Bridge in New York.
More than 170 people have been charged in connection with the Capitol attack that interrupted the formal congressional certification of Biden's election victory over Trump and sent lawmakers into hiding for their own safety.
Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, tapped to become chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is advocating possible RICO charges. A Durbin spokesperson said, ""There are multiple statutes currently available for federal prosecutors to use to hold the perpetrators behind the Jan. 6 attack accountable, including RICO, and prosecutors should appropriately evaluate potential charges.""
'RACKETEERING ACTIVITY'
Obstructing an official government proceeding, the charge some Oath Keepers and Proud Boy members are currently facing, is considered a ""racketeering activity.""
Prosecutors in a RICO case would need to show that the far-right groups qualify as a ""criminal enterprise"" and that members of the enterprise engaged in a pattern of two or more related crimes beyond the Capitol riots.
That could mean looking at whether these groups engaged in similar actions at other events, such as the violent 2017 ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, or other violent activities such as storming state capitols.
""Whatever theory they're pursuing requires looking at the group and kind of zooming out so they can capture a pattern of racketeering activity more than just what happened on that day,"" said Kamal Ghali, an Atlanta attorney and former federal prosecutor.
In a RICO case, prosecutors must show a pattern of related racketeering crimes and a threat of continuing criminal conduct. 
A Washington grand jury last month indicted three Oath Keepers members on charges that they conspired to forcibly storm the Capitol. Two Proud Boys members were indicted on charges they conspired with others to obstruct law enforcement from protecting the Capitol. 
In a sworn statement, an FBI agent said Thomas Caldwell, a defendant in the Oath Keepers indictment, sent messages after the attack urging others to keep fighting.
""We need to do this at the local level,"" Caldwell was quoted by the FBI as saying. ""Lets storm the capitol in Ohio. Tell me when!""
Federal prosecutors in Ohio convinced a judge to detain Caldwell's co-defendant Donovan Crowl by citing recent writings by the group's leader Elmer Stewart Rhodes. After the riots, Rhodes urged members to begin organizing in ""friendly red"" counties - jurisdictions that lean Republican - saying the Biden administration represents an ""illegitimate regime.""

The three Oath Keepers have not yet entered pleas, though Caldwell has previously said in court that ""every single charge is false."" Rhodes did not respond to requests for comment.

The Scottish Green Party brought forward a motion calling on ministers to seek an ""unexplained wealth order"" (UWO) against Trump over his acquisition of the golf courses and resorts in north and west Scotland. It was defeated by a vote of 89 to 32.
The party's co-leader Patrick Harvie said there were longstanding concerns about Trump's financial conduct, describing the ex-president as ""an untrustworthy dishonest, racist, conspiracy theorist"" with whom Scotland should never have associated.
""Maybe some people think he should just go back to being the global joke that he was before he became a global threat,"" Harvie said. ""But people who abused political office, need to be held accountable."" 
Trump's son Eric, the executive vice president of The Trump Organization, said politicians should be focused on saving lives and reopening businesses. 
""Patrick Harvie is nothing more than a national embarrassment with his pathetic antics that only serve himself and his political agenda,"" Eric Trump said in a statement before the vote.
Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice minister, said Donald Trump was a ""deplorable individual"" but it was not for politicians to instigate such investigations. 
Britain introduced UWOs in 2018 to help authorities target the illicit wealth of foreign officials suspected of corruption and those involved in serious crimes. They merely compel an individual to explain the source of their wealth but can pave the way for authorities to seize assets.
Scottish ministers have the power to ask that a UWO be ordered by the Court of Session, Scotland's top civil court.
However, the orders have only been used sparingly by the National Crime Agency (NCA), which tackles serious crime, proving a legally difficult tool to wield.
""If we have evidence that there were illicit funds involved ... we could look at one,"" a spokesman for the NCA said regarding the possibility of it seeking a UWO against the former U.S. president.

The Trump Organization owns the Trump International Golf Links near Aberdeen and the Trump Turnberry resort south of Glasgow.

KABUL (Reuters) - Half of Afghans need humanitarian aid but rising violence is preventing deliveries, a senior European Union humanitarian official said on Wednesday, reiterating calls for a ceasefire between the Afghan government and the insurgent Taliban.
The European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarčič visited Kabul to announce the EU will provide 32 million euros ($38.5 million) for humanitarian projects in 2021.
""Increasing violence and conflict is the main cause for the humanitarian need in this country,"" he said. ""We very much hope and call for an immediate, unconditional and comprehensive ceasefire.""
Violence has risen in the war-torn nation, dashing hopes that a U.S.-brokered peace process in Doha would reduce conflict while the Afghan government and the Taliban negotiated a political settlement. 
Even during the usually subdued winter months, fighting has taken place around the country along with a wave of assassinations of government officials and civil society members.
On Wednesday a blast in Kabul killed a police officer, and unknown attackers killed a religious leader in the southern city of Kandahar and a judge in the eastern city of Jalalabad.
Lenarčič called on the government and the Taliban ""to understand that allowing for full and unimpeded humanitarian access is their obligation under humanitarian law.""
Lenarčič said that the amount of the EU's humanitarian aid could rise. Those funds are separate from the $12 billion over the next four years that foreign donors including the EU pledged in November.

848,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 12:40PM ET</span>","U.S., Russia extend last major arms control treaty despite disputes","By Arshad Mohammed and Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber
WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States and Russia said on Wednesday they had extended the New START arms control treaty for five years, preserving the last treaty limiting deployments of the world's two largest strategic nuclear arsenals.
The pact, due to expire on Friday, was extended to Feb. 5, 2026, despite bilateral disputes over Russia's jailing of poisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, alleged cyber hacking of U.S. government agencies and treatment of neighboring Ukraine.
The treaty, which first went into effect in 2011, limits the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads each and imposes restrictions on the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.
U.S. President Joe Biden, who was sworn in on Jan. 20, acted quickly to extend the treaty, after his predecessor Donald Trump tried in vain to tie it to three-way talks with China covering its far smaller arsenal. Critics saw Trump's efforts as a poison pill to kill the treaty.
Both Washington and Moscow cast the extension as a victory, saying it would provide stability and transparency on nuclear issues while acknowledging some of their disagreements.
""Even as we work with Russia to advance U.S. interests, so too will we work to hold Russia to account for adversarial actions as well as its human rights abuses,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
Biden has stressed holding Russia accountable for its treatment of Navalny, who was arrested on his Jan. 17 return from Germany, where he was recovering from his poisoning with a military-grade nerve agent. Navalny has blamed Russian state security agents for the poisoning, which the Kremlin has denied.
Navalny's arrest has sparked large protests in Russia that the government has sought to quell with mass arrests.
In a Jan. 26 call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden raised Navalny's case, as well as the cyber hack blamed on Russia that used U.S. tech company SolarWinds Corp as a springboard to penetrate U.S. government networks, and reports Russia offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill coalition forces in Afghanistan.
Moscow has denied involvement in the hack of SolarWinds and brushed off the bounties allegations.
The Russian foreign ministry said in a statement that the diplomatic notes needed to formally extend New START had been exchanged on Wednesday. A U.S. official confirmed the exchange.
The Russian statement did not address wider disputes, which include Washington's condemnation of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, but criticized the United States for pulling out of other arms control pacts.
""We expect that the (New START) understanding ... would allow (us) to leave behind the trend towards dismantling of arms control and nonproliferation mechanisms, so prevalent in recent years due to U.S. destructive policies,"" the ministry said.
Tom Collina of the Ploughshares Fund, which advocates the elimination of nuclear weapons, said he believes Biden would review U.S. nuclear weapons policy and consult European allies before talks with Russia on a follow-on agreement.
Russia's priority in any new accord would be dealing with the threat it sees to its long-range strategic nuclear arsenal from U.S. missile defenses, while Washington likely will seek to limit Moscow's vast short-range nuclear arsenal, Collina said.
Because China's nuclear arsenal is so much smaller, there is no reason to include Beijing in a New START follow-on accord, he said.

""The China issue is a red herring,"" he said. ""This is something that the Trump administration threw in there essentially to try to hide the fact that they weren't extending New START, and their excuse for not extending New START is that, 'Oh, it's China's fault.'""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said on Wednesday that Venezuelan funds controlled by the U.S. Treasury Department could be used to pay for coronavirus vaccines but that President Nicolas Maduro's government is refusing to cooperate.
The government has not accepted an implementation plan laid out by the Pan American Health Organization that would enable Venezuela to join the COVAX program, and has failed to fulfill a prior agreement regarding distribution of COVID-19 tests.
""The (problem) is not the funds, that's the dictatorship's propaganda to try to excuse itself and point fingers and confuse the whole world,"" Guaido said in a press conference.

In the country's second city Mandalay, the gesture was repeated by healthcare workers at a coronavirus treatment centre, some of whom held a banner that read: ""We support civil disobedience movement.""
Two senior members of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy posted pictures of themselves making the same gesture on social media following Monday's takeover by the military.
The salute - three fingers pointing up with palm away from the body - stems from the popular ""Hunger Games"" movies, based on Suzanne Collins' dystopian novels. But in recent years it has been adopted by protesters against authoritarian rule in Asia.
Popularised by Jennifer Lawrence's character, Katniss Everdeen, in the ""Hunger Games"" the gesture became a symbol of the revolution and rebellion against totalitarian rule in fictional nation Panem.
It began appearing on the streets in 2014, when it was seized on by protesters in Thailand as a tactic to defy a ban on public gatherings imposed after a coup in May.
Later that year, young pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong also adopted the salute in their campaign for fully democratic elections.

The salute was widely seen again in Thailand - which shares a border with Myanmar and where many migrants from Myanmar work - last year, during months of protests calling for the removal of the government led by the 2014 coup leader and reforms to the monarchy.

Moore, who raised tens of millions of pounds for the National Health Service by walking up and down his garden, leaning on a frame, died on Tuesday in Bedford Hospital after suffering pneumonia and COVID-19. He had been fighting cancer for 5 years.
After parliament held a minute of silence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Britons later on Wednesday to clap for Moore and the health workers he raised funds for to ""show our appreciation of him and all that he stood for and believed in"".
Outside his home in Marston Moretaine, 50 miles (80 km) north of London, children laid flowers. One message read: ""Rest in Peace Captain Tom. We love you. X."" 
""You will always be our hero,"" read another message. ""Thank you for your warmth and your wonderful smile. Rest in Peace.""
His picture was shown on Piccadilly Circus in central London while the London Eye, Wembley Stadium and the Blackpool Tower shone lights of honour.
Condolences poured in from Queen Elizabeth II, Johnson and even the White House while soccer players, school children and his family shed tears for a man who millions consider a lockdown hero.
Amid the death and gloom of the COVID-19 pandemic, war veteran Moore's wit and inspiration struck a chord with millions.
""For all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment: the sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away,"" said Moore, dressed in a blazer and tie and displaying his war medals, after completing his walk in April.
Raised in Yorkshire, northern England, Moore served in India, Burma and Sumatra during World War Two. Always polite and dapper in public, Moore had a mischievous humour.
When asked about speculation he would be knighted by the queen, he quipped that he would find it funny to be known as ""Sir Thomas Moore"" - a reference to the beheaded Tudor statesman.
He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth at a ceremony at Windsor Castle. 
""Her Majesty very much enjoyed meeting Captain Sir Tom and his family at Windsor last year,"" Buckingham Palace said. ""Her thoughts and those of the Royal Family are with them.""
While Moore exuded modesty, his fame was global: CNN ran a banner headline about his death during the news, Russia news broadcasts reported that ""Tom Moore died like a real soldier"" and his death was reported across Asia.
The United Kingdom has the world's fifth worst official COVID-19 death toll - currently at 108,013 - but Moore brought hope to many. 
""Whilst he'd been in so many hearts for just a short time, he was an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay alive in our hearts forever,"" his daughters said.
Health Minister Matt Hancock told BBC television: ""We should find a way to make sure that we mark the memory of Captain Tom and thank him for the contribution that he made for the NHS (health service).

""He touched the heart of the nation and we should remember that.""

The Pentagon has put countering China and Russia at the centre of its strategy since 2018, even though U.S. defence spending outstrips that of Moscow and Beijing.
In 2018, China and Russia held their largest-ever joint military exercises, featuring 300,000 Russian troops.
And in 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping oversaw the launch of a three-decade pipeline project to transport natural gas from Siberia to northeast China.
Tod Wolters, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, or SACEUR, told reporters that the growing cooperation ""really does suggest an emergence of a partnership of convenience"".
He said the partnership was intended to advance mutual interests, ""and that advancement could be to the detriment of Europe and corresponding and surrounding nations"".
NATO accuses Russia of trying to destabilise the West with new nuclear weapons, cyber attacks and covert action. The European Union, many of whose states are members of NATO, sees China as a rival for influence as well as a trading partner.
Historically, relations between Russia and China, who share a land border of over 4,200 km (2,600 miles) have been marked by distrust, with Russian nationalists warning of encroaching Chinese influence in Russia's mineral-rich far east.
But Russia pivoted towards China after being punished with Western sanctions for its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.

""We are ever so vigilant with respect to that growing cooperation,"" Wolters said.

MANACAPURU, Brazil (Reuters) - Health workers sped along the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) river this week to start vaccinating riverside communities, bringing hope to a region hard hit by COVID-19 and now facing a lethal surge driven by a new Brazilian variant of coronavirus. 
Wearing protective masks and gowns, they traveled by open motorboat from Manacapuru, a town two hours from the jungle city of Manaus, where hospitals ran out of beds and oxygen last month and cemeteries could not dig graves fast enough to deal with Brazil's highest death rate. 
""I am happy you've come. We have lost so many old people and young ones too,"" said 83-year-old Maria Araujo after receiving a dose of a British vaccine made by India's Serum Institute. 
""This has given us hope that things will change, they will improve,"" she said.Brazil is scrambling to get access to more vaccines to fight the world's most deadly coronavirus outbreak outside the United States. So far, it has vaccinated 2 million people, mostly health workers and elderly Brazilians, with vaccines made by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc. 
More than 9.2 million Brazilians have been infected by the virus and 225,000 have died. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi) In Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state with 2.1 million inhabitants, more than 5,500 have died, or 261 per 100,000, the highest rate in Brazil, according to Health Ministry data. 
Researchers say the aggressive surge in Manaus is largely due to a new variant of the virus discovered there, called P1, which has quickly become the dominant variant, leading scientists to believe it is more contagious.Genome sequencing indicates that 91% of new COVID-19 cases in January in Amazonas state involved the new variant, said Felipe Naveca, a virologist at the ILMD/Fiocruz Amazônia biomedical research center. That is up from 51% of cases sequenced in December and none in November. 

The variant was first detected early last month on four travelers who arrived in Japan coming from the Amazon. Scientists have not yet determined whether P1, derived from the B.1.1.28 lineage of SARS-CoV-2, is more lethal than earlier variants. Naveca said it clearly spreads faster, although cases also increased due to less social distancing over the holiday season.

A majority of a panel of 16 judges found that the International Court of Justice, also known as the World Court, has jurisdiction in the dispute.
Iran brought the case in 2018 after President Donald Trump's administration reimposed sanctions, following Trump's decision to abandon a 2015 pact under which Iran accepted curbs to its nuclear programme. 
New U.S. President Joe Biden has said he wants to return to that pact, although Tehran and Washington have yet to agree on the steps needed for that to happen.
The United States had tried to argue that Iran could not base claims at the World Court on a 1955 bilateral friendship pact. However judges found the treaty, signed decades before Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution and the sharp deterioration in ties with Washington, could be used as a basis for the court's jurisdiction.
""The court unanimously rejects the preliminary objections to its jurisdiction raised by the Unites States of America according to which the subject matter of the dispute does not relate to the interpretation or application of the Treaty of Amity,"" presiding judge Abdulqawi Yusuf said.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter that the ruling was ""another legal victory for Iran following 3 Oct. '18 Order"".
""Iran has always fully respected int'l law. High time for the US to live up to int'l obligations,"" Zarif tweeted, in a clear reference to Tehran's call on Biden administration to return to the nuclear pact and lift U.S. sanctions.
Other U.S. objections to the case were also dismissed, meaning Iran's claim will move on to a hearing on the merits. A final decision would be likely to take several more years. 

The ICJ’s rulings are binding, but it has no power to enforce them, and the United States and Iran are among a handful of countries to have ignored its decisions.

855,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 11:06AM ET</span>",Crossing the COVID chasm between Israel and the Palestinian Territories,"By Zainah El-Haroun and Adel Abu Nimeh
JERICHO, West Bank (Reuters) - As a Palestinian living in Jerusalem, Ismail Daiq is used to negotiating the dividing lines between communities: the daily commute to his Jordan Valley date farm involves crossing a checkpoint on his way home.
Now the coronavirus pandemic has created another faultline for him to navigate: the stark difference between access to vaccines in Israel and in the Palestinian territories.
Living within the Israeli health system, Daiq, 62, has already received his second COVID-19 vaccination in a country that is a leader in the world's inoculation drive.
But his Palestinian siblings and 95-year-old mother in Jericho are still awaiting a vaccine rollout that has only just begun under the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited sovereignty in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Daiq is eligible for vaccination because he became a Jerusalem resident two decades ago when he married a woman from the city.
The rest of his family, friends and employees do not qualify, because they only have West Bank identity papers that do not let them pass through the Israeli checkpoints that control entry to the city.
So when the date farmer travels each day into the Palestinian territories, he is uncomfortably aware that while he feels safe, his loved ones are still at risk from the virus.
""I feel guilty, I feel very sad, because I want all my family safe,"" Daiq told Reuters.
""When you see that you can get these services, the vaccination, and all of the family, they can't get this vaccination, you feel that there is a difference between you and your family.""
Although Israel and the Palestinian Authority coordinate on security issues, political relations have foundered. Negotiations last broke down in 2014.
In January, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry accused Israel of ignoring its duties as an occupying power by not including Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in their inoculation programme.
Israeli officials have said that this is the job of the Palestinian authorities.
""If it is the responsibility of the Israeli health minister to take care of the Palestinians, what exactly is the responsibility of the Palestinian health minister?"" Israeli Health Minister Yuli Edelstein told the BBC last month.
While Israel has so far vaccinated a third of its 9 million citizens, the Palestinian Authority received its first batch of 2,000 vaccines - supplied by Israel - on Monday. West Bank health workers received the first shots.
Daiq said he tried to avoid the subject with his family, because his mother kept asking him when she would be inoculated.
His brother Ibrahim, 60, said that he wished good health to ""every person on this land"" but that there was a sense of unfairness among Palestinians.
""Because of this, my natural rights as a human being, me and the rest of the people living in the West Bank and Gaza, considering we are a country living under occupation, we should also have the right to benefit from this vaccination.""

The West Bank, where 3.1 million Palestinians live, has reported 101,221 coronavirus cases, with 1,271 deaths. Gaza, with a population of two million, has registered more than 51,000 cases with 523 deaths. Israel has reported 663,665 coronavirus cases and 4,888 deaths. [L1N2K90YQ]

LONDON (Reuters) - Surrounded by lipstick and eye-shadow, Aisha Quashie brushes her cheek with foundation as she mirrors makeup artist Laura Hunt thousands of miles away in London.
The 39-year-old, who finished treatment for lymphoma in March, is doing a private online makeup tutorial while shielding at her Mississauga, Ontario home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""When you're going through something like cancer, you tend to stay away regardless, because sometimes you're not feeling well,"" Quashie told Reuters. 
""But that additional isolation, just it makes it even that much harder not being able to see family (and) friends. It's definitely tough mentally.""
For some 30 years, international charity Look Good Feel Better has organised workshops for people living with cancer, giving advice on how to deal with treatment side-effects like dry skin and hair loss.
While group sessions took place at hospitals and cancer support centres around the world, these moved online last year. People living with cancer are considered at higher risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19.
Dee Diaz, president and CEO of Look Good Feel Better Canada, said it now offered two one-hour skin and haircare workshops with groups of six to 12 women.
""What's hard is sometimes that connectivity and now women, when they join, have the option of not turning on their camera,"" she said.
""Although ... within the first 10 minutes, the cameras start coming on because they start to feel comfortable, less vulnerable because they are amongst others who are facing the same challenges.""
For her tutorial, Quashie received the same kit as Hunt, who talked her through techniques. 
Cancer charities say the pandemic has made it more difficult for patients to reach out to support organisations, themselves facing funding cuts in the past year, according to the Union for International Cancer Control, which leads the World Cancer Day initiative held annually on Feb. 4. 
Look Good Feel Better UK, which also offers male grooming workshops, says it reached 4,500 people last year through mostly online sessions and will continue to do so for those living in remote areas. 
Briton Bev Francis-Green, who was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia in 2004, takes oral chemotherapy daily. She and her husband, a delivery driver, use different bathrooms and eat their meals separately to protect her from COVID-19 risks.
""I wouldn't ask my consultant about my skin going dry because he might view it as vanity,"" said Francis-Green, who did a workshop in May before her birthday.
""I'm 57 and I've never had a makeup lesson ... It was just something that was a little bit of nicety out of the whole of the doom and gloom.""

Two Lebanese security sources said Lebanon's Hezbollah armed movement fired at the drone. One of the sources said the missile did not hit the aircraft, which then returned across the border. 
Witnesses said they heard the sound of an explosion. Local channel NBN had said earlier that a drone blew up. 
Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has a dominant presence in the south near the border, has vowed to bring down Israeli drones breaching Lebanese airspace. The two neighbouring enemies last fought a month-long war in 2006.
Earlier this week, Hezbollah said it had brought down an Israeli drone, while Israel's military said the aircraft had fallen inside Lebanon. 
Lebanon's government regularly files complaints to the United Nations against Israeli drones and jets that often fly into Lebanon.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - War crimes judges on Thursday deliver their verdict in the case of Dominic Ongwen, a Ugandan child soldier turned top commander in the Lord's Resistance Army, a rebel group known for extreme violence and forcing women into sexual slavery.
Ongwen, 45, faces 70 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity and could be imprisoned for life if convicted. Judges will not address sentencing on Thursday.
The ruling at the International Criminal Court will be the first dealing with crimes by the LRA, New York-based Human Rights Watch said. 
It highlights the difficulty of trying somebody who, as a conscripted child soldier, is both an alleged perpetrator and a victim. His lawyers have asked for acquittal.
Led by fugitive warlord Joseph Kony, the LRA terrorized Ugandans for nearly two decades as it battled the government of President Yoweri Museveni from bases in the north of the country and in what is now South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic.
The case at the ICC focused on 2002-2005, when prosecutors said members of the LRA carried out crimes including murder, rape, sexual slavery, forced marriage, torture, pillaging and the conscription of children under the age of 15 for fighting.
After being abducted by the LRA as a boy, Ongwen worked his way up to a commander, overseeing the Sinia Brigade, one of the group's four main operational units with up to 800 fighters.
Detained in 2015, he remains in the court's custody. His 3.5-year-trial ended in March 2020.
Ongwen's lawyer says the brutal life in the LRA affected his mental health and his capacity to make independent decisions.
""When Ongwen was abducted he had no option, he was made a slave. That slavery continued until he left the bush,"" lawyer Krispus Odongo told judges in closing arguments.
But prosecutors countered that Ongwen was an adult at the time of the alleged offences and cannot be excused of responsibility.
Ongwen's case is extremely complex because under the law ""you have either a victim or a perpetrator and anything in between is very difficult to squeeze in,"" said Barbora Hola, senior researcher at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement.

In 2004, the Ugandan government referred the conflict with the LRA to the ICC, the world's first permanent tribunal for war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.

KANDELA, India (Reuters) - Indian farmers' leaders on Wednesday outlined plans to scale up months of protests against agricultural reforms, as their cause gained high-profile supporters in the West.
Demanding the repeal of three new farm laws that they say will hurt them to the benefit of large corporations, tens of thousands of farmers have been camped on the outskirts of Delhi since late 2020.
Their generally peaceful protest was marred by violence last week, when some demonstrators drove a procession of tractors into the heart of the capital and clashed with police.
Police have since erected barricades around three main protest sites and shut off the internet in some areas.
Farmers' leaders, speaking hours after U.S. pop superstar Rihanna weighed into the row in a posting to her 101 million Twitter followers, said they would not back down.
""This gathering shows the anger against the government and we will continue our fight,"" union leader Rakesh Tikait told a 50,000-strong rally of the politically influential Jat community in northern Haryana state.
He and other leaders said they would send more farmers to the Delhi protest sites and hold similar meetings across the country to gather further support.
Rakesh Singh Vidhuri, a farmer from the neighbouring state of Punjab, the epicentre of the protests, who attended Wednesday's meeting, said the movement was bringing together growers from across India's northern breadbasket region.
""The protests have spread because these laws will impact the livelihood of farmers and Indian agriculture overall,"" he told Reuters.
GLOBAL FOCUS
The farmers say the reforms, which will allow big retailers to buy directly from growers, will mean the end of long-standing guaranteed prices for their crops and leave them vulnerable to the whims of big business.
The government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has offered some concessions but ruled out abandoning them, says they will benefit farmers and draw investment to a sector that makes up nearly 15% of India's $2.9 trillion economy and employs about half its workforce.
The protests drew global attention as prominent Western activists echoed Rihanna's support for the farmers' campaign.
""We ALL should be outraged by India's internet shutdowns and paramilitary violence against farmer protesters,"" U.S. lawyer and activist Meena Harris, a niece of Vice-President Kamala Harris, said on Twitter.
Greta Thunberg shared a news report about the internet shutdowns. ""We stand in solidarity with the #FarmersProtest in India,"" the Swedish climate activist wrote on Twitter.
Hours earlier, Rihanna had shared a CNN article on the demonstrations and asked her Twitter followers under the same hashtag: ""Why aren’t we talking about this?!""
The foreign ministry labelled the comments ""neither accurate nor responsible"".
""A very small section of farmers"" had issues with the new laws and some groups had tried to mobilise international support against India.

""Before rushing to comment on such matters, we would urge that the facts be ascertained, and a proper understanding of the issues at hand be undertaken,"" the ministry said.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 08:55AM ET</span>","Russia accuses West of Navalny hysteria, Kremlin backs tough protest policing","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia accused the West on Wednesday of descending into hysteria over the jailing of opposition politician Alexei Navalny, and the Kremlin said police had been right to use force to break up protests over his imprisonment.
A Moscow court on Tuesday sentenced the prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin to three and a half years for parole violations he said were trumped up to sideline him, ignoring calls from the West and protesters at home to release him. 
Navalny's supporters tried to gather to show support during the ruling and then took to the streets afterwards to protest it, prompting authorities to shut down some central metro stations and detain more than 1,400 people, according to a protest monitor. 
Navalny's allies accuse the police of essentially outlawing public protest and of using disproportionate force and violence to break up rallies.
The Kremlin said the police's response late on Tuesday had been justified because the protests were illegal and unauthorised. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Navalny's allies of deliberately provoking the police by calling protests near the Kremlin following the Navalny ruling. 
""The police reaction was due to the threats that could have arisen from staging such a protest,"" he told reporters on a conference call. ""The provocations comprise of the fact that there were calls yesterday for unsanctioned protests."" 
""In recent days we've encountered calls for illegal protests several times and measures are taken to prevent them from leading to... worse consequences, he added.
Navalny's allies have circulated footage of scenes they say show police violence, including one clip in which a riot police officer strikes a cameraman with a truncheon, flooring him. 
Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said the incident was the subject of an internal investigation. 
The West has called on Moscow to release Navalny, but Russia has told it stay out of its sovereign affairs.

""The hysteria we've heard over the legal process for the Navalny case is of course off the scale,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.

The mountainous Moghila area, near the impoverished city of Kasserine, is home to an Islamist militant group that the Tunisian army has been fighting for years. 
Tunisia faces a small but persistent militant threat, foreign diplomats focused on security say. 
As well as jihadist cells holed up in remote mountain regions, who have not made successful forays beyond their strongholds in recent years, there is also a threat from militants radicalised online. 
Last year militants tried to attack the U.S. embassy in Tunis, killing a policeman at a security point with a suicide vest, and months later stabbed two security officers in a knife attack in the city of Sousse. 
In October, a young Tunisian migrant arrived in France and immediately killed three people in a church.

Colombia's tax and customs police (POLFA) had on Tuesday heralded the late-January seizure of five Anderson AM-15 rifles of U.S. origin and five magazines of 5.56 caliber ammunition and the capture of two suspects, saying it was investigating whether the final destination was Venezuela.
However, a police source familiar with the matter told Reuters that the guns and ammunition were headed across Colombia's porous land border with Venezuela to the ELN.
""The information we have as a result of investigations, the seizure of the weapons, and the arrests is that the weapons were destined for guerrillas from the National Liberation Army who are sheltering in Venezuela,"" the source said. 
A second police source also confirmed the arms were destined for the ELN in Venezuela.
The late January seizure was sparked by an earlier discovery of six other AM-15 rifles and seven magazines during the routine traffic stop of a truck traveling from the capital Bogota to Riohacha in the northeast, not far from the Venezuelan border.
After that discovery POLFA and Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement, carried out searches in Riohacha and detained two people. 
One of them, an elderly woman and the mother of the second suspect, was determined to have been unaware of the shipment. Her son had used his mother's name on shipping documents to avoid detection and told police all the weapons and ammunition were destined for the ELN. 
Colombia has long accused Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro of sheltering ELN guerrillas, including a top commander known by his nom de guerre of Pablito. 
The group has some 2,450 combatants and is known for being less centrally controlled than previous Colombian rebel groups.
The Venezuelan government was not immediately available to respond to questions sent by Reuters.

TRIPOLI, Lebanon (Reuters) - Lebanon's poorest city, Tripoli, was again racked by violent protests last week, and some politicians and experts warn that unrest could spread if more is not done to support people facing deepening poverty amid coronavirus restrictions.
The country was already in financial meltdown before the pandemic struck, with national debt spiralling, unemployment high and a tumbling currency stoking inflation.
For residents of Tripoli, on Lebanon's northern coast, the 24-hour curfew imposed from Jan. 11 to control the spread of COVID-19 was the final straw, preventing many from working.
""We are headed towards famine,"" said Haytham Kurdi, a 49-year-old fish kiosk owner in the city.
""The fish that we get is $3. That used to mean 4,500 pounds and we used to sell for 6,000 so we make a dollar profit. Now $3 is around 25,000 pounds and someone who earns 30,000 to 40,000 pounds a day, how can they buy a couple of kilos of fish?""
Protests last week culminated in the burning of Tripoli's municipality building as demonstrators clashed with police. 
""There is practically a total absence of government action, so the situation in Tripoli is ... worrisome and it reflects an extreme form of what is happening elsewhere in the country,"" said Toufic Gaspard, an economist who has worked as an adviser at the IMF and to a former finance minister.
If subsidies on basic foodstuffs like bread are eased because of dwindling reserves and dollar shortages, more Lebanese will feel the pinch.
Nationwide protests erupted in October 2019, amid financial meltdown, bringing cities including the capital Beirut to a standstill as tens of thousands of people vented their anger at politicians they blamed for ineptitude and graft.
Today, roughly half of the workforce relies on daily wages mostly paid in local currency, and a recent study by aid organization CARE found that 94% of Lebanon's population are earning less then the minimum wage.
""Should subsidies be lifted, the scene from Tripoli will be repeated everywhere,"" MP Faisal Karameh told local media.
MACRON FRUSTRATED
France's Emmanuel Macron is leading efforts to unlock foreign aid to help Lebanon out of its crisis.
But the initiative has been hampered by political paralysis in Lebanon, which has been unable to form a new government since the last one quit in the aftermath of an Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion that destroyed large parts of the city.
The caretaker government said it was giving 230,000 of the poorest families 400,000 liras a month, or less than $50 at the market rate, to help them make ends meet. Lebanon has a population of around 6 million. 
Many are still falling through the cracks.
""If you walk down the street you will see people looking through garbage for something to eat,"" said Bilal Tasieh, a 46-year-old carpenter from Tripoli.
A government decision to close supermarkets and grocery shops during lockdown, making daily essentials only available through delivery services, has drawn criticism.

""If I am poor then delivery is out of the question for me, it costs 10 to 15% more,"" said Nasser Saidi, a leading economist and former minister.

864,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>","As Poland's Church embraces politics, Catholics depart","By Justyna Pawlak and Alicja Ptak
WARSAW (Reuters) - Katarzyna Lipka is no longer Catholic, and she says that is a political statement.
Like most Poles, the 35-year-old has marked life's milestones in the Church, a beacon of freedom in Communist times. Also like many, she'd been drifting away. In November, after the country's courts decreed a clampdown on abortion that the bishops had lobbied for, she filed papers to cut loose.
""I used to think being passive was enough - I just didn't take part,"" Lipka told Reuters, curled up in an armchair in her apartment. ""But I decided to speak up."" 
For Lipka, abortion is only part of the problem. Her main concern is one many Poles, particularly young people on social media, often complain of: The Church's increasing reach into other areas of life. 
""I want - and I think all those who are leaving the Church now want - to voice our objection to what is happening now. To influence politics, our rights,"" she said, adding that the Church was being allowed to have too much influence in areas such as politics, state spending and education.
Young adults in many countries are becoming less religious, according to research by the Pew Center. In Poland, a growing number of its 32 million Catholics are turning away. In 1989 when Communist rule ended, nearly 90% of Poles approved of the Church, according to the state-affiliated CBOS opinion poll. That figure is now 41% - the lowest since 1993.
The relationship between Church and state in Poland is governed by an agreement signed by Warsaw and the Holy See from 1993 that says they are independent and autonomous.
In reality, Poles see an increasingly explicit connection.
For example, priests have displayed election posters on parish property or discussed elections during mass - almost always in favour of the governing party - in more than 140 cases over the last five years, according to a Reuters tally of archived local media reports. During that time Poland has held five elections.
""What I don't like in the Church is that it turns places of worship into a political bazaar, where my rights are being traded,"" Lipka said.
The Polish Bishops' Conference, which represents the Church in the country, declined to comment on the role of the clergy in political campaigning. 
The government said it remained impartial towards religious belief and protected freedom of religion. ""The relationship between the state and the Church as well as other religious organisations is based on respecting their autonomy and mutual independence ... as well as cooperation for the common good,"" it said in an emailed statement.
APOSTASY
In October, Poland's Constitutional Tribunal ruled that women should be prohibited from aborting a foetus with abnormalities, a ruling the government enforced on Jan. 27. About 1,000 pregnancies have been terminated legally each year in Poland, most due to foetal problems.
The Church considers all abortion to be murder. It says it was not involved in the court decision and government officials also told Reuters the Church had not influenced it. But in mass protests that followed, tens of thousands of people blocked roads and city centres carrying banners with slogans like ""Get your rosaries off my ovaries.""
Church officials stopped collating data on defections in 2010 so there is no nationwide total. In Warsaw, more people filed to quit last November than in all of 2019. The 577 acts of apostasy - the formal process of leaving the Church - booked between January and mid-December were nearly double the 2019 figure.
After the abortion ruling, Polish Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches for 'apostasy' jumped to their highest since counting began in 2004. Thousands signed up for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pages advising the documents needed, which include recent proof of baptism obtained from the parish where the ceremony took place. A website offering documentation, www.apostazja.eu, has had more than 30,000 downloads, its founder says.
""Whatever the reason, this is dramatic,"" archbishop Grzegorz Rys, one of the most senior clerics in Poland, told Reuters.
Given the scale of revolt, he believes many are quitting in protest at what they see as increasingly tight bonds between the Church and the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party. The party's ratings in most opinion polls have slipped to around 30% from more than 40% last August.
""SPECIAL MERITS""
The Catholic Church is at Poland's core. According to Church data, 88% of children attend catechism classes in state-run schools.
In the 1980s, the Church was a voice of freedom: Pope John Paul II earned iconic status for inspiring people to stand up against Communist rule. Parish priests sheltered anti-government activists and helped distribute food and underground newspapers.
After Communism fell, the clergy pushed for a return to conservative Catholic values and in 1993, when Poland introduced new curbs on abortion, Church approval ratings fell below 40%. They have since recovered but never above 75%. 
Over the next few years, as Poland introduced market reforms and joined the European Union, poorer, less educated voters felt left behind - a trend PiS promised to reverse when it came to power in 2015. 
The party, whose strongest support is among older, rural voters, has spent millions of euros on Church-run projects, government documents show. PiS has overhauled a number of institutions, including the Constitutional Court, in reforms that the European Union says have increased political influence on the legal system. PiS disputes that. 
The party sees the Church and Polish national identity as one. Ryszard Czarnecki, a senior lawmaker for PiS, says that while the party and the clergy should be seen as independent, the Church's role in ""preserving national identity"" is undeniable.
""Poland has its specificity and the Church has its special merits here,"" he told Reuters. 
MORAL TEACHINGS
For PiS, the Church is a repository of Poland's moral teaching: ""The only alternative ... is nihilism,"" it said in a 2019 election campaign programme.
Public TV, run by a former PiS politician, runs nearly nine hours of Catholic programming a week, including church service broadcasts. 
Church symbolism reaches deep into Poland's political life. In 2015, a group of lawmakers from across the political spectrum placed a vial of blood from the late John Paul II - born in Poland and declared a saint in 2014 - in the chapel of the House of Parliament.
Last December, parliament added another relic - a strand of beard hair purportedly belonging to a monk killed in a Nazi German concentration camp. The monk, Saint Maximilian Maria Kolbe, was canonized in 1982 for volunteering to die in place of another prisoner. 
Elzbieta Witek, the PiS-appointed parliament speaker, ceremonially received the relic for the house. She declined to comment for this story.
PiS fuses piety and nationalism to the point where a central banker nominated and chosen by the party has published his views on moral topics. 
Eryk Lon wrote a piece about interest rates in 2019 in which he urged the faithful to pray for the ""evil spirit of cosmopolitanism"" to be eradicated from universities, particularly from business schools. He did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Same-sex marriage is illegal in Poland and senior Church officials have supported a government crackdown on LGBT rights. One archbishop, Marek Jedraszewski, warned in 2019 against a ""rainbow plague"" spreading through the nation. He did not respond to a request for comment. 
Lipka feels it is inappropriate to hold up the Church as a moral beacon. She said she was particularly repulsed by a report from the Vatican in November that said John Paul II had promoted ex-U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick despite rumours of his sexual misconduct. McCarrick has declined to comment on the report. 
""AFRAID OF THE NEW""
Sebastian Duda, a theologian and a Catholic journalist, says Poland's court ruling on abortion brought to light how far faith has eroded - a trend that he thinks has accelerated because of ""the evident marriage between PiS and the Church,"" which he said is unacceptable for many.
Some priests, such as Pawel Batory from the southern city of Rzeszow, a PiS heartland, say it's time for the clergy to retreat from politics.
Batory, who was among more than 150 priests and nuns who issued a public appeal in October for more separation of Church and State, complains about election campaigning in places of worship.
Lipka says she believes popular opinion in the country as a whole is slowly turning away from conservative Catholicism.
Even her mother, a devout Catholic, agrees with some of her reasoning, she said, but worries about what funeral rites her daughter can expect.

""My mother doesn't know any funerals other than Catholic ones,"" said Lipka. ""And she is afraid of the new.""

865,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 05:50AM ET</span>",South Korea urges U.S. flexibility on sanctions to restart North Korea talks,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States should flexibly enforce sanctions aimed at curbing Pyongyang's nuclear programmes to revive denuclearisation talks, South Korea's point man on North Korea said on Wednesday.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula at their first summit in 2018, but a second summit and subsequent working-level talks fell apart.
The new administration of President Joe Biden has not announced any North Korea policy, but Seoul, keen to resuscitate stalled cross-border economic cooperation, has expressed hopes that Biden would restart negotiations with Pyongyang.
Lee In-young, South Korea's unification minister in charge of inter-Korean affairs, said reinforcing sanctions may not be the key to bringing North Korea back to the table.
""If we were to talk about additional sanctions, it's time to review what achievements the sanctions have brought so far. Strengthening it might not be everything,"" Lee told a news conference.
""We have to look back at the aspect that flexibly applying sanctions depending on the situation could play a role in expediting denuclearisation negotiations.""
Lee's remarks came after South Korea's President Moon Jae-in urged Biden to build on progress made by Kim and Trump. Last week, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told Reuters that Pyongyang and Washington should seek an initial deal including a halt to the North's nuclear activity and a cut in its programme in exchange for some sanctions relief.
Lee did not elaborate on which sanctions should be loosened, but has called for exemptions to allow humanitarian inter-Korean exchanges, including providing assistance to help the North fight the coronavirus.
North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus cases, though South Korean authorities have expressed doubt, and rejected Seoul's aid offer.
Lee said his government could share testing kits, drugs and other supplies whenever the North accepted its proposal, though it has no plans to send vaccines yet.

""Working together on COVID-19 is a way to keep all of us safe, beyond helping them,"" he said, referring to the shared border. ""I hope the North would rethink the positive value of humanitarian cooperation.""

867,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 02:56AM ET</span>","Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny jailed, declares Putin 'the Underwear Poisoner'","By Andrew Osborn and Maria Tsvetkova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Tuesday, ignoring the West in a ruling the opposition politician blamed on President Vladimir Putin's personal hatred and fear of him.
The Moscow court handed Navalny a three-and-a-half-year sentence, but his lawyer said the anti-corruption blogger would actually serve two years and eight months in jail because of time already spent under house arrest. 
His lawyers said they would appeal.
The decision, which followed nationwide protests calling for Navalny's release, will further strain relations with the West, which is considering imposing sanctions on Russia over its handling of the case. 
The United States, Britain, Germany and the EU urged Moscow to immediately free Navalny, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken saying Washington would coordinate closely with allies to hold Russia accountable.
Russia is already under numerous Western sanctions however, and analysts say the West's options for more pressure are limited. A Navalny ally had urged the West before the hearing to hit Putin's inner circle with personal sanctions.
Russia has suggested that Navalny is a CIA asset, a charge he rejects, and has told the West to stay out of its domestic affairs.
Navalny, one of Putin's most prominent critics, was arrested on Jan. 17 for alleged parole violations after returning from Germany where he had been recovering from being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent.
Navalny said Russian state security agents had put the poison in his underpants, something the Kremlin denied. He used Tuesday's hearing to try to frame Putin's place in history. 
""(Putin's) only method is killing people. However much he pretends to be a great geo-politician, he'll go down in history as a poisoner. There was Alexander the Liberator, Yaroslav the Wise, and Putin the Underwear Poisoner,"" said Navalny. 
His supporters, on hearing the ruling, encouraged people to gather in central Moscow though riot police had already taken up position. The Moscow metro shut down three central stations.
Reuters reporters saw hundreds of protesters and the police detain some of them violently. Some of them chanted, ""Putin is a thief!"" and ""Putin is a poisoner!"" 
Outside the court earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reporters saw riot police detain around 70 of Navalny's supporters. The OVD-Info monitoring group later reported 1,408 arrests nationwide, over 1,000 of those in Moscow. 
After his arrest, Navalny released a YouTube video making allegations about Putin's wealth that was viewed over 100 million times. The Kremlin said it was false.
Tuesday's hearing focused on Navalny's alleged parole violations over a suspended sentence in a 2014 embezzlement case Navalny says was trumped up. 
POLITICAL RIVAL
Navalny, in a fiery speech to the court, alleged he was going to be jailed because of Putin's concerns about him as a political rival, a suggestion the Kremlin has laughed off, referring to Navalny as a marginal figure without wide popular support. 
Putin, 68, has dominated Russian politics since 2000 and could rule until 2036 under constitutional changes approved in a referendum last year. 
""Someone did not want me to take a single step on my country’s territory as a free man. And we know who and we know why - the hatred and fear of one man, living in a bunker, whom I offended by surviving when he tried to have me killed,” Navalny, 44, told the court from inside a glass cage.
After the verdict was read out, Yulia, his wife, removed the mask she was wearing because of the coronavirus pandemic and waved to her husband before giving him a shrug. Navalny shouted: ""Don’t worry. Everything will be ok."" 
Putin, who the Kremlin said was not following the Navalny hearing because he was busy with affairs of state, said in December that reports the Russian state had poisoned Navalny were part of a U.S.-backed plot to try to discredit him.
Putin said Moscow would have finished the job if it had wanted Navalny dead. 
Tuesday's hearing was the result of a request from Moscow's state prison authority which has accused Navalny of violating the terms of a suspended three-and-a-half-year prison sentence for embezzlement. 
Navalny said the conviction, which was criticised by the European Court of Human Rights at the time, was politically motivated. 
A prison service representative told the court that Navalny had violated public order many times since being handed the suspended sentence and had systematically failed to report in.
Navalny told the court he had been unable to report to the prison service at the end of last year because he was recovering in Germany from being poisoned. The prison service said its complaints pre-dated his poisoning and that Navalny had in any case been well enough to meet journalists after being discharged from a Berlin hospital in September. 
Navalny, already serving a 30-day detention sentence in connection with the same case, told the court: ""On what grounds are you saying you didn't know where I was? You're misleading the court"".
Supporters have staged two straight weekends of nationwide protests demanding he be freed, despite a massive show of police force, the threat of arrest, bitter cold and the pandemic. 

While the trigger for those protests was Navalny's arrest, some protesters say they have also taken to the streets to vent their frustration over declining living standards.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Thousands of Burmese demonstrators gathered outside Japan's foreign affairs ministry on Wednesday demanding Tokyo join its allies in taking a harder stance against the military coup in Myanmar.
Wearing red and waving printed photos of Aung San Suu Kyi, a long line of protesters surrounded government buildings in Tokyo, where large political demonstrations are relatively rare.
""Free, free Aung San Suu Kyi, free, free Myanmar,"" the crowd chanted in unison while their representatives handed foreign ministry officials a statement that called on Japan to use all of its ""political, diplomatic, and economic power"" to restore the civilian government in Myanmar.
Japan and Myanmar have long enjoyed close ties, with Tokyo a major aid donor. Japan's largest companies have been particularly aggressive in expanding business there in recent years, seeing it as Southeast Asia's last major frontier market.
The Myanmar army seized power on Monday, cutting short an unsteady transition to democracy on the grounds of fraud in last November's general election, which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won in a landslide.
Union of Myanmar Citizen Association, which organised the rally, said Japan should not recognise the newly-formed military regime. Nearly 3,000 people were taking part in the protest on Wednesday, the organisers said. 
Mathida, a 50-year-old who works in a restaurant in Tokyo, said she joined the protest to push Japanese officials to do more to restore democracy in Myanmar. 
""We want our leader and our mother Aung San Suu Kyi to be freed,"" she said. ""The military is not the government."" She declined to give her full name. 
When pressed at a Tuesday news conference if Japan supported or would emphasise the kind of stance that the United States had expressed, including the possibility of sanctions, the government's top spokesman sidestepped a direct answer, repeating an earlier statement that Japan would keep in close contact with other nations and monitor the situation in Myanmar. 
A top defence official told Reuters this week Japan needed to be cautious about its approach towards Myanmar because cutting ties risked pushing the country closer to China. 
In contrast, the coup has drawn public condemnation from the United States and other Western countries. Suu Kyi remains in detention despite international calls for her immediate release. 

In the biggest public protest against the coup so far, people in the commercial hub of Yangon chanted and banged on metal pots late on Tuesday in a traditional gesture to drive away evil or bad karma.

871,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 01:45AM ET</span>",Chinese plan to boost 'masculinity' with PE classes sparks debate,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A plan in China to get boys to do more sports as a way of making them more manly has reopened a debate between those who urge more diversity and those backing a more masculine society.
The education ministry has said it aims to increase the number of physical education teachers and revamp gym classes to boost the ""masculinity"" of students. 
The plan was in response to a proposal last May by a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body to the government, calling for help for boys who have become too delicate, timid and effeminate after being schooled mostly by women teachers, the ministry said.
A hashtag on the ministry's plan has chalked up 1.5 billion views on the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platform by Wednesday.
""It's hard to imagine such effeminate boys can defend their country when an outside invasion looms,"" said one Weibo user.
Like most Asian nations, China has a traditional bias for sons and decades of a one-child policy has led to what some people see as a tendency for parents to molly-coddle their boys.
But the idea of getting boys to toughen up through physical activity has gained currency in recent years. 
Some affluent parents, worried that their sons are too fragile, are sending them to private boot camps that promise to turn them into ""real"" men through army-style drills.
Feminist scholar Li Jun said the ministry's plan reflected traditional attitudes on the sexes.
""The proposal has represented some stereotypes in China on male masculinity, which is against gender equality and diversity, as it sees being effeminate as negative and dangerous while masculinity is useful to the Chinese nation,"" Li told Reuters.
Yang Li, 25, a Beijing-based marketing manager, said the plan could lead to more bullying. Yang said he was once scolded by a male teacher for walking in his school yard like a model on a catwalk.
State media, trying to calm the debate, published reports this week saying certain temperaments and characteristics should not be associated with either sex. 

The Xinhua news agency, quoting experts, building ""masculinity"" should not be about emphasising gender differences but about developing healthy physiques and inner strength.

SYDNEY (Reuters) -Strong winds threatening to fan a bushfire prompted Australia on Wednesday to urge thousands of people to leave their homes in the provincial capital of Perth, complicating a lockdown after the state detected its first coronavirus infection in 10 months.
The fire in Western Australia has destroyed a swathe of more than 9,000 hectares (22,240 acres) and 71 homes, the authorities say, in a reminder of blazes that destroyed millions of hectares of habitat in the country's east a year ago.
As firefighters battled a blaze in steep, inhospitable terrain, authorities told residents of Bullsbrook, a suburb of 6,600 in Australia's fourth largest city, to ignore a stay-home order and leave immediately as hot, dry weather picked up. 
""We know how quickly things can go bad,"" state premier Mark McGowan told a news conference, adding that one of his personal acquaintances had lost their home.
""They are expecting extremely strong winds. That is why we are saying, if you can leave, please leave now. Please act to save your life."" 
At the same time, 2 million residents of the city are under a five-day lockdown until Friday, after a hotel quarantine worker tested positive for the highly contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain.
The rules require them to stay home, except for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping or exercise, while visits to hospitals and nursing homes are banned. 
""It's important everyone should have a plan and when emergency service personnel ask you to act on that plan, that trumps any lockdown orders,"" David Littleproud, the emergency management minister, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.
""There should be no confusion about that.""
No deaths have been reported from the fires, the origins of which are still unknown.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 03, 2021 12:05AM ET</span>",Mexico arrests 12 police in connection with migrant massacre,"By Laura Gottesdiener
MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) -Mexican officials have arrested a dozen police officers for suspected involvement in the massacre of 19 people in the northeastern state of Tamaulipas last month, state prosecutors said on Tuesday.
Irving Barrios, attorney general of Tamaulipas, told a news conference investigations showed at least 12 state police were likely involved in the killings in the municipality of Camargo.
A spokesman for state police confirmed the arrests, but declined to comment further, pointing Reuters to the statement made by Barrios.
Authorities have so far identified two Guatemalan migrants among the 19, whose bodies were found badly charred in a bullet-riddled, burnt-out vehicle.
Guatemalan families said they feared more loved ones trying to reach the United States were among the dead.
The massacre caused renewed consternation in Mexico about perils faced by migrants, many of whom suffer abuses on the journey north from impoverished Central American countries.
If the involvement of law enforcement officials is confirmed, the case would echo the abduction and apparent massacre of 43 student teachers in the southwestern city of Iguala in 2014 by corrupt police working with a drug gang.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to put an end to killings and kidnappings by authorities, but ties between security forces and organized crime have been hard to stamp out.
The two Guatemalan migrants were identified after their Maya indigenous relatives gave DNA samples to help investigators. 
More than a dozen of the victims are believed to be from Guatemala's highlands, a region hard hit by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and by extreme weather last year.
Also among the dead was the Mexican owner of one of the burnt-out pickup trucks found at the scene, prosecutors said. The truck had been impounded weeks before during the detention of 66 migrants in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon, but was later released to the owner, identified only as Jesus M.
Daniel P., another of the Mexican victims, was a known migrant smuggler, prosecutors said. 
The attack took place in a rural area along the busiest stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border for illegal crossings.
Every year tens of thousands of migrants, many from Central America, move through the region under the watch of guides who pay cartels for permission to transit. The lucrative routes are disputed by splinters of the Gulf Cartel and feared Zetas gang. 
Investigators believe the victims were part of a larger convoy that included other vehicles carrying migrants, including Salvadorans, and another with armed men aboard apparently for protection.
The detained police appeared to have altered the scene of the crime, removing ammunition casings, prosecutors said. The police report and information the suspects gave in interviews did not match phone records and location data, they added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department reacted coolly on Tuesday to an Iranian suggestion that Washington and Tehran take synchronized steps to return to the Iran nuclear deal, though a U.S. official said the stance should not be seen as a rejection.
On Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had said one way to bridge the impasse with Washington was for an EU official to choreograph their steps to restore the 2015 pact abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump.
It was the first time Zarif had hinted Iran might relent in its demand that the United States ease economic sanctions before Tehran would resume compliance. The Biden administration has insisted Iran return to compliance before it would do so.
""We haven't ... had any discussions with the Iranians, and I wouldn’t expect we would until those initial steps go forward,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said, referring to the Biden administration's consultations with allies, partners and the U.S. Congress. 
""There are (many) steps in that process ... before we're reaching the point where we are going to engage directly with the Iranians and willing to entertain any sort of proposal,"" he added.
Another U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Price's comments should not be taken as a rebuff of Zarif's idea, but rather reflected the fact that Biden's Iran team is just settling in and has committed to consult widely.
""There is no rejection,"" this official said. ""We have not begun negotiating with Iran, or with anyone else, because our priority is to consult"" with partners in the nuclear deal and in the region.
Under the 2015 accord between Iran and six major powers, Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program, making it harder to develop nuclear weapons in return for relief from economic sanctions. 

Trump abandoned the deal, which Iran struck with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States, reimposed prior U.S. sanctions and placed new ones that have squeezed Iran's economy.

876,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 06:40PM ET</span>",Biden administration indicates in no hurry to engage China,"By David Brunnstrom and Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Biden administration indicated on Tuesday it is in no hurry to engage with China, a strategic rival it has vowed to out-compete, and said it and would do so once it was in ""lockstep"" with allies and partners.
President Joe Biden has spoken to many world leaders since taking office on Jan. 20, but has yet to speak to his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, and White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told a briefing she could not say when a call might take place.
Psaki said that with Antony Blinken in place as U.S. secretary of state, ""there are additional layers to engage with the Chinese,"" but both she and State Department spokesman Ned Price said speaking to allies and partners came first.
Price told a briefing there were issues, including climate change, ""in which it is our national interest to cooperate on a limited basis with China.""
He said U.S. alliances and partnerships were a ""force multiplier across any range of challenges, and that includes in our relationship with Beijing.
""So, as a first step we want to make sure that we are in lockstep with those allies, in lockstep with those partners, and then ... you can expect that there will be engagement in several areas with China.""
Xi congratulated Biden on his election, even though Biden called him a ""thug"" during the campaign and vowed to lead an international effort to ""pressure, isolate and punish China.""
Psaki declined to say whether China had requested a call with Biden. 
The Biden administration has not fully articulated its strategy towards China, the world's second largest economy, but has indicated it will broadly continue the tough approach taken by former President Donald Trump. 
It has vowed to ""out-compete"" Beijing and endorsed a last-minute Trump administration determination that China has committed genocide against Muslims in Xinjiang, while also stressing the hope to cooperate on policy priorities like climate change..
Blinken last week called the U.S.-China relationship arguably the most important Washington has in the world, while Psaki told the briefing: ""Of course, the relationship with China is going to be multi-layered, we'll deal with climate, we'll deal with the economy, we'll deal with security.""
China's top diplomat called on Tuesday for U.S.-China relations to be put back on a predictable and constructive path, while saying Washington should respect Beijing's position on Taiwan and stop meddling in Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang.
Asked about the comments, Price said China should ""cease its military, diplomatic and economic pressure against Taiwan, and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan’s democratically elected leadership.""
Separately, Price said Washington was ""deeply concerned"" by China's attempts to disbar and harass lawyers representing 12 Hong Kong people convicted after trying to flee to Taiwan by boat.

""We urge Beijing to respect human rights and the rule of law and to reinstate their legal credentials at once,"" he said in a tweet.

(Reuters) -People across the U.S. Northeast on Tuesday were digging themselves out from a massive storm that dumped more than 2 feet of snow on the region as airlines resumed flights and officials expressed relief the damage had not been worse.
At least three people died due to the storm, which packed high winds and dropped about 30 inches (76 cm) of snow in parts of New Jersey and Pennsylvania and up to 1-1/2 feet (46 cm) in New York City. Thousands of households lost power and COVID-19 vaccination programs were suspended in several states.
But by Tuesday afternoon officials appeared relieved that the level of damage and destruction had not been as bad as it might have been. In New Jersey, only about 5,000 people lost power statewide, a development attributed to the fluffiness of the snow and effective preparations. Most commuter train and subway lines in and around New York, the nation's most populous city, were up and running on Tuesday, albeit some on reduced schedules. 
""This is one the most extensive snow events in the history of New York City, so our crews had an incredible job in front of them,"" Patrick Foye, chairman of New York state's Metropolitan Transportation Authority, told a news conference.
The nor’easter - an East Coast storm whose winds blow from the northeast - had been expected to keep dumping snow in some areas north of New York City, with an area stretching to northern Maine being hit the hardest, the National Weather Service said in its latest forecast on Tuesday. Snow could also develop in the Upper Midwest on Wednesday before the storm runs its course, it said.
Officials said they were now bracing for potentially another big storm this weekend.
""More storms coming, but that is the period of life that we are in. We are in a period of storms, and attacks and assaults,"" said New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, referring to the country's battle with the coronavirus pandemic.
In Allentown, Pennsylvania, a 67-year-old woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease was found lying dead in the snow on Monday after wandering away from her home, police said.
A man in Newark, New Jersey, died after being found lying in the snow on Monday, according to police officials, who said the death was not considered suspicious.
Michael Kopy, New York state's director of Emergency Management, said the state police handled more than 300 accidents during the storm, including a fatal snowmobile accident. And while it had stopped snowing around New York City, the northeastern tip of the state could see up to another foot (30 cm) of snowfall into early Wednesday, Kopy said.

The city's LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport began to resume flights after canceling more than 700 on Monday and earlier on Tuesday.
The storm also prompted widespread closings of schools and COVID-19 vaccination sites. In Connecticut, about 10,000 vaccination appointments were canceled on Monday, with plans to reschedule them for later this week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yemen's Houthi group has advised the United Nations to pause preparations to deploy a team to assess a decaying oil tanker threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil off the war-torn country's coast, a U.N. spokesman said on Tuesday.
The tanker Safer has been stranded off Yemen's Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for more than five years, and U.N. officials have warned it could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez disaster off Alaska.
Houthi authorities gave long-awaited approval in November for a visit to assess the tanker. A U.N. team, which includes a private company contracted by the world body to do the work, was aiming to travel to the tanker early next month.
But U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said that time line was now uncertain amid U.N. concerns about signals from the Houthis that they are considering a ""review"" of their formal approval of the tanker mission. 
""Houthi officials have advised the U.N. to pause certain preparations pending the outcome of such process, which would create further delays to the mission,"" he said in a statement.
He said the United Nations had so far spent $3.35 million on preparing for the mission. The world body also has to lease a technically equipped vessel, but needs a letter from the Houthis with security assurances. 
""We regret that, to date, we have not received a response to our multiple requests for this letter, the lack of which would increase the cost of the mission by hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" Dujarric said. 
Houthi-run Al Masirah TV last week quoted a senior Houthi official as saying the United Nations had made additional requests that had not been part of an agreed framework. 
""Their new requests are related to their financial relationship with insurance firms and we will not get involved in matters that do not concern us,"" the Houthi official said. 
Last month, former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration designated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. The United Nations is also reviewing whether that could affect the tanker mission.
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country's suffering is also worsened by an economic crisis, currency collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department will conduct a review of its foreign assistance to Myanmar after determining that the military takeover in the Asian country this week constituted a coup, officials said on Tuesday.
President Joe Biden has threatened new sanctions against the generals who seized power in Myanmar and detained elected leaders including Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi early on Monday.
Washington has not been in direct contact with the coup leaders in Myanmar or the deposed civilian government leaders. 
At the request of the White House, the top U.S. military officer, Army General Mark Milley, attempted to call Myanmar's military following the coup, but he was unable to connect, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.
Under U.S. law, the assessment that a coup has taken place automatically puts restrictions on U.S. assistance.
The coup is a significant blow for the Biden administration and its effort to forge a robust Asia-Pacific policy to stand up to China. Many of Biden's Asia policy team are veterans of the Obama administration, which on leaving office in 2016 hailed its work to end decades of military rule in Myanmar as a major foreign policy achievement. 
State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States gave nearly $135 million in bilateral assistance to Myanmar in 2020 but only a ""small sliver"" of that went directly to the government.
Officials are reviewing that assistance, but have said humanitarian aid, including to the stateless Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, and programs that promote democracy or benefit civil society would continue.
“Our first concern as we do that review will be to ensure that … we don’t do anything that would affect the long suffering people of Burma, including the Rohingya,” Price said in a briefing.
U.S. officials were also conducting a review of sanctions against Myanmar's military leaders and companies associated with them, he said. 
State Department officials briefed staff from the House of Representatives and Senate foreign relations committees on Monday about the situation but did not preview new sanctions, according to aides who were on the call.
U.S. officials were trying to work with European and Asian allies who have contacts with Myanmar's military, but had not made much progress, lawmakers were told, according to an aide.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who has close ties to Suu Kyi, said in a statement he had spoken to Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday about the situation in Myanmar and urged the administration to ""impose significant costs on the military for its attack on democracy.""

Erdogan's Chief Foreign Policy Adviser Ibrahim Kalin and U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan discussed issues regarding Syria, Libya, the eastern Mediterranean, Cyprus, and Nagorno-Karabakh, Turkey's official news agency Anadolu reported.
Kalin told Sullivan that joint efforts were needed to find a solution to current disagreements between the countries, such as Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 defense systems and U.S. support for Kurdish militia groups in northern Syria, Anadolu said. 
In its statement on the meeting, the White House said Sullivan underscored the Biden administration’s desire to build ""constructive"" U.S.-Turkey ties but also touched on areas of friction.
Sullivan ""conveyed the administration’s intention to strengthen transatlantic security through NATO, expressing concern that Turkey’s acquisition of the Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile system undermines alliance cohesion and effectiveness,"" National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said.
NATO allies Washington and Ankara have been at loggerheads over Turkey's purchase of the Russian-made D-400 defense systems. In December, the Trump administration imposed long-anticipated sanctions on Turkey over the acquisition, a move Turkey called a ""grave mistake.""
It had also removed Turkey, a NATO ally, from its F-35 fighter jet program as a result.
Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its advanced F-35 fighters and to NATO's broader defense systems. Turkey rejects this, saying the S-400s will not be integrated into NATO, and has offered to form a joint working group to examine the conflicting claims.

Ankara says its purchase of the S-400s was not a choice, but rather a necessity because it was unable to procure missile defenses from other NATO allies with satisfactory conditions.

MARSTON MORETAINE, England (Reuters) - Britain's Captain Tom Moore, the World War Two veteran who lifted a nation's spirits by raising millions of pounds for health service workers battling the coronavirus, died on Tuesday aged 100 after he contracted COVID-19.
Moore struck a chord with locked-down Britain by walking around his garden with the help of a frame to raise 38.9 million pounds ($53 million) for the National Health Service.
His endeavour and wit spread joy amid the grim news of the coronavirus outbreak: Moore's message to the world was that the sun would shine again and that the clouds would clear.
""It is with great sadness that we announce the death of our dear father, Captain Sir Tom Moore,"" his daughters said in a statement following his death on Tuesday morning at Bedford Hospital in central England. 
Over the last five years, he had been receiving treatment for prostate and skin cancer, his family said. He was fighting pneumonia and was taken to hospital after testing positive for COVID-19 on Jan. 22, unable to be vaccinated due to the other medication he was taking. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Queen Elizabeth led the tributes to Moore, whose exploits won global admiration.
""Captain Tom Moore was a hero in the truest sense of the word,"" said Johnson, who spoke to Moore's daughter Hannah to pass on his condolences. ""He became not just a national inspiration but a beacon of hope for the world.""
The flag above his Downing Street office was lowered to half-mast in Moore's honour.
The queen, who knighted Moore at Windsor Castle last summer in recognition of his efforts, will send a message of private condolence to the family, Buckingham Palace said, adding the 94-year-old monarch had ""very much enjoyed meeting Captain Sir Tom"".
""Her thoughts, and those of the Royal Family, are with them, recognising the inspiration he provided for the whole nation and others across the world,"" the palace said.
The White House also paid tribute to a man ""who inspired millions through his life and his actions."" 
When Moore, dressed in a blazer and tie, started his sponsored walk at his home in the village of Marston Moretaine, 80km (50 miles) north of London, he hoped to raise 1,000 pounds. 
Instead, he amassed a world record sum for the National Health Service, with his quiet determination and cheerful outlook winning the hearts of the British public.
SUNSHINE DURING LOCKDOWN
""The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of,"" his daughters said.
""Whilst he'd been in so many hearts for just a short time, he was an incredible father and grandfather, and he will stay alive in our hearts forever.""
Such was his fame that his 100th birthday was marked by a message from Johnson, a promotion to the rank of colonel and flypasts by both historic planes and modern RAF helicopters above his home.
He received more than 125,000 birthday cards from well-wishers around the world and became the oldest person to reach number one in Britain's main music singles chart, featuring on a cover version of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"".
""I never, ever anticipated ever in my life anything like this, it really is amazing,"" Moore said when he turned 100 on April 30. ""Thank you very much to everyone, wherever you are.""
Raised in Yorkshire, northern England, Moore served in India, Burma and Sumatra during World War Two.
Soldiers from the First Battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment, the successor to his own, gave him a guard of honour when he completed the 100th length of the garden on April 16, 2020.
Moore found words to cheer up the British public during lockdown, his status as a war veteran adding to his standing.
""For all those people who are finding it difficult at the moment, the sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away,"" he said after completing his sponsored walk.
""You've all got to remember that we will get through it in the end, it will all be right, it might take time. At the end of the day we shall all be OK again.""

883,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 03:41PM ET</span>",Russia's Sputnik V vaccine 92% effective in fighting COVID-19,"By Polina Ivanova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - - Scientists gave Russia's Sputnik V vaccine the green light on Tuesday saying it was almost 92% effective in fighting COVID-19 based on peer-reviewed late-stage trial results published in The Lancet international medical journal.
Experts said the Phase III trial results meant the world had another effective weapon to fight the deadly pandemic and justified to some extent Moscow's decision to roll out the vaccine before final data had been released.
The results, collated by the Gamaleya Institute in Moscow that developed and tested the vaccine, were in line with efficacy data reported at earlier stages of the trial, which has been running in Moscow since September. 
""The development of the Sputnik V vaccine has been criticised for unseemly haste, corner cutting, and an absence of transparency,"" said Ian Jones, professor at the University of Reading, and Polly Roy, professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.
""But the outcome reported here is clear and the scientific principle of vaccination is demonstrated,"" the scientists, who were not involved in the study, said in a comment shared by The Lancet. ""Another vaccine can now join the fight to reduce the incidence of COVID-19.""
The results were based on data from 19,866 volunteers, of whom a quarter received a placebo, the researchers, led by the Gamaleya Institute's Denis Logunov, said in The Lancet.
Since the trial began in Moscow, there were 16 recorded cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among people who received the vaccine, and 62 among the placebo group, the scientists said. 
This showed that a two-dose regimen of the vaccine - two shots based on two different viral vectors, administered 21 days apart - was 91.6% effective against symptomatic COVID-19.
'RUSSIA WAS RIGHT' 
The Sputnik V vaccine is the fourth worldwide to have Phase III results published in leading peer-reviewed medical journals following the shots developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech,  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
Pfizer's shot had the highest efficacy rate at 95%, closely followed by Moderna's vaccine and Sputnik V while AstraZeneca's vaccine had an average efficacy of 70%.
Sputnik V has also now been approved for storage in normal fridges, as opposed to freezers, making transportation and distribution easier, Gamaleya scientists said on Tuesday.
Russia approved the vaccine in August, before the large-scale trial had begun, saying it was the first country to do so for a COVID-19 shot. It named it Sputnik V, in homage to the world's first satellite, launched by the Soviet Union. 
Small numbers of frontline health workers began receiving it soon after and a large-scale roll out started in December, though access was limited to those in specific professions, such as teachers, medical workers and journalists.
In January, the vaccine was offered to all Russians.
""Russia was right all along,"" Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is responsible for marketing the vaccine abroad, told reporters on Tuesday.
He said the results supported Russia's decision to begin administering Sputnik V to frontline workers while the trial was still underway, and suggested scepticism of such moves was politically motivated. 
""The Lancet did very unbiased work despite some of the political pressures that may have been out there,"" he said.
EFFECTIVE IN ELDERLY
The number of people vaccinated in Russia has remained low so far. Authorities have pointed to some early issues with scaling up production while polls have shown low demand among Russians for the vaccine. 
Russia has already shared data from its Phase III trial with regulators in several countries and has begun the process of submitting it to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for approval in the European Union, Dmitriev said. 
The data release comes as Europe scrambles to secure enough shots for its 450 million citizens due to production cuts by AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The U.S. roll-out, meanwhile, has been hampered by the need to store shots in ultra-cold freezers and uneven planning across states. 
There were 2,144 volunteers over 60 in the Sputnik V trial and the shot was shown to be 91.8% effective when tested on this older group, with no serious side-effects reported that could be associated with the vaccine, The Lancet summary said.
RDIF's Dimitriev also said the Gamaleya Institute was testing the vaccine against new variants of COVID-19 and the early signs were positive.
The vaccine was also found to be 100% effective against moderate or severe COVID-19, as there were no such cases among the group of 78 participants who were infected and symptomatic at 21 days after the first shot was administered.
Four deaths of participants occurred, but none was considered associated with vaccination, The Lancet said. 
""The efficacy looks good, including in the over 60s,"" said Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London. ""It's good to have another addition to the global arsenal."" 
ONE DOSE VERSION
The authors of the study noted that because COVID-19 cases were only detected when trial participants reported symptoms, further research was needed to understand Sputnik V's efficacy on asymptomatic cases and transmission.
Sputnik V has been approved by 15 countries, including Argentina, Hungary and the United Arab Emirates and this will rise to 25 by the end of next week, the RDIF's Dmitriev said. 
The sovereign wealth fund also said vaccinations using Sputnik V will begin in a dozen countries including Bolivia, the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and Iran. 
Hungary was the first member of the European Union to break ranks and unilaterally approve the vaccine last month. It is set to receive a first batch of 40,000 doses on Tuesday. 
Germany has said it would use Sputnik V if it is approved by Europe's drug regulator while France has said it could buy any efficient vaccine.
However, large shipments of the shot have only been sent so far to Argentina, which has received enough doses to vaccinate about 500,000 people.
""Now all doubts are cleared up,"" Argentine Science Minister Roberto Salvarezza told local radio station La Red, citing ""the confirmation in a prestigious scientific publication.""
Production for export will primarily be done by RDIF's manufacturing partners abroad, the fund has said. 

On Tuesday, Dmitriev said production had started in India and South Korea, and would launch in China this month. Trial doses have also been produced by a manufacturer in Brazil. 
Russia is conducting a small-scale clinical trial of a one-dose version of the vaccine, which developers expect to have an efficacy rate of 73% to 85%.

As a team of law enforcement officers tried to execute the court-ordered warrant involving violent crimes against children at the home in Sunrise, Florida, shots were fired at 6 a.m. EST (1100 GMT), the FBI said in a statement.
The search warrant sought evidence in connection with suspected possession of child pornography, the FBI Agents Association added in a statement. 
Two of the wounded agents were in stable condition at a hospital, while the third did not require hospitalization, the FBI said. The subject of the warrant, who was not identified, also died, it said.
The man being investigated had apparently barricaded himself inside an apartment complex and was found dead, the New York Times reported, citing unidentified officials. It was unclear how he died, the newspaper said.
The scene on Tuesday morning near the home in Sunrise, just west of Fort Lauderdale and about 30 miles (48 km) north of Miami, was swarming with emergency and law enforcement vehicles from the FBI and police in Sunrise and surrounding jurisdictions.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that President Joe Biden had been briefed on the incident and would likely address it later on Tuesday.
FBI Director Christopher Wray identified the dead agents as Daniel Alfin and Laura Schwartzenberger and hailed them as heroes.
""Special Agent Alfin and Special Agent Schwartzenberger exemplified heroism today in defense of their country,"" Wray said in a statement. ""The FBI will always honor their ultimate sacrifice and will be forever grateful for their bravery."" 
The shooting deaths, which remain under investigation, were among the bloodiest episodes for the FBI. 
In 1994, two agents were shot dead along with a police detective at the Washington, D.C., police headquarters when a homicide suspect opened fire on them with an assault weapon, also wounding a third agent, according to the FBI's website. 
Another deadly encounter occurred in 1986, also in Florida, when two agents were killed and five others were wounded in a Miami shootout with two bank robbery suspects, the FBI said.
The last fatal shooting of an FBI agent on duty was on Nov. 19, 2008, which also unfolded during the execution of a warrant, the FBI said. Agent Samuel Hicks was shot and killed as he sought to execute a federal arrest warrant associated with a drug trafficking organization in Pittsburgh, it said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) -Intensifying weeks of tension at a top Istanbul university, Turkey's interior minister on Tuesday called student protesters ""LGBT deviants"" on Twitter, prompting the social media platform to put a rare warning on his comment.
""Should we tolerate the LGBT deviants who insult the great Kaaba? Of course not,"" Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said in the statement on Twitter, referring to a shrine in Mecca that is Islam's most sacred site. 
Twitter said Soylu's tweet, as well as another from the weekend that used the same phrase, violated its rules about hateful conduct. The site said it did not take down the posts because there was potential public interest in keeping them accessible.
Defying a government ban on demonstrations, students and teachers at Istanbul's Bogazici University have held protests for the last month against President Tayyip Erdogan's appointment of academic and former political candidate Melih Bulu as rector, which they said was undemocratic.
On Monday, students shared images on social media of themselves placing a picture on the ground that mixed LGBT symbols and Islamic images including the Kaaba shrine.
Police detained four students then and a total of 159 throughout the day after breaking up a group planning an all-night vigil outside the rector's office. Sixty-one were still in custody on Tuesday.
Academics gathered on Tuesday on the Bogazici campus with backs turned to the rector's building in protest. They chanted ""Melih Bulu resign,"" and carried signs reading ""159,"" the number of those detained on Monday.
Hundreds also gathered in Istanbul's Kadikoy district on Tuesday, carrying signs that said, ""LGBTQs will never walk alone"" among other slogans.
Police dispersed the crowds using pepper spray projectiles and detained 104 people, the Istanbul governor's office said.
Soylu said on live television on Tuesday it was his duty to preserve families against ""LGBT deviants.""
""I am a believer, and in my belief, this is deviant. As a Muslim, I am responsible to say this, to protect the institution of family.""
Twitter has not complied with a Turkish requirement implemented last year that social media firms appoint a representative in the country to deal with requests for content removal. Its bandwidth may be reduced in coming months.
In Ankara, police clashed with protesters, some of whom chanted: ""Shoulder to shoulder against fascism."" Video images showed police dragging protesters away, hands cuffed behind their backs. State-owned Anadolu agency said 69 people were detained.
The government has criticised the protesters, with Erdogan praising his party's youth wing for ""not being the LGBT youth.""

The main opposition CHP has supported the protests and several parliamentarians from the pro-Kurdish HDP were turned away at the university's entrance on Monday.
Erdogan's critics say the president and his AK Party, which promotes conservative Islamic values, have eroded social rights and tolerance. Erdogan's supporters say he has restored freedom of religious expression in a once strongly secular republic.

AMMAN (Reuters) - U.S. backed Kurdish-led forces and the Syrian army reached a deal on Tuesday to end a nearly three week long siege of neighborhoods under the control of the Syrian government in two-Kurdish controlled cities in northeast Syria, officials from both sides said.
Streets leading to the center of the city of Hasaka in a security zone under government control were reopened while barriers set up during the 20-day siege were being dismantled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a grouping of U.S.-backed militias which the Kurdish YPG dominates, state media said.
Trucks carrying goods, wheat and fuel were again being allowed into two neighbourhoods in the city of Qamishli that Kurdish-led forces had for days restricted goods entering it, according to a Syrian official and a resident.
""Steps have begun to lift the siege imposed by the militias ... and we hope this will continue in both cities,"" Ghassan Khalil, the governor of Hasaka told Syrian state-news agency SANA.
Most of the neighbourhoods of the two biggest cities in northeastern Syria have been under SDF control since Syrian troops handed control to the Kurds in the early years of the ten-year conflict to fight mainly Sunni rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al Assad.
With U.S. backing, the SDF have in recent years taken control over much of northeastern Syria where most of the country's oil and wheat production lies after defeating Islamic State militants.
The deal struck with Russian mediation defuses weeks of mounting tensions with daily protests against the Kurdish-led administration and some deadly clashes blamed on SDF forces who opened fire on pro-Assad demonstrators, according to residents and Syrian officials and a SDF source.
The Kurdish-led administration has accused Damascus of inciting tribal chiefs in the predominately Arab dominated province of Hasaka to rebel against their rule.
The YPG and Syrian authorities have for years been tacit allies, with lucrative oil and commercial links between them. 
The airport of Qamishli continues to be run by the Syrian government and salaries of employees are paid by the state.
Assad has however in recent months accused the YPG, which is affiliated to the PKK Kurdish rebel group in Turkey, of treachery and helping Washington lay its hands on the country's oil and wheat production.
The YPG accuses Damascus of seeking to return back areas it controls to decades of repression which saw discrimination of the Kurdish minority under a one-party rule that espouses Arab nationalism.

VELIKA KLADUSA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Fourteen year-old Amim Hzam from Iraq says he has tried to enter European Union member Croatia with his family forty times from northwestern Bosnia over the last two years. 
On one attempt about a year ago his mother and one of his siblings got through. They then managed to travel to Germany. But he and his father and two more children were caught by police and sent back to Bosnia.
The family is among more than 8,000 migrants from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa who are stuck in Bosnia, which since early 2018 has become a transit route for those aiming to reach wealthier EU states.
But it has become increasingly difficult to cross EU borders and impoverished Bosnia has become a cul de sac with its ethnically divided government unable to cope. The coronavirus pandemic has seen the EU seal its borders, leaving the migrants with little hope of entering and requesting asylum.
Now Hzam and his siblings learn German, and get sad when their mother calls from Germany and cries. 
""I need mama, I need school, but Croatian police say: 'Sorry, go back to Bosnia'"" said Hzam.
Many of the migrants live in tents in the woods or in houses and factories destroyed in the Bosnian war of the 1990s.
Hzam's family is staying in a furnished house near the border town of Velika Kladusa, belonging to a Bosnian living abroad who agreed with a local charity to provide them with shelter. 
The family do not leave the house, for fear of abuse by some local people who resent their presence in the village. 
""They are judged when they come out, these houses are actually their hiding places,"" said Zehida Bihorac Odobasic, a school teacher and activist who the migrants call ""Mother"". She brought Hzam's family some food and coloured pencils to draw, and helped arrange their accommodation.
""We can't go outside, we just sit at home,"" said Hojjat, a migrant among an Afghan family of five staying in similar accommodation, explaining they could have trouble from neighbours and police.
Even Bihorac Odobasic has received verbal and physical attacks from locals for helping and defending the migrants. She says her complaints to police went nowhere.
Last November, the UN human rights experts called on the Bosnian government to investigate a ""smear campaign and death threats"" against Bihorac Odobasic and bring those responsible to justice according to international standards, but to no avail.
""Here and now we are witnessing an absolute violation of human rights,"" Bihorac Odobasic told Reuters in a forest tent camp covered by snow, where around 50 people were trying to get warm in sleeping bags.

The EU has repeatedly called on Bosnian authorities to provide accommodation to at least 1,000 people sleeping rough during the winter. Since early 2018, the EU has provided more than 88 million euros to help Bosnia manage the migrant crisis.

""I can confirm today that we intend to introduce a managed quarantine requirement for anyone who arrives directly into Scotland, regardless of which country they have come from,"" she told the Scottish parliament.
Scotland will ask Britain's government to adopt a similar approach to minimise the risk of people with COVID-19 entering Scotland over the border with England and other parts of the United Kingdom.
Sturgeon also said she hoped there would be a gradual, phased return of children to schools in Scotland from Feb. 22 and a possible gradual lifting of lockdown requirements from early March.

""If our progress continues, then I am cautiously - and I stress cautiously - optimistic that as more and more people get vaccinated and with the protection of some of the additional measures ... we may be able to begin looking towards a careful and gradual easing around the start of March,"" she said.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine and his party said on Tuesday that around 3,000 of his supporters had been detained or abducted by state agents since November, when protests flared over his arrest during a presidential election campaign.
The police said they were investigating all reports of disappearances. They have previously said they arrested nearly 600 people in connection with the November unrest, and accused protesters of rioting and looting.
Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo and President Yoweri Museveni's spokesman Don Wanyama did not immediately answer telephone calls seeking comment on the assertions.
Wine, who is also a pop star, on Monday filed a court challenge to the results of the Jan. 14 presidential election, which handed victory to Museveni, in power since 1986.
Officials in Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) told a news conference that squads of state security personnel had appeared around Uganda in unmarked minivans and taken supporters to unknown locations. 
After the news conference, NUP Secretary General David Lewis Rubongoya told Reuters that people had begun to disappear on Nov. 18, the start of two days of protests.
""The state started conducting operations across the country, picking people and taking them away,"" he said.
Fifty-four people were killed as the army and police used bullets and teargas to quell the riots, which began after Wine was arrested for alleged violation of social distancing rules. 
Rubongoya said the NUP's estimate was based on reports from relatives or friends of people who had gone missing since Nov. 18. Most of the disappearances were in central Uganda, where Wine has strong support, but people also vanished in the east and north, he said. 
Oryem Nyeko, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said he was aware of many such reports, and that they raised ""very serious concerns"".
TINTED WINDOWS
Wine has said he defeated Museveni but that the election was rigged by ballot stuffing, pre-marking of ballots, intimidation of voters by security agencies, and other tactics.
Wine's large following includes many young people attracted by his bold criticism of Museveni's government, a longtime ally of the West.
Rubongoya told Reuters that security men typically came to a house with rifles, in unmarked minivans with tinted windows, and told people to get in. ""If you try to resist, they force you in there, beat you up and take you away.""
Mostly, relatives and the NUP do not know where those people have been taken, Rubongoya said.
Police spokesman Fred Enanga said Deputy Police Chief Paul Lokech had ordered the criminal investigations directorate to probe all alleged disappearances, and that anyone suspected to have caused them would be investigated.
Police said last month that at least 110 polling agents from Wine's party had been arrested since Jan. 13. During the election itself, 223 people were arrested for offences including assault, intimidation and voter bribery.

Wine said the disappearances recalled the many abductions perpetrated in the brutal reign of Idi Amin in the 1970s.

VIENNA (Reuters) - Iran has deepened a key breach of its 2015 nuclear deal, enriching uranium with a larger number of advanced centrifuge machines in an underground plant as it faces off with the new U.S. administration on salvaging the accord.
Tehran has recently accelerated its breaches of the deal, raising pressure on U.S. President Joe Biden as both sides say they are willing to come back into compliance with the badly eroded agreement if the other side moves first.
Iran began its breaches in 2019 in response to Washington's withdrawal in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump and the reimposition of U.S. economic sanctions against Tehran that were lifted under the deal.
The accord says Iran can refine uranium only at its main enrichment site - an underground plant at Natanz - with first-generation IR-1 centrifuges. Last year Iran began enriching there with a cascade, or cluster, of much more efficient IR-2m machines and in December said it would install three more.
""Iran has completed the installation of one of these three cascades, containing 174 IR-2m centrifuges, and, on 30 January 2021, Iran began feeding the cascade with UF6,"" the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report obtained by Reuters on Tuesday, referring to uranium hexafluoride feedstock.
The IAEA later confirmed that the Islamic Republic had started enriching with the second cascade.
Tehran is also pressing ahead with the installation of more advanced centrifuges, the report indicated. Of the remaining two cascades of IR-2m machines, installation of one had begun while the other's installation was ""nearing completion"", it said. 
Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, said on Twitter Tehran had also started installing IR-6 centrifuges at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain where Iran has begun enriching uranium to the 20% purity it last achieved before the 2015 deal. The IAEA report made no mention of that.
Earlier on Tuesday Israel's energy minister said it would now take Iran about six months to produce enough fissile material for one nuclear weapon, a timeline almost twice as long as that anticipated by a senior Biden administration official. 

Iran denies any intent to weaponise enrichment. The nuclear deal sets a limit of 3.67% enrichment purity, suitable for producing civilian nuclear energy and far below the 90% that is weapons-grade.

TAGHAVARD, Azerbaijan (Reuters) - Ethnic Armenian farmer Lenser Gabrielyan looks with sorrow at his land in the village of Taghavard, now cut off from him and his family under the terms of a peace deal which ended last year's war in the South Caucasus enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
Within weeks of the conflict's outbreak in September, military forces from Azerbaijan had entered Gabrielyan's picturesque mountain settlement and made big territorial gains.
A Russia-brokered ceasefire last November cemented Azeri advances in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognised as a part of Azerbaijan but had been controlled by ethnic Armenians since the early 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
The accord split Taghavard, which stretches for three kilometres along an unpaved road towards a mountain range and which had a pre-war population of over a thousand ethnic Armenians. 
It also left Gabrielyan, who has lived there since his birth, with his house on one side of a new border and his farmland on the other. 
""Now we have nothing to do,"" lamented the 65-year-old, as he walked near a barn that used to house livestock, but whose roof had since collapsed under shelling.
""I used to farm. But almost all the land was left under Azerbaijani control... No tractor is left here, all the equipment is in the hands of the Azeri side."" 
Azeri forces took control of the upper western end of the settlement. Those ethnic Armenians who did not flee now live in the east, protected by ethnic Armenian military units.
Gabrielyan's family, including his ten grandchildren, stayed. But like other families, they are now struggling to get by as fields where livestock used to graze and a nearby forest, where they used to chop firewood, are under Azeri control.
Before the war, his family kept sheep and pigs. Most of them were lost when the village became a battle field and Gabrielyan says his family will run out of firewood in a month.
""I don't know what to do,"" he said. ""Everything is in ruins.""
Before the war, residents also enjoyed running water to their homes from wells located in the upper part of the village. That access has now been lost.
An alternative water source - a pipe located several hundred metres away from houses is now the only option. A Reuters reporter watched recently as residents brought several plastic bottles and metal cans of water loaded onto two donkeys back home. The journey took them around 30 minutes. 
FEARS OF WAR
Gabrielyan's daughter-in-law, Minara, cried as she showed pictures of her brother, who was killed in combat on the same night when the peace deal was agreed.
She says she is scared to live in their house, which is only hundreds metres away from Azeri outposts, which are visible on sunny days.
""We don't know now what it is - war or peace? We can't go out freely or sleep calmly at night. We wake up from every noise because we are afraid,"" she said.
A Reuters reporter saw an Azerbaijani soldier on guard on a hillside overlooking the village, just several dozen metres away from ethnic Armenian military positions.
Lenser Gabrielyan picks up fragments of exploded shells when walking in a nearby field, still criss-crossed with trenches, and says it worries him that his grandchildren have to live so close to a hostile army.

""We're staying here,"" he said. ""(But) I don't know what will happen. It is dangerous"".

895,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 07:15AM ET</span>",Pakistan court orders release from prison of mastermind in Daniel Pearl case,"By Asif Shahzad
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court ordered the release from prison on Tuesday of a British-born militant who had been convicted in the kidnapping and murder of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl by al Qaeda and Pakistani Islamist militants in 2002.
In a decision that is expected to draw criticism from the United States, the court recommended that Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh be transferred to a government safe house as a stepping stone to his full release after spending 18 years on death row.
""He should be moved to a comfortable residential environment, something like a rest house where he can live a normal life,"" said Justice Omar Ata Bandyal.
Bandyal headed a panel of three judges that reviewed the case, following a petition from the government after the court upheld last Thursday a lower court's decision to acquit Sheikh and three accomplices of all charges except abduction.
The court said Sheikh should be kept at a secure location under a ""supervision and some surveillance,"" his lawyer Rauf Ahmad Sheikh told reporters. 
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken ""reinforced"" Washington's concern over the case in a telephone call on Friday with Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.
Pearl's family had also petitioned for the Supreme Court to reverse the acquittal so that ""Sheikh and co-conspirators are brought to justice for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl,"" Faisal Siddiqi, a lawyer for the family, said.
On assignment for the Wall Street Journal in the months after al Qaeda 9/11 attacks on the United States, Pearl was kidnapped in Karachi and later beheaded. The militants videoed his execution. 
Al Qaeda's number three leader Khalid Sheikh Mohammed later confessed to killing Pearl, while Sheikh, a former student at the London School of Economics, played key role in luring the journalist into a trap with the help of other Pakistani militants.
Captured in Pakistan in 2003, Mohammed is being held at the U.S. detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, on the island of Cuba, where he is a awaiting trial on multiple counts, and could face the death penalty.
Sheikh's fortunes changed last year, when a high court decided only the kidnapping conviction should stand, commuting his death sentence to seven years in jail, which he had already served.
Sheikh's father, Ahmad Saeed Sheikh, attended Tuesday's hearing.
""It is not a complete freedom. It is a step toward freedom,"" he told Reuters Television.
The judge said family members should be allowed to visit Sheikh once he was moved from prison.
The terms of Sheikh's release will become clearer once a written order is made public.
""Even if court orders for release, the government has prepared other cases to charge him under a terrorism act and for treason,"" said Hassan Abbas, a Washington based international security professor. ""The bigger challenge for Islamabad will be pressure from the U.S.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - More than half of New Delhi's 20 million inhabitants may have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a government serological survey whose findings echoed earlier private-sector research.
India has reported 10.8 million COVID-19 infections, the most anywhere outside the United States. But Tuesday's survey, based on some 28,000 samples, suggests the true figure among its 1.35 billion population is dramatically higher and approaching herd immunity levels.
""In the fifth sero survey done in the national capital of Delhi, (coronavirus) antibodies have been detected in 56.13% of the city's population,"" Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain said on Twitter after the report was published.
Separate tests done on more than 700,000 people across India by diagnostics company Thyrocare Technologies showed 55% of the population may have already been infected, its chief told Reuters last week.
The World Health Organization says at least 60% to 70% of a population needs to have immunity to break the chain of transmission, though Indian officials have said a lower level can also slow the virus's spread.
Jain said New Delhi had largely beaten COVID, and India's daily cases and deaths fell to eight-month lows on Tuesday.
Overall it has reported 154,486 COVID deaths, giving the country a relatively low fatality rate.
One factor in that is the country's low average age, medical experts say. Two rich states with relatively older populations - Kerala with 3,459 cases and Maharashtra with 1,948 - now account for nearly 70% of new infections.

India has vaccinated nearly 4 million people since mid-January, when it started what the government touts as the world’s biggest immunisation campaign, which aims to inoculate over 300 million people by August.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 06:38AM ET</span>",Suu Kyi's party demands her release as Myanmar generals tighten grip,"(Reuters) - The party of Myanmar's detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi called on Tuesday for her immediate release and for the junta to recognise her victory in November elections, a day after a military coup sparked global outrage.
The United States threatened to reimpose sanctions on Myanmar's generals after they seized power and arrested Suu Kyi and dozens of her allies in dawn raids on Monday. 
The Nobel Peace laureate's whereabouts remained unknown more than 24 hours after her arrest and her only communication has come in the form of a statement written in anticipation of the coup calling for protests against military dictatorship.
The U.N. Security Council was due to meet later on Tuesday, diplomats said, amid calls for a strong global response to the military's latest seizure of power in a country blighted for decades by army rule.
The coup followed a landslide win for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) in Nov. 8 elections, a result the military has refused to accept citing unsubstantiated allegations of fraud.
The army handed power to its commander, General Min Aung Hlaing, and imposed a state of emergency for a year, crushing hopes the poverty-stricken country also known as Burma was on the path to stable democracy.
The NLD's executive committee demanded the release of all detainees ""as soon as possible"".
In a post on the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of senior party official May Win Myint, the committee also called for the military to acknowledge the election results and for the new parliament to be allowed to sit. It has been due to meet on Monday for the first time since the election.
U.S. President Joe Biden called the crisis a direct assault on Myanmar's transition to democracy and the rule of law, and said his administration would watch how other countries responded.
""We will work with our partners throughout the region and the world to support the restoration of democracy and the rule of law, as well as to hold accountable those responsible for overturning Burma's democratic transition,"" Biden said in a statement.
The crisis is one of the first major tests of Biden's pledge to collaborate more with allies on international challenges, especially on China's growing influence. 
The United Nations led condemnation of the coup and calls for the release of detainees, in comments largely echoed by Australia, the European Union, India and Japan.
'WORRY FOR THE FUTURE'
China did not join the condemnation, saying only that it noted the events and called on all sides to respect the constitution. Other countries in the region including neighbouring Thailand declined to comment on Myanmar's ""internal affairs"".
The streets of Myanmar were quiet overnight during a curfew already in place to stop the coronavirus. Troops and riot police took up positions in the capital, Naypyitaw, and the main commercial centre, Yangon.
In one of the first callss for specific action to oppose the coup came from the Yangon Youth Network, one of Myanmar's biggest activist groups.
""Yangon Youth Network ... declared and urged CD (civil disobedience) as an immediate response,"" a representative said on Twitter, noting that doctors at a hospital in the city of Mandalay had also begun a similar campaign.
China's state Xinhua news agency quoted a military official as saying most regional and state leaders who were detained during the takeover were released on Tuesday, 
The chief minister of the Sagaing region, Myint Naing, told the BBC after his release that he had been kept in a dormitory and treated well.
""I worry for the future of the nation. We hoped for the best but the worst is happening,"" he said. 
By Tuesday morning, phone and internet connections were restored but usually bustling markets were quiet and Yangon's airport was closed.
Banks in Yangon reopened after halting services on Monday due to poor internet connections and amid a rush to withdraw cash.
Citizens feared upheaval would further hurt an economy already reeling from the COVID-19 outbreak.
""People aren't going out,"" said taxi driver Aung Than Tun.
LONG STRUGGLE
Suu Kyi, 75, endured about 15 years of house arrest between 1989 and 2010 as she led a democracy movement against the military, which has ruled for much of the past six decades.
The latest coup marks the second time the military has refused to recognise a landslide election win for the NLD, having also rejected the result of 1990 polls that were meant to pave the way for multi-party government. 
Following mass protests led by Buddhist monks in 2007, the generals set a course for compromise, while never relinquishing ultimate control.
The NLD came to power after a 2015 election under a constitution that guarantees the military a major role in government, including several main ministries, and an effective veto on constitutional reform.
Consolidating its position, the new junta removed 24 ministers and named 11 replacements for various portfolios including finance, defence, foreign affairs and interior.
Military chief Min Aung Hlaing has promised a free and fair election and a handover of power to the winner but without giving a timeframe.
Buddhist monk Shwe Nya War Sayadawa, known for his support for the NLD, was also among those arrested on Monday, his temple said. Monks can be a powerful political force in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.
One of the main concerns for UN diplomats is the fate of Rohingya Muslims who have endured years of harsh treatment at the hands of the military.
A 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine State sent more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing into Bangladesh.
About 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, including 120,000 people who are effectively confined to camps.

AIN DEFLA, Algeria (Reuters) - Algerian soldiers fired high-calibre rounds into a scrubby hillside of the Ain Defla mountains last week, part of an operation against the persistent threat of Islamist militants after they launched a fresh attack last month. 
They stalked in the rain between pine trees along muddy tracks, rifles raised, before dropping into a crouch, many of them too young to remember the 1990s jihadist insurgency that killed 200,000 Algerians. 
Two decades after that bloodshed ended, the militant threat in Algeria has mostly been contained. However, al Qaeda and other groups including an Islamic State branch still hold out in some remote areas, mostly in the vast desert border region with Sahel neighbours Mali and Niger. 
The operation in Ain Defla was aimed at a small group that the army believed to be hiding in the mountains, about 180 kms (112 miles) west of the capital Algiers. 
It had splintered from the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, one of Algeria's oldest militant organisations and the forerunner of its al Qaeda franchise, the army said. 
Reuters and a local news agency were escorted during the operation by the military. 
""Our goal is to fix, surround and liquidate a group of terrorists in this perimeter,"" said an army captain, calling it a combat mission. 
His column of five vehicles crawled across the barren terrain, using jamming devices to prevent militants using cell phones to detonate explosives. 
In the wet weather, it took the column nearly two hours to drive just 50 kms (30 miles) along the marshy tracks under the 2,000-metre (6,000-ft) peak of Mount Ouarsenis. 
In one place, soldiers sat behind sandbags under a bivouac looking out across a mountain valley, the wind ruffling the camouflage pattern sheet above them. 
JIHADIST STRUGGLE
Large-calibre gunfire rattled out across the landscape. The soldiers were shooting into an area they could not reach. 
""These shots are intended to clean areas where terrorists may be hiding,"" a colonel said. 
Algeria’s main security focus has shifted in recent years from the internal threat that once ran rampant through rural areas and dense cities to borders with unstable neighbours. 
""They are small in numbers, so you need to hunt them one by one,"" a security source said of militant groups still present in Algeria. 
Though some militants remain in areas like Ain Defla, the region’s traditional pastoral life continues. 
Lazali Belgacem, an animal herder in a brown hooded robe and yellow turban, said he felt safer than in the past as he led a donkey across a mountainside, his cows walking ahead. 
""I used to be very afraid of terrorists. They might kill or kidnap you,"" he said. 
In January, three soldiers and six armed men were killed in clashes in the Tipaza region, between Ain Defla and Algiers. 
It was a relatively rare recent episode in a jihadist struggle that has mostly moved into the deep sahara. 
Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), the most potent militant group operating in North Africa, has found more room for manouevre in the insurgencies rattling Mali and Niger. 
The former AQIM chief Abdelmalek Droukdel was killed in Mali last year. His successor, Algerian Abu Obaida Yusuf al-Annabi, is also thought to be based there.
AQIM, set up in 2007, seeks to replace Algeria's government with sharia rule but has not carried out any big attacks since the 2013 assault on a desert gas plant in which 40 workers and more than 20 militants were killed. 

Last year the Defence Ministry said it had killed 21 militants in Algeria. According to constitutional changes approved in a referendum last year, the military will in future be able to operate beyond Algeria’s borders in some cases.

899,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 06:25AM ET</span>",Explainer: Biden pledged to reunite migrant families separated by Trump policies. What happens now?,"By Mimi Dwyer and Mica Rosenberg
(Reuters) - U.S. president Joe Biden is on Tuesday expected to announce a task force to reunify families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border during the administration of former President Donald Trump.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Friday that Alejandro Mayorkas, Biden's nominee for Department of Homeland Security Secretary who still faces a confirmation vote in the U.S. Senate, would lead the task force. 
HOW MANY CHILDREN WERE SEPARATED?
In one of its most controversial policies to deter illegal migration, the Trump administration separated at least 5,500 migrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).
The separations happened mostly in 2017 and 2018, because parents were being criminally prosecuted for illegal entry or over concerns about their identities or criminal histories.
The blanket prosecution of border crossers, a practice known as ""zero tolerance,"" was officially announced in April 2018. Trump reversed himself in June after an international outcry.
Immigration attorneys and advocates, however, said children were separated before the official policy was announced and continued to be separated even after Trump ordered a halt to the practice.
U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw, overseeing a case filed by the ACLU in the Southern District of California, ordered the Trump administration to reunify about 4,000 children with their families. But hundreds of parents who were deported without their children were not given the option of returning to the United States.
In addition, there are about 1,500 separated children who were not included in the judge's reunification order because the U.S. government found the child might be in danger, according to the ACLU. But Lee Gelernt, the main ACLU attorney in the case, said those determinations were mostly based on inaccurate information or past crimes that did not merit such an action.
WHERE ARE THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN NOW?
Almost all of the children covered by Judge Sabraw's reunification order were eventually reconnected with their parents or released from government custody to sponsors, often family members, with their parents' consent. 
But attorneys and advocates are still trying to locate the parents of 611 children. According to the ACLU, parents of around 400 of the children have been deported and the remainder could be living in the United States. The government has failed to provide contact information for 18 of those children to the groups working on reunifications.
HOW ARE THE PARENTS BEING LOCATED?
The ACLU is working with other non-profit groups to search for parents by phone. They have created a toll-free number for parents to call and have conducted in-person searches in home countries such as Guatemala and Honduras. But the coronavirus pandemic and safety concerns have limited their ability to conduct these investigations, according to a brief filed in the case this month. 
WHAT HAS BIDEN PROMISED?
Biden pledged to create a task force to reunify families that are still separated and White House spokeswoman Psaki says the first lady, Jill Biden, is committed to the project, although it is not clear what role she may play. Advocates have called for counseling and support for parents and children who were separated, the right for deported parents to return to the United States, and a legal pathway for people affected to stay in the country.

The task force will make regular reports to President Biden and plans to work across government and with representatives of separated families, as well as with ""partners across the hemisphere to find parents and children separated by the Trump Administration,"" according to a factsheet distributed to reporters Monday. It will focus on but not be limited to families separated under the ""zero tolerance"" policy, officials said.

900,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 05:55AM ET</span>","Analysis: In China, post-coup Myanmar likely to find support if sanctions bite","By Yew Lun Tian and Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) - Three weeks before Myanmar's military commander took power in a coup, he met the Chinese government's top diplomat in an exchange that pointed to potential support as Myanmar faces the prospect of renewed Western sanctions.
China's foreign ministry noted the ""fraternal"" relationship as State Councillor Wang Yi met last month in Myanmar's capital with the military chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, making him one of the last foreign dignitaries to visit before the coup.
""China appreciates that the Myanmar military takes national revitalisation as its mission,"" the Chinese ministry said at the time.
Myanmar's own readout of the meeting proved more portentous.
It noted that the military raised complaints to Wang about Myanmar's Nov. 8 election, saying it was marred by fraud, including ""discrepancies with the voter lists"", and told him what the army was doing about it, without giving specifics.
Since the early Monday coup and the arrest of elected-leader Aung San Suu Kyi, China has stayed largely quiet, saying only it hoped for stability in a country where it ranks as the dominant trading partner, a major investor and a counterweight over years of pressure on Myanmar from the West over its suppression of democracy.
""China will be all too happy to recalibrate its engagement to recognise the new facts on the ground,"" wrote analysts at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
""That will likely soften the blow of any U.S. sanctions, which Min Aung Hlaing has doubtless already anticipated and dismissed.""
In Japan, a major donor with longstanding ties to Myanmar, State Minister of Defence Yasuhide Nakayama told Reuters that the world's democracies risk pushing Myanmar into China's arms if their response to the coup closes channels for communication with the generals. 
Chinese state media has largely held off commenting on what the coup means for China, or even using that word, with state news agency Xinhua referring to Monday's events as a ""major Cabinet reshuffle"".
STABILITY FIRST
Stability-obsessed China has deep ties to a military that ruled Myanmar for decades.
China has declined to say whether it was given warning that a coup was coming, but analysts played down the notion that last month's meeting had a bearing on events, or that Myanmar gave notice of the takeover.
""Myanmar's tumultuous transition to democracy in the past decade has greatly impacted China's economic interests in the country,"" said Li Mingjiang, associate professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.
""More than anything, China would've wanted stability in Myanmar, not a coup,"" he said.
China is well-connected in Myanmar following years of backing the old military government when it was subject to sweeping Western sanctions after Suu Kyi was put under house arrest in 1989 following pro-democracy protests. 
China later worked hard to build ties with Suu Kyi as political change swept the country, and she tried to reassure China that she did not consider it an enemy, visiting China several times and backing President Xi Jinping's extensive Belt and Road Initiative of energy and infrastructure projects.
Fighting along the border between Myanmar's army and ethnic minority guerrilla groups has on occasion over the last decade led to refugees pouring into China's Yunnan province, angering the Chinese government.
""As a neighbour on China's southern border, a split Myanmar in turmoil is obviously not what China wants to see,"" the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said in its overseas edition's WeChat account.
For its part, Myanmar has lingering suspicion of China's links with some militia forces that operate on the Myanmar side of their common border, and historically, Myanmar nationalists have viewed their huge neighbour with wariness.
Maw Htun Aung, a mining expert turned politician from Myanmar's Kachin State bordering China, who is aligned with neither the army nor Suu Kyi's ousted government, distrusted China's motives.

""It will take advantage of the crisis and will mainly focus on its political gain and regional influence,"" he said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Torture and forced labour are rife in North Korea's prisons, amounting to possible crimes against humanity, the U.N. human rights office said on Tuesday, as the Biden administration weighs fresh sanctions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme.
The report, issued seven years after a landmark U.N. investigation found that crimes against humanity were being committed, also said that political prison camps run by security forces still persisted, although information is more scarce.
“Not only does impunity prevail, but human rights violations that may amount to crimes against humanity continue to be committed,” Michelle Bachelet, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement. 
She urged world powers to pursue justice and prevent further violations. The report called for the U.N. Security Council to refer the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court for prosecutions or establish an ad hoc tribunal.
""Accountability for grave human rights violations and ongoing crimes against humanity should not be a secondary consideration in bringing North Korea to the negotiating table,"" U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told Reuters.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking on NBC News on Monday, said additional sanctions could be used against North Korea in coordination with U.S. allies as a way toward denuclearization of the divided Peninsula. Other tools include unspecified diplomatic incentives, he said.
North Korea denies the existence of political prison camps and last July denounced Britain for announcing sanctions against two organisations that the British government has said are involved in forced labour, torture and murder in the camps.
The U.N. report, citing interviews with former detainees, said it continued to receive ""consistent and credible accounts of the systematic infliction of severe physical and mental pain or suffering upon detainees, through the infliction of beatings, stress positions and starvation in places of detention."" 
This reconfirmed the 2014 findings of the U.N. inquiry, led by former Australian judge Michael Kirby (NYSE:KEX), and ""indicates that the crime against humanity of torture continues to take place in the ordinary prison system,"" it said.

Forced labour, ""which may amount to the crime against humanity of enslavement"" also persists in prisons, it said.

Many pro-British unionists fiercely oppose the new trade barriers introduced between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom as part of the Northern Ireland protocol, a standalone deal for the region after Britain left the EU.
""These things have certainly created a lot of tension in the community,"" Democratic Unionist Party politician Edwin Poots told BBC radio, adding that it was difficult for politicians to restrain the anger in the community.
""It's time for calm heads and for wise behavior,"" Poots said. He cast the EU's attempt to restrict vaccine exports across the Irish border as a ""crass act.""
A ""blunder"" by EU officials in briefly invoking and abruptly reversing emergency powers in the Northern Ireland protocol during a showdown with Britain over COVID-19 vaccines in recent days further angered unionists.
Northern Ireland temporarily suspended some post-Brexit checks at two ports on Monday after a local council withdrew staff over concerns for their safety and police said they planned to increase patrols at points of entry.

The council whose staff inspected goods at Larne Port said serious concerns around their safety were raised after a rise in ""sinister and menacing behaviour"" in recent weeks, including the appearance of graffiti describing port staff as ""targets"".

903,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 04:55AM ET</span>","Israel sees 6-month Iran nuclear breakout, longer than Blinken projection","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's energy minister said on Tuesday it would take Iran around six months to produce enough fissile material for a single nuclear weapon, a timeline almost twice as long as that anticipated by a senior member of the Biden administration.
Israel is wary of the Biden administration's intent to reenter the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal and has long opposed the agreement. Washington argues that the previous Trump administration's withdrawal from the deal backfired by prompting Iran to abandon caps on nuclear activities.
Speaking last month a day before he took office as U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken said that the so-called ""breakout time"" - in which Iran might ramp up enrichment of uranium to bomb-fuel purity - ""has gone from beyond a year (under the deal) to about three or four months"". He said he based his comments on information in public reporting.
But Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, in a radio interview, said the Trump administration ""seriously damaged Iran's nuclear project and entire force build-up"".
""In terms of enrichment, they (Iranians) are in a situation of breaking out in around half a year if they do everything required,"" he told public broadcaster Kan. ""As for nuclear weaponry, the range is around one or two years.""
Iran, which denies seeking nuclear weaponry, has recently accelerated its breaches of the deal, which it started violating in 2019 response to the U.S. withdrawal and reimposition of sanctions against it. 
The last quarterly estimates by the U.N. nuclear watchdog in November show that Iran's stock of enriched uranium had risen to 2.4 tonnes, more than 10 times the amount allowed under the deal but still a fraction of the more than eight tonnes it had before.

Since then Iran has started enriching uranium to higher purity, returning to the 20% it achieved before the deal from a previous maximum of 4.5%. The deal sets a limit of 3.67%, far below the 90% that is weapons grade.

904,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 04:41AM ET</span>","Explainer: Myanmar generals are back in charge, but for how long?","(Reuters) - The military is back in power in Myanmar after a coup less than a decade after it launched a transition to democracy to end nearly half a century of direct army rule and international isolation.
The military pledged to stick to its 2008 constitution and return power via a free and fair election but set no clear timeframe and the junta detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and purged her allies from the administration.
Economists say the coup could spook foreign investors and hit international development support, with the threat of a return of sanctions that made Myanmar among the world's poorest countries.
WHAT WAS ITS JUSTIFICATION?
The army said the administration had refused to act against ""terrible fraud"" in a Nov. 8 general election, which was won overwhelmingly by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party. The military said it took power ""to perform scrutiny of the voter lists"" and the coup would protect democracy. 
The military justified its coup within the parameters of the constitution, using a clause that allows for power to be transferred by the president to the armed forces chief in a state of emergency declared to address threats to the nation.
President Win Myint, a Suu Kyi ally, was among dozens of people detained early on Monday. Vice-president Myint Swe, a former general and member of the previous junta, then handed over power to the commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.
The electoral commission had repeatedly rejected the accusations of voter fraud.
WHAT OTHER FACTORS COULD THERE BE?
Observers with knowledge of Myanmar's secretive military suspect Min Aung Hlaing's personal ambitions and his limited options were a factor.
His mandatory retirement was imminent and it is highly unlikely an NLD-controlled parliament would have elected him president given the history of bad blood between the NLD and the army.
The military boss faces foreign accusations of war crimes against Rohingya Muslims, and is the subject of cases pending in international courts that could seek his arrest. 
Myanmar experts also see the coup as a means to prevent any chance of an NLD-dominated legislature amending the constitution to reduce the military's powers - which include the right to 25% of the seats in parliament, an effective veto over the legislature.
Such constitutional change might have been made easier by the poor performance in November's election by the Union Solidarity and Development Party, the military's proxy, which won only 33 of 476 seats.
WILL THE MILITARY CEDE POWER?
The state of emergency will last for one year, as prescribed by the constitution, and the junta chief on Monday pledged to hold elections ""upon completion of the tasks"".
But after sacking Suu Kyi's cabinet it appointed a new group of ministers, none of whom were identified as ""acting"" or interim appointments.
Activists have already voiced strong doubts that the military will step down after only a year. The army ignored the NLD's win in a 1990 election for a constituent assembly and took nearly two decades to complete its promised transition to democracy. 
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE ECONOMY?
The U.S. government has threatened renewed sanctions on Myanmar and the World Bank said the coup could hurt development prospects and gains in tackling poverty.
Political risk has been heightened by the takeover, with concern the junta will be preoccupied with establishing control and domestic security. 
Any pro-democracy protests could be met with force. The nascent economy and jobs could be hit if foreign investors are concerned about stability or reputation risks. Vital infrastructure projects might be stalled or even be halted if private or public funding is affected. 

Ratings agency Fitch called it a ""substantial backtracking of progress"" that will ""weigh heavily on policymaking, social stability as well as international perceptions of the country"".

KABUL (Reuters) - At least three people were killed and seven wounded in a series of explosions in Afghanistan on Tuesday, after Western countries called on the Taliban to end a wave of violence that the group denies responsibility for.
With Washington and NATO reviewing plans to withdraw their forces from the country by May, one blast in Kabul hit an SUV and killed two people, including Mohammad Atif, the head of non-governmental charity Jamiat-i-Islah, police in the capital said. 
Two other explosions in the city, which caused injuries, targeted, respectively, a jeep of the counter-narcotics force and a civilian vehicle.
All three blasts were caused by small magnetic devices known as sticky bombs, police said.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters the Kabul explosions ""had nothing to do with us.""
In the eastern city of Jalalabad, one soldier was killed and two injured in an explosion targeting their vehicle, Attaullah Khogyani, Nangarhar provincial governor spokesman, told Reuters. Another explosion in central Parwan province targeted a senior security official.
The European Union, NATO, and a number of Western embassies said on Sunday that the Taliban bore responsibility for ""the majority of this targeted violence.""
The group's attacks ""undermine state institutions and contribute to an insecure environment in which terrorist and criminal groups are able to freely operate,"" they added in a statement. 
Talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled, and President Joe Biden is reviewing an agreement to withdraw U.S. forces by May. 
On Sunday Reuters reported about 10,000 NATO troops in Afghanistan plan to stay beyond May, with exact plans to be decided this month.
""If U.S. or NATO troops remain in Afghanistan after 14 months, that means continuation of occupation in Afghanistan,"" Suhail Shaheen a Taliban negotiating team member said in Tehran on Monday. 
""In such a case we will have no choice to continue our jihad and struggle.""

906,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 02:30AM ET</span>",Japan set to extend state of emergency for another month,"By Elaine Lies and Daniel Leussink
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is set to extend a state of emergency in Tokyo and other regions for another month on Tuesday, seeking to keep the upper hand over a COVID-19 outbreak even as daily case numbers begin to edge down.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to formally announce the extension to March 7 later in the day following a recommendation from an expert coronavirus response panel.
""The number of new coronavirus cases is falling, but caution is still needed,"" Katsunobu Kato, chief cabinet secretary, told reporters before the panel met. Kato added that hospitals remained full and the death rate had not fallen.
Japan has reported a total of just under 392,000 COVID-19 cases, including just over 5,800 deaths. Tokyo reported 556 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday.
Suga and his government remain determined to host the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics, currently scheduled for July-August, despite the resurgence of the virus in Japan. 
The government last month imposed a one-month state of emergency for 11 areas, including Tokyo and neighbouring prefectures as well as the western city of Osaka, to combat the country's third and most lethal coronavirus wave. 
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who also oversees coronavirus policies, said Tochigi prefecture, north of the capital, was excluded from the extension.
However, official measures to control the coronavirus have been hamstrung by a lack of legal weight, including any penalties, meaning the government can only request people follow directives.
That may change later this week with the passage of a revision to the coronavirus special measures law that will allow authorities to levy fines on people who break the law. The revision passed the lower house on Monday and is expected to be approved by the upper house on Wednesday. 
Under the current state of emergency, scheduled to end on Sunday, restaurants and bars are requested to trade for shorter hours and people encouraged to stay home as much as possible. The Nikkei daily newspaper reported that gyms, cinemas and karaoke establishments could be added if new daily infections in Tokyo rise above 1,000 for several consecutive days.
With Japan behind other nations rolling out vaccination programmes, the government has pledged to start inoculating medical workers at the end of February. NHK reported on Tuesday that approval for the  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) vaccine could come as early as Feb. 12.

Support for Suga's government has been battered by disapproval of his handling of the pandemic, a situation not helped when several ruling coalition lawmakers admitted to flouting rules by visiting hostess clubs and bars late at night. One resigned his seat on Monday and three others left Suga's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

907,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 02, 2021 02:11AM ET</span>",Lights out: Brexit shuts off market for English cheese truckles,"MATLOCK, England (Reuters) - An English company that has long been selling its wax-coated mini barrels of cheese directly to European consumers says it can no longer do so because of Brexit, pushing it to consider new investment in France.
Last year The Cheshire Cheese company sold 180,000 pounds ($247,000) worth of artisan truckles -- the traditional name for cheese shaped like a barrel -- to European Union customers, but Managing Director Simon Spurrell says that is no longer possible.
""That's completely gone. At the moment we've had to just switch that light out,"" said Spurrell, surrounded by milking cows at the company's creamery near Matlock, northern England.
London and Brussels agreed a last-minute trade deal last December which averted border tariffs, but many companies, particularly smaller ones, have warned that the deal has thrown up new obstacles to trade that are killing business.
Spurrell can no longer sell cheese gift boxes worth around 25 pounds to the EU through his online shop because each consignment needs to be accompanied by a health certificate signed off by a vet that costs 180 pounds per consignment, regardless of size.
The company has therefore put on hold plans for a 1 million pound new distribution centre in Macclesfield, northern England, and is instead considering setting up its own hub in France, where it can still ship on a wholesale basis.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson argued that Britain would be free to trade globally once it had cast off the shackles of the EU and has said the bureaucratic snags are teething problems.
But for many companies that built up markets in the world's biggest trading bloc during Britain's 47-year membership, the new relationship is hitting sales and putting pressure on jobs and investment.
Smaller firms are bearing the brunt of the fallout, from specialist beef producers to shoe makers and fishing crews.
At The Cheshire Cheese Company, which sells a type of crumbly cheese first recorded over 400 years ago, recent investments in multi-lingual websites helped European online sales jump last year and they had been forecasting a 40% rise this year. 

Spurrell thinks that the lack of an exemption from costly certificates for direct consumer sales was an oversight as negotiators rushed to seal the deal. He's in touch with the government about the difficulties he's facing but time is running out.

The UAE had during Donald Trump's last day in office signed agreements to buy up to 50 F-35 jets, 18 armed drones and other defence equipment in a deal worth $23 billion.
""We did everything by the book and they will discover that once the review is complete and it will proceed,"" Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba told a virtual Washington Institute forum on Monday, describing the review as ""pro forma"".
Last month, a U.S. State Department official said Biden's administration was temporarily pausing the implementation of some pending arms sales to U.S. allies to review them.
""Everything is still proceeding while undergoing a review at the same time. I am confident it will end up in the right place,"" Otaiba said.
""If you are going to have less of a presence and less involvement in the Middle East you can't at the same time take tools away from your partners who are expected to do more,"" he said.
The UAE was promised a chance to acquire the stealthy F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) in a side deal when it established ties with Israel last August under a U.S.-brokered agreement.

In December, the Senate rejected attempts to block the transaction, which opponents had said was being rushed through without sufficient assurances that the equipment would not fall into the wrong hands or fuel instability in the Middle East.

Canadian diplomat's T-shirt logo angers China,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Canada said it regretted a ""misunderstanding"" after China lodged a formal complaint over a diplomat's order of a custom T-shirt displaying the word Wuhan, the city where the COVID-19 pandemic first emerged, over the emblem of hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan.
The logo of the American group is a stylized ""W"". Reports of the T-shirt order circulating on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) described it as depicting a bat, without mentioning Wu-Tang Clan. Many scientists suspect bats to have been a reservoir for COVID-19 before it jumped to humans. 
It was not immediately clear how images of the T-shirt logo, which the Canadian embassy said was created early last year, came to circulate on Chinese social media. 
""We are very shocked by this and have lodged representations with Canada, asking for a thorough investigation and a clear explanation,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in response to a question at a daily briefing on Monday, adding that the virus should not be linked to specific countries or regions.
Beijing has been highly sensitive about the source of the virus, and has sought to cast doubt on the notion that it originated in China.
""The T-shirt logo designed by a member of the Embassy shows a stylized W, and is not intended to represent a bat. It was created for the team of Embassy staff working on repatriation of Canadians from Wuhan in early 2020,"" a spokesperson for Canada's foreign service told Reuters by email early on Tuesday. ""We regret the misunderstanding.""
Relations between Beijing and Ottawa have been strained since late 2018, when China arrested two Canadian men and accused them of spying, shortly after Canadian police arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant.

A team led by the World Health Organization is in Wuhan investigating the outbreak's origins.

Yang Jiechi, director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, is the highest ranking Chinese leader to speak on China-U.S. relations since President Joe Biden took office. 
Under the Trump administration, U.S. relations with China plunged to their lowest point since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1979, as both sides clashed over issues ranging from trade and technology to Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang, and the South China Sea.
While reassuring the United States that China has no intention to challenge or replace the U.S. position in the world, Yang stressed that no force can hold back China's development.
""The United States should stop interfering in Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang and other issues regarding China's territorial integrity and sovereignty,"" Yang said, defining these as issues concerning China's core interests and national dignity.
Speaking at an online forum organised by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations on Tuesday in Beijing, Yang said China never meddles with U.S. internal affairs, including its elections.
Yang, whose position in the ruling Communist Party gives him more influence than even the foreign minister, also urged the Biden administration not to abuse the concept of national security in trade.
""We in China hope that the United States will rise above the outdated mentality of zero-sum, major-power rivalry and work with China to keep the relationship on the right track,"" he said.
Yang reasserted that China is prepared to work with the United States to move the relationship forward along a track of ""no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation."" 

The word ""cooperation"" appeared 24 times in his speech. He suggested that U.S. firms could gain from an estimated 22 trillion dollars worth of exports to China in the coming decade.

The 26-year-old Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co 737-500 crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta on Jan. 9, killing all 62 people on board.
National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Chief Soerjanto Tjahjono told Reuters the components had been sent for examination to help find out why an autothrottle parameter had changed. He did not identify the other parts.
The plane's flight data recorder (FDR) has been found and read by investigators but a maritime search is going on for the cockpit voice recorder's (CVR) memory unit that Tjahjono said would help explain any human factors behind the crash.
""If we only have the FDR, we do not know why the parameter changed, what was the reason,"" he said of the autothrottle. ""We need confirmation from the components that we sent to the US and UK and the CVR.""
KNKT said last month it was investigating whether a problem with the autothrottle system contributed to the crash given an issue with it had been reported on a flight a few days earlier.
It is acceptable for a plane to fly with an autothrottle system that is not working because pilots can control it manually instead.
KNKT plans to issue a preliminary report into the crash soon, possibly on Feb. 9, Tjahjono said. 
Citing sources close to the investigation, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) last month reported the FDR data showed the autothrottle system was not operating properly on one of the plane's engines as it climbed on departure from Jakarta.
Instead of shutting off the system, the FDR indicated the pilots tried to get the stuck throttle to function, the WSJ said. That could create significant differences in power between engines, making the jet harder to control.

Tjahjono said the WSJ report was incorrect and more information would be provided in the KNKT's preliminary report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested a way on Monday to overcome the U.S.-Iranian impasse over who goes first in returning to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, saying a top EU official could ""synchronize"" or ""choreograph"" the moves.
Zarif's stance was a shift from his position, expressed in a Jan. 22 article in which he said the United States should remove U.S. sanctions before Iran returned to the deal.
""There can be a mechanism to basically either synchronize it or coordinate what can be done,"" Zarif told CNN when asked how to bridge the gap.
Each government wants the other to resume compliance first with the agreement, which former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in 2018 but which President Joe Biden as said he will rejoin if Iran resumed ""strict"" compliance.
Under the accord, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program to make it harder for it to develop nuclear weapons in return for relief from U.S. and other economic sanctions. 
Zarif noted the pact created a Joint Commission coordinated by the European Union foreign policy chief, now Josep Borrell. Borrell ""can ... sort of choreograph the actions"" needed from both sides, Zarif told CNN.
The commission includes the EU and the seven parties to the deal: Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States. 
After abandoning the deal, Trump reimposed U.S. sanctions and imposed new U.S. economic penalties on Iran.
Analysts said Zarif's stance might lay the ground for talks on reviving the deal despite Iran's prior insistence that the United States lift sanctions first.

""It is entirely unsurprising to me that we are hearing, amid a largely uncompromising position from the Iranians, occasional breadcrumbs that will enable them"" to enter into a negotiation, said Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution.

Turks had voted in favour of the constitutional changes in 2017, leading the country to switch from a parliamentary democracy to an executive presidential system despite strong backlash from opposition parties and critics.
Erdogan was elected president under the new system in 2018, with sweeping executive powers that opposition parties described as a ""one-man regime"". The AKP and their Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) allies have defended the system, saying it created a streamlined state apparatus.
""Perhaps, the time has come for Turkey to once again discuss a new constitution,"" Erdogan said following a cabinet meeting in Ankara. ""If we reach an understanding with our alliance partner, we may mobilise for a new constitution in the coming period,"" he said, adding that efforts should be transparent and shared with the public.
""No matter how much we change, it is not possible to erase the signs of coup and tutelage that have been inserted into the spirit of the constitution"", he said, adding he was upset that previous such attempts had foundered over the main opposition's ""uncompromising stance"".
Erdogan's remarks come weeks after MHP leader Devlet Bahceli suggested constitutional changes to ban the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) for separatism, a move the HDP condemned as an attempt to silence six million votes.
Bahceli has long been a fierce critic of the HDP and, like Erdogan, accuses it of links to Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought a 36-year-old insurgency in southeast Turkey. The HDP denies this. 
""Work on a constitution is not something that can be done under the shadow of groups linked to the terrorist organisation (PKK) with people whose mental and emotional ties to their country are broken,"" Erdogan said on Monday, without specifying.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have criticised what they see as increasing authoritarianism and threats to the rule of law under Erdogan, especially since a 2016 coup attempt that prompted sweeping crackdowns on his perceived opponents in public services, the military and elsewhere.

Turkish authorities have rejected the accusations, saying the measures were necessary for national security.

Officers said they were responding to a family disturbance call on Friday, and video taken during the incident showed police wrestling the girl to the ground in the snow. 
“You’re acting like a child,” an officer tells her.
“I am a child,” the girl, who appears to be Black, says as she screams, crying for her father.
The investigation comes months after Rochester was rocked by protests in the wake of a Black man suffocating and dying last year after city police put a hood over his head. 
An inquiry concluded that seven officers involved in the death of Daniel Prude, 41, acted within department policy and ethical standards. 
In Friday's incident, police were responding to a 911 call reporting ""family trouble,"" Rochester Deputy Police Chief Andre Anderson told reporters. He said the girl ""indicated she wanted to kill herself and she wanted to kill her mom."" 
After the girl tried to run away, officers handcuffed her and attempted to take her to a hospital in the patrol car, Anderson said.
Screaming ""I want my dad!"" she resisted their efforts to get her into the patrol car, the video showed.
""This is your last chance. Otherwise pepper spray is going into your eyeballs,"" an officer tells her, adding, ""I will call your dad."" 
Eventually, another officer says, ""Just spray her at this point.""
The girl screams. She pleads, ""Wipe my eyes, please!""
""Unbelievable,"" the officer sighs.
The girl's identity was not released and the video was blurred to provide anonymity. A representative for the child's family could not be immediately identified.
After Prude's death, Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren fired the police chief, La'Ron Singletary, and named Cynthia Herriott-Sullivan as the first woman to run the department. 

Video footage, released by Prude's family, showed officers using a mesh hood and pinning him to the pavement, in a scene reminiscent of George Floyd's May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody that sparked worldwide anti-racism protests.

Students at the Bogazici University in Istanbul began their protests nearly a month ago, saying the appointment of Melih Bulu as rector was undemocratic. Teachers at Bogazici have also protested Bulu's swearing-in.
Protesters chanting slogans such as ""Police, get out"" and ""Universities are ours"" clashed and scuffled with the police on Monday.
In a statement, the Istanbul Governor's office said 159 people had later been detained for ""not ending the demonstrations in front of the Bogazici University despite warnings,"" and added that an investigation had been launched.
Earlier, more than 100 police gathered at the main entrance of the campus. They allowed university students to enter, checking their IDs, but told others to leave, including several lawmakers, mainly from the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP).
Sidewalks next to the roads leading up to the university were fenced off, and minor scuffles broke out as some protesters began chanting and walking toward the police barricade.
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), criticised the detentions late on Monday on Twitter, calling on Bulu to resign to end ""this ugly situation"".
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, also from the CHP, said he had spoken with authorities to establish dialogue between them and the protesters, adding he would meet with Bogazici students on Tuesday to hear their concerns.
Bulu, who has applied to be a candidate for Erdogan's ruling AK Party in a 2015 parliamentary election, was the first rector chosen from outside a university since a military coup in Turkey in 1980, Bogazici faculty members have said.
The protesters have also been demanding the release of four people who had been detained after images were shared on social media of them laying a picture on the ground that mixed sacred Islamic iconography with symbols supporting LGBT issues.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A close ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Monday urged the West to hit President Vladimir Putin's inner circle with personal sanctions, predicting the move could trigger potentially destabilising infighting among Russia's elite.
Leonid Volkov, who is wanted by Russian authorities on accusations he illegally encouraged minors to attend anti-Kremlin protests, made the call on the eve of a court hearing that could see Navalny jailed for three-and-a-half years.
Navalny, one of Putin's most prominent critics, was arrested last month after returning to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent. Navalny accuses Putin of ordering his murder, something the Kremlin denies.
""We very much hope that there will be tough sanctions against the people on whom Putin relies, against his money men and his inner circle. It will be an extremely unpleasant blow to Putin and punishment for his criminal acts,"" Volkov told Reuters in an interview by video call.
""This will give us intra-elite conflicts,"" he said, adding he hoped such a move would bring pressure from Putin's allies to end the crackdown on Navalny or to compensate them for any financial losses or travel bans resulting from sanctions.
The Kremlin on Monday said moves by Navalny's allies to encourage the West to hit Russia with sanctions showed they were acting as ""foreign agents"" and said any new sanctions would be unacceptable.
Vladimir Ashurkov, another Navalny ally, published a letter addressed to U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday appealing for sanctions against businessmen and officials identified as being close Putin allies.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday the United States was reviewing possible responses to Moscow's actions.
The Kremlin has cast Navalny as a CIA asset bent on destabilising he country, an allegation Navalny denies, and has said the protests calling for this release are illegal and risk spreading COVID-19.

Volkov, who is outside Russia and declined to give his location, has helped organise two successive weekends of protests demanding Navalny be freed.

""We are going to see if there is any responsibility on the part of any officials or public servants of the National Migration Institute itself,"" Mexico's interior minister, Olga Sanchez, said on Monday.
State prosecutors have so far genetically identified two Guatemalans and two Mexicans among the 19 victims, whose bodies were badly charred.
Some Guatemalan families have said they feared loved ones trying to migrate to the United States were among those killed in Tamaulipas.
A truck found at the scene of the crime had been seized by immigration authorities in the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon in December, local media reported. 
Nuevo Leon's immigration institute did not respond to requests for comment about the truck's seizure. Nuevo Leon's prosecutor's office referred Reuters to Tamaulipas' prosecutor's office, which on Saturday said the truck had been located at the scene of a ""rescue"" of 66 foreigners by local police and immigration authorities in December. The office said on Monday it could not confirm the truck's subsequent seizure by the immigration agency.
Sanchez said the federal government was aware of the truck and the fact that it may have been in the possession of immigration authorities but said that the matter was still under investigation.
The killings have caused renewed consternation in Mexico about the perils faced by migrants, many of whom come from the three violent and impoverished Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is due to brief the 15-member body, said Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD). Britain holds the monthly rotating presidency of the council for February. 
""We want to look in particular at the threats that climate poses to conflict, to peace and security, the way in which droughts lead to famine, famine and floods can cause displacement, they can cause conflict very easily,"" she said. 
""So we want to explore these sorts of linkages and look at ways of preventing risks to peace and security,"" Woodward said.
She said several other council members had indicated that they would also be represented by leaders at the meeting. 
The Security Council is charged with maintaining international peace and security. 

In 2011 the council adopted a statement expressing concern ""that possible adverse effects of climate change may, in the long run, aggravate certain existing threats to international peace and security.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel and Kosovo established diplomatic relations on Monday, via online links due to the coronavirus crisis, under a U.S.-brokered deal that includes a pledge by the Muslim-majority country to open an embassy in Jerusalem. 
Israel sees its new ties with the tiny Balkan country as part of its broader normalisation with Arab and Muslim countries under agreements sponsored by former U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Trump announced the two countries' ties in September as a side deal to an economic agreement between Kosovo and Serbia. As part of the deal, Serbia, which has ties with Israel, also agreed to open an embassy in Jerusalem.
During a signing ceremony held via Zoom video conference, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said the new ties were ""historic"" and ""reflect a change in the region, and in the Arab (and) Muslim world's relationship with Israel"".
Ashkenazi said he had received an official request from Kosovo to establish a Jerusalem embassy, which Israeli officials hope will open by end-March. 
Only two countries - the United States and Guatemala - have embassies in Jerusalem. Others, including Malawi and Honduras, have pledged to make the move. 
The status of Jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to forging a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, who with broad international backing want East Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as their capital.
The ceremony included the unveiling of a commemorative plaque that will be placed at the entrance to Kosovo's embassy in Jerusalem upon opening, Israel's foreign ministry said. 
Kosovo Foreign Minister Meliza Haradinaj-Stublla said Kosovo and Israel share a ""historic bond"" and had both ""witnessed a long and challenging path to existing as a people and becoming states"".
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, almost a decade after a guerrilla uprising by its ethnic Albanian majority.
Haradinaj-Stublla said Kosovo had received support for the agreement from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. 
(Story corrects to show that Kosovo FM said she received support from the U.S. Secretary of State, not that she spoke with him)

The February 2020 agreement between the Taliban and the United States calls for a complete withdrawal of U.S. troops by May 2021 in return for the insurgents fulfilling security guarantees.
While Biden has not formally changed the May deadline, officials have said the Taliban has not been living up to its commitments under the deal and the deadline is likely to be extended.
The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, said in a report that the U.S. military had reported that ""enemy initiated attacks"" between October and December 2020 were higher than those in the same period in 2019. 
In particular, there was an increase in attacks in the capital city of Kabul. 
""U.S. Forces-Afghanistan said this quarter enemy attacks in Kabul were higher than they were last quarter, and 'much higher' than in the same quarter a year prior,"" the report said. 
It added that despite the violence, casualties this quarter were down 14% compared with the previous quarter and down 5% in 2020 compared with 2019. 
An Afghan peace ministry official suffered light injuries in a bomb blast in Kabul on Monday.
The Taliban and the Afghan government have been negotiating in Qatar to reach a peace deal. Those talks resumed in January after an almost month-long break, but negotiators and diplomats say there has since been little progress.

Reuters reported on Sunday that international troops plan to stay in Afghanistan beyond the May deadline, a move that could escalate tensions with the Taliban demanding full withdrawal.

Last month Washington slapped sanctions on several Ukrainian individuals and entities, accusing them of interference in U.S. elections and associating with a pro-Russian Ukrainian lawmaker linked to efforts by then-President Donald Trump's allies to dig up dirt on his successor, Joe Biden, and his son. 
Dubinsky denies the election meddling allegations and in a statement on Monday accused his colleagues of ""cowardice and meanness"".
""Unfortunately, the events of the last three weeks have clearly and distinctly demonstrated the true face of the actors on the political stage of Ukraine,"" he said. 
Daniil Getmantsev, a lawmaker with the ruling Servant of the People party, told Interfax Ukraine that Dubinsky had been ejected after a vote that was held over three days. 
The party's parliamentary faction leader David Arakhamia and another lawmaker, Olha Vasylevska-Smahliuk, said the majority of the its 246 lawmakers had voted to expel Dubinsky. 
Ukraine has sought to turn the page on relations with Washington after being unwillingly sucked into the political battle over Trump's impeachment in 2019. 
The Trump administration temporarily froze military aid to Ukraine as Trump pressed Zelenskiy's administration to investigate Biden. Washington has been Kyiv's most powerful ally against Russia since Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

Zelenskiy's administration has said it will hold people to account for meddling in U.S. elections, ""regardless of party affiliation"".

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations fears the coup in Myanmar will worsen the plight of some 600,000 Rohingya Muslims still in the country, a U.N. spokesman said on Monday as the U.N. Security Council planned to meet on the latest developments on Tuesday. 
Myanmar's military seized power on Monday in a coup against the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained along with other political leaders of in early morning raids.
A 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar's Rakhine state sent more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing into Bangladesh, where they are still stranded in refugee camps. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Western states accused the Myanmar military of ethnic cleansing, which it denied.
""There are about 600,000 Rohingya those that remain in Rakhine State, including 120,000 people who are effectively confined to camps, they cannot move freely and have extremely limited access to basic health and education services,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters. 
""So our fear is that the events may make the situation worse for them,"" he said. 
The 15-member U.N. Security Council plans to discuss Myanmar in a closed meeting on Tuesday, diplomats said.
""We want to address the long-term threats to peace and security, of course working closely with Myanmar's Asia and ASEAN neighbors,"" Britain's U.N. Ambassador Barbara  Woodward  (NASDAQ:WWD), president of the council for February, told reporters.
China, backed by Russia, shielded Myanmar from any significant council action after the 2017 military crackdown. Beijing and Moscow are council veto powers along with France, Britain and the United States.
The Myanmar army said it had detained Suu Kyi and others in response to ""election fraud"", handing power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and imposing a state of emergency for one year.
The United Nations called for the release of all those detained, Dujarric said. He said Guterre's special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, ""remains actively engaged"" and is likely to brief the Security Council. 
The United Nations has long had a presence in Myanmar. Security Council envoys travelled to Myanmar in April 2018 and met separately with Suu Kyi and Min Aung Hlaing following the crackdown on the Rohingya.

""I am the pastor of people who are suffering,"" he told Catholic New Service (CNS), the news outlet of the U.S. Bishops Conference.
Francis said it was important that ""they will see the pope is there in their country"" even if most would see him only on television because of social distancing requirements.
CNS said the 84-year-old pope intended to go ahead with the March 5-8 trip unless there is a serious new wave of coronavirus infection there.
The patriarch of Iraq's Chaldean Catholic Church said last week the pope would meet the country top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani.
The visit, which eluded Francis' predecessors, takes place amid deteriorating security in some parts of Iraq and after the first big suicide bombing in Baghdad for three years.
CNS did not say if the pope discussed security during an audience granted to its Rome staff on the occasion of the agency's 100th anniversary.

Iraq has been home to Christian communities for centuries. Hundreds of thousands of Christians fled sectarian violence after the fall of Saddam Hussein or were driven out when Islamic State captured much of the north in 2014.

928,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 12:06PM ET</span>",Closed highway and dangerous desert detour underline challenges to Libyan peace,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyans watching a peace process nearing a critical phase this week in Switzerland need only try driving from one side of their country to the other to understand the obstacles to diplomacy.
An October ceasefire called for all foreign mercenaries to leave the country and for the main coastal road between west and east to reopen. But the mercenaries remain, the United Nations said last week, and the road is shut.
For those who cannot take one of the flights that resumed last year between the capital Tripoli in the west and Benghazi in the east, it means a long, dangerous detour through the desert.
""Drivers face violence and abuse. Sometimes we lose contact with the drivers for two days until they reach safety and can get a mobile signal,"" said a transport company worker, who asked not to be named fearing reprisals from armed groups.
A 24-year-old driver from Benghazi, waiting in Tripoli to fill his minibus with goods to take back, said he had no other way to make a living. 
""The road is difficult and there is a lot of looting. The trip takes about a day and a half,"" he said. That is double the time it would take along the coastal road.
The continued closure of the key artery, and lawlessness along alternative routes, underline how Libya remains beset by instability 10 years after the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi but unleashed civil war.
The United Nations last week urged both sides of the conflict to reopen the road, as it hosts a meeting near Geneva to select a new transitional government for the whole country to oversee the run-up to elections scheduled for December.
Belqasem Egzait, a member of the State Council set up as part of an earlier peace process, said he believed diplomacy was moving forward, but would be slow.
""The political track is by its nature complex. That complexity will continue,"" he told Reuters. 
However, some Libya experts have warned of the risk of renewed fighting as the process drags on.
The transport company worker said stories of attacks on drivers were commonplace.
""Last week a group of armed men stopped a driver and stole everything - even chemotherapy doses. The thugs will target anything they find."" 
OBSTACLES 
Libya has been split between factions in the west and east since 2014. 
The latest round of diplomacy follows the failure last year of Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) to capture Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).
In recent interviews with Reuters, leaders on both sides of the frontlines accused each other of refusing to abide by ceasefire terms that temporarily halted the 14-month assault.
The GNA defence minister, Saleh Namroush, who has nominated himself for a leadership role in the transitional government, said the LNA was bringing in more equipment and digging new defences. 
But in Benghazi, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari blamed armed groups in the west for breaching the agreement.
Along the frontline between the cities of Sirte and Misrata, a joint military committee is still discussing ceasefire terms. Both sides have dug in.
On the GNA side, a local field commander, Musa Araibi Mayouf, said the absence of fighting since the summer showed that the current talks were serious. But he acknowledged the risk of a return to warfare.

""There are obstacles. And they are the gentlemen who sit in the political chairs,"" he said. His fighters, in camouflage uniforms, stood atop their ""technicals"" - pick-up trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns.

929,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 11:10AM ET</span>",Bolsonaro allies poised to win leadership of Brazil's Congress,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Allies of Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro are set to win leadership roles in Congress on Monday, bolstering his standing but not necessarily his economic team's reform agenda, analysts and politicians said.
Rodrigo Pacheco of the center-right Democrats party, whom Bolsonaro has endorsed, is expected to easily win election as president of the Senate, with 55-60 votes in the 81-seat chamber, according to risk consultancy Arko Advice.
Pacheco recently said he would not make a priority of privatizing Eletrobras, Latin America's largest utility and one of the government's biggest potential asset sales as it works to cut the fiscal deficit. He also disagrees with Bolsonaro's policies easing environmental enforcement and gun sales.
For speaker of the lower house, the right-wing Liberal Party's candidate, Arthur Lira, has widened his lead over Luiz Felipe Baleia Rossi, of the centrist MDB party, who is backed by left-wing lawmakers pushing to spend more on assistance to low-income Brazilians hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.
On Sunday, the center-right Democrats party decided not to back any candidate in the 513-seat chamber, effectively pulling its support for Baleia Rossi and ensuring Lira a majority.
The decision was a defeat for incumbent speaker Rodrigo Maia, a member of the Democrats party, who has sought to keep Congress independent from the Bolsonaro government in setting the legislative agenda. 
Lira has some 280-300 votes, according to Congressman Marcelo Ramos who is in line to become his deputy speaker.
Bolsonaro's growing influence over Congress should dispel for now the growing clamor for impeachment from critics who have filed 57 requests to unseat him, mainly for his handling of the pandemic that has killed some 224,000 Brazilians.
Upset by the news that his party was abandoning his favored candidate, Maia reportedly threatened on Sunday to authorize the opening of impeachment proceedings on his last day as speaker, according to newspapers Estado de S. Paulo and Folha de S.Paulo.
Representatives for Maia declined to comment on the reports.
Despite deep recession and the world's second-deadliest COVID-19 outbreak, polls show Bolsonaro retaining his core support of a third of the electorate, though his negatives rose in January as the second wave of the pandemic began to bite.
His popular support, along with a growing willingness to discuss traditional horse-trading in Congress, have helped him secure a political base of center-right lawmakers.
Opening the pork barrel tap has also helped. Newspaper Estado de S. Paulo reported last week that Bolsonaro authorized 3 billion reais ($550 million) in pork barrel spending in the districts of 250 lawmakers and 35 senators.

($1 = 5.45 reais)

BEDFORD, England (Reuters) -Prime Minister Boris Johnson was among a host of well-wishers from Britain and beyond willing record-breaking fundraiser Captain Tom Moore to pull through after the centenarian was admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
Moore, who raised more than 30 million pounds ($41 million)for health service workers by walking 100 lengths of his garden during last year's lockdown, was admitted to Bedford hospital after testing positive for the virus, his daughter said on Sunday.
""I spoke to the family last night, and all I can say is Captain Tom Moore has been an inspiration to everybody in this country during this pandemic,"" Johnson told reporters during a visit to northern England.
""Our thoughts and our prayers are now with him and with his family,"" he said.
The World War Two veteran caught the public's imagination in April, just before his 100th birthday, when he was filmed doing his sponsored walk with the help of a walking frame around his garden in the village of Marston Moretaine, 80kms (50 miles) north of London.
He hoped to raise 1,000 pounds. Instead, he raised about 33 million pounds for the National Health Service, broke two Guinness world records, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, scored a No. 1 single, wrote an autobiography and helped set up a charity.
""Pray for Tom"", the Sun tabloid's front page headline said, a message echoed by other papers which carried prominent pictures and stories about Moore. 
Moore went on vacation with his family to Barbados in December but his daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, said that over the last few weeks he had been treated for pneumonia, and last week tested positive for COVID-19. 
""He was at home with us until today when he needed additional help with his breathing. He is being treated in a ward, although he is not in ICU (intensive care unit),"" she said on Twitter.
Britain is currently vaccinating all its elderly population against the coronavirus, but Sky News quoted a family representative as saying Moore had not yet received a shot because he was being treated for pneumonia.
Messages of support came in from politicians and the likes of the British army, the England soccer team and Michael Ball (NYSE:BLL), with whom he joined to record a number one single with a cover version of ""You’ll Never Walk Alone"".

""My thoughts are with @captaintommoore and his loving family and friends,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said on Twitter.

Last week, health authorities said the new, more contagious variant was responsible for around a third of all new infections in the Netherlands.
The 'British mutation' was seen to be almost 50% more contagious than the older variant, based on calculations up until Jan. 14, De Jonge wrote in a letter to parliament.
The Dutch government has repeatedly warned that new mutations could lead to a new wave of infections in the coming weeks, despite a steady drop in the number of COVID-19 cases since the start of the year.
To stop the spread of new mutations, a nighttime curfew was added to an already broad lockdown last week.
But in a first step towards easing measures, the government on Sunday decided to reopen primary schools as of next week, as young children were still seen to be playing only a marginal role in the transmission of the disease.
Dutch media on Monday reported that the government was also considering scrapping the curfew early next week.
On Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections in the Netherlands dropped to its lowest level in 4 months, at 3,280.

Since the start of the pandemic almost 1 million coronavirus infections in the Netherlands have been reported, with over 14,000 deaths.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's co-ruling Democratic Party (PD) will not let Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri be shunted aside in any cabinet reshuffle that might arise from the government crisis, political sources said on Monday.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was forced to resign last week when a junior partner, Italia Viva, quit the 17-month-old coalition in a row over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent economic meltdown.
The former government allies are holding talks to try to overcome their differences and revive their alliance.
Political sources say Italia Viva, headed by former premier Matteo Renzi, wants to see a major cabinet shake-up, including the removal of Gualtieri, a leading PD figure, to signal a clear break with the past.
However, PD sources, as well as political sources outside the party, said they would not let Gualtieri be sacrificed. 
""Renzi kicks up four or five dust storms, but then settles back on more achievable goals,"" a PD minister told Reuters, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Separately a source who had talked with President Sergio Mattarella -- the man tasked with finding a solution to the turmoil -- said the head of state wanted ""continuity"" in the main ministries, including the economy, health and defence portfolios.
The source added that continuity could be provided by another person, but only if they were heavyweight figures.
Renzi has not publicly criticised Gualtieri and has repeatedly refused to talk openly about any eventual reshuffle, saying it was important to focus instead on policies, such as how best to spend more than 200 billion euros ($243 billion) from a European Union fund to help Italy's battered economy.
In a newsletter to supporters on Monday, he sounded upbeat about the prospect of finding a deal.
""At the end of this week we will have, I hope, a new government. It will have to be up to the challenges of this time. And it must be a government of capable and competent people. This is the only way to save Italy,"" he wrote.
The speaker of the lower house of parliament, Roberto Fico, is leading mediation efforts between the coalition parties. He is due to report back to Mattarella on his progress on Tuesday.
Renzi said last week that if a political accord could not be found, he would support the creation of a government of technocrats that would need cross-party support in parliament.

An Italia Viva source told Reuters on Sunday that the party would like to former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi become prime minister.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Twitter blocked dozens of accounts in India on Monday, including that of a leading newsmagazine, on the demand of the government on grounds that the users were posting content aiming to incite violence, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The move by the social media giant came in the wake of protests by Indian farmers that took a violent turn last week, resulting in the killing of one demonstrator and injuries to hundreds of people, including police officers.
Tens of thousands of farmers have camped on the outskirts of New Delhi for more than two months, demanding the withdrawal of new agricultural laws that they say benefit private buyers at the expense of growers.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government denies this, saying the reforms open up new opportunities for farmers to sell their produce directly to private buyers.
A government official said the Home Affairs Ministry had demanded the suspension of ""close to 250 Twitter accounts"" that were allegedly posting content that sought to foment violence. 
""The order was issued against accounts that were using the hashtag #modiplanningfarmersgenocide that started on Jan. 30,"" the government source said. 
""Genocide incitement is a public offence and a great threat to public order,"" said the official, who asked not to be named as he was not authorised to publicly discuss the matter. 
India's information technology laws empower the government to seek to block online content deemed as inciting disruption to public order. 
The Home Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Twitter said it complies with official orders, as required.
""If we receive a properly scoped request from an authorized entity, it may be necessary to withhold access to certain content in a particular country from time to time,"" a Twitter spokeswoman said in a statement. 
She added that Twitter policy is to ""promptly"" notify the holders of the affected accounts when it receives requests to withhold them, unless it is prohibited from doing so.
Vinod Jose, editorial director of The Caravan magazine, whose official Twitter account had a following of more than 280,000 and had tweeted reporting on the farmers' protests, was also blocked along with the accounts of many farm leaders and protest supporters.
Jose told Reuters that Caravan had received no word from Twitter on the account suspension. ""This is akin to censorship. Twitter's act follows multiple cases of sedition filed against Caravan editors for covering the farmers protests,"" he said. 

The suspended accounts include popular reports by agitating farmers keen to build public momentum for their campaign.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine filed a supreme court challenge on Monday seeking cancellation of the results of a presidential election that handed victory to incumbent Yoweri Museveni, his party's lawyer said.
Museveni, a former guerrilla leader who has led the East African country since 1986, was declared winner of the Jan. 14 election with 59% of the vote, while Wine was given 35%.
""We want the poll cancelled and repeated,"" said George Musisi, lawyer for Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP).
Wine, 38, a pop star and lawmaker, rejected the results and said he believed his victory was stolen. Musisi said Wine was asking the court to overturn the results on several grounds including widespread use of violence.
""There was outright ballot-stuffing, there was intimidation of NUP agents and supporters, some were arrested on the eve of the election, there was pre-ticking of ballots,"" he said.
The filing showed the judiciary could be trusted to adjudicate over the dispute fairly, Museveni's National Resistance Movement party told Reuters, adding the petition did not have much chance of succeeding.
""Kyagulanyi is trying to give his supporters a soft landing but inside himself he knows he lost genuinely,"" said Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Mulindwa, NRM's spokesman. 
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, used his youthful energy and a widespread Ugandan love of music to build a large following among young people and present a formidable challenge to Museveni.
On the campaign trail, which Wine once described as a ""war zone"", he was forced to wear a bulletproof vest and a ballistics helmet for safety reasons.
To keep a lid on Wine's support, authorities responded with a violent crackdown. His rallies were routinely broken up with bullets, beatings, teargas and detentions.
Wine was himself on various occasions prevented from appearing on radio talk shows during campaigns and blocked from going to certain parts of the country to canvass for votes.
Uganda's judiciary has over the years drawn criticism from the political opposition and some human rights activists for alleged partisan rulings in high-profile political cases.
Challenges to the results of all the four previous elections won by Museveni have been dismissed by the supreme court.

In the rulings, most judges acknowledged the elections were marred by irregularities, but said those irregularities could not have affected the election's ultimate result in a substantial manner.

936,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 07:40AM ET</span>",Russian prosecutors seek Navalny jail term as Kremlin tells U.S. to back off,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state prosecutors said they would back an effort to jail opposition politician Alexei Navalny for up to three and a half years at a court hearing on Tuesday, as the Kremlin said it would not heed U.S. complaints about his case. 
Riot police used forced to break up protests across Russia on Sunday calling for Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, to be freed. More than 5,300 people were detained in a massive show of force. 
That prompted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to condemn what he said was the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists, and to call for Navalny's release. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that Moscow would ignore Blinken's comments about what he said were illegal protests inside Russia and warned against Washington imposing any new sanctions. 
""...We are not prepared to accept or heed American statements about this,"" said Peskov. 
A court on Tuesday is set to consider a request from Moscow's prison service to hand Navalny a jail term of up to three and a half years for alleged parole violations which he calls trumped up.
The Prosecutor General's office said on Monday that the request was legal and justified and that state prosecutors would ask a court to grant the prison service's request. 
Navalny, 44, is serving a 30 day stint in jail after being immediately arrested upon arrival in Russia from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent attack in Russia. 
He says Putin ordered his murder, something the Kremlin denies. 
Sunday's nationwide rallies, held for a second straight weekend, drew an angry response from the Kremlin.
Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, on Monday said a large number of ""hooligans and provocateurs"" had been present who he accused of acting aggressively towards the police. 
""There can be no conversation with hooligans and provocateurs, the law should be applied with the utmost severity,"" Peskov told reporters. 
Pavel Chikov, a lawyer and rights advocate, said police had opened 40 criminal cases in 18 different regions related to the two weekends of protests. 

Navalny's allies have called on supporters to gather outside the Moscow court on Tuesday during his hearing, something the authorities are certain to characterise as an illegal protest.

937,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 07:06AM ET</span>","Myanmar military seizes power, detains elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi","(Reuters) -Myanmar's military seized power on Monday in a coup against the democratically elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained along with other leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party in early morning raids.
The army said it had carried out the detentions in response to ""election fraud"", handing power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and imposing a state of emergency for one year, according to a statement on a military-owned television station.
Suu Kyi's party published comments on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that it said had been written in anticipation of a coup, quoting her as saying people should protest against the military takeover.
The coup derails years of Western-backed efforts to establish democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma, where neighbouring China also has a powerful influence.
The generals made their move hours before parliament had been due to sit for the first time since the NLD's landslide win in a Nov. 8 general election viewed as a referendum on Suu Kyi's fledgling democratic rule. 
Phone and internet connections in the capital, Naypyitaw, and the main commercial centre of Yangon were disrupted and state television went off air after the NLD leaders were detained.
Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other NLD leaders were ""taken"" in the early hours of the morning, NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters by phone. Reuters was subsequently unable to contact him.
A video posted to Facebook by one MP appeared to show the arrest of another, regional lawmaker Pa Pa Han.
In the video, her husband pleads with men in military garb standing outside the gate. A young child can be seen clinging to his chest and wailing.
Troops and riot police stood by in Yangon where residents rushed to markets to stock up on supplies and others lined up at ATMs to withdraw cash. Banks subsequently suspended services due to poor internet connections.
The detentions came after days of escalating tension between the civilian government and the military in the aftermath of the election.
Suu Kyi's party won 83% of the vote in only the second election since the military agreed to share power in 2011.
BROKEN WINGS
The pre-written statement uploaded on an NLD Facebook page quoted Suu Kyi as saying such army actions would put Myanmar ""back under a dictatorship"".
""I urge people not to accept this, to respond and wholeheartedly to protest against the coup by the military,"" it quoted her as saying. Reuters was unable to reach any NLD officials to confirm the veracity of the statement.
Supporters of the military celebrated the coup, parading through Yangon in pickup trucks and waving national flags.
""Today is the day that people are happy,"" one nationalist monk told a crowd in a video published on Facebook.
But democracy activists and NLD voters were horrified and angry.
""Our country was a bird that was just learning to fly. Now the army broke our wings,” student activist Si Thu Tun said.
""The NLD is the government we voted for. If they're unhappy with the result, they can call another election. A coup isn't acceptable,"" said a woman, who declined to be identified, whose husband works for the military.
Senior NLD leader Win Htein said in a Facebook post the army chief's takeover demonstrated his ambition rather than concern for the country.
Health Minister Myint Htwe referred in a post to the ""evolving situation"" and said he was stepping down. He urged colleagues to serve the people, especially with regard to the coronavirus and vaccinations.
In the capital, security forces confined members of parliament to residential compounds on the day they had expected to take up their seats, representative Sai Lynn Myat said. 
'POTENTIAL FOR UNREST'
The military, summarising a meeting of the new junta, said Min Aung Hlaing had pledged to practice a ""genuine discipline-flourishing multiparty democratic system"" and promised a free and fair election and a handover of power to the winning party.
It gave no timeframe for an election but the military had already said the state of emergency would last a year.
The United Nations led condemnation of the coup and calls for the release of detainees and restoration of democracy in comments largely mirrored by Australia, Britain, the European Union, India, Japan and the United States.
""The military must reverse these actions immediately,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, while the U.S. embassy in Yangon issued an alert warning U.S. citizens of the ""potential for civil and political unrest"".
In Japan, a major aid donor with scores of businesses in Myanmar, a ruling party source said the government may have to rethink the strengthening of defence relations with the country undergone as part of regional efforts to counterbalance China.
China called on all sides in Myanmar to respect the constitution and uphold stability in a statement which ""noted"" events in the country rather than expressly condemning them.
Bangladesh, which is sheltering around one million Rohingya who fled violence in Myanmar, called for ""peace and stability"" and said it hoped a process to repatriate the refugees could move forward.
The Association of South East Asian Nations, of which Myanmar is a member, called for ""dialogue, reconciliation and the return to normalcy"" while in Bangkok, police clashed with a group of pro-democracy demonstrators outside Myanmar's embassy.
""It's their internal affair,"" a Thai government official said of events in Myanmar - a handsoff approach also taken by Malaysia and the Philippines.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, 75, came to power after a 2015 election win that followed decades of house arrest and struggle against the military, which seized power in a 1962 coup and stamped out all dissent for decades.
While still hugely popular at home, her international reputation was damaged after she failed to stop the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya Muslims in 2017.
Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh also condemned the takeover.
The November vote faced some criticism in the West for disenfranchising many Rohingya but the election commission rejected military complaints of fraud.

In its statement declaring the emergency, the military cited the failure of the commission to address complaints over voter lists, its refusal to postpone new parliamentary sessions and protests by groups unhappy with the vote.
""Unless this problem is resolved, it will obstruct the path to democracy and it must therefore be resolved according to the law,"" the military said, citing an emergency provision in the constitution in the event sovereignty is threatened.

Harry launched the legal action after an article in the paper in October said he had lost touch with the Marines, a commando force of the British navy with which he had a formal relationship until he stepped back from royal duties last March.
It added that Queen Elizabeth's grandson, officially titled the Duke of Sussex, had snubbed the armed forces and ignored correspondence from a former British military chief.
""All of these allegations are false as the Mail on Sunday and the Mail Online have accepted, albeit after considerable damage was already done,"" His lawyer, Jenny Afia, told a remote hearing at London's High Court on Monday.
The paper had agreed to pay damages which Harry would donate to the Invictus Games, an international sporting event he founded for military personnel wounded in action, she said.
Harry, who served in the armed forces for a decade and saw active service twice in Afghanistan before taking on the role of a full-time senior royal, had been appointed as Captain General Royal Marines by his grandmother in 2017.
But, as part of an arrangement negotiated with the queen and other senior royals, he had to give up the title when he quit official duties and moved to the United States with his wife Meghan and their son Archie. 
British media reported at the time he was upset at having to relinquish his military connections, which he highly valued.
""The baseless, false and defamatory stories ... constituted not only a personal attack on the duke's character but also wrongly brought into question his service to this country,"" Afia said.
Harry and Meghan's relationship with Britain's tabloid press has become increasingly hostile since they wed in 2018. Last April, the couple said they would no longer engage with four publications, including the Mail, accusing them of false and invasive coverage. 
Harry's libel case is separate from the action Meghan, 39, is taking against the Mail on Sunday, which she is suing over articles which included parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in 2018.

Last month she asked the High Court to rule that the paper breached her privacy and copyright, without the need for a potentially embarrassing trial, which is scheduled for later this year.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - While the world was grappling with the pandemic, a Hungarian family of four decided last summer to fulfil their dream: sailing around the globe in a 50-feet boat called ""Teatime.""
They left a Croatian port in late June 2020 and have since sailed around Italy and Spain, then stopped for some time on Cape Verde before crossing the Atlantic.
After having spent Christmas on Martinique, they are now anchored in Marigot, on the Caribbean island of St. Martin, waiting to sail towards the Panama canal.
They are in no rush, though, as life on the boat -- just as for many people quarantined in their homes -- has slowed down.
""For me it is a fantastic experience that I can spend a lot more time with my kids, instead of getting home late from work totally exhausted,"" said 48-year-old Domonkos Bosze, who set up a home office on the boat. He works in the IT business.
""Our route is fairly flexible: basically the weather defines which way we go, as the hurricane and cyclones seasons set the limits for sailing each region.""
He and his wife Anna, who have been sailing for more than a decade, had planned the adventure long before the COVID-19 pandemic.
While the pandemic presented them with the dilemma of whether this was the right time to go, in the end their determination overruled all worries and risks.
TEATIME ON SEA
So far the biggest challenge has been a six-hour storm during the Atlantic crossing which they managed well, losing only a toaster and the satellite phone which broke.
They follow the changes in coronavirus rules in each country and take a test or go into quarantine as required. 
""When we arrived in Martinique ... we told authorities that we just spent 16 days on the open seas and they accepted that as quarantine,"" Bosze said.
Nonetheless, the boat is filled with enough foodstuff for a month. And they catch their own tuna or mahi mahi (dorado), much to the joy of their 6- and 8-year-old daughters.
The two girls do remote learning, and will be enrolled in local schools if possible to get familiar with different cultures.
Domonkos said a discussion with Jimmy Cornell, the legendary Romanian-born British yachtsman, had a great influence on their thinking when they planned the trip.
While being together all the time in a confined space posed some difficulties in the beginning, now everything goes like clockwork on ""Teatime"", named after the family's habit of sitting down for tea and chatter.
Anna said the trip has given her huge freedom even though she cooks regularly besides handling the sails if needed.
""We saw dolphins jumping at the bow of the boat and swimming with us, with the sea totally calm ... so we could see them clearly under water,"" she said, smiling.
Depending on COVID restrictions, they plan to sail on this year or next year towards the Pacific, and now they say their trip could last another 5-6 years, stopping for extended periods in the southern Pacific and on the Indian ocean.

Killings by small, magnetic bombs attached to the undercarriages of vehicles, as well as shootings, are unnerving Afghan officials, activists and journalists, and they are on the rise despite negotiations to end two decades of war.
The latest explosion occurred near an armoured vehicle that was taking Khoshnood Nabizada, a peace ministry official who is also editor in chief of the local Khaama Press agency, to work, Kabul police said. 
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) condemned the attack. ""Today's targeted attack in Kabul against a senior official involved in the peace process is another deplorable incident, akin to an attack on the peace process itself,"" UNAMA said on Twitter.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Government officials generally blame Islamist Taliban insurgents for all targeted killings, a tactic senior security officials and Western diplomats say is meant to instil fear while avoiding large-scale civilian casualties.
In a separate attack in Kabul on Monday, a bomb attached to an army vehicle in a western district of the city killed one officer and a civilian, police said. 
Bombings in recent weeks have targeted politicians, security officials, human rights activists and journalists.
The Taliban and the Afghan government have been negotiating in Qatar to reach a peace deal. Those talks resumed in January after an almost month-long break, but negotiators and diplomats say there has since been little progress.

Lai had been in custody since Dec. 3, except for when he was released on bail for about a week late last year. He was granted a HK$10 million ($1.3 million) bail by a lower court on Dec. 23 only for the Court of Final Appeal to bring him back into custody on Dec. 31 for another hearing.
His return to custody was related to Article 42 of the security law, which says that ""no bail shall be granted to a criminal suspect or defendant unless the judge has sufficient grounds for believing that the criminal suspect or defendant will not continue to commit acts endangering national security"".
On Monday, the Court of Final Appeal said the judgement will be handed down on a date to be notified at a later stage.
Lai was arrested in August when about 200 police officers raided the newsroom of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily tabloid newspaper.
Beijing imposed the sweeping national security law on the former British colony in June 2020 after months of pro-democracy protests. The law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent and it erodes freedoms in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city. Its supporters say it restores stability after months of unrest.
Prosecutors have accused Lai of breaching the law over statements he made on July 30 and Aug. 18, in which they allege he requested foreign interference in Hong Kong's affairs.

Under the new law, the onus is on the defendant to prove they would not be a national security threat if released on bail. Under Hong Kong's common law-based legal system, the onus has traditionally been on the prosecution to prove its case.

Footage posted on social media showed a crowd of several score gathered in the centre of Myanmar's biggest city to celebrate Senior General Min Aung Hlaing seizing power. But the mood elsewhere in the city was laced with fear, anger and frustration.
""I feel angry. I don’t want more military rule,"" said Zizawah, a 32-year-old commercial director who only wanted to give one name because of fear of reprisals.
""The way they act is like a dictatorship. All of us know who we voted for.""
Myanmar's army said it had detained elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy (NLD) party had won a landslide in a ballot in November that the military disputed.
""Today is the day that people are happy,"" one nationalist monk told a crowd of military supporters in a video published on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Suu Kyi is hugely popular in Mynamar as the figurehead of decades struggling to end previous juntas despite anger in Western countries over her handling of an exodus of Rohingya refugees fleeing an army crackdown in 2017.
""We had a lawful election. People voted for the one they preferred,"" said Theinny Oo, a development consultant.
""We have no protection under the law now. We feel insecure and in fear.""
News of the coup, announced on military-controlled media, broke sporadically because of major disruptions to internet connections for mobile phones that many people rely on for news and keeping in touch.
Queues formed at ATMs, but many stopped working because of the disruptions to the internet while banks announced that they were being forced to close.
Markets were busy as people rushed out to stock up on essentials.
""I went to the market twice this morning. I bought rice and groceries, said one 19-year-old woman in the Yankin district who was afraid to give her name. ""I don’t know what is happening. I am a bit scared.""
There was no sign of any anti-military protests on the streets of Yangon or in the administrative capital Naypyidaw, where parliament had been due to start it's first post-election sitting later on Monday.
Yangon had been the scene of protests in the 1980s and 2000s that ultimately helped lead to the military agreeing to a transition to democracy.
A verified NLD Facebook account published a statement on behalf of detained leader Suu Kyi that she had written before being detained, saying that people should not accept a military coup and should protest. NLD officials were not immediately available to comment on the statement.
The military, whose favoured party was drubbed in the Nov. 8 election, cited what it said was the electoral commission's refusal to address voting irregularities it had reported.
Pro-democracy activists, who had long complained of backsliding under Suu Kyi herself, were dismayed.
""Our country was a bird that was just learning to fly. Now the army broke our wings,” student activist Si Thu Tun said.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh called for ""peace and stability"" in Myanmar after a military coup on Monday, and said it hoped its neighbour makes genuine efforts to move forward the stalled process of voluntary repatriation of Rohingya Muslim refugees.
Mainly-Muslim Bangladesh has sheltered 1 million Rohingya who had fled violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where most of them are denied citizenship.
A UN-backed repatriation process has failed to take off despite multiple attempts from Bangladesh, which has now started sending some refugees to an isolated island in the Bay of Bengal.
""We have been persistent in developing mutually beneficial relations with Myanmar and have been working with Myanmar for the voluntary, safe and sustained repatriation of the Rohingya sheltered in Bangladesh,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Reuters in a statement.
""We expect these processes to continue in right earnest.""
Myanmar's military seized power on Monday in a coup against the democratically elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained along with other leaders of her National League for Democracy party in early morning raids.
""We hope that the democratic process and constitutional arrangements will be upheld in Myanmar,"" Bangladesh said. 
Suu Kyi's international reputation was damaged after she failed to stop the forced expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya from western Rakhine State in 2017.
Nevertheless, Rohingya in Bangladesh expressed fears for their people still in Myanmar following the military's ouster of Suu Kyi.
""She was no good for us but there was still hope that through the democratic process we could achieve our rights. Now it seems Myanmar has no democratic future in the near term,"" a 31-year-old Rohingya told Reuters by telephone from a refugee camp, asking not to be named for fear of reprisal.

A suicide car bombing on Sunday evening was followed by a shootout between al Shabaab militants and security forces at the Hotel Afrik.
""The operation is over now. Nine people including four attackers died and over 10 civilians were injured,"" Sadik Ali, told reporters from the scene and via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The attack on a hotel in the heart of the heavily fortified city comes as Somali politicians wrangle acrimoniously over delayed elections and follows the withdrawal of around 700 U.S. military personnel last month. 
The U.S. troops were largely supporting Somali special forces known as Danaab who are skilled at complex operations against high level al Shabaab targets. 
They also enjoyed considerable support from the Americans, including air support and medical evacuations, and some Somali politicians have raised fears the pullout ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump could weaken the fight against al Shabab. 
The insurgency has battled since 2008 to overthrow Somalia's internationally-backed central government and establish its rule, based on its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law.
It carries out regular gun and bomb attacks in Mogadishu and elsewhere in Somalia.
It has also vowed to disrupt national elections, which were scheduled to begin in December but have been delayed after the opposition accused the president of packing the electoral board with his allies. Newly appointed legislators were meant to pick a president on Feb. 8, but even the elections for lawmakers have yet to be held. 
Times of political turmoil have also traditionally provided a boost to the insurgency, as security chiefs may be ordered to concentrate on political rivals rather than al Shabaab. 
Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble said in a statement that former military general Mohamed Nur Galal was among those killed in Monday's attack.

""I condemn the barbaric attack,"" he said. ""General Mohamed Nur Galal will be remembered for his over 50 year role in defending the country.""

951,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 03:21AM ET</span>","'Loved ones, not numbers': Inside a British funeral business as COVID deaths surge","By Andrew R.C. Marshall
LONDON (Reuters) - It was a normal busy winter for British funeral director Matthew Uden until the second week of January. ""Then it was like someone flicked a switch,"" he said.
As Britain's COVID-19 death toll surged into six figures, the phones at W. Uden & Sons, his family's business in south London, started ringing almost non-stop.
Uden & Sons usually arranges about 10 funerals a day during the winter. Now it is doing 15 or 16, with dozens more bodies awaiting collection from hospitals and care homes.
With the deceased arriving faster than they can be cremated or buried, the company's own mortuaries are packed with coffins, many pinned with a sign: ""COVID-19 - TAKE PRECAUTIONS.""
Britain has recorded more COVID-19 deaths per capita than any other country, but Matthew Uden said he refused to be numbed by the escalating toll.
""These are people's loved ones, they're not numbers,"" he said. ""No matter how busy we are, everyone is treated with the same dignity and respect.""
Staff at funeral homes play vital roles in the battle against the pandemic, but often get less recognition than doctors, nurses and other frontline workers.
Britain's funeral directors arranged around 90,000 more funerals in 2020 than in recent years, according to the National Association of Funeral Directors, a leading trade association.
""In terms of 2021 (funerals), we're currently about 30 percent up on a normal January/February,"" said Deborah Smith, the association's spokeswoman.
Reuters spent a day at Uden & Sons, where staff provided a rare window into love, death and grieving in the time of coronavirus, even as they worked long hours to keep up with the march of the dead.
The company was founded in Victorian times, when London endured regular epidemics of smallpox and cholera. Today, it has seven branches in the capital and the neighbouring county of Kent, where a deadlier and more transmissible variant of coronavirus emerged late last year.
On the Thursday when Reuters visited, the company's bearers carefully loaded coffins onto hearses parked outside its various branches.
On the same day, at the back of the shops, 19 bodies arrived from hospitals and care homes, and another three were collected overnight.
During the pandemic's first wave last spring, Uden said it took a week and a half to arrange a funeral. Now, families had to wait four or five weeks, as mortuary and registry staff struggled to process the sheer volume of deaths.
The company already has 130 funerals booked for February, among them an unusual number of ""double funerals,"" of husbands and wives who die around the same time.
Before the pandemic, they arranged about nine such funerals in a year. Now, they have nine in the next month alone. ""I've never seen anything like it,"" said Uden.
One couple had been married for over 50 years and died of COVID-19 within an hour of each other, he said.
SAYING GOODBYE
None of Uden's staff have caught the virus, which he credits to extra precautions the company has taken. All vehicles are sanitised between funerals, and the limousines have screens to separate driver and passengers.
In the mortuary, embalmer Mary Evans wears heavy duty personal protective equipment as she prepares the body of elderly COVID victim, and doesn't move the body more than necessary in case the lungs expel infected air droplets.
""When we see a deceased who has died from COVID and been very severely ill, it isn't very nice,"" said Evans. She said her work allowed families to ""see their loved ones at rest, looking as peaceful as they can.""
Funeral workers are accustomed to death, but the pandemic had still taken an emotional toll, said Matthew Uden.
His eyes teared up when he recalled a ""remarkable"" 12-year-old girl who, despite losing her father to COVID, brimmed with strength and positivity at his funeral.
Uden also saw other signs of hope and resilience, despite households being isolated due to lockdown. He said whole neighbourhoods often emerged from their houses to stand silently in respect as a hearse carried someone away.

""It's so touching to see,"" he said. ""Even though we're not together, it's bringing a real togetherness.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - An iconic cafe and show venue that symbolises Japan's ""kawaii"" pop culture, and is beloved by tourists and celebrities, has shut its doors in Tokyo, the capital, after business dried up following the COVID-19 pandemic.
A funky aesthetic of outlandish colours and designs made Kawaii Monster Cafe in the capital's youth culture hotspot of Harajuku a hit, drawing overseas A-listers, such as reality star Kim Kardashian, singer Dua Lipa and Jenny of K-pop's Blackpink.
But its five-year run ended on Sunday, in part after overseas clientele disappeared because of border curbs against the pandemic.
""I'm glad that I could come on the final day. I'm really moved,"" said Misuzu Kida, 24.
Kida was among the fans who flocked for a last chance to see their favourite cosplay-inspired ""Monster Girls"" staff and soak up the atmosphere in quirkily-themed areas such as the Mushroom Disco (OTC:DSCSY) and Mel-Tea Room.
The cafe had hoped to capitalise on strong demand during the 2020 Olympics, but with the outlook still uncertain after the virus forced a year's delay in the Tokyo games, a decision was made to let the lease expire and shut down. 
""I feel it is very hard to keep the business going, without knowing how long the current situation will last,"" cafe manager Keisuke Yamada told Reuters.
""It is difficult for overseas customers to come to Japan, and it is also difficult for customers in Japan to go out."" 
The cafe had kept shorter hours, shutting by 7 p.m., since a temporary closure last spring for about 2-1/2 months after Japan declared a state of emergency over the virus.
Japan, with a tally of 390,687 infections and 5,766 deaths, is expected to extend an emergency for Tokyo and other areas this week as hospitals face pressure despite a drop in cases from their peaks, media have said.
While Sebastian Masuda, the artist who designed the sprawling cafe, said he was sad to see it close, he remained upbeat on the future of the trend-setting district.

""In Harajuku, regardless of age and era, the younger generations will always create new cultures. So I believe that the young generation will make something interesting again.""

""We have noted what has happened in Myanmar and are in the process of further understanding the situation,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told a daily news briefing in Beijing.
""China is a friendly neighbour of Myanmar's. We hope that all sides in Myanmar can appropriately handle their differences under the constitution and legal framework and safeguard political and social stability,"" he added.
Last month the Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, met military chief Min Aung Hlaing, who has now assumed power, during a visit to Myanmar.
Asked whether Myanmar had hinted there could be a coup during Wang Yi's visit, or whether China would condemn the coup, spokesman Wang reiterated his previous statement.
China has long played an important role in the former Burma, standing by the country during its previous time as a military dictatorship, but also working closely with Aung San Suu Kyi when she became leader.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi has been detained along with other leaders of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party in early morning raids. 
China has strategic economic interests in Myanmar, with major oil and gas pipelines running through the country.
China is also pushing the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, a network - some of it existing and some planned - of transport and other projects passing through areas where ethnic minority factions often battle each other and government forces.

Fighting in northeastern Myanmar sometimes sends refugees fleeing over the border into China, to Beijing's anger.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A dozen Australian media firms have agreed to plead guilty for breaching a suppression order on reporting on the trial and conviction of former Vatican treasurer George Pell in 2018 for child sexual assault, a court heard on Monday.
Pell was cleared last year of the sexual abuse charges after spending 13 months in prison.
The cardinal was found guilty by a jury in December 2018 of sexually assaulting two choirboys, making him the highest-ranking Catholic official convicted on child sex crimes.
Reporting on the trial and verdict was gagged Australia-wide by the County Court of Victoria to ensure the cardinal got a fair trial on further charges he was due to face. Those charges were later dropped.
As part of the agreement announced on Monday, the state prosecutor said it was dismissing charges of sub judice contempt against all of the media firms and all charges against 15 reporters and editors at those newspapers, radio and television stations. 
The surprise agreement was reached nearly two years after the charges were brought, nearly three months after the media trial began and 10 months after Pell was acquitted by the High Court.
Despite the Australian gag on reporting, foreign media published news on the outcome of Pell's trial, naming him and the charges.
Australian media then published reports saying they were unable to cover major news about an unidentified high-profile person, with some pointing out that the news was accessible online.
The state initially alleged that dozens of media, journalists and editors, mostly with News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) and Nine Entertainment Co and its Fairfax arm, had breached the suppression order and interfered with the administration of justice in running those articles. 
Breaches of suppression orders can be punished with up to five years jail and fines of nearly A$100,000 for individuals and nearly A$500,000 for companies.
DISMISS CHARGES
Some charges had been dismissed over the past two years, but 79 charges remained as of January.
""The prosecution has resolved,"" prosecutor Lisa De Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) told the Supreme Court of Victoria on Monday.
""Each corporate respondent has indicated that it will plead guilty in respect of each publication for which they are charged to contempt by breaching the proceeding suppression order,"" she said.
""Given the plea and the acceptance of responsibility in respect of each publication ... the director (of public prosecutions) has determined that it is in the public interest to dismiss the remaining charges.""
The companies have also agreed to pay the costs of prosecution, she said.
The plea hearing has been set for Feb. 10-11.
Last week, former editor of the Age, Alex Lavelle, the first media witness to appear in the trial, told the court he ran a story only to explain why the newspaper could not cover the news that was being reported overseas, as the newspaper had received numerous queries from the public.
Readers were ""wondering if the Age was part of a Catholic church conspiracy"", Matthew Collins, the lawyer representing Nine Entertainment, told the court.
Lavelle said based on legal advice, he believed the article did not breach the suppression order.
A spokeswoman for Nine said in emailed comments: ""Our decision to enter a guilty plea was important to protect our individual people, who were simply going about their jobs.""

News Ltd, the Australian arm of News Corp, was not immediately available to comment.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the developments were a ""serious blow to democratic reforms"" and urged all leaders to refrain from violence and respect human rights, a U.N. spokesman said.
The United States, Australia and Singapore expressed grave concern at the military's declaration of a state of emergency and the detentions, which the army said it had carried out in response to ""election fraud"".
""We call on Burmese military leaders to release all government officials and civil society leaders and respect the will of the people of Burma as expressed in democratic elections on Nov. 8,"" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.
The White House said U.S. President Joe Biden had been briefed on the detentions.
""The United States opposes any attempt to alter the outcome of recent elections or impede Myanmar's democratic transition, and will take action against those responsible if these steps are not reversed,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne called on the military ""to respect the rule of law, to resolve disputes through lawful mechanisms and to release immediately all civilian leaders and others"" who had been detained.
Singapore's Foreign Ministry urged all parties to exercise restraint and work towards a positive and peaceful outcome in comments that were echoed by Malaysia and Indonesia.
However, other fellow members of regional grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), took a more hands off approach.
""It's their internal affairs,"" Thailand's deputy prime minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters when asked about the coup in the country's northern neighbour. Cambodia and the Philippines made similar comments.
The detentions came after days of escalating tension between the civilian government and the military after the Nov. 8 election in which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) scored a landslide win.

The army on Monday handed power to military chief Min Aung Hlaing and imposed a state of emergency for one year, according to a statement on a military-owned television station.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",Indian journalists accused of sedition over protest reporting,"By Zeba Siddiqui
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Several senior Indian journalists are facing charges of sedition over their reporting and online posts about a protest by farmers last week, sparking criticism of the legal action from media associations.
The cases have been filed with police in at least five states against the journalists including Rajdeep Sardesai, a prominent anchor on the India Today television channel, and Vinod Jose, executive editor of the Caravan magazine. 
The cases, filed by residents of the states, allege that the journalists provoked violence during protests by farmers at New Delhi's Red Fort on Jan. 26 through incorrect posts on Twitter and reports that police had killed a protester.
Tens of thousands of farmers have camped out on the outskirts of the capital for more than two months, demanding the withdrawal of new agricultural laws that they say benefit private buyers at the expense of growers. 
The government of Prime Minster Narendra Modi says reform of the agriculture sector will bring opportunities for farmers.
The protests turned violent on Jan. 26, when farmers broke into the historic Red Fort complex, with one protester killed and hundreds injured. 
At the time, a witness told Reuters the protester was killed when the tractor he was driving overturned and crushed him but there was also talk he had been shot. Police, who had fired tear gas on the day, denied shooting him.
""The accused tried to provoke the protesters for their political and personal gains by spreading false and misleading information online,"" one complaint filed in Uttar Pradesh state said, echoing the language of the other filings.
Jose said his journalists on the ground heard from a witness and a relative of the dead man that he had been shot. ""This is an attack on free and independent reporting ... Government wants only its official version to be published,"" he said in a statement.
A lawyer for Sardesai did not have any immediate comment when contacted on Monday. 
The Editors Guild of India, the Press Club of India and several other journalist groups condemned the police complaints and called them an intimidation tactic aimed at stifling the media.
Anand Sahay, president of the Press Club of India, said it was not a coincidence that the cases had largely been registered in states that are ruled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The club said ""early reports"" suggested the protester had been shot dead though later it appeared he was killed when his tractor turned over.
""In a moving story, things change on a regular basis. Accordingly, the reporting reflects the circumstances. It is criminal to ascribe this to motivated reporting,"" the club said in a statement on Friday.
Activists say press freedom has shrunk under Modi’s rule, which has been marked by attacks on and intimidation of journalists. The government denies intimidating the press.
India dropped two places to 142nd in the annual World Press Freedom rankings by the group Reporters Without Borders last year, which noted “constant press freedom violations, including police violence against journalists” and increased “pressure on the media to toe the Hindu nationalist government’s line”.

The Editors Guild of India, which represents newspapers, said it was disturbed that the police complaints had been filed under as many as 10 different legal provisions including sedition, promoting communal disharmony and insulting religious beliefs.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police and paramilitary dug ditches and spread razor wire across main roads into New Delhi on Monday to prevent protesting farmers entering the capital as the finance minister prepared to deliver the government's annual budget in parliament.
Internet and messaging services were blocked in several neighbourhoods on the outskirts where protests turned violent week, and security was stepped up around parliament and other important government offices in the central district.
""The government has increased security to avoid any clash or violence when parliament is in session,"" said a senior official who didn't wish to be named in line with official policy. ""The idea is to keep everyone safe and avoid any escalation in tensions.""
A farmers' procession turned violent on Jan. 26, when India celebrated its Republic Day with a military parade, as some protesters broke away from a rally of tractors to storm into the historic Red Fort complex after breaking through barricades and clashing with police.
On Friday, authorities used tear gas and batons to break up clashes at one of the protest sites near the city. And in the past few days, more farmers have arrived along with their tractors to join their protesting colleagues at the three major protest sites near New Delhi.
""The country was saddened by the insult to the Tricolor (Indian flag) on the 26th of January in Delhi,"" Modi said in a radio address on Sunday, making his first public comments on last week's violence.
""The government is committed to modernizing agriculture and is also taking many steps in that direction."" 
The farmers want the government to withdraw three new farm - introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in September - that they say will hurt their livelihoods and benefit large private produce buyers.
The government says the reforms will open up new opportunities for farmers and it has invited farmer leaders for fresh talks to end the deadlock.

Although Modi remains India's most popular politician, his standing in the rural areas, where most Indians live, could be damaged by his handling to the farmers' two-month-old agitation.

960,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 01:10AM ET</span>","Newsmaker: Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's tainted torch bearer for democracy, detained again in coup","(Reuters) - Aung San Suu Kyi, who spent 15 years under house arrest in the struggle to bring democracy to Myanmar, has been detained along with other leaders of her political party in a military coup.
Beloved in Myanmar as ""the Lady"", Suu Kyi fulfilled the dreams of millions when her party won a landslide election in 2015 that established the Southeast Asian nation’s first civilian government in half a century. 
But the Nobel laureate appalled the world two years later by denying the extent of a sweeping military-led crackdown against the Rohingya Muslim minority which forced hundreds of thousands to flee the country.
In Myanmar, Suu Kyi remains adored but she has failed to unite its myriad ethnic groups or end its decade-long civil wars. She also oversaw tightening restrictions on the press and civil society and has fallen out with many former allies.
The daughter of independence hero Aung San, who was assassinated in 1947 when she was two years old, Suu Kyi spent much of her young life overseas. She attended Oxford University, met her husband, the British academic Michael Aris, and had two sons.
Before they married, she asked Aris to promise he would not stop her if she needed to return home. In 1988, she got the phone call that changed their lives: her mother was dying.
In the capital Yangon, then Rangoon, she was swept up in a student-led revolution against the military junta that had seized power after her father’s death and plunged the country into a ruinous isolation. 
Suu Kyi, the spitting image of the idolized Aung San and an eloquent public speaker, became the leader of the new movement, quoting her father’s dream to ""build up a free Burma"".
The revolution was crushed, its leaders killed and jailed, and Suu Kyi was imprisoned in her lakeside family home. Speaking her name in public could earn her supporters a prison sentence, so they called her ""the Lady"".
Slightly built and soft-spoken, she played a crucial role in keeping world attention on Myanmar’s military junta and its human rights record, winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. Aris died in 1997 but she did not attend his funeral, fearful she would not be allowed to return.
For years, the army led a relentless smear campaign against Suu Kyi, whom they dubbed an “axe-handle of the West”. 
During a brief release from house arrest in 1998 she attempted to travel outside Yangon to visit supporters and was blocked by the army. She sat inside her van for several days and nights, despite dehydration in the sweltering heat, and was said to have caught rainwater in an open umbrella.
She survived an assassination attempt in 2003 when pro-military men wielding spikes and rods attacked a convoy she was travelling in. Some of her supporters were killed or badly wounded.
The army again placed her under house arrest and from behind the gates, she gave witty weekly addresses to supporters, standing on rickety tables and talking about human rights and democracy under the watchful eyes of secret police. A devout Buddhist, she sometimes spoke of her struggle in spiritual terms.
FROM REVERED TO REVILED 
In 2010, the military began a series of democratic reforms and Suu Kyi was released before thousands of weeping, cheering supporters.
In the West, she was feted. Barack Obama became the first U.S president to visit Myanmar in 2012, calling her an “inspiration to people all around the world, including myself”. U.S economic sanctions on Myanmar were eased, though Suu Kyi remained cautious about the extent of reforms.
With the 2015 election win, Suu Kyi became state counsellor, pledging to end civil war, boost foreign investment and reduce the army’s role in politics. She also promised Western allies she would address the plight of the Rohingya who had borne the brunt of violent clashes with Buddhists, with hundreds of thousands detained in internment camps.
In August 2017, Rohingya militants attacked security forces and the military responded by burning hundreds of villages to the ground and carrying out mass killings and gang rapes. The United Nations said it was conducted with “genocidal intent”.
Suu Kyi said the military was exercising ""rule of law"" and appeared baffled and ignorant about the exodus of refugees. And while she had no power to direct the army operation, her government ordered burned land become government-owned land and oversaw the bulldozing of destroyed villages. 
Global institutions and former advocates including the Dalai Lama publicly denounced her and many of the numerous accolades awarded to her were rescinded. 

In 2019, she flew to the Hague to face charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice. She acknowledged the possibility war crimes had been committed but framed the crackdown as a legitimate military operation against terrorists.

962,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 12:25AM ET</span>",Statement from Myanmar military on state of emergency,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's army declared a state of emergency on Monday as it carried out detentions of senior government leaders in response to alleged fraud during November's general election.
A video address broadcast on military-owned television said power had been handed to the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.
Here is the statement read out on Myawaddy Television (MWD):
""The voter lists which were used during the multi-party general election which was held on the 8th of November were found to have huge discrepancies and the Union Election Commission failed to settle this matter. 
Although the sovereignty of the nation must derive from the people, there was terrible fraud in the voter list during the democratic general election which runs contrary to ensuring a stable democracy.A refusal to settle the issue of voter list fraud and a failure to take action and follow a request to postpone lower-house and upper-house parliament sessions is not in accordance with article 417 of the 2018 constitution that refers to 'acts or attempts to take over the sovereignty of the Union by wrongful forcible means' and could lead to a disintegration of national solidarity.
Due to such acts, there have been a lot of protests going on in townships and cities in Myanmar to demonstrate their mistrust toward UEC. Other parties and people have also been found conducting different kinds of provocations including displaying flags which are very damaging to national security. 
Unless this problem is resolved, it will obstruct the path to democracy and it must therefore be resolved according to the law. Therefore, the state of emergency is declared in accordance with article 417 of the 2008 constitution.In order to perform scrutiny of the voter lists and to take action, the authority of the nation’s law making, governance and jurisdiction is handed over to the Commander in Chief in accordance with the 2008 constitution article 418, sub article (a).

963,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 12:20AM ET</span>","Factbox: Aung San Suu Kyi's history, previous detentions and rise to power","(Reuters) - Here are some facts about Aung San Suu Kyi, the 75-year-old who rode to power after a 2015 landslide election win that established Myanmar's first civilian government in half a century.
- The daughter of independence hero Aung San, who was assassinated when she was two years old, Suu Kyi spent much of her youth overseas. At Oxford University, she met British academic Michael Aris, who would become her husband. They had two sons and settled in Oxford.
- In 1988, Suu Kyi returned to Yangon, then the capital, to care for her dying mother. There, she was swept up in student-led protests against the military, which had ruled since a 1962 coup.
- An eloquent public speaker, Suu Kyi was a likely candidate to lead the movement but the protests were crushed, its leaders killed and jailed, and she was soon imprisoned in her lakeside family home, where she remained until 2010, despite brief releases from house arrest.
- Suu Kyi made a decision to remain in Myanmar to lead a campaign for democracy. Although the military made it clear she could leave, she feared she would not be allowed to return.
- She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, which her elder son Alexander collected on her behalf.
- In August 2011, Suu Kyi had her first meeting with then President Thein Sein, a former general and head of the quasi-civilian administration, marking the start of a pragmatic period of engagement with the government of former soldiers.
- In 2015, she came to power on a platform of ending civil war, drumming up foreign investment, and reducing the army's role in politics. Suu Kyi also promised Western allies she would address the plight of the Rohingya Muslim people, forming an advisory commission headed by former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
- A day after Annan's report was released in August 2017, advising sweeping changes, Rohingya militants attacked security forces in Rakhine State. The military responded with a campaign that included the torching of hundreds of villages and killings, and was described by the U.N. human rights high commissioner as ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"".
Suu Kyi blamed ""terrorists"" for an ""iceberg of misinformation"" about the crisis and said the military was exercising the ""rule of law"". In a September 2017 address to the nation, she appeared baffled about the exodus, saying in reference to refugees: ""We want to know why they are leaving"".
- She went to the Hague in 2019 to face charges of genocide brought against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice at The Hague. She acknowledged the possibility war crimes had been committed but framed the crackdown as a legitimate military operation against terrorists.
- In 2020, a survey by election watchdog the People's Alliance for Credible Elections, found that 79% of people had trust in Suu Kyi - still beloved as ""the Lady"" - up from 70% the year before.
- After a November 2020 parliamentary election, official results show her ruling party, the National League of Democracy (NLD), had won enough parliamentary seats to form the next administration. The NLD said it would seek to form a government of national unity.

- After weeks of disputes about the election results involving the military, in the early hours of Feb. 1, Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other senior figures from the ruling party were detained in an early morning raid.

964,By Reuters,"<span>Feb 01, 2021 12:00AM ET</span>",Explainer: All eyes on Myanmar army chief Min Aung Hlaing as military seizes power,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's powerful military chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, is in the spotlight after politicians from the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party were detained and the army announced it was taking power.
Myanmar's military is notoriously reclusive and even sophisticated observers know little about its inner workings.
Here are some key facts about its leader and the army's enduring role in the political system: 
MILITARY'S ROLE IN POLITICS 
The military ruled directly for nearly 50 years after a 1962 coup and had long seen itself as the guardian of national unity.
As the architect of Myanmar's 2008 constitution, the military enshrined a permanent role for itself in the political system. It gets an unelected quota of 25% of parliamentary seats and its chief appoints ministers of defence, interior and border affairs, ensuring a key stake in politics, which has made for an awkward power-sharing arrangement with the NLD. 
Many members of the party, including leader Aung San Suu Kyi, for years suffered persecution for opposing the former junta.
SLOW AND STEADY RISE
Min Aung Hlaing, 64, steered clear of the political activism that was widespread at the time when he studied law at Yangon University in 1972-1974. ""He was a man of few words and normally kept a low profile,"" one classmate told Reuters in 2016.
While fellow students joined demonstrations, Min Aung Hlaing made annual applications to join the premier military university, the Defence Services Academy (DSA), succeeding on his third attempt in 1974.
According to a member of his DSA class, who spoke to Reuters in 2016 and who still sees the army chief at annual class reunions, he was an average cadet.
""He was promoted regularly and slowly,"" said the classmate, adding that he had been surprised to see Min Aung Hlaing rise beyond the officer corps' middle ranks.
FROM SOLDIER TO POLITICIAN
Min Aung Hlaing took over the running of the military in 2011 as a transition to democracy began. Diplomats in Yangon said that by the onset of Suu Kyi's first term in 2016, Min Aung Hlaing had transformed himself from taciturn soldier into a politician and public figure.
Observers noted his use of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to publicise activities and meetings with dignitaries and visits to monasteries. His official profile attracted hundreds of thousands of followers before being taken down in the wake of the army's offensive against the Rohingya Muslim minority in 2017.
Min Aung Hlaing studied other political transitions, diplomats and observers have told Reuters, and has made much of the need to avoid the chaos seen in Libya and other Middle Eastern countries after regime change in 2011.
The commander-in-chief has never shown any sign he was prepared to give up the military's 25% of seats in parliament nor of allowing any change to the clause in the constitution that bars Suu Kyi from becoming president.
The recent complaints by the army of irregularities in voter lists for a Nov. 8 general election which, as expected, delivered another sweeping victory to Suu Kyi's party, have been accompanied by cryptic comments about abolishing the charter.
Min Aung Hlaing extended his term at the helm of the military for another five years in February 2016, a step that surprised observers who expected him to step aside that year during a regular army leadership reshuffle.
SANCTIONS
A 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar drove more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims into neighbouring Bangladesh. U.N. investigators have said Myanmar's military operation included mass killings, gang rapes and widespread arson and was executed with ""genocidal intent"".
In response, the United States imposed sanctions on Min Aung Hlaing and three other military leaders in 2019 and several court cases in various international courts, including the International Court of Justice, are going on.

Also in 2019, U.N. investigators urged world leaders to impose targeted financial sanctions on companies linked to the military.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and his deputy, Avi Berkowitz, were nominated on Sunday for the Nobel Peace Prize for their role in negotiating four normalization deals between Israel and Arab nations known as the ""Abraham Accords.""
The deals were announced in a four-month span between mid-August and mid-December and were the most significant diplomatic breakthroughs in the Middle East in 25 years as the region girds for a prolonged confrontation with Iran.
Nominating the pair of former deputies to then-President Donald Trump was American attorney Alan Dershowitz, who was eligible to do so in his capacity as a professor emeritus of Harvard Law School.
Dershowitz had defended Trump in his first impeachment trial last year and said in a Jan. 20 comment in the Wall Street Journal that the Senate should dismiss the article of impeachment against Trump over the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol as he is no longer president.
Kushner, who is Trump's son-in-law, and Berkowitz, who was the Middle East envoy, were key figures in negotiating deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco.
In a statement, Kushner said he was honored to be nominated for the prize, which will be awarded in October.
President Joe Biden's administration is expected to review all national security deals struck during the Trump administration, including arms packages for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
Some lawmakers have complained about the Morocco deal because, to win the nation's agreement, the United States recognized its sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara.

Trump left office on Jan. 20 under a cloud of controversy, potentially affecting whether the two aides would be awarded the Nobel.

Myanmar's army declared a state of emergency on Monday as it said it carried out detentions of senior government leaders in response to fraud during last year's general election.
There are an estimated 3,500 Japanese in Myanmar, but because of the coronavirus pandemic, Tokyo had been advising citizens to put off travel there, said the official, who asked to remain unidentified, adding there are no current plans to change that advisory. 
The Japanese embassy in Myanmar, in a message posted on the Foreign Ministry's website, said while the situation in the country at this point did not appear to be one that would involve ordinary people, people should exercise caution.

""We encourage people to stay inside and refrain from going out unless absolutely essential,"" it added.

The move came after Myanmar's powerful military triggered worry about a coup last week after threatening to ""take action"" over alleged fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD).
The NLD led by Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner and figurehead of Myanmar's long struggle against dictatorship, won 83% of available seats in the Nov. 8 election seen as a referendum on her fledgling democratic government.
WHO RULES IN MYANMAR?
Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, 75, came to power after a 2015 landslide election win that followed decades of house arrest in a struggle for democracy that turned her into an international icon.
Her international standing was damaged after hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled army operations into refuge from Myanmar's western Rakhine state in 2017, but she remains hugely popular at home. 
The military, as the architect of Myanmar's 2008 constitution and fledgling democracy, sees itself as the guardian of national unity and the constitution, and it has enshrined a permanent role for itself in the political system.
Known as the Tatmadaw, it gets an unelected quota of 25% of parliamentary seats and it controls the defence, interior and borders ministries, ensuring an important stake in politics.
WHY DID THE MILITARY CHALLENGE THE LATEST VOTE?
The military alleged discrepancies such as duplicated names on voting lists in scores of districts and was unhappy with the election commission's response to its complaints.
The military did not say if irregularities were substantial enough to have changed the election outcome. 
Its grievance was similar to that of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the former ruling party created by the military before it officially ceded power in 2011.
The USDP, widely seen as a military proxy, was humiliated in the election, winning only 33 of 476 available seats. 
HOW DID THE NLD, OTHER PARTIES REACT TO ELECTION?
Suu Kyi has not commented on her party's election victory, nor on the military's complaints, but the NLD said the military's allegations were groundless and any election flaws would not have changed the outcome.
Of the more than 90 parties that contested the vote, at least 17 have complained of mostly minor irregularities and all except the USDP are smaller parties. Election observers have said the voting was without major irregularities.
The election commission on Thursday said there were no errors on a scale that could mean fraud or the election being discredited.
WHAT DID THE MILITARY SAY?
The spokesman for the armed forces, Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, held a news conference last week on its allegations but gave a succession of non-committal answers to questions about the military's intentions.
He said the military would ""take action"", and use all available options including the Supreme Court. Asked if the military would cooperate with the new government and legislature, he told reporters ""wait and watch"". 
Asked if he would rule out a coup, Zaw Min Tun said ""cannot say so"".
On Saturday, Myanmar's military had said it would protect and abide by the constitution and act according to law.
WHAT DOES THE COUNTRY'S CONSTITUTION SAY?
The constitution says the commander-in-chief can take power only in extreme circumstances that could cause ""disintegration of the union, disintegration of national solidarity and loss of sovereign power"", but only during a state of emergency, which can only be declared by the civilian president.

The commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, caused intrigue last week when he told military personnel a constitution was a ""mother law for all laws"" and if not abided by, it should be revoked. He cited previous instances when that had happened in Myanmar.

The group of independent experts left two weeks of quarantine on Thursday in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, and is conducting two weeks of field work. So far, it has included visits to hospitals, markets, and an exhibition commemorating Wuhan's battle with the outbreak.
The WHO, which has sought to manage expectations for the mission, has said that team members would be limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and would not have any contact with community members, because of health restrictions.

No full itinerary for the group's field work has been announced, and journalists covering the tightly controlled visit have been kept at a distance from team members.

""All of our medical activities are suspended for the time being, but not canceled, until we can investigate this, and it's clear we can carry out our interventions safely,"" MSF said.
MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said the attack occurred in the municipality of Ilopango on the eastern fringe of San Salvador, as its team was traveling by ambulance in response to an emergency call. Local media described the assailants as suspected gang members.
Members of the MSF team suffered some light injuries and bruises, but no one was seriously injured, the NGO said.
It was unclear what provoked the attack, which was condemned by the government of El Salvador.

Ilopango is regarded as potentially dangerous area in El Salvador, one of a group of Central American countries that has for years battled to keep chronic gang violence in check.

Sturgeon said this month she was hoping that a strong performance by her Scottish National Party (SNP) in an election in May would give her the mandate to hold a second referendum, a move Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will not approve.
It is still not clear whether the May election will take place. Scotland, like the rest of the United Kingdom, is struggling to control the spread of COVID-19 and is moving fast to try to vaccinate as many people as possible.
""We are living under a national lockdown and in the middle of a global pandemic ... It is the duty of all politicians to come together and focus on the national interest in a time of crisis,"" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross will say, according to excerpts of his speech. 
""There is no getting away from it, the timing of this plan is reckless and irresponsible. She has put party before pandemic, and risked damaging trust in the government when it is needed most,"" he said.
The SNP has put forward an 11-point roadmap to plan for a second referendum, saying it would ""vigorously oppose"" any legal challenge from the British government. 
Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014 but opinion polls suggest many in the nation now favour of independence. Some feel Scotland was taken out of the European Union against its will by the British government.
Unlike in England and Wales, a majority of voters in Scotland backed staying in the EU during the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Johnson's Conservatives, much like the main opposition Labour Party, have a tough task to win back voters in Scotland. The British leader has taken steps to try to counter the SNP's message by bolstering a special unit in Downing Street.

The British leader used a visit to Scotland last week to tell nationalists to stop talking ""endlessly"" about a new independence referendum.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - A suspected suicide car bomb exploded on Sunday in Somalia's capital and was followed by a shootout between militants and security forces at a hotel, causing an unknown number of casualties, witnesses and authorities said.
The militant Islamist group al Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda and often carries out bombings in its war on Somalia's government, claimed responsibility via its radio station.
""A speeding car exploded near the hotel and checkpoint. The blast shook us and heavy gunfire followed,"" shopkeeper Ali Abdulahi told Reuters of the incident, which occurred in the busy Kilometre 4 area of Mogadishu. 
A Reuters journalist saw security forces besiege the area, where cars are inspected en route to the airport and where politicians regularly gather at the hotel. 
""The blast made the hotel tremble as we sat inside and were talking. We were panicked, confused,"" witness Ahmed Nur said, adding that he escaped via a ladder down a wall. ""I jumped down and ran.""
'MARTYRDOM OPERATION'
Police spokesman Sadik Ali said many people had been rescued from the Hotel Afrik.
""There must be casualties because the militants first started the attack with a suicide car bomb against the wall,"" he told Reuters. ""The operation still goes on, casualties will be known later.""
Al Shabaab wants to rule Somalia according to its interpretation of Islamic sharia law.
There was no immediate word from Somali officials or the African Union (AU) peacekeeping mission, which supports the government against al Shabaab.
Al Shabaab's radio Al Andalus said fighters had gone into the hotel after a suicide car bomb. ""A martyrdom operation by the mujahideen goes on at Hotel Afrik, which is a cover-up for officials from the apostate government,"" it said. 
Separately, eight children died on Sunday in a town outside of the capital Mogadishu, after a mortar shell they had found exploded, a local official said, adding 11 others were injured.

The children were aged between four to 12, said Osman Nur, chairman of Shalambood, a town 90 km (56 miles) from Mogadishu.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Riot police broke up protests across Russia on Sunday in support of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, detaining more than 5,000 people who had braved the bitter cold and the threat of prosecution to demand he be set free.
In a massive show of force, police imposed a sweeping security lockdown in the heart of Moscow, sealing off streets to pedestrians near the Kremlin, closing metro stations and deploying hundreds of riot police as snow fell. 
At one point, a column of protesters marched towards the prison in northern Moscow where Navalny is being held, chanting ""Let him go!"". In another scene, people in a crowd raised their hands above their heads in front of a row of riot police and chanted ""we're not your enemies"".
Navalny, 44, was arrested on Jan. 17 after returning to Moscow from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in Russia last summer. He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies.
His dramatic return to Moscow despite the obvious threat of arrest and the second straight weekend of protests at his jailing pose a challenge for Putin who has dominated the Russian political landscape for more than two decades. 
Yulia, a 40-year-old protester in Moscow, said she had joined the rallies despite having a panic attack the night before because of worrying about repercussions for taking part. 
""I understand that I live in a totally lawless state. In a police state, with no independent courts. In a country ruled by corruption. I would like to live differently,"" she said.
Police said protesters could face criminal prosecution for attending or calling for an unauthorised demonstration and warned they could spread COVID-19. 
Navalny's allies used social media to repeatedly change the location of their rally, scattering the crowds over different parts of Moscow and making it harder to disperse.
Police put turnout at Sunday's Moscow protest at around 2,000 people. Reuters reporters estimated crowds of several thousand, smaller than last weekend. 
In St Petersburg and Moscow police used force to detain protesters and were occasionally seen using tasers. One protester had a bloodied, bandaged head.
At least 5,021 people were detained nationwide, including 1,608 in Moscow, according to OVD-Info, a protest monitoring group. 
Yulia Navalnaya, the Kremlin critic's wife, was among those detained. She was later released. 
""If we stay quiet, then they could come for any of us tomorrow,"" she wrote on Instagram before joining the protests. 
The protest is a test of Navalny's support after many of his prominent allies were targeted in a crackdown this week. Several, including his brother Oleg, are under house arrest.
U.S. CONDEMNATION
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken condemned what he said was the persistent use of harsh tactics against peaceful protesters and journalists, and called for Navalny's release. 
Russia's foreign ministry responded by accusing the United States of hypocrisy, meddling and seeking to encourage the protests as part of a strategy to contain Russia. 
""Everyone knows well what the United States does in those cases - it opens fire to kill,"" it said.
UK foreign minister Dominic Raab also said Britain condemned the arrests of protesters and journalists, saying in a tweet: ""I call on the @GovernmentRF to respect people's right to peaceful protest. #MediaFreedom must be protected.""
The West has told Moscow to let Navalny go and his allies have appealed to U.S. President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on 35 people who they say are Putin's close allies.
In the far eastern city of Vladivostok, video footage showed protesters chanting ""Putin is a thief"" as they linked hands and marched in temperatures of around -13 Celsius (8.6 Fahrenheit). Police detained more than 120 people in the city, OVD-Info said.
Dozens turned out in Siberia's city of Yakutsk despite temperatures of -42 Celsius. Eleven were detained in Tomsk, the Siberian city that Navalny visited before suddenly collapsing on a domestic flight last August, OVD-Info said. 
Navalny is accused of parole violations which he says are trumped up. A court is due to sit on Tuesday to consider handing him a jail term of up to three and a half years.
Leonid Volkov, a close ally of Navalny outside Russia, called on protesters to come to the court house to support him. 
Seeking to galvanise his followers, Navalny put out an online video this month that has been viewed more than 100 million times, accusing Putin of being the ultimate owner of a sumptuous Black Sea palace. The Kremlin leader has denied this.

On the eve of the protests, Arkady Rotenberg, a businessman and Putin's former judo sparring partner, said he owns the property.

The World War Two veteran caught the public's imagination in April, just before his 100th birthday, when he was filmed doing laps with the help of a walking frame around his garden in the village of Marston Moretaine, north of London.
He hoped to raise 1,000 pounds. Instead, he raised more than 30 million ($41 million) for the National Health Service, broke two Guinness world records, was knighted by Queen Elizabeth, scored a No. 1 single, wrote an autobiography and helped set up a charity.
""I wanted to update everybody that today ... my father was admitted to hospital,"" his daughter, Hannah Ingram-Moore, said on Twitter.
""Over the last few weeks he was being treated for pneumonia and last week tested positive for COVID-19. He was at home with us until today when he needed additional help with his breathing. He is being treated in a ward, although he is not in ICU (intensive care unit),"" she said.
She said he had been receiving ""remarkable"" medical care in the past few weeks. The family knew the staff at Bedford Hospital would do all they could to make him comfortable and ""hopefully return home as soon as possible"", she added.
Britain has vaccinated nearly 9 million people against the coronavirus, with the over-80s in one of the top priority groups. But Sky News quoted a family representative as saying Moore had not yet received a vaccine because he was being treated for pneumonia.
His hospitalisation prompted an outpouring of support.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter his thoughts were with Moore and his family. ""You've inspired the whole nation, and I know we are all wishing you a full recovery.""

Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer also wished him well, saying: ""The whole nation hopes you get well soon @captaintommoore. You've been an inspiration to us all throughout this crisis.""

Shi'ite Muslim Iran has been a foe of the hardline Sunni Muslim Taliban for decades, but has been openly meeting with Taliban leaders for the past few years as the United States has started negotiating the exit of its troops from Afghanistan.
Washington has accused Iran in the past of providing covert aid to Taliban fighters against U.S. forces.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif met Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in Tehran, and told him that Washington was not a ""good mediator"" for the conflict, Iran's Tasnim news agency reported on Sunday.
Iran supports an inclusive Afghan government that would include all ethnic groups and sects, Zarif was quoted as saying.
Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem said on Twitter that the meetings had taken place ""in a good atmosphere"". 
""The situations in Afghanistan, Intra-Afghan negotiations, the full implementation of the Doha agreement and Afghanistan's & region's need (for) peace were discussed,"" he added.
The United States reached an agreement last year with the insurgents at negotiations in the Qatari capital to withdraw troops that have been in Afghanistan since 2001.
More recently, the Taliban and the Afghan government have been negotiating in Qatar to reach a peace deal. Those talks resumed this month after an almost month-long break, but negotiators and diplomats say there has since been little progress.
Reuters reported on Sunday that some NATO troops are likely to stay in Afghanistan beyond the deadline set last year of May 2021, as the Western alliance does not believe the withdrawal conditions have been met.

New U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to take a close look at the withdrawal agreement negotiated under his predecessor Donald Trump.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court has ordered a leading government foe to remove allegations on social media that the state's coronavirus vaccine policy is opaque and unfairly favours a company owned by the king, the government said on Sunday. 
However, opposition politician Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit's Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Movement denied the videos were illegal and urged YouTube and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to preserve freedom of expression. 
The clips could still be viewed late on Sunday. 
Thailand's Digital Ministry said the Criminal Court ruled that Thanathorn's posts on social media and his movement's website could breach national security.
The videos accuse Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's government of lack of transparency in allowing Siam Bioscience, which is owned by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, to supply most doses despite a lack of vaccine experience.
Critics say former junta leader Prayuth rigged a vote in a 2019 election to retain power - a charge he denies - and have broken a national taboo by increasingly criticising the monarchy. 
SUBSIDY
Siam Bioscience received a 600 million baht ($20 million) subsidy to develop capacity to manufacture AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) vaccines domestically and across Southeast Asia. 
The court did not comment when contacted by Reuters.
Thanathorn's movement said it had not received the ruling. ""We continue to stress that the content is not false or a threat to national security,"" tweeted Pannika Wanich, a prominent Progressive Movement member.
""We hope YouTube and Facebook will stand by the rights and freedom of expression."" 
Thanathorn was banned from politics for 10 years after a court dissolved his previous Future Forward Party last year over loans deemed illegal. He denied the charges.
Now the government has lodged a case against him over the video, accusing him of insulting royalty, a charge punishable by up to 15 years' prison.
The government says Siam Bioscience manufacturing is on track to deliver a first batch of 61 million doses to the public by June.
There was no immediate comment from Thanathorn or Siam Bioscience on the court ruling. The palace traditionally does not comment on political disputes.
Relatively unscathed by COVID-19, Thailand on Sunday reported 829 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 18,782 cases and 77 fatalities since the outbreak started last January.

Vienna police banned numerous protests planned for this weekend, including one by the far-right Freedom Party on Sunday, on the grounds that protesters have generally failed to observe rules on social distancing and often not worn face masks.
Since Dec. 26, Austria has been in its third national lockdown, with non-essential shops and many other businesses closed and their staff unable to work. 
The opposition Freedom Party has denounced various restrictions as ""corona madness"" and its leaders have sent mixed messages on issues such as vaccinations.
Freedom Party deputy leader Herbert Kickl on Saturday accused the conservative-led government of banning criticism in general. He urged his supporters to go on a walk in the capital instead of attending the banned protest, and to ""articulate their displeasure peacefully"".
The affiliation of many of Sunday's protesters was not immediately clear.
Some of them, however, expressed support for the Freedom Party, and many opposed conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, chanting and waving banners saying ""Kurz must go"" - often without wearing masks. Many carried Austrian flags.
The crowd, which police estimated at 5,000, gathered on a square in central Vienna across the central ring road from the former imperial palace as well as from the offices of Kurz and President Alexander Van der Bellen.
Rows of police in riot gear and face masks prevented the crowd from marching down the ring road. 
After riots in the Netherlands apparently set off by the introduction of a night-time curfew, Austrian police avoided escalation despite having ordered the crowd to disperse, and the atmosphere was tense but peaceful. 

A Reuters witness saw police make some arrests and estimated the size of the protests at thousands. Police confirmed arrests had been made without giving numbers.

Tensions have spiked over the last week or so after Taiwan reported multiple Chinese fighters and bombers flying into the zone last weekend, in an area close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the northern part of the South China Sea.
The Chinese missions coincided with a U.S. aircraft carrier group entering the South China Sea for what the U.S. military termed a routine deployment. The United States has criticised the Chinese flights.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said a total of seven Chinese aircraft flew into the same waters near the Pratas Islands on Sunday - two J-10 fighters, four J-11 fighters and a Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft.
It added that a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft was also present in the same southwestern part of the defence zone, but neither named the aircraft type nor provided details of its flight path, which it does for all Chinese flights.
It was the first time Taiwan had mentioned the presence of a U.S. aircraft since it began near daily reports of Chinese activity in its defence zone in mid-September.
Taiwan rarely speaks publicly about U.S. activity near it, normally when U.S. warships sail through the Taiwan Strait, though diplomatic and security sources say there are frequent U.S. air and naval missions close to the island.
The United States, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, but is the island's most important international backer and supplier of weapons.
China toughened its language towards Taiwan last week, warning after its stepped up military activities that ""independence means war"" and that its armed forces were acting in response to provocation and foreign interference.

China believes Taiwan's democratically-elected government is bent on declaring independence, a red line for Beijing. President Tsai Ing-wen says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, Taiwan's formal name.

979,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Foreign troops to stay in Afghanistan beyond May deadline - NATO sources,"By Rupam Jain and Charlotte Greenfield
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - International troops plan to stay in Afghanistan beyond the May deadline envisaged by the insurgent Taliban's deal with the United States, four senior NATO officials said, a move that could escalate tensions with the Taliban demanding full withdrawal.
""There will be no full withdrawal by allies by April-end,"" one of the officials told Reuters.
""Conditions have not been met,"" he said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""And with the new U.S. administration, there will be tweaks in the policy, the sense of hasty withdrawal which was prevalent will be addressed and we could see a much more calculated exit strategy.""
The administration of then-President Donald Trump signed an agreement with the Taliban early last year calling for the withdrawal of all foreign troops by May in return for the insurgents fulfilling certain security guarantees.
Trump hailed the accord - which did not include the Afghan government - as the end of two decades of war. He reduced U.S. troops to 2,500 by this month, the fewest since 2001.
Plans on what will happen after April are now being considered and likely to be a top issue at a key NATO meeting in February, the NATO sources said.
The positions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are becoming increasingly important after the alliance was sidelined by Trump, diplomats and experts say.
Peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban began in September in Doha, but violence has remained high. 
""No NATO ally wants to stay in Afghanistan longer than necessary, but we have been clear that our presence remains conditions-based,"" said NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu.
No NATO decision has been made, she said, adding that a February meeting NATO defence ministers meeting could not be preempted. ""Allies continue to assess the overall situation and to consult on the way forward.""
NATO continues to call on all sides to ""seize this historic opportunity for peace,"" Lungescu said.
""NATO fully supports the Afghanistan peace process in order to ensure that Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists that would attack our homelands,"" she said.
Around 10,000 troops, including Americans, are in Afghanistan, Lungescu said. 
The NATO source said troop levels are expected to stay roughly the same until after May, but the plan beyond that is not clear.
Kabul and some foreign governments and agencies say the Taliban has failed to meet conditions due to escalated violence and a failure to cut ties with militant groups such as Al Qaeda, which the Taliban denies.
The administration of Joe Biden, who replaced Trump on Jan. 20, has launched a review of his predecessor's peace agreement.
A Pentagon spokesman said the Taliban have not met their commitments but Washington remained committed to the process and had not decided on future troop levels.
A State Department representative said Biden was committed to bringing a ""responsible end to the 'forever wars'... while also protecting Americans from terrorist and other threats."" 
Afghanistan's presidential palace did not respond to a request for comment.
RISING CONCERN
The Taliban have become increasingly concerned in recent weeks about the possibility that Washington might change aspects of the agreement and keep troops in the country beyond May, two Taliban sources told Reuters. 
""We conveyed our apprehensions, but they assured us of honouring and acting on the Doha accord. What's going on, on the ground in Afghanistan, is showing something else. And that's why we decided to send our delegations to take our allies into confidence,"" said a Taliban leader in Doha.
A Taliban delegation this week visited Iran and Russia, and the leader said they were contacting China.
Although informal meetings have been taking place between negotiators in Doha, progress has stalled in recent weeks after an almost one-month break, according to negotiators and diplomats. 
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters the insurgents remained committed to the peace process.
""No doubt that if the Doha deal is not implemented there will be consequences, and the blame will be upon that side which does not honour the deal,"" he said. ""Our expectations are also that NATO will think to end this war and avoid more excuses for prolonging the war in Afghanistan."" 
NATO and Washington will have a challenge getting the Taliban to agree to an extension beyond May.
If the situation remains unclear, the Taliban may increase attacks, possibly once again on international forces, said Ashley Jackson, co-director of the Centre for the Study of Armed Groups at the British think tank ODI.
The lack of a resolution ""gives voice to spoilers inside the Taliban who never believed the U.S. would leave willingly, and who have pushed for a ratcheting up of attacks even after the U.S.-Taliban deal was agreed,"" she said.
A Feb. 17-18 meeting of NATO defence ministers will be a chance for a newly empowered NATO to determine how the process would be shaped, said one source, a senior European diplomat.

""With the new administration coming in there will be a more cooperative result, NATO countries will have a say.""

980,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 07:56AM ET</span>",Fugitive ex-leader of Ethiopia's Tigray region vows 'extended resistance',"NAIROBI (Reuters) - The former ruling party in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray is committed to ""extended resistance"", according to an audio message purporting to be from its leader, who accused federal government forces and their allies of rape and looting. 
The comments attributed to Debretsion Gebremichael would be his first in public or via media since early December. 
The recording was posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by a media outlet affiliated with the former ruling party the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), which has battled the government since Nov. 4.
""They (the federal government) have temporary military dominance,"" said the recording, alleging abuses like rape and looting, reports of which have also been highlighted by the United Nations. 
""We are engaged in extended resistance."" 
Reuters could not verify the audio's authenticity or date.
Asked to comment, Billene Seyoum, spokeswoman for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, said: I ""cannot to speak to the delusions of a criminal clique's Facebook page.""
The TPLF and foreign backers have sought to divert attention with unfounded genocide claims since November to cover up their own ""horrendous crimes"", she said, urging foreign nations and media to expose them.
THOUSANDS KILLED
Abiy claimed victory in late November after his forces captured the regional capital Mekelle, but reports of low-level fighting have continued. 
Thousands of people have died, hundreds of thousands have been forced from homes and there are shortages of food, water and medicine across the region of more than 5 million people. 
""The cities and rural areas of Tigray are being bombarded day and night by heavy artilleries,"" Debretsion said. 
Reports from all sides are difficult to verify since the government has largely sealed off Tigray from media and foreign aid workers. Telecommunications to many areas are not working. 
Debretsion called on Tigrayans abroad to contribute time and money to supporting the fighters and foreign nations to condemn the Ethiopian government, saying Abiy and Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki should be charged in an international court.
Dozens of eyewitnesses have said Eritrean troops are present in Tigray to support Ethiopian forces, though both nations deny that.
Abiy's government says the TPLF provoked the conflict by attacking army bases in Tigray and that the government is sending aid. 
On Sunday, state-affiliated broadcaster Fana reported that the government was establishing a taskforce to investigate heightened concern over violence against women in Tigray. 

Minister of Women, Children and Youth Filsan Abdullahi was quoted as saying the government had a zero tolerance policy towards any form of sexual violence.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's new lawmakers vowed to take their seats in parliament for the first time on Monday and said they were undaunted by threats from the army and fears of a coup after the military alleged last year's election was fraudulent.
Myanmar's powerful military last week threatened to ""take action"" over alleged fraud in a November election won by the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, just days before the parliament was set to convene.
In a statement on Saturday, the army appeared to backtrack, saying it would protect and abide by the constitution and act according to law, but pro-military demonstrations continued in major cities.
About 300 people marched through the commercial capital of Yangon on Sunday waving banners and chanting in support of the military and against foreign intervention in the country's internal affairs.
A military spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
The National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner and figurehead of Myanmar's long struggle against dictatorship, won 83% of available seats in the Nov. 8 election seen as a referendum on her fledgling democratic government.
The military has disputed the result and legal complaints against the country's president and chair of the electoral body are pending at the Supreme Court. 
The election commission has rejected the allegations, saying there were no errors big enough to affect the credibility of the vote.
Myanmar's lower house is set to convene on Monday but state media announced over the weekend the first session of the upper house had been rescheduled to Tuesday.
Under the country's constitution, a quarter of seats are reserved for lawmakers from the military, which has declined to comment on whether they will attend.
Monywa Aung Shin, a spokesman for the NLD, said representatives from all parties including those from the military were receiving vaccinations against COVID-19 in order to attend parliament on Monday.
""I believe that everyone will attend the parliament tomorrow,"" he told Reuters by phone.
Many lawmakers from the ruling party spent years in jail under the former military government, which ruled for half a century until reforms began in 2011. 
Several told Reuters they were not frightened by the signs of increased tensions, including armed police patrolling at the housing where they have been quarantining ahead of the parliament session.
""I will go to parliament on Monday as we are members of parliament elected by the people,"" said NLD lawmaker Phyu Phyu Thin, a former political prisoner. 
""This is not new for us,"" she said.
Nai San Tin, a representative from the Mon Unity Party, said he was prepared to face any situation.
""We knew we would experience this kind of situation sooner or later,"" he told Reuters by phone. 

""Especially being a politician in Myanmar, we cannot avoid this.""

Francis, making the surprise announcement at his Sunday noon address, said it would be marked on the fourth Sunday of July each year in Catholic communities around the world.
The Catholic Church already has a World Day of Peace, which Pope Paul instituted in 1967, a World Day of Youth, which Pope John Paul II established in 1984, and a World Day of the Poor, which Francis started in 2017.
The worldwide Church holds special events and religious services on those days to draw attention to the needs and attributes of the groups.

Francis, 84, has often called on society to cherish the elderly as a source of wisdom and experience and he has lamented a ""throwaway culture"" that puts them aside because they are no longer productive.

984,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 06:41AM ET</span>",WHO team visits Wuhan market where first COVID infections detected,"By Martin Quin Pollard and Thomas Peter
WUHAN, China (Reuters) - A World Health Organization-led team of experts investigating the origins of COVID-19 visited Huanan market on Sunday, the now-shuttered wholesale seafood centre in the Chinese city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus was initially detected.
The team arrived at Huanan amid heavy security, with additional barricades set up outside a high blue fence surrounding the market, and left in a convoy after about one hour. The experts did not take questions from journalists.
Since being released from a two-week quarantine on Thursday, the team has visited hospitals and markets, as well as an exhibition commemorating Wuhan's battle with the virus, which included a 76-day lockdown of the city of 11 million.
""Very important site visits today - a wholesale market first & Huanan Seafood Market just now. Very informative & critical for our joint teams to understand the epidemiology of COVID as it started to spread at the end of 2019,"" team member Peter Daszak said on Twitter.
The WHO, which has sought to manage expectations for the mission, said on Friday that team members would be limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and would not have any contact with community members, due to health restrictions.
No full itinerary for the team's two weeks of field work has been announced, and journalists covering the tightly controlled visit have been kept at a distance from team members.
Public access to the sprawling Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has been restricted since it was shut at the beginning of last year. 
Before its closure, the market bustled with hundreds of stalls divided into sections for meat, seafood and vegetables. Now it stands as a landmark in a city that was traumatised as the original epicentre of what became the pandemic. 
On Dec. 31, 2019, after four cases of a mystery pneumonia were linked to the market, it was shuttered overnight. By the end of January, Wuhan had gone into a 76-day lockdown.
Experts say the Huanan market still plays a role in tracing the origins of the virus, since the first cluster of cases was identified there.
The WHO-led probe in Wuhan has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between China and the United States, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.
The origins of the virus have become highly politicised, and some Chinese diplomats and state media have thrown support behind theories that the virus potentially originated in another country. 

The team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which then-U.S. President Donald Trump accused of being ""China-centric"".

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's energy ministry said on Sunday that documents about a potential plan to build a nuclear power plant in North Korea were meant to suggest an ""idea"" but this has never been pursued as an official project. 
On Thursday, South Korean broadcaster SBS unveiled a prosecution indictment listing more than a dozen documents from the energy ministry that suggested a previously unknown project to set up a nuclear plant in North Korea.
This raised questions over whether South Korea's President Moon Jae-in had sought any nuclear energy programme for North Korea as part of his drive to restart inter-Korean economic cooperation.
Many of the files were dated to May 2018, a month after Moon held his first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
Shin Hee-dong, spokesman of South Korea's energy ministry, said the files were ""internal documents"" that were discussed only among ministry officials after the summit, as an idea to consider in the future when the two Koreas can potentially reopen economic exchanges. 
""We've confirmed that those documents were considered internally within the ministry as an idea for inter-Korean energy cooperation,"" Shin told a briefing.
""But the idea was never pursued as a government policy, and it is not true that we had sought to clandestinely build a nuclear plant."" 
Shin said one of the documents stipulated that the idea entailed ""high uncertainty"" due to the need for nuclear negotiations between North Korea and the United States.
He declined to elaborate when asked about other details, citing an ongoing prosecution investigation, but expressed regret that the ministry had deleted the files. 
The documents were among some 530 that the ministry had deleted to conceal that it had distorted feasibility studies to shut down a reactor in South Korea. Prosecutors last month indicted three officials on charges of violating the Criminal Act by damaging public records. 
Some of the files were reportedly titled ""A plan to build a nuclear plant in North Korea"" and ""Tasks for phased cooperation to establish electricity infrastructure in North Korea.""

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's ruling Communist Party re-elected its 76-year-old chief Nguyen Phu Trong for a rare third five-year term on Sunday, as the Southeast Asian country battled its biggest coronavirus outbreak since the pandemic began.
Trong, who emerged on top in a power struggle at the last congress in 2016 and has spearheaded a ""blazing furnace"" crackdown on corruption in the last five years, was granted an exception to party rules that say people over the age of 65 should retire, cementing his position as one of the country's strongest and longest-serving leaders for decades.
""Comrade Nguyen Phu Trong was elected to be the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam, term XIII,"" the official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported.
Trong's re-election as party general secretary came at a five-yearly party congress in Hanoi, where 1,600 party delegates from across Vietnam are concluding eight days of meetings, mostly behind closed doors, to pick a new leadership team, aiming to bolster Vietnam's ongoing economic success - and the legitimacy of the party's rule.
((For a profile on Trong, click here https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-politics-trong-idUSKBN2A006T))
Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four ""pillars"": the chief of its Communist Party, the most powerful post; a president; a prime minister; and the National Assembly chair.
While ascent to the highest levels of Vietnamese politics is governed by party regulations, in reality the highly secretive process revolves around building consensus and vying for control of the decision-making Politburo. 
That means exceptions to rules can be granted - especially if consensus on the top candidates cannot be reached.
China's President and ruling Communist Party chief Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to Trong on Sunday, the official Xinhua news agency reported.
HANOI SHUTS SCHOOLS
Since taking office in 2011, Trong has built up a power base that saw him emerge on top in a showdown with former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung at the last congress in 2016.
His crackdown on corruption, described by government critics as politically motivated, has seen dozens of high-level officials, including one Politburo member, sentenced to lengthy jail terms.
Trong's re-selection by members of the ruling Communist Party came as Vietnam battles a new COVID-19 outbreak that has infected at least 221 people and spread to at least eight cities and provinces in the country, including the southern economic hub of Ho Chi Minh City and the capital, Hanoi.
After the new outbreak was detected, state media have reported the congress would end on Monday, a day earlier than planned. 
The Ministry of Health reported 14 new COVID-19 infections early on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 1,781, with 35 deaths.

Authorities in Hanoi announced on Sunday that all schools in the city would close, after locking down several residential areas and a factory in the northern province of Hai Duong, the outbreak's epicentre, since the first cases of community transmission in almost two months were detected there last week.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's prime minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday protesters that stormed New Delhi's Red Fort had caused ""insult"" to the country, his first public comments on a months-long farmers' agitation that turned violent last week.
Tens of thousands of farmers have camped on the outskirts of the capital for more than two months, protesting new agricultural laws they say benefit private buyers at the expense of growers.
A tractor parade on Tuesday's Republic Day turned violent when some protesters deviated from pre-agreed routes, clashing with police and breaking into the historic Red Fort complex in the capital. One died and hundreds were injured.
""The country was saddened by the insult to the Tricolor (Indian flag) on the 26th of January in Delhi,"" Modi said in a radio address on Sunday.
""The government is committed to modernizing agriculture and is also taking many steps in that direction.""
Farm leaders say they were not responsible for violence, that was caused by a minority of those on the parade, and the government has left open the possibility talks between the two sides will resume. 
Modi told opposition party leaders on Saturday an offer to freeze the laws for 18 months still stands, according to a government summary of the meeting.
Agriculture employs about half of India's labour force, and unrest among an estimated 150 million landowning farmers is one of the biggest challenges to Modi's rule since he first came to power in 2014.

989,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 03:55AM ET</span>","Nguyen Phu Trong, Vietnam's anti-corruption czar, crowned party chief again","By James Pearson
HANOI (Reuters) - Nguyen Phu Trong, re-elected as Vietnam's most powerful man on Sunday, is one of the Southeast Asian country's strongest and longest-serving leaders since founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh.
Trong, 76, winning a rare third term as general secretary of the ruling Communist Party at a five-yearly party congress, combines decades at the pinnacles of power with the cultivated image of a frugal wordsmith serving the nation of 98 million people.
Famed for his ""blazing furnace"" crackdown on corruption, Trong's Communist Party has also been criticised by human rights groups for a crackdown on dissent.
Frail but in strong command for now, the committed Marxist-Leninist becomes Vietnam's longest-serving party chief since Le Duan, who ruled with an iron fist after the 1969 death of ""Uncle Ho"".
Trong's rise and long rule stand in contrast with a trend of greater power sharing among the country's top four leaders since the ""Doi Moi"" reforms of the 1980s that transformed Vietnam from a war-torn agrarian basket case into one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.
Trong's post of party chief eclipses the other three - president, prime minister and National Assembly chair. Trong has also held the largely ceremonial role of Vietnam's president since his predecessor died in 2018.
He emerged on top in a power struggle with former prime minister Nguyen Tan Dung at the last party congress in 2016 and has since presided over an intense crackdown on corruption that has seen the jailing of dozens of high-ranking officials, including a politburo member.
Critics say the crackdown, which has targeted many of Dung's allies, is politically motivated. Rights groups have criticised Trong for presiding over an intensified muzzling of dissent.
The language used by the party to describe its chief has changed under Trong, analysts say.
In 2019, the party released a book about him called ""General Secretary and State President Nguyen Phu Trong: With the feelings of the people in the country and international friends"".
Across 600 pages, it speaks of Trong as an ""intelligent, brave and pure leader"" striving to bring Vietnam ""shoulder to shoulder with the powers of the five continents, as Uncle Ho respectfully wished"", the book's prelude says.
""I haven't seen such language used about any other leader since the days of Ho Chi Minh,"" said Linh Nguyen, a Singapore-based analyst at risk consultancy Control Risks. ""It is a cult of personality under construction.""
HAMMER AND SICKLE
Trong has called for better party discipline and for stamping out corruption in its ranks. 
A poem in the book describes Trong as ""a noble man, sent by the spirits to purify the system,"" an apparent reference to the corruption crackdown. ""Hammer and sickle in hand, he dispels gloom, waiting for the sunshine.""
Securing a third term implies that other party factions do not view Trong as a threat to their long-term race to power, said Nguyen at Control Risks. ""He can be a kind of compromise figure,"" she said.
There were times during Trong's second term where the future of his rule seemed uncertain. He disappeared from public view for nearly a month in 2019 with an undisclosed illness. He has since appeared visibly frail at official meetings and often requires assistance to walk but has maintained his command of the party and outmanoeuvred rivals. 
He has also demonstrated mental strength, delivering a wide-ranging 78-minute speech at the opening of the party congress last week.
LIVING THE 'DREAM'
From a young age, Trong was interested in folk literature, according to a biography posted to the website of Vietnam National University, where one of his first published works - a 1967 review of folk poetry - is on display.
He once dreamed of a career in literature or journalism, according to the biography, an ambition he realised in 1991 when he became editor-in-chief of the party's Communist Review magazine after a stint in the Soviet Union.
Although Trong occasionally works in the colonial-era presidential mansion, he lives in modest, state-appointed housing. His official image is that of a man who detests excess, refusing expensive Lunar New Year gifts from friends, and who in the past rode to work on a Honda Dream - one of Vietnam's most popular workhorse motorbikes.
""He's a sincere person. Not noisy, but profound,"" Vu Mao, the late chairman of Vietnam's National Assembly, told Reuters in a 2018 interview.
True to the image that the party has carefully created, Mao described Trong as a quiet, modest man who enjoyed singing in Russian when they met. He expressed doubt about Trong's preference for riding a motorbike, however.
""It's not that extreme. It's not safe for him to ride a motorbike,"" Mao said. ""I think people made it up to paint a good picture of him.""

Thousands of people, from members of parliaments worldwide to former winners, are eligible to propose candidates. Nominations, which close on Sunday, do not imply an endorsement from the Nobel committee.

According to a Reuters survey of Norwegian lawmakers, nominees include Thunberg, Navalny, the WHO and its COVAX programme to secure fair access to COVID-19 vaccines for poor countries.
Thunberg was named as one of ""the foremost spokespeople in the fight against the climate crisis"", with the campaigning group she co-founded, Fridays for Future, also receiving a nod. 
Navalny, nominated by Russian academics, was named for his ""efforts for a peaceful democratisation of Russia"" by Norwegian former minister Ola Elvestuen.
The battle against COVID-19 is front and centre, including a nomination for the GAVI vaccine alliance.
Other names are Belarusian activists Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Maria Kolesnikova and Veronika Tsepkalo for their ""fight for a fair election and inspiration for peaceful resistance"", one nominator, Geir Sigbjoern Toskedal, said.
Another, Jette Christensen, also named the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights group, and IUSTITIA, a group of Polish judges defending civil rights.
""My nomination this year is ... for the fight to preserve democracy as a form of government in Europe,"" Christensen said.
Freedom of information is a recurring theme with nominees including the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists; former Charlie Hebdo journalist Zineb el Rhazoui; news website Hong Kong Free Press, the U.S.-based International Fact-Checking Network and Paris-based Reporters without Borders (RSF).
Other nominees include former U.S. President Donald Trump, NATO and the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR).
Also on the list is Aminatou Haidar, for her peaceful campaigning towards an independent Western Sahara, the International Space Station and the International Scout Movement.
The 2021 laureate will be announced in October.

991,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 31, 2021 12:50AM ET</span>",UK opens special visa route for Hong Kong residents to become citizens,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong residents can apply from Sunday for a new visa offering them an opportunity to become British citizens after Beijing's imposition of a national security law in the Asian financial hub last year.
The move comes as China and Hong Kong have said they will no longer recognise the British National Overseas (BNO) passport as a valid travel document from Sunday, Jan. 31.
Britain and China have been arguing for months about what London and Washington say is an attempt to silence dissent in Hong Kong after pro-democracy protests in 2019 and 2020. 
Britain says it is fulfilling a historic and moral commitment to Hong Kong people after Beijing imposed the security law on the semi-autonomous city that Britain says breaches the terms of agreements under which the colony was handed back to China in 1997.
The UK government forecasts the new visa could attract more than 300,000 people and their dependants to Britain. Beijing said it would make them second-class citizens. 
The scheme, which was first announced last year, allows those with BNO status to live, study and work in Britain for five years and eventually apply for citizenship.
BNO is a special status created under British law in 1987 that specifically relates to Hong Kong. 
China says the West's views on its actions over Hong Kong are clouded by misinformation and an imperial handover.
Anson Law, a 25 year old who works in sales, said he would consider using his BNO status to move to the UK even though the economy there was not as good. 
""I's still better than Hong Kong. For example, for young people like us, we don't know how to live or survive here.""
Law said people were still monitoring the situation and did not see a large number immediately moving.
Nicholas Muk, a 30 year old teacher who lived in the UK previously, said he would not apply for a BNO visa.

""If people want to move to a foreign country and think the UK is safer than Hong Kong amid a pandemic, that's their own decision.""

""All foreign nationals who hold valid Chinese residence permits for work, personal matters and reunion are temporarily not allowed to enter China from Canada,"" the consulate said in a statement on its website on Saturday.
Entry with diplomatic and service visas will not be affected, it said.
The suspension comes as Canada clamps down on cross-border travel due to COVID-19 concerns. Canada reported 4,255 new cases on Saturday, with 19,942 deaths since the start of the pandemic. 
All airline passengers arriving in Canada will be required to take a COVID-19 test at the airport and wait in a hotel for up to three days at their expense until the results arrive, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday.

In coming weeks Canadian vacationers returning from the United States by land will have to show a negative COVID-19 test result before being allowed entry.

Hungary and Serbia began inoculating their Olympic athletes on Friday, while Israel’s Olympic Committee said it had already vaccinated half its Olympic delegation and would complete the process by the end of May.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said on Wednesday the organisation was not in favour of athletes ""jumping the queue"" for vaccines, a view backed by CONI President Giovanni Malago in an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
""We already know there are many countries where national athletes are about to be vaccinated,"" he said. 
""We will never ask for this and we don't want it either. An elderly person has their sacred right to be vaccinated before a 20-year-old athlete is.
""The athlete is forced to move around: they don't participate in gatherings, they go through airports, changing rooms, competitions, contacts, to defend the Italian flag. Politics needs to make this assessment, not sport.""
Shortfalls in COVID-19 vaccine deliveries from U.S. drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) have spread across Europe, as Italy joined France and Switzerland in announcing the company’s shipments for February would miss expectations.

Like many European countries, Italy is now grappling with broad vaccine delays, at least temporarily, as all Western vaccine makers with approved shots - Moderna,  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNtech, and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) -- fall behind their initial delivery targets.

CATARINA, Guatemala (Reuters) - The family of a young Guatemalan woman believed to be among 19 victims of a massacre in northern Mexico has urged the Mexican government to bring those responsible to justice.
Authorities in Mexico's Tamaulipas state bordering the United States this month recovered the bodies, which some Guatemalan families said they feared were loved ones who had been trying to migrate to the United States.
Many of the dead had gunshot wounds and were badly charred. Authorities are still trying to identify them.
Paola Damaris Zacarias, 22, from the small Guatemalan town of Catarina near the border with Mexico, is suspected to have been among those who died, her grieving family told Reuters.
""We want justice, an investigation that gets right to the bottom of who was responsible,"" her brother Hector Zacarias said in an interview on Friday. ""I ask the Mexican authorities to look into this, to find out the truth, and what motivated it.""
""This has caused us great sorrow.""
Paola's father, Gerardo Zacarias, said the family had given DNA samples in the hope that investigators can identify the remains found in Tamaulipas, an often dangerous region where migrants have previously fallen victim to ruthless drug gangs.
Zacarias said his daughter had set off for the United States to find work because of the lack of opportunities in Guatemala. The family last heard from her on Jan. 22, he said, not long before Mexican officials discovered the bodies. 
The killings have caused renewed consternation in Mexico about the perils faced by migrants, many of whom come from the three violent and impoverished Central American countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
Hector Zacarias was disconsolate.

""These are young people with goals, who were battling to get ahead in the world,"" he said. ""But unfortunately, they fell into the hands of people with no heart, no mercy.""

The transitional government will oversee preparations for the vote that aims to end a decade of chaos and conflict that has left Libya split down the middle and hammered its vital oil exports on which the country's economy depends.
The 75 participants at talks in Switzerland, ranging from regional and tribal figures to representatives of political factions, will vote next week to pick a three-person presidential council and a prime minister.
They will pick from 24 candidates for the three presidential council posts, while 21 people are vying for the post of prime minister, according to the U.N. list released on Saturday.
While U.N.-backed talks have progressed, many Libyans fear competition for posts could yet trigger fresh fighting, unravelling a ceasefire that has largely held since October.
Libya has been riven since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011, one of several autocrats ousted after decades of rule during uprisings that swept the Arab world.
Since 2014, control of Libya has been split between an internationally-recognised government in the west, based in the capital Tripoli, and its opponents based in Benghazi in the east. Each side has also grappled with internal divisions, while armed groups have seized control of key state institutions.
In the chaos, foreign powers have backed rival camps. Turkey has supported the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, while Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have backed Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) in the east.
Participants at the U.N. talks agreed a formula for voting on the candidates for the transitional government this month.

The list of approved candidates includes Aguila Saleh, head of the eastern-based parliament, while they also include the GNA's Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha, Defence Minister Saleh Namroush and Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Maiteeg.

It was the third time the outdoor event, one of the largest music festivals in the world, had been canceled or postponed because of the pandemic.
""The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Stagecoach Country Music Festival currently scheduled for April 2021 are hereby cancelled,"" an order from Riverside County Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser said.
It said the decision was made to reduce the likelihood of exposure to the virus.
Coachella brings half a million fans to an open-air site in the California desert. Its April 2020 event was initially rescheduled for October 2020, and then again to April 2021.
Festival organizers did not immediately return a request for comment. No details for the April 2021 line-up had been announced and no new dates for the event were given. 
The decision follows a surge in coronavirus cases and deaths in southern California in the past two months.

After being wiped out in 2020, other major cultural gatherings are shifting dates again for 2021. Organizers of the Glastonbury music festival in England last week cancelled the June event and the Cannes film festival in France this week postponed its traditional May event to early July.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian businessman Arkady Rotenberg said on Saturday he owns a huge palace in southern Russia which jailed Kremlin critic Alexey Navalny has linked to President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny and his anti-corruption foundation have published a video in which they allege the opulent mansion belonged to the Russian leader. The video has been viewed more than 103 million times.
Rotenberg, Putin's former judo sparring partner who sold his stake in gas pipeline construction firm Stroygazmontazh in 2019 for a sum which RBC business daily put at some 75 billion roubles ($990 million), said he bought the palace two years ago. 
""Now it will no longer be a secret, I am the beneficiary,"" Rotenberg said in a video published by Mash channel in Telegram. ""There was a rather complicated facility, there were a lot of creditors, and I managed to become the beneficiary.""
He gave no further financial details of the purchase or how it had been funded. 
Putin has already denied ownership of the palace. 
Navalny was remanded in custody for 30 days on Jan. 18 for parole violations he says were trumped up and could face years in jail. He was arrested after flying back to Moscow from Germany, where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning last August.
After Navalny's arrest thousands of people joined unsanctioned protests across Russia last Saturday to demand the Kremlin release Navalny from jail. 
Navalny's supporters plan to hold further protest rallies across Russia this Sunday. Authorities have said they are illegal and have vowed to break them up.
Rotenberg was among the Russian officials and business executives blacklisted by the United States and other Western powers in the aftermath of Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014.
Russian police on Saturday detained Sergey Smirnov, editor-in-chief of independent media outlet Mediazona, in Moscow on suspicion of taking part in last weekend's Moscow protest, Mediazona said on Saturday.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - The family of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl, who was kidnapped and beheaded in Pakistan in 2001, plans to appeal to Pakistan's Supreme Court to overturn a decision to free the four men convicted of his murder.
A panel of three judges of the court on Thursday threw out the 2002 murder convictions against the four Islamists, including group's British-born ringleader, Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh.
Kidnapping convictions were left in place, but the men were ordered freed as they had already served out sentences for the kidnapping charges. 
The Pearl family ""intends to file a review petition against the illegal and unjust majority decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan,"" said a statement issued by the family’s lawyer, Faisal Siddiqui, on Saturday night.

Health Ministry data showed that, out of 850 ICU beds allocated to COVID-19 cases on its mainland, a record 843 beds were now occupied. The nation of 10 million people has an additional 420 ICU beds for those with other ailments.
The ministry said the number of daily infections was 12,435, dipping from Thursday's record, while there were 293 deaths.
Portugal, which has so far reported a total of 12,179 COVID-19 deaths and 711,018 cases, has the world's highest seven-day rolling average of cases and deaths per capita, according to data tracker www.ourworldindata.org. 
The Justice Ministry said on Friday its institute of forensic medicine, whose role includes handling autopsies for the police and others, had requested a refrigerator truck to preserve bodies as funeral homes were not able to take them fast enough.
An association representing funeral homes said public hospitals were also running out of refrigerated space to preserve bodies. Some hospitals have installed cold containers to ease pressure on their morgues.
With mainland beds running low, three patients needing critical care were airlifted from Lisbon to the Portuguese island of Madeira on Friday, where the health system is under less pressure.
The government has attributed the surge in infections to a decision to relax restrictions over the Christmas period, blaming the speed at which infections have spread on a new variant first detected in Britain.

Portugal's health institute, the Ricardo Jorge, told Lusa news agency the variant was likely to account for 65% of new COVID-19 cases within three weeks. Portugal has extended a lockdown to mid-February and imposed strict travel restrictions.

The ministry said in a statement the bomb attack took place in an industrial site at the center of the town and wounded 22 people, blaming the attack on the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia.
There was no immediate comment from the YPG.
Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group tied to the PKK inside its own borders, and has staged incursions into Syria in support of Syrian rebels to push it from the Turkish frontier.
Ankara now retains a large military presence in the area deploying thousands of troops in the last rebel enclave.

DHAKA (Reuters) - More than 1,400 Rohingya Muslim refugees were relocated to a remote island in the Bay of Bengal on Saturday, despite opposition from human rights groups concerned about the site's vulnerability to storms and flooding.
Including a similar sized group who were moved on Friday, it brings to around 6,700 the number of Rohingya refugees that Bangladesh has moved to the island of Bhasan Char since December.
Bangladesh says the relocation is voluntary, but some of the first group of refugees who were relocated spoke of being coerced. The government also says overcrowding in refugee camps in the Cox's Bazar district fuels crime.
""This time we have received a total 3,242 Rohingya in two days. Everyone is happy with the arrangements here,"" Navy Commodore Abdullah Al Mamun Chowdhury, the officer in charge of the island, told Reuters by telephone. 
Five ships moved 1,466 Rohingya and their belongings on Saturday after they were transferred from the camps to Chittagong, he said.
The Rohingya, a minority group who fled violence in neighbouring Buddhist-majority Myanmar, are not allowed to move off the island, which is several hours' journey away from the southern port.
The Dhaka government wants to move 10 percent of the 1 million refugees living in ramshackle border camps.
Two Rohingya refugees who moved on Friday with their families told Reuters that frequent violence in the camps had forced the decision to relocate.
""We have been living in fear... In recent times almost everyday there is an exchange of fire and attacks centering on the domination of the armed Rohingya groups,"" said a 28-year-old refugee, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal.
""Murder, kidnapping, rape, drugs and other crimes have gone up these day,"" said a 42-year-old refugee, who moved along with his wife and six children.
Two other Rohingya men told Reuters they moved to their new home voluntarily in ""hope of a better life.""
The government has dismissed safety concerns over the island, citing the building of flood defences as well as housing for 100,000 people, hospitals and cyclone centres.
Bangladesh has drawn criticism for a reluctance to consult with the United Nations refugee agency and other aid bodies over the transfers. 
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees says the agency has not been allowed to evaluate the safety and sustainability of life on the island.

Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abdul Momen told Reuters last month the U.N. should first assess and verify how conducive the environment in Myanmar's Rakhine state was for repatriating the refugees, before carrying out an assessment of Bhasan Char.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - The World Health Organization-led team investigating the origins of COVID-19 during a mission that has been tightly controlled by its Chinese hosts visited a hospital on Saturday in the central city of Wuhan that treated early coronavirus patients.
On its second day after two weeks in quarantine, the team went to Jinyintan Hospital, where doctors had collected samples from patients suffering from an unidentified pneumonia in late 2019.
""Important opportunity to talk directly w/ medics who were on the ground at that critical time fighting COVID!"", team member Peter Daszak said on Twitter. 
Team members leaving the hospital did not speak to journalists, who have been kept at a distance since the group left its quarantine hotel on Thursday.
""Just back from visit at Jinyintan hospital, that specialised in infectious diseases and was designated for treatment of the first cases in Wuhan. Stories quite similar to what I have heard from our ICU doctors,"" team member Marion Koopmans tweeted.
The WHO-led probe has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between Beijing and Washington, which accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.
The WHO, which has sought to manage expectations for the mission, said on Friday that team members would be limited to visits organised by their Chinese hosts and would not have any contact with community members, due to health restrictions.
Exactly a year ago, the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), its highest level of alarm. 
The group's itinerary has not been announced but the WHO has said the team plans to visit the seafood market at the centre of the early outbreak as well as the Wuhan Institute of Virology. One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.
Later on Saturday, the WHO team went to an exhibition centre that features an exhibit commemorating early efforts to battle the outbreak in Wuhan, which included a 76-day lockdown of the city of 11 million.
The investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former U.S. President Donald Trump accused of being ""China-centric"".
China has pushed the idea that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers saying it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.

China's foreign ministry has also hinted that the sudden closure of a U.S. army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the pandemic.

The Southeast Asian nation was at risk of returning to a Financial Action Task Force ""grey list"" which could delay foreign investment and make remittances from millions of Filipinos overseas, which powers domestic consumer spending, subject to stricter scrutiny and monitoring.
The new law expands the powers of the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC), allowing it to impose targeted financial sanctions against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and its financing. It also allows the council to apply for court summons, and search and seizure warrants.
""Consistent with its foreign policy, the state shall extend cooperation in transnational investigations and prosecutions of persons involved in money laundering activities wherever committed,"" the legislation says.
The AMLC will also be able to scrutinise transactions involving Philippine-based online casino operators, which employ thousands of mainland Chinese workers, and real-estate firms and brokers engaging in single cash transactions worth more than 7.5 million pesos ($160,000).
The Financial Action Task Force, a Paris-based inter-governmental agency, grey-listed the Philippines in 2000 for failing to address money-laundering issues. It was removed from the list in 2005 after amending its law.
The agency gave the Philippines until Feb. 1 to strengthen its law on anti-money laundering, extending its original deadline of October 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Travellers from other regions, including neighbouring countries, will have to have tested negative before arrival in the country, Alireza Raisi, spokesman for the national coronavirus task force, said on state TV.
Raisi said travellers arriving from Europe should be holding negative test results, will be tested again and will have to self-quarantine even if their test is negative, state media reported.
Previously, people coming from Europe were only required to test negative. 
He did not say when exactly the new measures will go into effect, saying only ""from now on."" 
Meanwhile, health officials said the Iranian-manufactured Barekat vaccine was found effective against the highly contagious coronavirus variant that emerged in Britain. 
“Tests conducted on the blood plasma of three volunteers of 'COVIran Barekat' vaccine completely neutralized the mutated coronavirus,” Hassan Jalili, who is in charge of the team that produces the local vaccine, told state TV.
Iran launched human trials of its first domestic vaccine candidate late last month, saying this could help it defeat the pandemic despite U.S. sanctions that affect its ability to import vaccines.
It has also approved Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine and plans to both import it and produce it.
The country has recorded more than 1.4 million cases and over 57,800 deaths, according to government data, but there has been a decline in new infections in recent weeks.

The Wockhardt plant in Wrexham provides so-called fill-and-finish capacity for AstraZeneca’s British supply chain, which is the final manufacturing step of putting vaccines into vials or syringes and packaging them.
Kent police said Anthony Collins, 53, has been charged with dispatching the package in the post, which was investigated by a bomb disposal squad.
In a statement, the police said the package was ""not a viable device"".
AstraZeneca has agreed to supply Britain with 100 million doses of the COVID vaccine it developed with Oxford University, with the shots forming the central plank of its mass vaccination programme.

The mayor of St Anton, one of Austria's top resorts, said this week that dozens of young tourists from across Europe had recently come to his town and circumvented lockdown rules under which ski lifts are open but hotels are closed to tourists.
""Among others Britons, Danes, Swedes, Romanians, Germans, Australians, Irish people and Poles were checked and fined,"" the police force of the western province of Tyrol said in a statement issued on Friday night.
The operation was carried out on Friday evening with 15 officers, and those found in breach face fines of up to 2,180 euros ($2,650), the statement said.
Austria, a country of just under 9 million people, has recorded 413,208 cases and 7,703 deaths in the pandemic so far. Daily new cases have dropped to roughly 1,500 from a peak of more than 9,000 in November but are now falling only slowly.
It has been in its third national lockdown since Dec. 26, with non-essential shops closed. In addition, from Dec. 19 to Jan. 10 even stricter rules on entering the country were put in place largely to discourage skiers, forcing arrivals from almost every country in Europe to go into quarantine.
In recent weeks, however, the public has been stunned to learn of loopholes, often involving work or training. Although regular skiers cannot stay overnight at a resort, coronavirus clusters emerged at ski teacher training courses, which were allowed to be held for visitors from across Europe.
Tourist accommodation is only available to business travellers, and St Anton's Mayor Helmut Mall has said new arrivals there have registered a local address saying they are looking for work even though there are no jobs available.
The police did not say exactly what offences had been committed but said the foreigners had breached lockdown and immigration regulations as well as the law on registering an address.

SINGHU, India (Reuters) - India blocked mobile internet services in several areas around New Delhi on Saturday as protesting farmers began a one-day hunger strike after a week of clashes with authorities that left one dead and hundreds injured. 
Angry at new agricultural laws that they say benefit large private food buyers at the expense of producers, tens of thousands of farmers have been camped at protest sites on the outskirts of the capital for more than two months. 
At the main protest site near the village of Singhu on the northern outskirts of the city, there was a heightened police presence on Saturday as hundreds of tractors arrived from Haryana, one of two states at the centre of the protests. 
""Many farmers' groups have joined the protest site since last night,"" said Mahesh Singh, a 65-year-old farmer from Haryana. ""They have come to show their support and more farmers are expected to come in the next two days."" 
India's interior ministry said on Saturday internet services at three locations on the outskirts of New Delhi where protests are occurring had been suspended until 11 p.m. (1730 GMT) on Sunday to ""maintain public safety"".
Indian authorities often block local internet services when they believe there will be unrest, although the move is unusual in the capital.
Farm leaders said the hunger strike by hundreds of protesters, primarily at Singhu and two other protest sites and designed to coincide with the anniversary of the death of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, would show Indians that the demonstrations were non-violent. 
""The farmers' movement was peaceful and will be peaceful,"" said Darshan Pal, a leader of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha group of farm unions organising the protests. ""The events on January 30 will be organised to spread the values of truth and non-violence."" 
Agriculture employs about half of India's population of 1.3 billion, and unrest among an estimated 150 million landowning farmers is one of the biggest challenges to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi since coming to power in 2014. 
Eleven rounds of talks between farm unions and the government have failed to break the deadlock. The government has offered to put the laws on hold for 18 months, but farmers say they will not end their protests for anything less than full repeal. 
In the past week, a planned tractor parade on Tuesday's Republic Day anniversary turned violent when some protesters deviated from pre-agreed routes, tore down barricades and clashed with police, who used tear gas to try and restrain them. 

Sporadic clashes between protesters, police and groups shouting anti-farmer slogans have broken out on multiple occasions since then.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's military said on Saturday it would protect and abide by the constitution and act according to law, a move that could allay concerns that the armed forces might attempt to seize power. 
The statement comes a day after United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and Western embassies in Myanmar expressed serious concerns about the possibility of army intervention in Myanmar, a country ruled by the military for 49 years after a 1962 coup.
The military, known as the Tatmadaw, said recent remarks by its commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, about abolishing the constitution had been misinterpreted.
""The Tatmadaw is protecting the 2008 constitution and will act according to the law,"" it said. ""Some organisations and media assumed what they want and wrote as Tatmadaw will abolish the constitution."" 
Aung San Suu Kyi's ruling National League for Democracy Party (NLD), which won November's election in a landslide, called the statement a ""suitable explanation"". 
NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters the party wanted the military to be an organisation ""that accepts the people's desire regarding the election"".
Myanmar-based analyst Richard Horsey said an imminent coup now seemed unlikely. 
""It appears that Myanmar military has stepped back from its coup threat,"" he said on Twitter. ""How to interpret that, and what it means for stability going forward, depends on the behind the scenes details that aren't clear yet.""
Political tensions escalated this week when a military spokesman declined to rule out a coup ahead of a new parliament convening next week, and warned the armed forces could ""take action"" if its complaints about vote fraud were not addressed.
Pro-military demonstrations were held in several major cities. On Saturday, about 200 people marched through the commercial capital of Yangon, waving banners and chanting in support of the military and against foreign intervention in the country’s internal affairs. 
The crowd, walking in the shadow of Shwedagon Pagoda, Myanmar's most important Buddhist site, called on government and the election commission to resolve complaints of fraud.
Myanmar's election commission on Thursday rejected the military's allegations of vote fraud, saying there were no errors big enough to affect the credibility of the vote.
The army's repeated allegations of irregularities in the election, in which the NLD won 83% of seats, have led to the most direct confrontation yet between the civilian government and the military, which has an awkward power-sharing agreement.
The constitution reserves 25% of seats in parliament for the military and control of three key ministries in Suu Kyi's administration.
Military chief Min Aung Hlaing added to the coup fears when he told military personnel on Wednesday that the constitution should be repealed if it was not abided by, citing previous instances when charters had been abolished in Myanmar.

In Saturday's statement, the military said his remarks were ""to make them understand the situation of the constitution.""

The Mizan site said Javid Dehghan, who it said was a leader of the Sunni militant group Jaish al-Adl, or the Army of Justice, was hanged for shooting dead two Guards five years ago in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province.
In a tweet on Friday, the United Nations human rights office called for a halt to Dehghan’s imminent execution and condemned “a series of executions – at least 28 – since mid-December, including of people from minority groups.”
World bodies and human rights groups have often criticised Iran for its rights record and large number of executions - the world’s highest after China, according to Amnesty International.
Amnesty said the court that convicted Dehghan relied on ""torture-tainted ‘confessions’"" and ignored serious abuses of due process by Revolutionary Guards agents and prosecution authorities during the investigation.
The impoverished Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan, has long been the scene of frequent clashes between security forces and Sunni militants and drug smugglers. The population of the province is predominantly Sunni Muslim, while most Iranians are Shi’ite.
Jaish al-Adl, which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for ethnic minority Baluchis, has claimed responsibility for several attacks in recent years on Iranian security forces in the province.
On Thursday, state media said an Iranian member of Islamic State was executed in southwestern Khuzestan province, home to many of Iran’s ethnic Arabs, for taking part in an attack that killed two paramilitary Basij militiamen.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Teresa Cheng reiterated on Saturday that Britain had no rights over the city under the joint declaration that laid the blueprint for how the city would be ruled after its 1997 reunification with China.
Cheng made the comments in a blog post on the eve of changes to the UK's visa application program that will allow Hong Kong residents who hold a British National Overseas (BNO) passport to live, study and work in Britain for five years and eventually apply for citizenship.
BNO status was created by Britain in 1987 specifically for Hong Kong residents.
Cheng cited former Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in Hong Kong, Xie Feng, as saying ""the UK has no sovereignty, jurisdiction or right of ‘supervision’ over Hong Kong whatsoever after the latter returned to China"" under the Joint Declaration.
Beijing's imposition of a national security law in Hong Kong in June last year prompted Britain to offer refuge to almost 3 million Hong Kong residents eligible for the BNO passport from Jan. 31.

China and the Hong Kong government had already hit back at the visa change, by saying they would no longer recognise the BNO passport as a valid travel document from Sunday, Jan. 31.

On Friday, a senior aide to U.S. President Joe Biden said the administration is working on a system to process the asylum seekers who are waiting in Mexico under a Trump-era program known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP).
""We're reviewing now how we can process the migrants who are already in this program,"" the aide, Roberta Jacobson, said on a call with reporters. ""How to prioritize the people who were enrolled not only months but years ago, and above all, people who are the most vulnerable.""
Jacobson said all of those waiting in Mexico under the program will have an opportunity to present claims.
The protocols, in place since 2019, pushed more than 65,000 asylum seekers back across the border to wait for their U.S. court hearings, although far fewer are believed to still be in Mexico.
The Biden administration stopped adding people to MPP last week, but has not outlined how it will process the claims of those already enrolled.
Advocates have documented the dangers they face while waiting, including rape and murder.
Jacobson said the administration would process people ""in a much more rapid manner than in the past.""
She asked asylum seekers not to rush to the U.S. border, however, as it would not speed up the process.
""Please, wait,"" she said.
The population of a makeshift camp in the Mexican border city of Matamoros, across the river from Brownsville, Texas, has been slowly swelling, migrants and aid workers say, despite attempts by Mexican authorities to control it.
""It's been growing because people think that if you're in the camp, you'll be able to enter (the United States) first,"" said Honduran asylum seeker Oscar Borjas, who estimated up to 800 people, including women and children, live in the camp.
He and other residents welcomed Jacobson's comments.
""Everything is changing for the better,"" said Dairon Elisondo, an asylum seeker and doctor from Cuba, who provides medical care to fellow migrants.
But asylum seekers also urged the U.S. administration to act soon.

""If they don't do something soon, people are going to start trying to cross (illegally). People are desperate,"" said Yuri Gonzalez, from Cuba, who is waiting in Ciudad Juarez.

Mexico and Argentina have a deal with AstraZeneca to produce its vaccine for distribution in Latin America, with financial support from the foundation of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. 
""We are also getting AstraZeneca vaccines, apart from the agreement we have with them - these vaccines are being made here in Mexico - we will bring AstraZeneca from India,"" Lopez Obrador said in a video broadcast on social media.
Meanwhile, deliveries of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s COVID-19 vaccine to Mexico would ""very probably"" resume on Feb. 10, Lopez Obrador said, after global delivery delays by the U.S. company. Mexico was expecting about 1.5 million doses from Pfizer, he noted.
Mexico is trying to secure as much vaccine supply as possible amid delivery delays and a surge in cases. Mexico's death toll from COVID-19 was 156,579 on Friday.
Lopez Obrador, speaking publicly for the first time since revealing on Sunday he had COVID-19, said Mexico would also receive 870,000 doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine in February. 
Additionally, Lopez Obrador said 1.8 million vaccine doses would arrive next month through a U.N.-backed mechanism, an apparent reference to the global COVAX facility. 
Mexico has secured enough vaccines to cover 20% of its 126 million people through COVAX, led by the GAVI vaccines alliance and the World Health Organization to promote equitable access.
Six million doses of the CanSino Biologics vaccine, which is due to share its clinical trial results soon, should arrive in Mexico in February, Lopez Obrador said.

It would also be ""no problem"" for Mexico to have 12 million doses of the Chinese vaccine in March, he added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military said on Friday that Chinese military flights in the past week in the South China Sea fit a pattern of destabilizing and aggressive behavior by Beijing but posed no threat to a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier strike group in the region.
""The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group closely monitored all People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and Air Force (PLAAF) activity, and at no time did they pose a threat to U.S. Navy ships, aircraft, or sailors,"" the U.S. military's Pacific Command said in a statement. 
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Chinese aircraft did not come within 250 nautical miles (460 km) of the U.S. Navy vessels.
Taiwan reported that several Chinese air force aircraft flew into the southwestern corner of its air defense identification zone last weekend, near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, including fighter jets and nuclear-capable H-6 bombers.
Regional security and diplomatic sources familiar with the situation said China's air force was dispatched on missions beginning mid-morning on Jan. 23, coinciding with the U.S. carrier group passing south of the Pratas.
China, which has long geared its military towards defending itself against the United States, was conducting exercises that would simulate an operation against an aircraft carrier, the sources said.
""They purposely conducted the drills when the U.S. carrier was passing through the Bashi Channel,"" one source said, referring to the waterway between southern Taiwan and the northern Philippines.
""That was not just meant for Taiwan. Most importantly, China is trying to tackle the issue of the South China Sea: it wants to stop the U.S. military from entering the South China Sea. China wants to diminish the United States' weight in the western Pacific.""
The sources spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
China's Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Thursday, the ministry toughened its language towards Chinese-claimed Taiwan, warning after last weekend's stepped-up military activity near the island that ""independence means war"" and that its armed forces were acting in response to provocation and foreign interference. 
China claims almost all the energy-rich waters of the South China Sea, where it has established military outposts on artificial islands. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the sea.
The waters have become a flashpoint in the Sino-U.S. relationship. Washington regularly accuses Beijing of militarizing the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbors who might want to exploit its extensive oil and gas reserves.
China, in turn, regularly bristles at U.S. military activity in the region, saying on Monday that such actions are not conducive to peace and stability in the region.
The U.S. Navy regularly conducts ""freedom of navigation"" operations by ships close to some of the islands China occupies, asserting freedom of access to international waterways.
The U.S. Pacific Command renewed its pledge to continue operations in the region.

""The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, demonstrating resolve through our operational presence throughout the region,"" Pacific Command said.

(Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. lawmaker urged the Biden administration to involve additional major healthcare distributors in the shipment of COVID-19 vaccines to speed vaccinations, according to a letter seen by Reuters. 
The Trump administration signed an exclusive deal with healthcare distributor McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) to ship COVID-19 vaccines for the government. That distribution system has broadly worked, but it will face new demands as vaccines from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and other companies are expected to be added.
""Given the scale of vaccinations needed in response to this pandemic ... I encourage you to consider utilizing all distributors and the full infrastructure of our commercial pharmaceutical distribution network,"" Representative Anna Eshoo wrote in the letter, which was dated Jan. 28 and addressed to Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. 
Eshoo is the chair of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health. 
Reuters reported on Thursday that federal officials are talking to U.S. pharmaceutical distributors about increasing the number of companies shipping coronavirus vaccines, but have not yet made a final decision.
Eshoo cited a report by the Center for American Progress, a think-tank, that suggested enlisting all three of the largest U.S. healthcare distributors --  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), McKesson Corp and AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC) Corp -- in the COVID vaccine shipping efforts.
Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen have made proposals to the administration to take on some distribution, Reuters reported. 

President Joe Biden has called the initial phase of the vaccination campaign a “dismal failure” and plans to expand and improve the program in a bid to make vaccines available to all Americans by mid-year.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - International organizations have offered to help identify the bodies of 19 suspected Guatemalan migrants who were found burned and shot in Mexico last weekend, in a bid to ensure transparency in the investigation into what happened.
The Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said they have offered assistance to Guatemalan authorities and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where the bodies were found with gunshot wounds and badly charred.
""The ICRC is holding confidential dialogue with (Tamaulipas) authorities to see if technical support... neutral, impartial and independent, is appropriate,"" the ICRC told Reuters on Friday. ""(The officials) have the obligation to guarantee full identification (of victims) transparently and quickly.""
Mexican and Guatemalan authorities have so far collected DNA samples from relatives of the suspected victims to determine whether the 19 bodies are those of a group of migrants reported missing in the Central American country.
The ICRC and the EAAF have helped identify human remains in other cases in the United States and Mexico.
The EAAF assisted Mexican authorities probing a notorious 2010 migrant massacre in Tamaulipas as well as the disappearance of 43 student teachers in southwestern Mexico in 2014.
Oscar Hernandez, a researcher for Mexican institute Colegio de la Frontera Norte, said that migrants often look for 'coyotes' to help them cross into the United States, using the term for smugglers who are often linked to organized crime.

""Others are kidnapped, extorted and have their relatives threatened,"" he added. ""That could have happened in this case.""

POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (Reuters) - By the grave dug for Dustin Higgs, the 13th and final prisoner executed by former President Donald Trump's administration, a woman began to wail, doubling over and stomping her right foot as his coffin was lowered into the frozen ground.
""They killed my brother!"" Alexa Cave said, heaving with tears. Relatives circled around to steady her, and she said it again, loud even above the bitter winds slapping at the green canvas canopy raised over the grave.
Two weeks earlier, Cave had watched through glass as U.S. officials injected Higgs, 48, with a lethal dose of a barbiturate at the Department of Justice's execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana.
On Friday, Cave and her family buried him atop a snow-whitened hill in a cemetery in his hometown of Poughkeepsie, New York.
Higgs and an accomplice, Willis Haynes, were convicted at separate trials for the 1996 murders of Tanji Jackson, 21; Tamika Black, 19, and Mishann Chinn, 23, on a federal wildlife refuge in Maryland.
Haynes, who confessed to shooting the women, received life in prison. Higgs, who prosecutors said handed Haynes his gun and ordered him to kill, was sentenced to death. The sentencing disparity has pained Higgs' relatives.
In a statement released just after Higgs' execution, a sister of Jackson spoke of her conflicting emotions.
""On one hand, I felt we were finally going to get justice, but on the other, I felt sad for your family,"" the statement said. ""They are now going to go through the pain we experienced.""
The U.S. government revived executions last summer under Trump, a Republican and long-standing proponent of capital punishment, saying that it was authorized by Congress and owed to the victims of the ""worst criminals."" Before that, the federal government had only executed three people since 1963, though a minority of states still carry out executions each year.
If President Joe Biden has his way, Higgs could turn out to be the last person ever executed by the U.S. government. Biden, a Democrat who took office five days after the execution, has said he will seek to abolish the federal death penalty and encourage states to follow suit.
At the viewing of the body before the burial, some of Higgs' family said they would hold Biden to his promise. Cave greeted arrivals at the funeral home in downtown Poughkeepsie in a white face mask with a black slogan: ""ABOLISH the DEATH PENALTY.""
One of Higgs' nephews, Harrison Brisbon-McKinnon, had a camera on a strap around his neck and took pictures of his tearful relatives as they approached the open gray casket. It was the first time Harrison, 16, had seen his uncle in person.
""I don't feel release,"" Harrison said calmly. ""I want to end this. No one should ever have to do this again.""
An imam arrived, and Cave asked everyone to sit while he whispered a prayer over the body of Higgs, who converted to Islam in prison. 
DaQuan Darby, Higgs' 28-year-old son, said he wanted to go back to school to study law. Tierra Darby, Higgs' 23-year-old daughter, was missing her father's frequent calls from prison, asking about her life.
The siblings stood close to each other by the casket, leaning in turn to kiss their father's forehead. ""Love you, dad,"" the son said as pallbearers readied the casket for the hearse.
At the graveside, Cave could not be comforted. 

""I can't stay here,"" she cried, and family helped her away. Harrison, the nephew, photographed the sadness around him. DaQuan stayed back, peering down at his father's coffin.

(Reuters) - U.S. law enforcement agents found bomb-making instructions inside the home of a member of the Proud Boys right-wing extremist group who was charged with participating in the Jan. 6 siege of the Capitol, prosecutors said on Friday.
Dominic Pezzola, 43, had ""weapons- and bomb-making manuals"" on a thumb drive device found within his home near Rochester, New York, prosecutors said in a court filing arguing that he should be jailed pending trial.
More than 135 people have been arrested so far in connection with the rampage by supporters of then-President Donald Trump that interrupted the formal congressional certification of President Joe Biden's election victory, forced lawmakers to rush to safety and left five people dead including a police officer.
The Justice Department said Pezzola and another member of the Proud Boys, William Pepe, 31, of Beacon, New York, were indicted on charges including conspiracy, civil disorder and unlawfully entering restricted buildings or grounds.
Pezzola was also indicted on additional charges including obstruction of an official proceeding, robbery of personal property of the United States, and assaulting, resisting or impeding officers, the Justice Department said.
Separately, the FBI said bombs found at the Capitol Hill headquarters of the Democratic and Republican National Committees were placed there the evening before the attack. The FBI increased a reward for information about the incident to up to $100,000.
Pezzola, known as ""Spaz"" to associates, poses a ""serious danger to the community and a serious risk of flight,"" the prosecution brief stated. Pezzola was arrested in New York.
A lawyer for Pezzola, Mike Scibetta, said in an email that, to his knowledge, the thumb drive was given to Pezzola, was never opened by him, and contained a ""survivalist"" manual.
""The government has cherry-picked a small portion of the paper to suit their narrative,"" Scibetta said.
The prosecution court filing, citing social media posts, said Pezzola was one of the first rioters to enter the Capitol. Prosecutors said he used a police shield to break a window, allowing other protesters to enter the building. 

Once inside the Capitol, Pezzola chased a police officer up the stairs near the entrance to the Senate chamber, and smoked a cigar while bragging on video about the attack, prosecutors said.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union on Friday abruptly reversed a plan to use emergency Brexit measures to restrict exports of COVID-19 vaccines from crossing the Irish border into the United Kingdom after it sent shockwaves through Northern Ireland, London and Dublin. 
In a steep escalation of the EU's fight to secure vaccine supplies, Brussels had said it would trigger clauses in the Northern Irish Protocol to prevent the vaccines from moving across the open border between EU-member Ireland and the British-run province. 
Following an outcry in London, Belfast and Dublin, the EU published a statement just before midnight saying it would ensure that the Northern Ireland Protocol, designed to keep the border open, would not be affected.
It warned, however, that should vaccines and active substances move toward third countries and out of the bloc, it would use ""all the instruments at its disposal"".
Ireland said the EU's change of heart was welcome but that lessons should be learned.
""The Protocol is not something to be tampered with lightly, it's an essential, hard won compromise, protecting peace and trade for many,"" Irish foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney said on Twitter.
The EU's original plan was intended to prevent the open border between EU-member Ireland and Northern Ireland from acting as a backdoor for vaccine supplies into the United Kingdom.
The public reversal followed a round of frantic calls as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen of his ""grave concerns"" while Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin spoke to both Johnson and the EU chief to find a solution.
Northern Irish unionists cast the EU's original plan as an act of hostility.
In a tweet late on Friday, von der Leyen said she had spoken to Johnson: ""We agreed on the principle that there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines by companies where they are fulfilling contractual responsibilities.""
STOKING TENSION 
The swiftest mass vaccination drive in history is stoking tensions across the world as big powers buy up doses in bulk and poorer nations try to navigate a financial and diplomatic minefield to collect whatever supplies are left. 
The EU, whose member states are far behind Israel, Britain and the United States in rolling out vaccines, is scrambling to get supplies just as the West's biggest drugmakers slow deliveries to the bloc because of production problems.
The British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has been caught in the crosshairs after it said last week it would fall short of delivering promised vaccines to the EU by March because of production problems in Belgium. That angered Brussels which has demanded to know why the company cannot divert supplies from its British sites, which have been producing millions of shots for British citizens. 
Britain has its own domestic supply chain in place for AstraZeneca, including rolling it out in Northern Ireland, but it imports  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine from a factory in Belgium.
The European Commission agreed to a broader plan to control exports of vaccines from the bloc, including to Britain, arguing it needed to do so to ensure its own supplies.
But the EU's abortive attempt to use the Northern Ireland Protocol triggered anger in the province. 
Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster described it as ""an incredible act of hostility"".

Preserving the delicate peace in Northern Ireland without allowing the United Kingdom a back door into the EU's markets through the UK-Irish 310-mile land border was one of the most difficult issues of the Brexit divorce talks.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Several thousand people marched through cities across Poland on Friday in a third day of protests against a near-total ban on abortion since it was put into effect by the conservative government earlier this week.
Defying coronavirus restrictions, hundreds gathered in central Warsaw, chanting ""freedom, equality, abortion on demand"". Some carried placards that said ""I am afraid to live here"" and ""Banning abortion discriminates against the poor"".
The protests follow a Constitutional Tribunal ruling from October that terminating pregnancies with foetal defects was unconstitutional, eliminating the most frequently used case for legal abortion in the predominantly Catholic nation.
The ruling came into effect late on Wednesday when it was published in the official gazette
Under the new rules, abortion can be performed legally only in the case of rape or incest and when the mother's health or life are at risk, putting Poland outside the European mainstream. Doctors defying the law face jail.
The country was rocked by weeks of nationwide protests following the Oct. 22 court decision. They had quickly morphed into an outpouring of anger against the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government and the powerful Catholic Church.
PiS has rejected opposition accusations that it had influenced the court in its decision, although it is one of the judicial bodies PiS overhauled during reforms that the European Union said have politicised the courts.
Abortion has become a highly divisive issue since PiS came to power in 2015, promising a return to a traditional, pious society mixed with generous state handouts.
Krzysztof Sobolewski, a senior PiS official, said the protests were illegal because of social distancing restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus pandemic.
""People who organise these protests... should realise they are risking the lives of the participants and those close to them, because it threatens, God forbid, a new coronavirus wave,"" he was quoted as saying by the state PAP news agency.
In Warsaw, police in riot gear lined major roads in Warsaw, as protesters marched to Aretha Franklin's ""Think"" and ""We Will Rock You"" by Queen.
Organisers said pepper spray was used against one of the protest leaders. A Reuters witness said one pepper spray exchange was initiated by someone among march participants. 

Poland reported 6,144 new infections and 336 deaths, and has seen more than 1.2 million cases.

OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - The patient alarms ping constantly in the COVID-19 ward at a hospital in Oklahoma City, signaling to pulmonologist Dr. Syed Naqvi and the rest of the ICU team that yet another person needs help.
The sheer volume is exhausting, Naqvi said, but the emotional toll is even more draining, given that each time he puts a patient on a ventilator he knows there is little chance that person will recover.
""The disease is real. Unfortunately, the misery is real. We have and still see patients die every day,"" Naqvi said from an intensive care unit set aside for COVID-19 patients at the SSM Health St. Anthony Hospital.
At the same time as coronavirus vaccinations are being rolled out across the United States, the post-holiday spike in cases appears to be easing.
In Oklahoma, the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized has fallen 34% in the last two weeks, with 1,375 admitted as of Thursday, according to a Reuters tally.
The state's rate of infected people to population of 9.6% is higher than the overall U.S. rate of 7.9%, but the fatality rate for those with the coronavirus is lower, at 0.8% compared with 1.7% nationally.
But the pandemic is never taken lightly in hospitals like St. Anthony, where Naqvi frequently sees patients die alone, their loved ones kept at a safe distance.
""I still remember one guy, his last message was to tell his son he loves him... Most of those stories stick with you,"" Naqvi said.
Naqvi wears two pairs of gloves and two face masks before entering the COVID-19 ICU, in addition to a cap and a gown over his scrubs.
Suited up, he makes the rounds treating patients like Brenda Rex, 77, who has been hospitalized twice over the past week after catching COVID-19 at her nursing home.
She admonished the skeptics who have refused to take the disease seriously.
""You'd better take it seriously because you're going to spread it,"" Rex said, speaking through a respirator supplying her with oxygen.

""And pay attention to those around you,"" she said. ""If they're not doing what they should be doing... run the other way.""

Iran has often faced criticism from world bodies and Western human rights group for its rights record and high number of executions - the world's highest after China, according to Amnesty International. Tehran has dismissed the criticism as baseless and due to a lack of understanding of its Islamic laws.
""#Iran: We strongly condemn the series of executions – at least 28 – since mid-December, including of people from minority groups,"" the U.N. human rights office said on Twitter.
""We urge the authorities to halt the imminent execution of Javid Dehghan, to review his and other death penalty cases in line with human rights law,"" it added.
There was no immediate official Iranian reaction to the U.N. statement on Friday, the weekend in the country.
Dehghan was sentenced to death after being convicted ""following a grossly unfair trial"" of belonging to an armed group and involvement in an ambush that killed two Revolutionary Guards, Amnesty International said.
""The court relied on torture-tainted 'confessions' and ignored the serious due process abuses committed by Revolutionary Guards agents and prosecution authorities during the investigation process,"" Amnesty said.
Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan province borders on Afghanistan, the world's biggest producer of opium, and Pakistan. The area has long been plagued by unrest from drug smuggling gangs and separatist militants. The population of the province is mostly Sunni Muslim, while the majority of Iranians are Shi’ites.
On Thursday, state media said an Iranian member of Islamic State was executed in southwestern Khuzestan province, home to many of Iran's ethnic Arabs, for taking part in an attack that killed two paramilitary Basij militiamen.

PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new U.S. Iran envoy spoke with British, French and German officials on Thursday as the United States explores how to revive the 2015 nuclear deal former U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.
""It was to take stock of the dossier and to assess what our state of mind is,"" a European diplomatic source said of U.S. special envoy Rob Malley's conversation with the British, French and German foreign ministry political directors.
A second source confirmed that the discussion took place but offered no details. The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was struck by Iran and six major powers and committed Iran to restricting its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief from the United States and others. Malley was a member of the U.S. team that negotiated the deal during the Obama administration.
U.S. President Joe Biden has said if Tehran returns to the pact, Washington would do so as well and would then seek to build a broader pact to also deal with Iran's development of ballistic missiles and support for proxy forces in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and elsewhere.
Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and revived U.S. sanctions. Iran in 2019 begin violating the deal, including by enriching larger quantities of uranium to higher levels of purity.
The Biden administration has insisted Iran resume complying before it would. Tehran argues that Washington abandoned the agreement and should return before Iran does.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the time it would take Iran to make enough fissile material for a single nuclear weapon has fallen to three or four months from over a year under the deal.
""From our perspective, a critical early priority has to be to deal with what is an escalating nuclear crisis as they (Iran) move closer and closer to having enough fissile material for a weapon,"" White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at an event in Washington on Friday. 
The talks with the British, French and German officials are likely only the first step in consultations that will ultimately bring in China and Russia, the other major powers in the pact, and, eventually Iran itself. 

French President Emmanuel Macron was quoted on Friday as saying any new negotiations would be very ""strict"" and should include Saudi Arabia, Iran's regional adversary, Al Arabiya television reported.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian President Sergio Mattarella, looking to overcome a political crisis that has brought down the government in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, said on Friday he believed the collapsed coalition could still be revived.
Following three days of talks with party leaders, Mattarella asked lower house speaker Roberto Fico to mediate between the estranged parties, telling him to report back on Tuesday.
""It is necessary to set up a government as soon as possible,"" Mattarella told reporters, saying Italy was being severely tested by a health, economic and social emergency.
The crisis was triggered this month when former premier Matteo Renzi withdrew his tiny Italia Viva party from the coalition, depriving it of a majority in the upper house Senate and forcing Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to resign.
Renzi, whose party has barely 2% of voter support, clashed repeatedly with Conte over his handling of COVID-19 and the recession, and in particular his plans for spending more than 200 billion euros ($243 billion) from a European Union fund to help Italy's virus-battered economy.
He accused the prime minister of lacking strategic vision, saying he risked squandering the EU bonanza on handouts rather than long-term investments. 
Conte has tried to lure unaligned and opposition senators into the government ranks to replace Italia Viva, but has had little apparent success, meaning that if he wants to stay in office, he will almost certainly need Renzi's help.
5-STAR RUCTIONS
Conte has no party affiliation but is close to the largest coalition group - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. It had said it wanted nothing more to do with Renzi, but in a U-turn, the 5-Star leader offered to try and mend broken ties.
""We expressed our willingness to ... (create) a political government that takes as its starting point the coalition forces that have worked together over the past year and a half,"" 5-Star's Vito Crimi said on Friday after seeing the head of state.
However, he also insisted that Conte had to stay on as prime minister - something Renzi has so far refused to endorse.
The decision to offer Renzi an olive branch went down badly with hardline 5-Star members, who have heaped abuse on the former premier over the past two weeks.
""I see that the (5-Star) position has changed. I have not changed my position,"" said one of the movement's leading lights, Alessandro Di Battista. ""If the movement goes back to its old position, I'm in. Otherwise, it is goodbye and thank you.""
Di Battista is not in parliament and it was not immediately clear how many lawmakers might follow him out the party if Crimi goes ahead and forges a new alliance with Renzi.
The other main ruling group, the centre-left Democratic Party, is also backing Conte to get a fresh mandate but the prospect is far from certain unless Renzi and he both agree to patch up their policy differences and mutual recriminations.
Earlier in the day, the rightist opposition alliance led by Matteo Salvini's League, which leads in opinion polls, told Mattarella it wanted snap elections two years ahead of schedule.
When Mattarella hears back from Fico, who is a 5-Star politician, the president could ask a new candidate with more parliamentary backing than Conte to try to form a government, or meet Salvini's request for a vote.
Most analysts believe he will only do this as a last resort.

The thousands of New York City restaurants that have been surviving on takeout business and makeshift outdoor pavilions since mid-December may reopen their indoor dining areas at 25% of capacity on Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, Cuomo said.
Despite the resumption of indoor dining, which comes on what is traditionally one of the industry's busiest days, Cuomo sounded a note of caution, saying that he is ready to reverse the move if the trajectory of COVID-19 indicators worsens.
""There are possible scenarios that could develop that are problematic,” he said at a briefing.
The state's hospitalization rate and percentage of residents testing positive for the virus have both abated since earlier this month when the post-holiday surge of infections hit its peak, he said.

Earlier this week, California eased its strict stay-at-home orders, allowing restaurants to reopen for outdoor dining and greater social mixing, as public health authorities there also reported slower rates of infections and hospitalizations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Friday the United States must be prepared to impose costs on China for its actions against Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, its crackdown in Hong Kong and threats towards Taiwan.
Sullivan told an event at the United States Institute of Peace that Washington needed to speak with clarity and consistency on the issues.
He said it needed to be ""prepared to act, as well to impose costs, for what China is doing in Xinjiang, what it's doing in Hong Kong, for the bellicosity and threats it is projecting towards Taiwan."" 
Sullivan did not elaborate on steps Washington might take.
He said the China issue was at the top of those to be addressed between the United States and allies in Europe.
He stressed the need to agree joint responses with Europe on China's trade and technology abuses.
""We don't have entirely aligned perspectives on every one of these issues ... I think China is right at the top of the list of things that we've got to work together on and where there is work to do to get fully aligned."" 
The Biden administration, which took office last week, has indicated it will continue the tough approach to China pursued by former President Donald Trump, but wants Beijing's cooperation on policy priorities such as climate change.
Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken has endorsed a last-minute determination by his predecessor, Mike Pompeo, that China has committed genocide in Xinjiang. The move increases pressure for more U.S. sanctions, which the Trump administration also imposed over Beijing's crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong.

Biden's administration issued a strong statement in support of Taiwan amid stepped up Chinese military activity near the island, stressing that the U.S. commitment to Taipei is ""rock solid.""

The migrants are stuck on beaches in Necocli, a municipality in Colombia's Antioquia province, from where they hope to pass through the dangerous Darian Gap towards Panama and then north towards the United States, said migration agency director Juan Francisco Espinosa. 
The stranded migrants include some 647 Haitian nationals, as well as 23 Cubans, and 19 migrants from African countries, he said.
Just in the last week more than 500 migrants have arrived in Necocli, demanding they be allowed to travel to Panama.
""This isn't possible because there is a presidential order to close the borders and additionally Panama has also closed its borders,"" Espinosa said, adding that migrants will receive humanitarian aid while border controls with Ecuador will be stepped up to prevent more immigrants from entering Colombia.
Colombia has closed its land and river borders since March 2020, a measure it will keep in place until at least March 1. It deported some 3,800 illegal migrants last year, the majority from Haiti, according to agency statistics.
Migrants from Cuba, African and Asian countries are also detained in Colombia as they look to travel to the United States with help from people-trafficking networks.
At the start of January four Haitians - a man, a pregnant woman and two children - drowned after their vessel shipwrecked between Necocli and Capurgana, a Colombian Caribbean resort from where they intended to travel to Panama.
Migration authorities, with help from the military and police, captured 198 people traffickers in recent months and dismantled 60 trafficking networks, Espinosa said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's federal government is considering decriminalization of the possession of opioids and other illicit drugs in its efforts to tackle a spiraling overdose crisis, a government official said this week, even as data show the number of charges rising.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government is facing pressure to rein in drug overdoses, though it has previously downplayed decriminalization.
Vancouver has asked the federal government to exempt the city from part of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of drugs within city boundaries. A spokesman for Health Minister Patty Hajdu said on Wednesday that decriminalization was under consideration and that discussions with Vancouver were under way but would not comment further
That could subject people caught with small amounts of drugs to fines or mandatory treatment.
Canada's opioid toxicity death rate for the first half of 2020, 14.6 per 100,000, was the highest since national data began to be collected in 2016, according to the federal government.
The number of people charged with drug possession of non-cocaine, non-heroin drugs in Canada more than tripled to 13,725 in the past decade to 2019, according to Statistics Canada. The number of people charged with heroin possession almost quintupled, to 1,043.
""The idea that we're kind of becoming more tolerant isn't borne out by the data,"" said Neil Boyd, director of the School of Criminology at Simon Fraser University. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted illicit drug supply chains, making for a more toxic supply; it has also lessened supports and driven people to use alone, health advocates say.
Health Canada's move to discuss decriminalization ""comes at a time when the overdose crisis in our city has never been worse,"" Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said in a statement Wednesday.
Many health experts argue decriminalization would encourage drug users to use in safer spaces where they can access medical care.
Trudeau dismissed decriminalization last year, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corp it was not a ""silver bullet."" 
Portugal decriminalized illicit drug possession and consumption in 2001. In the 2020 election Oregon voted to decriminalize.

This week Montreal's city council also voted to support decriminalization. The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police came out in support of the move last summer.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Proud Boys supporter who U.S. prosecutors said kept a large weapons cache and made ominous social media posts, including toward a Democratic senator, pleaded not guilty to charges of being a felon in possession of ammunition and making online threats.
Eduard Florea, of Queens, New York, entered his plea through a federal public defender at a Friday hearing before Chief U.S. Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak in Brooklyn federal court.
Florea was charged after FBI agents searched his Middle Village home and found more than 900 rounds of ammunition, 72 military-style combat knives, two hatchets and two swords, according to court papers.
Prosecutors said Florea used the name ""LoneWolfWar"" on Parler, a social media platform popular with many conservatives, to make threats before and during the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, though he did not travel to Washington, D.C.
According to a Jan. 22 indictment, Florea responded to a post concerning newly-elected Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock by writing ""Dead men can't pass s*** laws,"" and later wrote ""I am awaiting my orders ... Armed and ready to deploy"" and ""It's time to unleash some violence.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The administration of President Joe Biden on Friday extended deportation relief for several thousand Syrian immigrants living in the United States, an early move that aligns with his broader pro-immigrant platform.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that acting Secretary David Pekoske would extend Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 6,700 eligible Syrians through September 2022 and allow an additional 1,800 people to file initial applications. 
The program grants immigrants who cannot return to their countries safely, for reasons like natural disasters or armed conflict, the ability to stay and work in the United States legally for a defined period that can be renewed.
Biden, a Democrat who took office on Jan. 20, has pledged to embrace a more welcoming approach to refugees and immigrants. The stance contrasts with the hardline policies of former Republican President Donald Trump, who rolled back many humanitarian protections.
Trump largely sought to phase out enrollment in the TPS program for immigrants from Central American and other countries but was stymied by legal challenges. Despite his tough stance, his administration twice extended protections for Syrians due to ongoing armed conflict and limited access to medical care in the country. Trump, however, did not allow new applicants into the program.
With Biden's designation, additional Syrians in the United States can now seek protection under TPS. The move fits with his broader plans to expand protections under the program.
Biden also pledged to grant TPS to immigrants from Venezuela due to the economic conditions in that country, although Trump had pre-empted that move by providing the protections through a similar program before he left office.

Additionally, the Biden transition team discussed the possibility of designating Guatemala and Honduras for the program, which could open protections to over a million people.

Mahamat Said Abdel Kain, who was detained and transferred to The Hague last week, faces accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in 2013. 
The Central African Republic has been mired in violence since a coalition of mostly northern and predominantly Muslim rebels known as Seleka, or “alliance” in the Sango language, seized power in March 2013. Their brutal rule gave rise to the opposing “anti-balaka” Christian militias, several of whose former leaders also face charges at the ICC.
The arrest comes against the backdrop of fighting between the Central African Republic's army, backed by U.N., Russian and Rwandan troops, and rebels from both militia groups who have now formed an alliance with the aim of seizing the capital and overturning a Dec. 27 vote in which President Faustin-Archange Touadera was declared the winner.
Defense lawyer Jean Pierre Madoukou told judges at his client's first court appearance that Said intends to prove his innocence in court.
""I can say clearly that (the) truth will come out in favour of mister Said based on everything we have at our disposal,"" Madoukou said.

NICOSIA (Reuters) - Cyprus it to set up an anti-corruption authority and regulations to protect whistleblowers, the president said on Friday, in an attempt to draw a line under a now-suspended citizenship for cash programme.
Thousands of non-Europeans received a Cypriot passport under a programme launched in 2013, giving citizenship to applicants for a minimum 2 million euro investment. The scheme, which gave visa-free travel throughout the European Union, was suspended in November after media reports of abuse.
A former speaker of the island's parliament resigned in October after the Al Jazeera network secretly filmed him offering to help a person with a criminal record obtain a passport. Those filmed said their comments were taken out of context.
But despite the scheme being halted, the uproar has persisted, with comments from opposition politicians, newspaper editorials and from ordinary Cypriots on social media pointing to endemic corruption.
President Nicos Anastasiades on Thursday promised Cyprus' ""biggest intervention yet to create the strongest possible net against corruption"".
Giving some details of the plans on Friday, he said: ""These new measures ... are based on a triptych of rule of law, transparency and accountability.
As well as the establishment of the anti-corruption agency, authorities would to tighten control over procurement, keep an independent database of the assets of ""politically exposed persons"" - politicians and other public figures - set up an open-access registry on corruption inquiries and introduce a registry for lobbyists. 
More than 3,000 people benefited from the passports scheme introduced by Anastasiades' administration in 2013. But even though it has now been wound down, data protection laws mean those who benefited have not been publicly identified.
Anastasiades said on Thursday perceptions of widespread corruption were overblown, and politically motivated. He said his administration had been aware of the shortcomings in the passport scheme, which led to the rules being tightened several times.
Communist AKEL, the main opposition party, said the government's promises on Friday were vague. 
""Its not a coincidence that there was no specific reference to conflicts of interest, something which has defined this government,"" said AKEL spokesman Stefanos Stefanou. 
Anastasiades on Friday refused to be drawn into specifics of allegations of conflict of interest concerning his own role. His daughters are partners in a legal practice, which, like dozens of other firms, offered citizenship services.

Anastasiades has previously said there was no conflict of interest, since he had disengaged from the firm before his election in 2013.

BEIJING/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Friday hailed a new visa offering Hong Kong citizens a route to citizenship after China's crackdown but Beijing said it would no longer recognise special British passports offered to residents of the former colony.
Britain and China have been bickering for months about what London and Washington say is an attempt to silence dissent in Hong Kong, though Beijing says the West's views are clouded by misinformation and an imperial hangover.
Britain says it is fulfilling a historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong after China imposed a tough new security law on the city that Britain says breaches the terms of agreements to hand the colony back in 1997.
""I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BN(O)s to live, work and make their home in our country,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, referring to a special British National Overseas (BNO) passport.
""In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy – values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear.""
But China and the Hong Kong government hit back by saying neither would recognise the BNO passport as a valid travel document from Jan. 31 
""Britain is trying to turn large numbers of Hong Kong people into second-class British citizens. This has completely changed the original nature of BNO,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing.
Beijing's decision not to recognise the travel document is largely symbolic as Hong Kong residents would not normally use their BNO passports to travel to the mainland. A BNO passport holder in Hong Kong could still use their Hong Kong passport or identity card.
Beijing's imposition of a national security law in the former British colony in June last year prompted Britain to offer refuge to almost 3 million Hong Kong residents eligible for the BNO passport from Jan. 31.
The scheme, first announced last year, opens on Sunday and allows those with ""British National (Overseas)"" status to live, study and work in Britain for five years and eventually apply for citizenship.
BN(O) is a special status created under British law in 1987 that specifically relates to Hong Kong.
The new 250 pound ($340) visa could attract more than 300,000 people and their dependents to Britain and generate up to 2.9 billion pounds of net benefit to the British economy over the next five years, according to government forecasts.
From around midday on Sunday, eligible applicants can apply online and book an appointment to register their fingerprints at a visa application centre. From Feb. 23 some will be able to make the application via a smartphone app.

It is still highly uncertain how many people will actually take up the offer. The government estimates that 2.9 million people and a further 2.3 million dependents will be eligible to come to Britain.

GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 200,000 people have fled fighting in the Central African Republic (CAR) since violence erupted over a December election result, the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) said on Friday, with nearly half crossing into the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The CAR army, backed by U.N., Russian and Rwandan troops, has been battling rebels seeking to overturn a Dec. 27 vote in which President Faustin-Archange Touadera was declared the winner.
""Refugees have told UNHCR that they fled in panic when they heard gun shots, leaving their belongings behind,"" spokesman Boris Cheshirkov told journalists in Geneva.
The nation of nearly five million people, larger than mainland France, Belgium and Luxemburg combined and rich in diamonds, timber and gold, has struggled to find stability since a 2013 rebellion ousted former president Francois Bozize.
The current fighting between a coalition of militias on the one side and the national army and its backers on the other was sparked by a Constitutional Court decision to bar Bozize's candidacy in the Dec. 27 presidential election. 
Former prime minister Martin Ziguele, who came third in the Dec. 21 election, said on Friday there was fighting across the country every day, preventing movement between towns, and pushing more people to flee.
""Everyone is focused on the main transport route between the capital and eastern Cameroon for supplies, but inside the country, there is no movement,"" Ziguele told Reuters by phone from Bangui.
""I cannot leave Bangui and go 90 km (60 miles) without a heavily-armed army escort. Imagine then the population. Add the curfew and the state of emergency, it is really an apocalyptic situation,"" Ziguele said.
SEX FOR FOOD
About 92,000 refugees have reached DRC and more than 13,000 have crossed into Cameroon, Chad and the Republic of Congo. The rest are displaced inside the Central African Republic, the UNHCR said. 
Ongoing attacks has hampered humanitarian access and the main road used to bring supplies has been forced shut inside the country and many are now facing ""dire conditions"", UNHCR's Cheshirkov said.
Some of the displaced are so desperate they have agreed to sex in return for food, he added. Malaria, respiratory tract infections, and diarrhoea have become common.
He also voiced concern about the reported presence of armed groups in the Batangafo and Bria camps for the displaced.
""Those armed groups are trying in some cases to restrict movements and in some cases forcibly recruit. So this is a very concerning situation,"" he told the briefing.
Ziguele said that while a substantial increase in peacekeepers, as requested by the U.N. envoy in Bangui, was welcomed, a dialogue between all parties was urgently needed. 

""A military surge is not the only solution to tackle the security, humanitarian and economic crisis that is threatening to put one of the world's least developed countries into a complete coma,"" he said.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament voted on Friday to legalise euthanasia, with the country set to become the seventh in the world to allow terminally ill patients to seek assistance from a doctor to end their life.
People aged over 18 will be allowed to request assistance in dying if they are terminally ill and suffering from ""lasting"" and ""unbearable"" pain - unless they are deemed not to be mentally fit to make such a decision.
The process will only be open to national citizens and legal residents in order to prevent people from travelling to Portugal to get medical help to end their life.
The law is now in the hands of President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, a conservative, for a final stamp of approval. He previously said he would respect parliament's vote.
Some have criticised the timing of the vote, with opposition party PSD saying due to the coronavirus pandemic raging across Portugal there was ""great anxiety, great fear among people that has to do with issues of life and death"".
In a letter to parliament, two groups managing the majority of Portugal's care homes, which were hit hard by the pandemic, said ""the approval of euthanasia represents a disrespect for all these people"".
But parliamentary leader of the People-Animals-Nature party, Ines Real, said: ""It is dishonest to invoke an extremely difficult moment in the country...to confuse deaths related to COVID-19 with the legislative process that aims to allow euthanasia to those suffering"".
Portugal, a Catholic-majority country which spent a large part of the 20th century until the 1974 Carnation revolution ruled by a fascist regime, has since made strides in liberal reforms upholding human rights. It legalised abortions in 2007 and allowed same-sex marriage in 2010.

Prosecutors on Friday charged four Bulgarians suspected of belonging to an organised crime ring making and distributing the fake Bulgarian documents and counterfeit U.S. dollar and euro bills in the Balkan country.
The four were arrested after printing presses and equipment for the production of counterfeit banknotes and documents were found following searches at 30 locations across Bulgaria in a joint operation with Europol and the U.S. Secret Service.
During a search in an apartment in the southern city of Plovdiv, police seized large amounts of high quality fake euro and dollar bills as well as fake Bulgarian ID cards and driving licences.

""Officers have also seized a Bulgarian passport with the picture of a famous U.S. actor, which was used as a sample to demonstrate to clients the high quality of their counterfeit production,"" the prosecutors said in a statement.

The boxes seized by police contained a version of the drug called Bemsivir with a value of $18,000 on the black market, Colombia's tax and customs police (POLFA) said in a statement.
Bemsivir, produced by Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd, is a generic form of remdesivir, a COVID-19 treatment developed by  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD). 
""During a routine check that was carried out on Thursday at the airport in Cucuta, the boxes with the medicine were found in the luggage of a woman who said it was the vaccine against COVID-19,"" POLFA director Brigadier General Gustavo Franco said in a telephone interview.
""We made inquiries with the authorities and they informed us the drug isn't authorized (in Colombia). It appears there are groups who want to take advantage of the pandemic by deceiving people and putting their health at risk,"" he added.
The woman was intending to take the antivirals to Medellin, Colombia's second city, POLFA said.
Cucuta is a city that sits on Colombia's border with Venezuela and police are investigating whether the antivirals were smuggled into the country from its neighbor via illegal crossings, POLFA said.
Criminal groups trying to con people with the drugs are likely behind such smuggling incidents, POLFA said.
Remdesivir is not designed to prevent COVID-19 and a World Health Organisation-led trial found it failed to improve survival rates although others dispute that conclusion. 
Seizures of medical contraband rose 41% in 2020, compared with the year before, the statement added. 
So far in 2021 more than 218,000 items of medical contraband or dubious origin have been seized, POLFA said. The seized goods are valued at over 570 million pesos ($159,000) but could be worth three times as much on the black market.

Travel firms and airlines have been badly hit by the pandemic, which has put a stop of much of the global tourism business, while those who rely on visitors have also suffered.
Harry, Queen Elizabeth's grandson, said the travel, said the ""acute hardship"" of communities in tourist destinations had shown the importance of travel, but had also highlighted the need to reduce its detrimental impact.
""We know that to not travel again is not an option,"" the prince, 36, said in a foreword to the annual report of Travalyst, an initiative he launched in 2019 with the objective of making the travel industry more sustainable.
""Right before us, there is an opportunity to do things differently, to do things better. Travel and tourism are no exception. As the industry re-emerges from crisis, there is an urgent need to reset and reimagine.""
Harry, like his father, the heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, is a vocal champion of environmental causes, said it had been clear before the pandemic the industry had not done enough to tackle issues such as climate change and pollution.
The prince has previously come under fire himself for advocating more environmentally-aware travel while using private jets. But he says he only rarely does not use commercial aircraft, and took action to offset the carbon dioxide emissions caused by his trips.

Travalyst, an independent non-profit body which is backed by some major tourism industry companies including Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), and Visa (NYSE:V), said the industry needed universal transparency on its sustainability efforts, and to champion the success of local communities, destinations and operators.

BANDA ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Authorities in Indonesia’s Aceh province publicly caned six people accused of breaching Islamic law, including two men who received 77 lashes for having a same sex relationship, in a punishment Human Rights Watch called ""public torture"".
Aceh is the only province in majority-Muslim Indonesia to follow Islamic law, and this was the third such caning since Aceh outlawed homosexuality in 2014. The province, on the northern tip of Sumatra island, also imposes caning for crimes such as theft, gambling and adultery.
A hooded religious police officer carried out Thursday's floggings, watched by a crowd wearing face masks. One of the men grimaced in pain as he received the punishment, which caused his mother to faint. 
Two other people received 40 lashes for alcohol consumption and another two 17 lashes for adultery.
Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch, condemned the canings and the homophobic attitudes displayed by some in Aceh, a deeply conservative society where lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are ostracised and targeted by the authorities.
""If Indonesia is to be considered a civilized country... the government must stop the practice of torture in Aceh"" and immediately review how Islamic law has been integrated into regional regulations, he said. 
Opinions among Acehnese are a still a world away for any tolerance of LGBT communities. Devi Arinah, a 53-year-old teacher, said she backed caning for homosexual acts but in addition felt people should be ""given counseling so that they realize that their actions are not suitable for us as believers."" 
Another resident, 17-year-old Teguh Khosul said that if caning did not alter behaviour then either a cleric should help ""rehabilitate"" gay people in a religious way or be cast out from society.

NEW DELHI/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A small bomb went off near the Israeli embassy in New Delhi, causing no injuries, in an incident that an Israeli official said was being treated as terrorism.
Delhi police said the explosion was caused by a ""very low intensity improvised device"" and damaged the window panes of three nearby parked cars.
""Initial impressions suggest a mischievous attempt to create a sensation,"" a police spokesperson said in a statement.
The Israeli foreign ministry said no damage was caused to its embassy building and all Israeli diplomats and embassy staff were safe. 
""The incident is under investigation by the authorities in India, who are in contact with the relevant Israeli authorities,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that ""although there were no casualties, India and all elements in Israel regard the explosion as a terrorist incident"".
Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said he had assured his Israeli counterpart Gabi Ashkenazi ""of the fullest protection for the Embassy and Israeli diplomats. Matter is under investigation and no effort will be spared to find the culprits.""
The blast occurred shortly after 5 p.m. (1130 GMT), while Indian President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi were participating in a military ceremony a kilometre away.
The site of the blast was quickly cordoned off by police.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE are part of an Arab coalition that has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthis in Yemen since 2015 in a conflict seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran. The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need of aid.
""This is an act that we considered necessary, a clear message of peace coming from our country. For us, the respect of human rights is an unbreakable commitment,"" Di Maio said in a statement.
The Italian Network for Peace and Disarmament said Rome's decision would block the sale of around 12,700 missiles to Saudi Arabia.
The blocked sales were part of a total allotment of 20,000 missiles worth more than 400 million euros ($485 million) agreed in 2016 under a centre-left government led by Matteo Renzi, the disarmament group said. 
Renzi, who triggered a government collapse in Rome this week by pulling his Italia Viva party from the coalition, is under fire for recently visiting Saudi Arabia, where he told the crown prince he saw that nation as the site of a ""New Renaissance"".

MOSCOW (Reuters) - It will be around minus 40 degrees Celsius (-40 Fahrenheit) on Sunday as some Russians in Yakutsk, one of the world's coldest cities, join nationwide protests against the jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
It was -52C when they took to the streets last weekend.
""You always have to dress in a sort of spacesuit,"" said Niurgun Semenov, a 26-year-old who protested last weekend. ""It's like going out into outer space. It's extreme.""
Eastern Siberia's Yakutsk, a city of more than 300,000 people, was the scene of a small opposition street rally on Saturday as around 150 people paced up and down for warmth in a white, glacial haze. Police detained around 30 people. 
It was one of dozens of rallies that involved tens of thousands of people across Russia calling on authorities to release Navalny from jail.
Police said the rallies were illegal and detained over 4,000 people, according to a monitoring group. The police have not given an official number.
Navalny's allies plan to stage a new round of protests in more than 80 cities this Sunday, including in Yakutsk, which is built on permafrost.
Many protesters wrapped themselves up in three or four layers of thermal clothing and wore traditional fur boots known as unty, breathing through their scarves so as not to lose body heat, Semenov said. 
He said he was shocked by Navalny's treatment, and that his return to Russia despite the threat of immediate arrest had become an inspiration.
Sulustaana Myraan, a former lawmaker in the regional legislature, was among those detained last weekend. 
Myraan, who resigned as a lawmaker last year to protest against constitutional reforms allowing Putin to potentially extend his rule until 2036, said she had not yet decided whether to protest again so soon after her detention.
She fears such a move could prompt the authorities to open a criminal case against her, she said. 
Myraan said protest turnout was likely to be depleted after last weekend's detentions, but that the frigid temperatures were unlikely to keep people away.
""In theory the authorities should be interested in people being healthy, that they live a decent human life,"" she said. ""But this is not happening. This means people are forced to go out on the streets in the freezing cold.""

JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to work to reopen the Palestinians' diplomatic mission in Washington could be held up over a law that exposes Palestinian officials to U.S. anti-terror lawsuits, officials and advisers to the Palestinians say. 
The Biden administration hopes to repair relations with the Palestinians after a sharp deterioration under former President Donald Trump, who closed the Palestine Liberation Organization's Washington office in 2018 and cut millions of dollars in aid to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
But under an anti-terror amendment passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump in 2019, the Palestinians would become liable for $655.5 million in financial penalties against them in U.S. courts if they open an office in the United States.
There are also questions about how Biden will fulfil a pledge to resume economic aid to the Palestinians. The Taylor Force Act, passed by Congress in 2018, restricts some aid until the Palestinians end payments to people jailed by Israel over violent crimes, among other conditions. 
Speaking to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, Acting U.S. envoy Richard Mills said Washington ""intended to take steps to reopen diplomatic missions that were closed for the last U.S. administration"", without giving a timeline.
The legal hurdles underscore the range of challenges Biden may face in restoring ties with the Palestinians and reversing actions taken by Trump, who overturned longtime U.S. Middle East policy with a series of pro-Israel steps including ending U.S. opposition to Israeli settlements in the West Bank. 
Palestinians say his actions discredited the longtime U.S. role as chief mediator in their conflict with Israel and further dimmed any chance of a peace deal envisaging a Palestinian state in Israeli-occupied territory. 
Palestinian leaders have welcomed Biden's pledges of rapprochement, but while he can reverse some measures through executive orders, others involve laws passed by Congress and are not as easily changed. 
Asked for comment, a U.S. State Department official told Reuters: ""In administering aid, the Biden-Harris Administration will fully comply with U.S. law including the Taylor Force Act."" 
The official did not comment on whether the Biden administration would look into working around the anti-terror amendment to help rebuild relations with the Palestinians.
TALKS ON A 'FIX'
Talks are ongoing with the administration and Congress about finding a ""fix"" to the amendment that would allow the PLO mission to reopen, an American legal adviser to the Palestinians said, adding that the Palestinians ""don't have the money to pay"" the financial claims against them.
Palestinian officials declined to comment.
A Biden adviser told Reuters just before the Nov. 3 election that Biden would seek to reopen the PLO mission to Washington but added: ""There is a law that could make that more challenging.""
The anti-terror amendment makes the Palestinians liable for the hefty financial penalty that a U.S. jury awarded against them if they establish or maintain any facilities in the United States, conduct activity on behalf of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority, or make payments to Palestinians imprisoned over violent crimes against Americans, among other conditions. 
The jury award stems from lawsuits by 11 American families who sought to hold the PA and PLO liable for shootings and bombings by between 2002 and 2004 in Jerusalem that killed 33 people, including several Americans. 
Palestinian leaders have condemned the attacks and blamed them on rogue individuals.

But the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 refused to consider awarding those claims, upholding a lower court finding that there was no jurisdiction for attacks outside U.S. territory.

Two pro-independence parties currently govern the region, but opinion polls have been split on who could win this time.
The separatists aim to garner more than 50% of the vote for the first time, but former health minister Salvador Illa, a Socialist, this week resigned from the central government in Madrid to run in the election, and some polls have seen him winning.
The parliament is likely to be quite fragmented, and even if Illa won the election, it is unclear if he could garner enough support to form a regional government.

SINGHU, India (Reuters) - An Indian state blocked mobile internet across most of its districts on Friday, following clashes between protesting Indian farmers and groups of men shouting anti-farmer and pro-police slogans.
Mobile internet in 15 of 22 districts in Haryana state bordering the capital New Delhi will be unavailable until 1700 local time on Saturday, according to a circular from the state government. 
Authorities used tear gas and batons on Friday to break up the clashes at Singhu in Haryana, one of several protest sites near Delhi.
The protesting farmers want the government to withdraw three new farm laws that they say will hurt their livelihoods for the benefit of large private produce buyers.
In a stand-off between riot police and the farmers, authorities tried on Thursday night to clear another protest site in the city's east, but most farmers refused to move and thousands more marched overnight to join them.
Their leaders said any retreat would constitute surrender.
""Concerned over police high-handedness, thousands of farmers, who were not part of the protest, have now come to bolster our movement,"" Rakesh Tikait, president of one of the largest farmers unions, the Bharti Kisan Union, told Reuters on Friday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government introduced the new agricultural laws in September, triggering protests and a two-month long sit-in on some of the major approaches to New Delhi.
Farm leaders say the laws are an attempt to erode a longstanding mechanism that ensures farmers a minimum support price for their rice and wheat.
The government says the reforms will open up new opportunities for farmers and that it will not bow to the protesters' demands.
Modi retains a solid majority in parliament although the protests are beginning to undermine some support for the government in the countryside.

The protests turned violent on Tuesday, when India celebrated its Republic Day with a military parade, and some protesters clashed with police. One was killed and hundreds were injured.

Many of the islands have been shielded by distance and life has continued relatively undisturbed by the pandemic. The vaccinations are aimed at ensuring that continues before the summer months brings in a hoped-for influx of tourists.
""It is important for our island, it is both symbolic and practical,"" said Sofia Kouvalaki, as she went in for a shot at a medical centre on Kastellorizo, an island in the eastern Mediterranean whose population drops to around 200 in winter.
""We did not have cases, so this has to continue so that people here feel safe and so those who will come will be safe.""
Greece has so far vaccinated more than 208,000 people and is hoping a global rollout will allow holidaymakers to return in the summer and help save a tourist industry that accounts for about a fifth of its economy.
On Kastellorizo, local doctor Stavros Stavropoulos said around 80% of residents had been given a shot since the vaccination team arrived on the island three days ago, with people of all ages treated equally. 
Despite a decade-long financial crisis that badly weakened its public health services, Greece has so far been a relative success story during the pandemic, with case rates and fatalities at a fraction of the levels seen in some of its more prosperous European neighbours.
But authorities are acutely aware that hospitals and intensive care units could not handle surging patient numbers, a concern that holds doubly true for dozens of small islands that at best have small medical centres to treat the sick.
""It's really important, especially for the small islands that don't have large hospitals for people to be treated, they have to be (vaccinated) so that they are protected when people come here for tourism,"" Nikolaos Tachtzis, a nurse administering the shots on Kastellorizo said.

The demand ""is not practical and will not happen”, he said at a joint news conference in Istanbul with his Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu.
The new administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has said Tehran must resume compliance with curbs on its nuclear activity under the world powers' 2015 deal before it can rejoin the pact.
Iran breached the terms of the accord in a step-by-step response to the decision by Biden's predecessor Donald Trump to abandon the deal in 2018 and reimpose sanctions on Tehran.
Earlier this month, Iran resumed enriching uranium to 20% at its underground Fordow nuclear plant - a level it achieved before the accord.
However, Iran has said it can quickly reverse those violations if U.S. sanctions are removed.
""If the United States fulfils its obligations, we will fulfil our obligations in full,"" he said.
Iran’s parliament, dominated by hardliners, passed legislation last month that forces the government to harden its nuclear stance if U.S. sanctions are not eased within two months.

Zarif also condemned U.S. sanctions against Turkey over Ankara's decision to procure Russian S-400 defence systems.
“The U.S. government is addicted to sanctions … and this harms the world and the U.S. itself,” he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's presidential office on Friday issued a rebuke to an opposition leader who accused it of ""abetting the enemy"" after a news report that Seoul had planned to build a nuclear plant in North Korea. 
Local broadcaster SBS unveiled a prosecution indictment listing more than a dozen documents from the energy ministry that suggested a previously unknown project to set up a nuclear plant in North Korea.
The documents were among 530 files that prosecutors say the ministry had illegally deleted to conceal that it had distorted feasibility studies to shut down a reactor in South Korea, the report said.
Kim Chong-in, leader of the main opposition People Power Party, called the potential plan a ""shocking and appalling act that abets the enemy"". 
President Moon Jae-in's spokesman, Kang Min-seok, accused Kim of making ""irresponsible"" remarks to stoke ideological strife and ""deceive people"" ahead of a key by-election in April. 
But he declined to comment when asked about whether such plans had existed, or whether Moon's office had ordered the energy ministry to delete the documents. 
""Kim should take responsibility for his comment,"" Kang told a briefing, adding the office would pursue legal action. 
Prosecutors last month indicted three energy ministry officials on charges of violating the Criminal Act by damaging public records following a state auditor investigation. 
The government had decided in 2018 to decommission the South Korean reactor, the Wolsong No.1, earlier than scheduled citing the ministry feasibility studies, in line with liberal President Moon's pledge to phase out nuclear power, which the conservative opposition opposed. 
Some of the files were titled ""A plan to build a nuclear plant in North Korea"" and ""Tasks for phased cooperation to establish electricity infrastructure in North Korea"", according to the SBS report. 
Others included lists of energy experts with experience in inter-Korean economic projects, as well as officials who were dispatched to a failed international consortium aimed at building two reactors in the reclusive North in the early 2000s. 
At least six documents were dated to May 2018, a month after Moon held his first summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, SBS said. 
Reuters could not verify the list and the individual documents. 
The prosecutors' office was not reachable for comment.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - In a victory for environmentalists, a Dutch appeals court on Friday said that the Nigerian subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) was responsible for multiple oil pipeline leaks in the Niger Delta and ordered it to pay unspecified damages to farmers.
The case was brought in 2008 by four farmers and environmental group Friends of the Earth, seeking reparations for lost income from contaminated land and waterways in the region, the heart of Nigeria's oil industry.
Friday's decision went a step further than a 2013 ruling by a lower court, saying that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary was responsible for multiple cases of oil pollution.
The appeals judge sided with the farmers in four of six spills covered by the lawsuit and postponed a verdict in the remaining cases, where the lower court had previously found Shell subsidiary SPDC responsible.
Although only SPDC was found to be directly responsible, the decision could open the door for more environmental cases against the oil major.
Shell said in a statement it continues to believe the spills were caused by sabotage.
""We are therefore disappointed that this court has made a different finding on the cause of these spills and in its finding that SPDC is liable.""
The appeals court said Shell had not proven ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the oil spills had been caused by sabotage, rather than poor maintenance.
""This makes Shell Nigeria responsible for the damage caused by the leaks"", the court said. 
Friends of the Earth said the ruling exceeded all expectations.
""This is fantastic news for the environment and people living in developing countries,"" said Friends of the Earth's Netherlands head, Donald Pols. It creates legal grounds to ""take on the multinationals who do them harm.""
Shell settled a similar case in a British court in 2015, agreeing to pay 70 million euros ($85 million) to members of the Niger Delta Bodo community.
The Dutch appeals court did not hold Shell's parent company Netherlands-based Royal Dutch Shell directly responsible, but ordered it to install a leak detection system on the Oruma pipeline, the source of several spills in the case.
The spills addressed by the court case occurred between 2004 and 2007, but pollution from leaking oil pipelines, which Shell maintains are the result of sabotage, remains a major problem in the Niger Delta.

Germany's top court last year ruled in favour of groups that help people die, saying an existing law that bans assisted suicide services breached the constitution.
""Everyone who is able to make decisions for themselves should also be able to decide when they want to die,"" Katrin Helling-Plahr, a member of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) told a news conference.
Euthanasia is particularly sensitive in Germany due to the legacy of the Nazis, who murdered an estimated 300,000 people with disabilities and psychological ailments under its ""euthanasia"" programme https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-nazi-euthanasia/victims-of-nazi-euthana because their lives were deemed unworthy.
Under the draft legislation presented by members of the Social Democrats, who are in the ruling coalition, as well as the opposition FDP and Linke, patients who want to take the lethal sodium pentobarbital drug would have to prove that their wish is permanent and they had not been pressured by anyone.
Members of the opposition Greens have drawn up a separate draft law that would require two doctors' opinions before patients can be given a prescription for sodium pentobarbital, daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported on Thursday.
Some palliative medics had argued against any change in Germany's law, fearing that could risk premature action in cases not properly based on a wish to die.
Only a few countries in the world have legalized euthanasia whereby a doctor administers lethal doses of drugs to patients willing to die, or people perform the action themselves.
In Spain, the lower house of parliament approved a bill in December allowing people who are seriously ill to choose to end their life, despite staunch opposition from the political right and religious groups. 

Portuguese lawmakers are due to vote later on Friday to give the final stamp of approval to a law to decriminalise euthanasia and assisted suicide. If approved, terminally ill people over 18 who do not suffer from a mental illness can request the practice if they are suffering from ""unbearable"" pain and ""without a hope for cure"".

PARIS (Reuters) - Boris Czajka, a 32-year-old driver with a Paris ride-hailing service, now has a new category of clients because of the COVID-19 pandemic: people who use taxis as a clandestine way to break curfew.
With people barred from leaving home between 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. except for essential business, some have found that by taking a taxi during curfew, they can dodge police and the 135 euro ($163) fines they can impose on rule-breakers.
""Lots of people believe a ride-sharing car or taxi is more discreet,"" Czajka, at the wheel of his black BMW saloon, said as he drove a fare south from the centre of Paris after dark.
Accounts from taxi drivers and passengers in Paris suggested that people breaking curfew were more likely to be caught if they were on public transport than if they were in a taxi. Hailing a ride makes economic sense because a taxi fare will work out less than the fine.
Speaking anonymously because she was discussing breaking the rules, one taxi passenger said she used cabs to visit her boyfriend twice a week.
""It's a matter of preserving myself emotionally and mentally,"" said the passenger, an American working in Paris.
""In times like these we must make choices and, for me, the choice is to take a ride-share car after work, from time to time.""
Taxi drivers benefit too. Their usual night-time clientele, people heading home from bars and restaurants, has evaporated because such places are shut.
""It brings us work,"" another taxi driver, who gave his name as Soufiane, said of the curfew-breaking passengers.
""They know that they are 'outlaws' as you might say, but they go to have a drink at a colleague or a friend's place because they are fed up with the curfew,"" he said.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian doctors are demanding a nationwide lockdown and threatening to stop taking in new patients as a surge in COVID-19 cases, which they say is killing an average of one medic per day, strains hospitals to breaking point.
New daily coronavirus infections in the Andean country, which received its first batch of Russian Sputnik V vaccines on Thursday, hit a single-day record of 2,866 this week and deaths attributed to the epidemic climbed above 10,000.
""At the rate we are going, there will be a total collapse,"" said Ricardo Landivar, a director of the La Paz Medical College. ""... We are going to have patients dying in the streets without being able to be treated by medical staff.""
Health workers' and doctors' unions are demanding that leftist President Luis Arce return to lockdown until the current COVID wave - Bolivia's second - passes.
But the government has been reluctant to further undermine the landlocked country's already reeling economy.
Arce, due to be one of the first in the country to get inoculated with Sputnik V, has said the arrival of the Russian vaccine can help Bolivians ""breathe a bit easier"".
Medical union leaders however point to the high fatality rate - confirmed COVID cases in the nation of 11.5 million stand at around 210,000 - and say that every day more than one doctor or health worker loses their life.
In cities, hospitals are often visibly crowded inside and out, with signs on doors and walls warning: ""no room for new patients"" and ""the emergency units have collapsed"".
""Doctors are dying day by day,"" said Patricia Almanza, a doctor at the Hospital Petrolero in La Paz.
""The previous week seven doctors died, yesterday another doctor died and today another... and the government does not want to order a quarantine not even for fifteen days... because it is more interested in the economy.""
Bolivia's government has agreements for a combined 15 million doses of Sputnik V, the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and others via the international COVAX mechanism co-managed by the World Health Organization. 

It will start vaccinations of frontline workers with the first 20,000 doses of Sputnik V.

YANGON (Reuters) - The United Nations and Western governments voiced alarm on Friday over threats by Myanmar's military that have stirred fears of a coup in the aftermath of an election the army says was fraudulent. 
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was following with ""great concern"" developments in Myanmar, where the army has said it would take action if complaints about the election are not addressed. An army spokesman on Tuesday declined to rule out the possibility of seizing power. 
Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union and United States, and 12 other nations, in a separate statement urged the military to ""adhere to democratic norms"".
They said they opposed ""any attempt to alter the outcome of the elections or impede Myanmar's democratic transition"".
A military spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
Talks between the civilian government and army failed to ease tensions ahead of parliament's opening on Monday, a ruling party spokesman said as pro-military protesters gathered in two cities.
Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won a resounding victory in the Nov. 8 poll, only the second election deemed free and fair by international observers since the end of direct military rule in 2011.
But allegations by the army of widespread voter fraud, which the electoral commission denies, have led to the most direct confrontation yet between the civilian government and the military.
The country's constitution reserves 25% of seats in parliament for the military, which has demanded a resolution to its complaints ahead of Monday, when parliament is set to convene, and has refused to be drawn on whether its lawmakers will show up.
The commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, told military personnel on Wednesday that the constitution should be repealed if it was not abided by, citing previous instances when charters had been abolished in Myanmar.
A Western diplomat in Yangon said information about the situation was hard to verify because ""not many people speak with one of the sides"", referring to the army, but a coup would be a ""tragic eventuality"". 
""The country is defined by that history, so this would be unforgiveable. The people from Myanmar would consider that unforgiveable,"" the diplomat said.
FRAUGHT TALKS
Suu Kyi has not made any public comment on the dispute. A spokesman for her NLD said members had met military leaders on Thursday for talks but said they were ""not successful"". 
""We do have concerns but they are not too significant,"" the spokesman, Myo Nyunt, said by telephone, explaining how they had anticipated some tension due to the NLD's plan to amend the constitution after the vote to curb the power of the military.
He said police battalions were stationed in the capital, Naypyitaw, where the Supreme Court was set to hold an initial hearing on complaints filed against the president and the head of the election commission.
He said in the event of a coup the NLD would not respond with force.
Several dozen trucks carrying protesters with placards denouncing the government and election commission and praising the military circled the city on Friday morning but turned back from the court, where police were deployed.
NLD lawmaker Zin Mar Aung said police were patrolling the parliament compound and there was need for caution.
""We cannot pretend as if nothing is happening,"" Zin Mar Aung said by telephone. 
Win Htein, a senior member of the NLD who spent years in prison during military rule, said he was prepared in case he was arrested.
""I am packed and ready to follow them if they come to take me today,"" he said.
Author and historian Thant Myint-U said on Twitter on Thursday the country was likely ""veering towards its most acute constitutional crisis since the abolition of the old junta in 2010"".

A youth leader for the NLD, who asked not to be identified, said many people had a real fear of return to military rule.

The government has said it expects to receive 100,000 to 200,000 doses of the vaccine made by  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and Germany's BioNTech (DE:22UAy) under the global COVAX scheme in February.
No vaccine has yet been approved in Ukraine but authorities have repeatedly said Kyiv will not approve or use vaccines from Russia, with which Ukraine's ties are strained.
""One political force just created some hysteria over the registration of the Russian vaccine,"" Ukraine's Health Minister Maksym Stepanov told a televised briefing.
""I can say at once: You can be hysterical for a very long time, no one will register the Russian vaccine in the country.""
Biolik, a Ukrainian pharmaceutical company backed by Viktor Medvedchuk, a prominent Russia-leaning opposition figure, said earlier this month it had applied for state approval to make Russia's Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine, a sensitive move given the poor relations between Kyiv and Moscow.

The two countries have been at loggerheads since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and involvement in a conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbass region which Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.

Thursday was the fourth straight night of unrest in one of Lebanon's poorest cities, after the government imposed a 24-hour curfew to curb a COVID-19 surge that has killed more than 2,500 people. 
""The criminals who set the municipality on fire and attempted to burn the court ... represent a black hatred for Tripoli,"" Hassan Diab said in a statement. 
""The challenge now is in defeating these criminals by arresting them one by one and referring them to the judicial system."" 
Flames engulfed the government building after it caught fire just before midnight on Thursday. Police had been firing tear gas at protesters hurling Molotov cocktails. 
A funeral for a man who died after being shot by a bullet on Wednesday night had given fuel to the further protests. Security forces said they had fired live rounds to disperse rioters trying to storm the government building.
Diab's statement on Friday did not mention the killing; Human Rights Watch has called for it to be investigated.
""We promise to work quickly to restore the municipality building of Tripoli so that it remains an expression of its dignity and pure heritage,"" Diab said. 
The lockdown, in effect since Jan. 11, is piling extra hardship on the poor, now more than half the population, with little government aid.
Lebanon has been in the throes of its worst financial crisis since 2019 and anger has erupted into protests over the economy, state corruption and political mismanagement.
A currency crash has triggered fears of rising hunger, but Lebanese leaders have yet to launch a rescue plan or enact reforms to unlock aid, prompting rebukes, including from foreign donors.

Diab is steering the government in a caretaker role as fractious politicians remain unable to agree on a new administration since his quit in the aftermath of the Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion leaving Lebanon rudderless as poverty soars.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh moved another group of Rohingya Muslims on Friday to a remote island in the Bay of Bengal, despite concerns over the risk of storms and floods lashing the site, even as some refugees despaired of finding solutions to their plight.
The densely-populated south Asian country wants to transfer to the island a tenth of the 1 million refugees living in ramshackle border camps after they fled violence in neighbouring Myanmar.
""What options do we have? How long can we live in the crowded camps under tarpaulins?"" asked Mohammed Ibrahim, 25, as he sailed to the island of Bhasan Char, to which some of his relatives have also been moved.
""This is going nowhere, the way the international community is handling our crisis,"" he told Reuters by mobile telephone, referring to floundering efforts to return the refugees to their homeland.
The Rohingya are a minority group, most of whom are denied citizenship by Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which considers them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, even though many trace their roots back for generations in the western state of Rakhine.
Five ships moved 1,776 Rohingya and their belongings, with more set to be moved on Saturday for a two-day total of more than 3,000, said Commodore Abdullah Al Mamun Chowdhury, the officer in charge of the island.
""We are receiving them,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""So far, so good.""
They will join the roughly 3,500 Rohingya sent there since early December, making a journey of several hours from the southern port of Chittagong.
Rohingya living on the island, which emerged from the sea just two decades ago, are not allowed to move away unless they have government permission.
Bangladesh says the relocation is voluntary, but some of the first group of refugees, moved in December, spoke of being coerced. The government also says overcrowding in camps in the Cox's Bazar district fuels crime.
It has also dismissed flood concerns over the island, citing the building of a 12-km (7.5-mile) -long stretch of embankment 2 metres (6.5 feet) high, in addition to housing for 100,000 people, hospitals and cyclone centres.
Bangladesh has drawn criticism for reluctance to consult with aid bodies, including the U.N. refugee agency, over the transfers.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says the agency has not been allowed to evaluate the safety and sustainability of life on the island.

""We look forward to continuing a constructive dialogue with the government regarding its Bhasan Char project, including the proposed U.N. technical and protection assessments,"" it said in an email.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan's government on Friday appealed to the Supreme Court to review its decision to free an Islamist convicted of kidnapping and beheading U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl, a day after the United States expressed ""deep concerns"" over the ruling.
A panel of three judges of the court on Thursday acquitted British-born Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three co-accused, who had been convicted in 2002 on charges of kidnapping and murder of the Wall Street Journal reporter.
The court ordered the Islamist and his co-accused released forthwith if they are not required in any other case. 
The government in southern Sindh province filed a petition asking the top court to review its decision, the Pearl family's lawyer Faisal Siddiqi and the Sindh government's prosecutor told Reuters.
""We have filed three review petitions,"" prosecutor Faiz Shah said, explaining that the petitions would seek a reversal of the acquittal and the reinstatement of Sheikh's death penalty.
""Being aggrieved of and dissatisfied with the judgement, the petitioner files an instant criminal review petition for leave to appeal on matters of law, facts and grounds,"" the petition seeking the reversal of the aquittal said.
Pearl, 38, was investigating Islamist militants in Karachi after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States when he was kidnapped. A video of his beheading emerged weeks later.
His parents expressed shock over the Supreme Court's decision, which U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called ""an affront to terrorism victims everywhere, including in Pakistan"".
Washington was also prepared to prosecute Sheikh in the United States, Blinken said.
A high court last year commuted Sheikh's death penalty into a life sentence and acquitted his three co-accused, citing lack of evidence.

The government and Pearl's parents challenged that decision and pleaded to the Supreme Court to reinstate the death penalty, that was turned down on Thursday.

Navalny, who is serving a 30-day jail stint for parole violations he calls trumped up, released the video last week in an effort to encourage people to take to the streets to demand his freedom, something tens of thousands did last weekend. 
Navalny's allies are still promoting the video to try to encourage people to protest, this time on Sunday, something the authorities have warned would be illegal under Russian law, which requires such events to be pre-authorised. The authorities have said such mass events are unsafe amid a pandemic. 
Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for over two decades and has traditionally avoided even uttering Navalny's name publicly, has said the palace, in southern Russia, does not belong to him or his family.
His public denial on state TV was unusual. Some critics saw it as a sign that he was rattled, an idea the Kremlin has laughed off. 
Navalny's video said the property, built in the Italian palazzo style, had its own underground ice rink, casino, swimming pool, theatre and something called an aqua-disco.
The latter inspired a pop music track and video titled ""Akvadiskoteka"" that has since gained over three million YouTube views. 
Navalny rose to prominence in Russia during anti-Kremlin protests in 2011-12 and carved out a following online, particularly among younger Russians in big cities, by airing allegations about official graft. 
He was arrested earlier this month after flying back to Moscow from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning in August. 

Navalny has accused Putin of ordering his poisoning. Putin has denied the authorities tried to poison him and said Russian agents would have finished the job if they had wanted him dead.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain cannot publish details of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine supply contract because it would jeopardize national security, a junior minister said on Friday, as the European Union threatened drug companies over supply delays.
Europe's fight to secure vaccines intensified on Thursday when the EU warned drug companies that it would use all legal means or even block exports unless they agreed to deliver shots as promised.
Scotland will publish COVID-19 detailed vaccine supply data next week even though the British government has refused to do so.
British prisons minister Lucy Frazer said the government had been transparent with data but could not publish supply details for national security reasons which she repeatedly refused to specify.
""My understanding is it risks national security,"" Frazer, a former barrister, told LBC radio, when asked why the data had not been published. She refused to say how publication of such data could hurt national security.
The swiftest mass vaccination drive in history is stoking tensions across the world as big powers buy up doses in bulk and poorer nations try to navigate a financial and diplomatic minefield to collect whatever supplies are left. 
Israel is by far the world leader on vaccine rollout per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain and the United States. Behind them are Italy, Germany, France, China and Russia.
The United Kingdom has secured 367 million doses of the seven most promising vaccines, including 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine which was developed by Oxford University.
Kate Bingham, the former head of the UK's vaccine taskforce, said the country had been able to secure supplies by supporting pharmaceutical companies, setting up clinical trials quickly and helping firms procure equipment to scale up manufacturing. 
She declined to comment on the detail of the contract with AstraZeneca, but said that the UK had benefited from early work to be ready to make vaccines. 
""That is ultimately the difference as to why we're so far ahead on manufacturing,"" Bingham said, adding that she did not expect the EU to block vaccine exports to the UK.
The EU's contract with AstraZeneca for its COVID-19 vaccine contains binding orders, EU Commision Head Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday, demanding a plausible explanation from the drugmaker for delivery hold-ups.

""I think we'll just go back to publishing the actual supply figures from next week, so that we all have transparency around that,"" Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament on Thursday.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal's Supreme Court has issued two contempt of court notices to caretaker Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli, demanding he explain why he mocked lawyers challenging his decision to dissolve parliament and call early polls.
The contempt of court suits are the latest challenges for the beleaguered leader after being expelled from his party earlier this week.
The Supreme Court has ordered Oli to ""present his written replies within seven days,"" Devendra Dhakal, a Supreme Court official told Reuters.
The Supreme Court judges are dealing with more than a dozen petitions against Oli's surprise move in December last year to dissolve the parliament and call fresh elections a year ahead of schedule, a move that has triggered nation wide protests amid the coronavirus pandemic and plunged the young Himalayan republic into a political crisis.
Despite protests, Oli at a public function last week, questioned the involvement of a 94-year-old lawyer Krishna Prasad Bhandari in petitions filed against his political decision. 
Bhandari had earlier stated before the court that the leader (Oli) had no prerogative to dissolve the parliament and had acted unconstitutionally. 
This week two lawyers filed contempt cases against Oli for making statements which they deemed were ""a direct insult"" to the legal fraternity. 
Oli's lawyer Ramesh Badal said the leader was yet to get a communication from the court.
""Once the formal letter comes he (Oli) will reply accordingly,"" Badal told Reuters.
Oli has justified the dissolution saying the ruling Nepal Communist Party had not cooperated with the government in policy decisions, while his opponents say he had ignored the party decision and abruptly dissolved the parliament instead of sorting out differences with party colleagues.

The court is expected to give its verdict in February.

(Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Friday he was following with ""great concern"" developments in Myanmar, where military threats and coup fears have overshadowed the planned opening of parliament.
Escalating tension between the civilian government and the powerful military has stirred fears of a coup in the aftermath of an election the army says was fraudulent.
The army has said it plans to ""take action"" if its complaints about the election are not addressed and a spokesman this week declined to rule out the possibility of seizing power.
In a statement Guterres called on ""all actors to desist from any form of incitement or provocation, demonstrate leadership, and to adhere to democratic norms and respecting the outcome of the 8 November general election.""
""All electoral disputes should be resolved through established legal mechanisms,"" he added.
In a separate statement, Western nations said they were looking forward to the ""peaceful convening"" of parliament on Monday.

""We urge the military, and all other parties in the country to adhere to democratic norms, and we oppose any attempt to alter the outcome of the elections or impede Myanmar's democratic transition,"" said the statement signed by the embassies of Australia, Britain, Canada, the European Union and United States, among others.

The EU has been locked in a row with AstraZeneca, which partnered with Britain's Oxford University to develop its vaccine, after the drugmaker said last week it would cut deliveries in the first quarter due to production issues at a Belgian factory.
An EU official said that meant the EU would receive 31 million doses in the period, or 60% less than initially agreed, piling pressure on the 27-country bloc which has lagged vaccination campaigns in Israel, Britain and the United States.
""There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,"" von der Leyen told Deutschlandfunk radio, adding it contained clear delivery amounts for December and the first three quarters of 2021.
""AstraZeneca has also explicitly assured us in this contract that no other obligations would prevent the contract from being fulfilled,"" she added.
Von der Leyen's comments contradict statements by AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot, who told newspapers on Tuesday the EU contract was based on a ""best-effort"" clause and did not commit the company to a specific timetable for deliveries.
Soriot has also said the EU was late to strike a supply contract so the company did not have enough time to iron out production problems at a vaccine factory run by a partner in Belgium.
Von der Leyen said the ""best-effort"" cause was only valid as long as it was not clear whether AstraZeneca could develop a vaccine. She also said there was no ""order sequencing"" stipulation and that it mentioned four production sites, two of which are in Britain.
The EU wants to make a redacted version of the contract public later on Friday, she said.

The EU contract with AstraZeneca is an advance purchase agreement for the supply of at least 300 million doses provided the vaccine is approved as safe and effective, with doses delivered in stages. It is expected to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Friday.

Britain said it was adding the United Arab Emirates, Burundi and Rwanda to its coronavirus travel ban list because of worries over the spread of a more contagious and potentially vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variant first identified in South Africa.
""This means people who have been in or transited through these countries will be denied entry, except British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights who must self-isolate for ten days at home,"" U.K. Transport Minister Grant Shapps said on Twitter on Thursday.
Emirates Airways said on their websites they would suspend all U.K. passenger flights from 1300 GMT on Friday when the ban takes effect. Etihad Airways said they would only suspend flights to the U.K., with those from the U.K. remaining unaffected.
Dubai airport, in a statement, advised passengers booked on flights due to arrive in the U.K. after the ban comes into effect to not go to the airport and instead contact their airline.
The U.K. transport department advised British nationals currently in the United Arab Emirates to make use of indirect commercial airline routes if they wished to return to Britain.
Due to border closures caused by COVID-19, Dubai to London was the world's busiest international route in January with 190,365 scheduled seats over the month, according to airline data provider OAG.
Emirates and Etihad normally carry large numbers of passengers connecting from Britain to destinations like Australia through their airport hubs, meaning the decision to cancel those flights will have far-reaching implications.
The Australian government said it will add more charter flights from Britain if needed as a result of the Emirates and Etihad cancellations.
Eran Ben-Avraham, an Australian stranded in Britain due to strict limits on the number of arrivals in Australia, said his options for getting home were continually shrinking.

""At the moment it is only giving us three options of flying Qatar, ANA or Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY),"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""Every day it is making it more difficult to get home. The flights back are anywhere from like 4,000 pounds ($5,487).""

1088,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2021 12:45AM ET</span>",Explainer: Myanmar army flexes muscles as Suu Kyi's government begins second term,"By Shoon Naing and Martin Petty
(Reuters) - Myanmar's powerful military has triggered worry about a coup after threatening to ""take action"" over alleged fraud in a November election won by the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, just days before a new parliament convenes.
The military's allegations of voter list irregularities have been accompanied by cryptic comments about abolishing the constitution that have captured public attention and raised the spectre of a coup in a country ruled by the military for half a century after a 1962 military takeover.
The National League for Democracy (NLD) led by Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner and figurehead of Myanmar's long struggle against dictatorship, won 83% of available seats in the Nov. 8 election seen as a referendum on her fledgling democratic government.
WHY IS THE MILITARY CHALLENGING THE VOTE
The military alleges discrepancies such as duplicated names on voting lists in scores of districts and is unhappy with the election commission's response to its complaints.
The military has been guarded about its motives and has not said if irregularities were substantial enough to have changed the election outcome. 
Its grievance is similar to that of the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), the former ruling party created by the military before it officially ceded power in 2011.
The USDP, widely seen as a military proxy, was humiliated in the election, winning only 33 of 476 available seats. 
WHY IS THE MILITARY GETTING INVOLVED?
As the architect of Myanmar's 2008 constitution and fledgling democracy, the military, known as the Tatmadaw, sees itself as the guardian of national unity and the constitution, and it has enshrined a permanent role for itself in the political system.
It gets an unelected quota of 25% of parliamentary seats and it controls the defence, interior and borders ministries, ensuring an important stake in politics, which has made for an awkward power-sharing arrangement with the NLD, many members of which suffered imprisonment and persecution by the former junta.
Columnist San Yu Kyaw said the political positioning was a last-ditch show of power by the military top brass before their mandatory retirement. 
""The political ambitions of Tatmadaw leaders have not been reached so they are acting this way,"" he said.
WHAT HAS THE NLD, OTHER PARTIES SAID?
Suu Kyi has not commented on her party's election victory, nor on the military's complaints, but the NLD said the military's allegations were groundless and any election flaws would not have changed the outcome.
Of the more than 90 parties that contested the vote, at least 17 have complained of mostly minor irregularities and all except the USDP are smaller parties. Election observers have said the voting was without major irregularities.
The election commission on Thursday said there were no errors on a scale that could mean fraud or the election being discredited.
WHAT IS THE MILITARY PLANNING TO DO?
The spokesman for the armed forces, Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun, held a news conference on Tuesday to renew the allegations but gave a succession of non-committal answers to questions about the military's intentions.
He said the military would ""take action"", and use all available options including the Supreme Court. Asked if the military would cooperate with the new government and legislature, he told reporters ""wait and watch"". 
Asked if he would rule out a coup, Zaw Min Tun said ""cannot say so"".
The military spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment on Friday.
IS A COUP LIKELY?
The constitution makes it difficult for the military to legally intervene against an elected government.
The commander-in-chief can take power only in extreme circumstances that could cause ""disintegration of the union, disintegration of national solidarity and loss of sovereign power"", but only during a state of emergency, which can only be declared by the civilian president.
To take power by force, it might have to breach its own constitution.
The commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, caused intrigue on Wednesday when he told military personnel a constitution was a ""mother law for all laws"" and if not abided by, it should be revoked. He cited previous instances when that had happened in Myanmar. 
Legal expert Khin Maung Zaw said talk of scrapping the constitution was unreasonable.

""I wonder if they want to abolish it because they cannot protect their own interests,"" said Khin Maung Zaw.

Health officials are reassessing daily a pause on Australia's travel corridor with New Zealand after the Pacific nation's strong response to an outbreak of a contagious strain of COVID-19, while borders between Australia's two most populous states may next week open freely for the first time this year.
The trans-Tasman bubble, which has allowed New Zealand residents to travel to Australia without quarantining, was frozen after New Zealand confirmed its first case in months on Monday of a variant that emerged in South Africa.
Evidence that it has contained the worrying spread, with zero cases of community transmission on Friday, have meant there is reason for health officials to reconsider the travel pause, Australia's Health Minister Greg Hunt told media. 
""If there are continued excellent results out of New Zealand, which is commensurate with their entire performance over the course of the pandemic, then we hope to be in a position to resume (travel) in the coming days,"" said Hunt.
New Zealand and Australia both ranked in the global top 10 in an index of almost 100 countries based on their containment of the coronavirus, which has paved the way for the state of Victoria to stage the Australian Open starting Feb. 08. 
The state Victoria began relaxing month-long travel restrictions on visitors from Sydney on Friday, as the world's top tennis talent emerged from 14-day hotel quarantine in Melbourne and neighbouring Adelaide which was hosting a show tournament.
""These 14 days, there wasn't a day that I didn't have someone under the balcony, with a Serbian flag, and I want to thank them all for making the stay in the hotel much easier for me and my team,"" Novak Djokovic told media in Adelaide.
Australia has recorded nearly a fortnight free of community transmission with authorities bringing an outbreak that began before Christmas in the most populous New South Wales state under control. 

Australia logged 5 new cases on Friday, all in overseas travellers in quarantine, bringing total cases to around 28,800 with 909 deaths since March.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - A World Health Organization-led team of experts investigating the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic began meeting with Chinese scientists on Friday, and the WHO said the group plans to visit labs, markets and hospitals in Wuhan.
On Thursday, the team completed two weeks of quarantine following its arrival in China, moving to a lakeside hotel in the central Chinese city where the deadly virus emerged in late 2019.
""First face to face meeting with our colleagues. Correction: facemask to facemask given the medical restrictions. Discussing our visiting program,"" Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands, tweeted on Friday.
""China teamleader prof Wannian joking about some technical glitches. Nice to see our colleagues after lengthy zoom meetings,"" she said.
The group is expected to spend two more weeks in China, and will visit the seafood market at the centre of the early outbreak. It will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology. One hypothesis, rejected by China, is that the outbreak was caused by a leak at the government lab.
The WHO has sought to manage expectations. ""There are no guarantees of answers,"" its emergency chief, Mike Ryan, said earlier this month.
The mission has been plagued by delays, concern over access and bickering between China and the United States, which has accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research.
""It is important to remember that the success of this mission and origin-tracing is 100% depending on access to the relevant sources,"" Thea Fischer, a Danish member of the team, told Reuters on Thursday.
""No matter how competent we are, how hard we work and how many stones we try to turn, this can only be possible with the support from China,"" she said.
The origin of COVID-19 has been highly politicised.
The investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former U.S. President Donald Trump accused of being ""China-centric"".
China has pushed the idea that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers saying it had been circulating in Europe in 2019.
China's foreign ministry has also hinted that the sudden closure of a U.S. army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the pandemic.
""At the early stage in China, it was a burden particularly for Wuhan people when everyone was calling it a Wuhan virus, which was humiliating,"" said Yang You, a 30-year-old Wuhan resident. ""If it could be traced to the source clearly, in my opinion, it could clear either China's or Wuhan's name.""

1091,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 11:30PM ET</span>",Former Obama aide Malley named Biden's top envoy on Iran: official,"By Matt Spetalnick and Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Joe Biden has named Robert Malley as special U.S. envoy for Iran, a senior official said on Thursday, giving the veteran diplomat a leading role in one of most daunting and politically divisive foreign policy challenges facing the new administration.
Malley was a key member of former President Barack Obama's team that negotiated the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and world powers, an agreement that former president Donald Trump abandoned in 2018 despite strong opposition from Washington's European allies.
""Secretary Blinken is building a dedicated team, drawing from clear-eyed experts with a diversity of views. Leading that team as our Special Envoy for Iran will be Rob Malley, who brings to the position a track record of success negotiating constraints on Iran’s nuclear program,"" the State Department official said.
""The Secretary is confident he and his team will be able to do that once again,"" the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said, referring to Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
When Malley's name first surfaced in news reports as a leading candidate for the post, he drew criticism from some Republican lawmakers and pro-Israel groups that expressed concern that he would be soft on Iran and tough on Israel. But a number of foreign policy veterans rushed to his defense, praising him as a respected, even-handed diplomat.
The post would make Malley the point person in Biden's efforts to deal with Iran after years of worsening relations under Trump, who, after pulling out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, reimposed crippling economic sanctions. 
The Diplomatic news website was first to report on Malley's expected appointment.
He held numerous senior positions in the Democratic administrations of Obama and former President Bill Clinton with a focus on Middle East and Gulf policymaking and informally advised Biden's team during the 2020 campaign.
Most recently, he was the president of the International Crisis Group, a non-profit organization focused on global conflict.
CRAFTING IRAN POLICY
Malley's expected appointment comes as Biden and his foreign policy aides move to craft their approach to Iran. Malley is expected to report directly to Blinken, a source familiar with the matter said.
Biden's top diplomat on Wednesday stuck to the new administration's stance that Tehran must resume complying with the Iran nuclear deal before Washington would do so.
Making his first public comments on Iran as secretary of state, Blinken reiterated Biden's policy ""that if Iran comes back into full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA, the United States would do the same thing."" 
But Iran's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, said on Twitter on Thursday that the United States should make the first move by returning to the nuclear pact.
The nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was struck by Iran and six major powers and committed Iran to restricting its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief from the United States and others. Israel and Gulf Arab states strongly opposed the deal as not stringent enough on Tehran.
Malley, the son of an Egyptian journalist and Iran expert, was an informal adviser to Obama's 2008 campaign but resigned after it emerged he had met with representatives of the Palestinian militant group Hamas while working for the International Crisis Group.

Malley was later brought into the Obama administration, in which Biden served as vice president, as a top Middle East adviser.

The scheme, first announced last year, opens on Sunday and allows those with ""British National (Overseas)"" status to live, study and work in Britain for five years and eventually apply for citizenship.
Britain says it is fulfilling a historic and moral commitment to the people of Hong Kong, after accusing China of breaching the terms of a 1997 handover by introducing security laws that London says are being used to silence dissent.
China says the path to citizenship is a violation of international law and interferes with its internal affairs.
""I am immensely proud that we have brought in this new route for Hong Kong BN(O)s to live, work and make their home in our country,"" Johnson said in a statement.
""In doing so we have honoured our profound ties of history and friendship with the people of Hong Kong, and we have stood up for freedom and autonomy – values both the UK and Hong Kong hold dear.” 
BN(O) is a special status created under British law in 1987 that specifically relates to Hong Kong.
The 250 pound ($340) visa could attract over 300,000 people and their dependents to Britain and generate up to 2.9 billion pounds net benefit to the British economy over the next five years, according to government forecasts.
From around midday on Sunday, eligible applicants can apply online and book an appointment to register their fingerprints at a visa application centre. From Feb. 23 some will be able to make the application visa a smartphone app. 

It is still highly uncertain how many people will actually take up the offer. Government estimates show that 2.9 million and a further 2.3 million dependents will be eligible to come to Britain.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has delayed until Sunday any easing of social distancing measures because outbreaks involving mission schools are threatening to undermine efforts to keep new infections under control ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays.
The number of cases linked to Christian schools nationwide grew further on Friday, reaching 344 infections in total in seven facilities.
Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Friday that the government would not carelessly reduce social distancing rules, citing experts who view the recent surge in cases as a sign of another massive wave of infections.
""We want to be cautious as making a wrong judgment ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays could end up tumbling the anti-virus measures we have been building up in an instant,"" Chung told a government meeting.
South Korea's social distancing policy has become a whack-a-mole game, a repetition of tightening and easing of the curfews and restrictions, said Kim Woo-joo, a professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital in Seoul.
""The nation is reeling with false hope of a return to normal in February since the vaccination starts then, but the eradication is impossible with so many locally transmitted cases,"" Kim said.
The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 469 new coronavirus cases as of midnight on Thursday, bringing the national tally to 77,395 cases and 1,399 deaths.
The government on Thursday unveiled a plan to inoculate 10 million high-risk people by July, starting with key groups in February.

Chung has said that Asia's fourth largest economy would hopefully have achieved herd immunity by November and a return to normal life.

Beijing has imposed a tighter grip on the Asian financial hub in the past year, imposing new security laws and arresting political opponents.
The Post, citing unnamed sources, said the Hong Kong Liaison Office's expanded responsibilities included tighter supervision and policy implementation in the semiautonomous city.
The new cadres were also tasked with helping contain the coronavirus, build bridges with young people who have shown their anger towards Beijing in often-violent 2019 protests and to identify long-term governance challenges, the report said.
One mainland China source cited in the report said about 200 new cadres were transferred in the past year, partly to replace others in jobs on rotation. That resulted in a net increase of 100 staff. The total staff numbers remain unknown.
Many of the new arrivals had been selected for their skills in areas such as social media and because they were ""ready to start afresh"" in Hong Kong, the source told the paper.
A second source close to the Liaison Office told the paper the cadres had all attended briefings, including on disciplinary issues, in the neighbouring mainland tech hub of Shenzhen before they arrived in Hong Kong. 
""The disciplinary reminder is important because the liaison office now promotes a down-to-earth working style and following (Communist Party discipline) is a top priority,"" the source was quoted as saying.
They were also vaccinated against COVID-19 while in Shenzhen. 

China has signaled a more hands-on approach on Hong Kong affairs early last year when it replaced the heads of the Liaison Office in the city and of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office on the mainland.

Killings of civilians in Afghanistan's conflict rose to more than 2,900 last year, the country's human rights commission has said, despite stepped-up diplomacy to end the war including peace talks taking place in Qatar.
The deaths are part of a wider increase in violence that threatens a delicate peace process, undermining international calls for a ceasefire as the Afghan government takes part in peace negotiations with the Taliban.
""Without them meeting their commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan National Security Forces ... it's very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement, but we're still committed to that,"" Pentagon spokesman John Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told reporters.
The February 2020 agreement with the Taliban calls for a complete U.S. troop withdrawal by May 2021 in return for the insurgents fulfilling security guarantees.
U.S. officials and diplomats have said that ties between the Taliban, especially its Haqqani Network branch, and al Qaeda remain close. 
""Thus far, the Taliban has been, to put it politely, reticent to meet their requirements,"" Kirby added.
The United States went down to 2,500 troops in Afghanistan earlier this month under the then-outgoing Trump administration, the lowest level of American forces there since 2001.
Kirby said no decision had been made by President Joe Biden's administration about future troop levels in Afghanistan.
Diplomats have raised concerns that rising violence, particularly by the Taliban, is undermining trust needed for successful peace talks.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told his Afghan counterpart last week that the United States would review the peace agreement reached with the Taliban.

Despite the numerous facilities at Rose Hills, there is about a month's delay before families can receive funeral services for their loved ones.
Patrick Monroe, CEO and president of Rose Hills, told Reuters via Zoom that there had been a sharp increase for services since the Thanksgiving holiday in November, with demand nearly doubling.
Rose Hills has brought in a large number of refrigeration units to deal with the additional bodies.
The park has also set up tented areas to replace on-site chapels and is using new methods like livestreaming to bring services to families.

Mexico's federal government should guarantee the rights of migrants in Mexican territory and establish humane policies, Bishop Jose Torres, the Mexican Catholic Church's spokesman for migration, added in a letter seen by Reuters and addressed to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and other officials. 
Mexican authorities recovered the bodies in the border state of Tamaulipas over the weekend. Many had gunshot wounds and were badly charred. Guatemalan families, who believe relatives migrating northwards are among the victims, have provided DNA samples to confirm their identities. 
""In the name of the highest values ​​of humanity, we ask the federal government for an exhaustive investigation,"" said Torres, who oversees 120 shelters for migrants. He said a lack of legal options pushes migrants towards dangerous, clandestine networks.
Immigration from Central America and Mexico has returned to the forefront of regional policy since U.S. President Joe Biden took office earlier this month vowing to unwind some restrictions imposed by predecessor Donald Trump. 
""One of the contributing factors to this type of tragedy is the implementation of repressive immigration policies and persecution of migrants who only seek better living conditions for themselves and their families,"" Torres said.
Authorities have not established the identity of the victims or the perpetrators. Tamaulipas Governor Francisco Garcia said on Thursday the killings were an ""outrage."" 
Every year thousands of Central Americans and Mexicans flee poverty and violence for the safety and economic stability of the United States. Along the dangerous journey, which includes the vast Mexican territory, many fall victim to crime.
Tamaulipas is a major migration route and site of cartel conflict.
""It is a priority that the federal government establishes fair, safe and orderly immigration policies,"" Torres said. 

Mexico's Interior Minister Olga Sanchez this week vowed that the case will not go unpunished.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - At least six people were killed and 12 hospitalized on Thursday after a suspected liquid nitrogen leak at a poultry plant in the U.S. state of Georgia, police and fire services officials said.
Five people died at the Foundation Food Group plant in Gainesville, about 60 miles (97 km) northeast of Atlanta, and one died after being transferred to hospital, the officials said. 
Nicholas Ancrum, a spokesman for Foundation Food Group, said it appeared a nitrogen line had burst and the cause was under investigation. 
""All these folks who came to work today didn't expect something like this, so please keep them in your prayers,"" County Sheriff Gerald Couch said.
All the bodies had been removed from the plant and authorities were working on identifying them and notifying the families, Couch said.
Of the 12 people injured, three were in critical condition, five were listed in fair condition and the remaining three had been released from hospital, officials said.
Nitrogen, typically an inert gas that becomes a liquid when supercooled, is widely used in frozen food processing plants. However, liquid nitrogen gas released in a confined space can rapidly displace oxygen in the air and lungs, according to the University of Delaware, leading to unconsciousness and lethal asphyxiation.
Last month, two workers at a Golden West Food Group plant in Los Angeles County, lost consciousness and died following an apparent liquid nitrogen leak there, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
Four firefighters were injured in Thursday's suspected leak, suffering respiratory ailments, while around 130 other people were evacuated to a nearby church, officials said. 
The Foundation Food Group plant processes raw chicken into products like frozen chicken tenders and individual chicken cuts for restaurants and food service operations. It was known as Prime Pak Foods until the start of the year, when its name was changed under a merger between the two companies.
Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said on Twitter that he and his family are heartbroken over the news, and asked for all Georgians to pray for the families of the victims. 
""May God be a hand of peace, comfort, and healing in the days ahead,"" he wrote.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called for thousands of foreign fighters and mercenaries to immediately leave Libya, with Guterres demanding that they ""leave the Libyans alone.""
Libya has been divided since 2014 between the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in the capital Tripoli, in the country's west, and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).
The rival administrations agreed a ceasefire in October, but have not pulled back. Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.
""The ceasefire is holding,"" Guterres told reporters on Thursday. 
""It's essential that all foreign troops and all foreign mercenaries move first to Benghazi and to Tripoli and, from there, move back and leave the Libyans alone, because the Libyans have already proven that, left alone, they are able to address their problems,"" he said. 
Libya initially descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. 
The 15-member Security Council discussed the situation on Thursday and in a statement called for the withdrawal of all foreign fighters and mercenaries ""without further delay"", and for all Libyan and international actors to respect the arms embargo and ceasefire agreement. 
Acting U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Mills, called out the countries by name. 
""We call on all external parties, to include Russia, Turkey, and the UAE, to respect Libyan sovereignty and immediately cease all military intervention in Libya,"" Mills told the council. 
""We call on Turkey and Russia to immediately initiate the withdrawal of their forces from the country and the removal of the foreign mercenaries and military proxies that they have recruited, financed, deployed, and supported in Libya,"" he said.

""Our Cuba policy is governed by two principles. First, support for democracy and human rights - that will be at the core of our efforts. Second is Americans, especially Cuban Americans, are the best ambassadors for freedom in Cuba. So we'll review the Trump administration policies,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a news briefing.
Trump, a Republican, clamped down on Cuba after taking office in 2017, tightening restrictions on U.S. travel and remittances to Cuba, and imposing sanctions on shipments of Venezuelan oil to the island.
The policy was popular among the large Cuban-American population in South Florida, helping Trump win the state in November though he lost the election to Democrat Biden, who was former President Barack Obama’s vice president.
Nine days before Trump left office, his administration announced on Jan. 11 it was returning Cuba to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that could complicate Biden's efforts to revive improved relations with the Communist-run nation.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria evacuated hundreds of its citizens from Saudi Arabia on Thursday after they overstayed their visas and were left stranded, two Reuters witnesses said.
The first returnees, clad in masks and flowing robes, could be seen walking across the tarmac after their plane landed in the capital Abuja. 
High unemployment and two recessions in four years have pushed thousands of Nigerians to seek work overseas. But the coronavirus pandemic has reduced employment opportunities in other countries and travel restrictions have left many stranded. 
A video circulating on social media in recent weeks had shown Nigerians who said they had been held in a camp in Saudi Arabia for more than three months while other countries had flown out their stranded citizens within two weeks or so. 
""A camp generally is not a luxury hotel, but when people have waited for some time agitation comes in,"" said Akinremi Bolaji, a foreign affairs ministry official.
The government had said on Monday it was working with Saudi authorities to repatriate 802 Nigerians via two flights on Thursday and Friday. 
Abike Dabiri-Erewa, chairman of the Nigerians In Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), said last Friday that evacuations had been delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We appeal to Nigerians to resist travelling abroad without proper documents. It becomes very dangerous and more difficult,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday he hopes there will be a ""reset"" in U.S.-China relations, acknowledging that while the countries had ""different views"" on human rights, they should work together on climate action.
Beijing has been pushing for greater global influence in a challenge to traditional U.S. leadership. Tension between the two superpowers hit a boiling point at the United Nations last year, under former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, over the coronavirus pandemic.
""I hope we will see a reset in relations between the United States and China,"" Guterres told reporters. ""It is clear that in human rights, there are two completely different views, and it is clear that in human rights there is no scope for an agreement or a common vision.""
""There is an area where I believe there is a growing convergence of interests, and my appeal is for that area to be pursued by the two sides, together with the whole of the international community, and that area is climate action,"" he said.
New U.S. President Joe Biden's nominee for ambassador to the United Nations accused China on Wednesday of trying to ""drive an authoritarian agenda"" at the 193-member world body.
When asked for a response, Guterres said: ""In relation to the United Nations I can guarantee that we are very strongly committed to make sure that the U.N. is a beacon of all the values are related to ... security, development, human rights.""

Guterres also said he was ""particularly worried"" about the power of social media companies and that a regulatory framework should be created so decisions such as banning Trump from Twitter can be done ""in line with law.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish women with scheduled abortions are calling advice services in panic, activists said, as Poland's government put into effect a ruling banning terminations of pregnancies with foetal defects, which amounts to a near total abortion ban.
The ruling, first announced on Oct. 22 last year by the Constitutional Tribunal, led to weeks of massive protests, forcing the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government to delay its implementation.
Thousands protested across Poland as they waited for the court's verdict to be published in the official gazette late on Wednesday. On Thursday, hundreds gathered in Warsaw and other cities. 
""I picked up about ten of these calls during the night "" Krystyna Kacpura, director of Poland's Federation for Women and Family Planning (Federa) told Reuters on Thursday.
""They were (from women but) also from doctors and gynecologists asking if this is in place, what should they do. 'The patient is ready for the procedure - should I send her home?'"" 
Under the new rules, terminations will be permitted only in cases of rape and incest, and when the mother's life or health is endangered. Doctors performing illegal abortions in Poland face jail.
Abortions Without Borders, a support group helping women get abortions abroad whose number was spraypainted around Poland after the initial wave of protests, said it had received at least 30 calls from women by noon on Thursday.
Justyna Wydrzynska, a member of the support team, told Reuters she expected to have at least 100 calls by the end of the day. 
""You are not alone, we are with you and we are doing all we can so that everyone who contacts us gets all the support they need as soon as possible,"" she said. 
MOVING FORWARD
Polish conservatives who supported the new limitations rejoiced as the ruling came into full force on Thursday, arguing that they had finally secured equal human rights for unborn children and were shielding women from the trauma of abortion.
""There's a Polish saying that it's better to have ten children on your arm than one on your conscience, and I think this is part of our philosophy to protect life,"" said Maria Kurowska, a member of parliament representing socially conservative grouping United Poland, allied with the ruling nationalists.

Supporters of the ruling insisted that it's now up to the Polish government to provide additional support to families that have to care for disabled and sick children.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - In-person classes in Chicago for pre-kindergarten and special education students were canceled again on Thursday as a labor dispute between teachers and school officials over the district's COVID-19 safety plan remained unresolved. 
Chicago Teachers Union (CTU), representing 28,000 public school educators, has been locked in negotiations with Chicago Public Schools for months over a plan to gradually reopen schools for in-person learning, including pandemic-related safety protocols. 
With the nation's third-largest school district aiming to reopen in-person classes for some elementary and middle students on Monday, the two sides have yet to come to an agreement. Rank and file members voted last week 71% in favor of staying remote and not going back into their schools until their demands are met. 
Elementary and middle school teachers were due to report in person on Wednesday to prepare for Monday's reopening, but only about a third of them showed up, the district said. It was uncertain how many reported to classrooms on Thursday.
""I am protesting the inequitable and unfair treatment of teachers, staff and scholars by CPS,"" said Dwayne Reed, a fourth and firth grade teacher on the city's South Side, who has not been in his classroom this week. 
Earlier, CTU had warned that teachers will be ready to picket if the district disciplined any of those who failed to report to work on Wednesday.
In all, about 67,000 elementary and middle school students remain on the list to take at least some of their classes in-person, down from 77,000 who initially signed up for the option, according to CPS. 
Similar labor disputes have unfolded across the country, pitting teacher unions against district officials over conditions for reopening, almost a year after the virus shut down schools for 50 million students nationwide.
The teachers' union in Chicago says classrooms lack proper ventilation and that the district has failed to provide cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment. The district says ventilation meets industry standards for classroom learning and that it would provide schools with adequate PPE. 
The union has urged school and city officials to move quickly to vaccinate teachers. Inoculations are expected to begin in mid-February. 

The district said on Wednesday in its latest proposal that it has offered to make accommodations for those teachers who have family members with medical conditions, and that it has expanded testing and prioritized vaccines for staff working in the hard-hit areas of the city.

""Our heroic armed forces have eliminated Daesh commander Abu Yaser Al-Issawi as part of an intelligence-led operation,"" Kadhimi tweeted.
""If this is indeed confirmed, it's significant news, al-Issawi headed up IS's entire Iraq operation,"" tweeted Charles Lister, a director at the Middle East Institute think tank in Washington. ""It's worth awaiting more substantive evidence (..) previous claims have turned out to have been false.""
Last week, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a twin suicide bombing that killed at least 32 people in a crowded Baghdad market. It was the first big suicide bombing in Iraq for three years.
Iraqi authorities said the attack was a possible sign of the group reviving after its military defeat in 2017.
Suicide attacks on civilian targets were a near-daily tactic of the mainly Sunni Muslim insurgents during the U.S. occupation of Iraq after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.
Many of the insurgents were later recruited by Islamic State, whose fighters swept across a third of Iraq in 2014.
By 2017, however, Islamic State insurgents had been driven from all territory they held in Iraq. Their paramount leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, died in 2019 during a U.S. raid in neighbouring Syria.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's fight to secure COVID-19 vaccine supplies intensified on Thursday when the European Union warned drug companies such as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) that it would use all legal means or even block exports unless they agreed to deliver shots as promised.
The EU, whose member states are far behind Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States in rolling out vaccines, is scrambling to get supplies just as the West's biggest drugmakers slow deliveries to the bloc due to production problems.
As vaccination centres in Germany, France and Spain cancelled or delayed appointments, the EU publicly rebuked Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca for failing to deliver and even asked if it could divert supplies from Britain.
European Council President Charles Michel said in a letter to four EU leaders that the EU should explore legal means to ensure supplies of vaccines it contracted to buy, if negotiations with companies over delayed deliveries are unsuccessful.
""If no satisfactory solution can be found, I believe we should explore all options and make use of all legal means and enforcement measures at our disposal under the Treaties,"" he said in the Jan. 27 letter.
EU rules on monitoring and authorising exports of COVID-19 vaccines in the 27-nation bloc could lead to exports being blocked if they violated existing contracts between the vaccine maker and the EU, an EU official said.
The European Commission is to lay out the criteria under which such exports would be evaluated on Friday.
VACCINE CRUNCH
The global mass vaccination is stoking tensions across the world as big powers buy up doses in bulk and poorer nations try to collect whatever supplies are left. 
Israel is by far the world leader on vaccine rollout per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain and the United States. Behind them are Italy, Germany, France, China and Russia.
Both New York-based  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca, headquartered in Cambridge, England, have had production problems.
AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said the EU was late to strike a supply contract so the company did not have enough time to iron out production problems at a vaccine factory run by a partner in Belgium.
The European Commission has asked Belgian authorities to inspect production at the plant, Belgium's Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAGG) said on Thursday.
Britain, which has repeatedly touted its progress rolling out vaccines since leaving the EU's orbit on Jan. 1, said its deliveries must be honoured.
""I think we need to make sure that the vaccine supply that has been bought and paid for, procured for those in the UK, is delivered,"" Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove told LBC Radio.
European regulators are expected to decide on Friday whether to approve AstraZeneca's shot. Germany's vaccine committee said this vaccine should be given only to people aged between 18 and 64.
""There are currently insufficient data available to assess the vaccine efficacy from 65 years of age,"" the committee, also known as Stiko, said in a draft resolution made available by the health ministry on Thursday.
Britain's Johnson said health authorities in Britain believed the vaccine was safe and worked across all age groups. 
APPOINTMENTS CANCELLED
In Hauts-de-France in northern France, the country's second most densely populated region, several vaccination centres were no longer taking appointments for a first jab. In several other French regions, some online appointment platforms closed booking options.
Spain's Madrid and Cantabria regions have also ceased first vaccinations and were using remaining doses to administer second shots to those who have had the first one.
Portugal, where infections and deaths have spiked to record levels after Christmas, said delivery delays meant that people who have top priority - including health professionals - will all be fully vaccinated only by April, around two months later than initially planned. 
The Netherlands will also struggle to execute its vaccination program on schedule after having bet heavily on AstraZeneca. It ordered 11.7 million doses, of which 4.5 million were due for delivery in March. 
Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, last week postponed opening its vaccination centres until Feb. 8, while the state of Brandenburg has also had to push back vaccination appointments originally scheduled for the end of January due to delivery delays.

AstraZeneca is prepared to publish the delivery contract it has with the European Union and aims on Friday to make proposals to the European Commission on which sensitive parts to redact, the Frankfurter Allgemeine reported.

The 44-year-old senior drama teacher said police detained him at the protest in Moscow as tens of thousands of people took to the streets to demand the Kremlin release jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny. 
Police had said the protests were illegal, and rounded up more than 4,000 people, according to a monitoring group. 
Nazarov, who was held in custody until Monday, when a court fined him 10,000 roubles ($132), found out abruptly that Moscow's Institute of Theatrical Art had decided to fire him via a work chat on WhatsApp. 
The sacking illustrates the risks that demonstrators run by taking part in anti-Kremlin protest activity as police have cracked down on Navalny's most prominent allies and opened criminal cases.
Dmitry Tomilin, the institute's rector who publicly supports President Vladimir Putin, explained Nazarov's sacking on the institute's website. 
""The teacher's act of deliberately committing a crime in no way corresponds to the morals or ethics of a teacher and in my opinion is an amoral act,"" he said. 
Nazarov told Reuters he had not originally planned to attend the protests, but decided to go along as his son was going and he felt he could not stay on the sidelines. 
""I wish Russia was a European nation, and a country I'm not ashamed of... And as time goes by, there are more and more reasons to be ashamed. And it pains me deeply,"" he said.
Navalny's supporters plan to stage a new protest on Sunday. Nazarov said he was unsure if he would attend. 
""To live in a country that is descending into an abyss of absurdity and fear is much more frightening than what happened to me or could happen there (on Sunday),"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has placed his technology envoy on administrative leave, days after announcing the appointment, while the world body investigates accusations of abuse of authority and harassment.
Three women filed complaints with the Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS) in the past two months accusing veteran U.N. official Fabrizio Hochschild of abuse of authority and harassment in 2019 and 2020, according to three sources familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The complaints accuse Hochschild of creating a toxic work environment through bullying, aggressive outbursts, inappropriate remarks and phone calls and messages at all hours, the three sources told Reuters.
Hochschild said he was made aware of the complaints on Wednesday and promised to cooperate with the investigation. 
""I was informed of their existence but have not yet been informed in any manner about what they are grounded in or anything else specific. I am learning about this from the press, he told Reuters on Thursday. ""I will cooperate fully with any OIOS inquiry as soon as I am contacted.""
The formal complaints were made weeks before Guterres announced on Friday that Hochschild, of Chile, would be his technology envoy to enlist global support for digital cooperation. The United Nations informed him on Wednesday that he would be put on administrative leave. 
Staff in Guterres' executive office were aware in December that one of the women planned to make a formal complaint, according to correspondence seen by Reuters.
""The Secretary-General was informed on 27 January that OIOS had received complaints and would launch an investigation,"" said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric. He said OIOS is independent from the U.N. secretariat and he could not comment on the investigation.
""Mr Hochschild will be placed on administrative leave while the investigation is ongoing. Once he receives the results of the investigation, the Secretary-General will act swiftly and take the appropriate actions on the findings,"" Dujarric said.
He said Guterres had asked OIOS to ""conduct its investigation with priority and in a comprehensive manner.""
From April 2019, Hochschild was Guterres' special adviser on preparations for the 75th U.N. anniversary. Prior to that he spent two years as Assistant Secretary-General for Strategic Coordination in Guterres' Executive Office.
When his appointment as technology envoy was announced, Hochschild described himself on Twitter last Friday as ""a relative newcomer to the tech field."" 
When asked about his qualifications, Dujarric said on Monday: ""What Mr. Hochschild brings to the table is ... having dealt with this issue for a bit of time within the U.N., but I think also the ability to bring different stakeholders together.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) on Thursday accused eight former commanders of the demobilized FARC guerrillas of war crimes and crimes against humanity for taking hostages during the country's internal armed conflict. 
This is the first time since the signing of the 2016 peace deal that the JEP has attributed criminal responsibility to former leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia(FARC), which demobilized to reintegrate with society. 
""Depriving people of their freedom and setting conditions for their release, as well as their wellbeing, integrity, and life, was a war crime, especially the taking of hostages,"" the JEP said in a statement read by magistrate Julieta Lemaitre. 
The former commanders are also charged with other war crimes connected with the treatment of kidnap victims, including murder and torture, among others, Lemaitre said. 
Among the accused are former FARC leader Rodrigo Londono - know by the nom de guerre Timochenko - Pablo Catatumbo, Pastor Alape and Milton de Jesus Toncel. They have 30 days to accept or reject the accusations. 
If the commanders accept the accusations, they will face restrictions on their freedoms for five to eight years. 
However, if they reject them, they could face up to 20 years in jail per the terms of the peace deal which ended the FARC's part in a conflict that has left 260,000 dead and millions displaced. 
The JEP is a tribunal created under the 2016 peace deal to prosecute former FARC members and military leaders for alleged war crimes.
There was no immediate response from the former FARC commanders. Last year, former guerrilla leaders - including Timochenko - sought forgiveness for kidnappings. 
FARC guerrillas used kidnappings to fund their war against the state, while captured military or government personnel were used to pressure authorities into releasing jailed rebels, the JEP said. 
Kidnapping victims say they continue to suffer from mental health damage caused by the physical and emotional suffering they were subject to.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - On the morning of Jan. 20, hours before Joe Biden arrived at the White House as the 46th U.S. president, a clear plexiglass shield was erected at the guard's desk at the entrance to the West Wing housing the executive offices.
It was a small but noticeable sign that things were changing: COVID-19 protections missing during Donald Trump's last year in office would be a regular part of White House life in the Biden administration.
From required mask-wearing to a new public information approach, the Democrat's steady hand-on-the-tiller style marks an abrupt change from the bombast and volatility under the Republican Trump, a businessman and former reality TV star. 
""This is what normalcy looks like,"" said Ambassador John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, when asked about the Biden administration. ""It’s certainly true that if a president can’t manage the White House, he can’t manage the rest of it."" 
A White House governing strategy assailed as chaotic by both political parties is gone, replaced by message discipline and a disinclination toward leaks. 
New presidents typically benefit from a honeymoon period. Morning Consult Political Intelligence showed that, during Biden's first few days in office, 56 percent of voters approved of his job performance. But popularity can be fleeting. 
DOGS AND BRIEFINGS ARE BACK
The White House changes are myriad, from the mundane to the profound. Dogs are back on the South Lawn. Regular media briefings, with follow-up questions and data-driven answers, have returned to the briefing room.
Biden himself has made unity and civility his main messages. 
""We can treat each other with dignity and respect. We can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature,"" Biden said in his inaugural address. ""For without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury; no progress, only exhausting outrage; no nation, only a state of chaos.""
Trump dominated the news cycle largely as a one-man show, shifting topics regularly in a frenetic, seesaw fashion. The Biden team has stuck to a specific theme nearly every day, with Biden systematically signing executive orders to roll back one Trump policy after another. 
Trump's Twitter account, a mainstay of his presidency with aggrieved and inflammatory messages on a daily if not hourly basis, was suspended in the aftermath of a Jan. 6 riot by his supporters on the U.S. Capitol.
Biden's tweets are used to advance his policy objectives and to share the occasional lighthearted comment, such as when he cleared up any confusion about his favorite ice cream flavor: “Can confirm it’s chocolate chip.”
WHITE HOUSE MASKS AND DIVERSITY 
The Biden White House approach to the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 430,000 people in the United States, is one of the sharpest departures. 
Trump routinely eschewed masks, and most officials did the same when around him. The virus infected multiple members of his White House staff, and Trump himself.
Biden has mandated mask-wearing in government buildings. At public events, he and other officials adhere to public health guidelines for social distancing.
The new president has required appointees to sign stringent ethics pledges that include a ban on accepting gifts from registered lobbyists or lobbying organizations.
He also has showcased diversity. Vice President Kamala Harris - the first woman, Black person and Asian American to hold the role - is on hand for event after event. 
Although Biden has his share of white male advisers, other team members, from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the first woman and the first Black person to hold the roles, respectively, have projected a tableau of America in a way that Trump's team did not. 
Biden's call to move past the polarizing Trump years will be tested as his legislative agenda encounters resistance from Republicans on Capitol Hill and from liberal lawmakers who seek bolder reforms.
""In the short term very clearly the temperature has been taken down, and despite what we’ve seen in the Capitol just a few weeks ago, people are calming down,"" said Republican strategist Doug Heye. 

“Moving forward, Biden is in a perfect position to cut the deals that Trump always said he could but never did,"" he said, but added, ""that’s not to say it’s going to be easy.""

On a trip to Scotland to try to stem growing support for another referendum, Johnson opted for a blunt message, saying independence supporters had their chance in 2014 in a vote they had agreed at the time was ""a once-in-a-generation event"".
The bonds that tie England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland together in a $3 trillion economy have been severely strained by both Britain's exit from the European Union and Johnson's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
Opinion surveys indicate a majority of Scots would now favour breaking apart the 314-year-old union between England and Scotland.
But Johnson, whose unpopularity runs deep in Scotland according to opinion polls, suggested he was sticking to his position of not approving another referendum, which the Scottish National Party needs to hold a legal vote. 
""I don't think that the right thing to do is to talk endlessly about another referendum when I think what the people of the country and the people of Scotland want in particular is to fight this pandemic,"" Johnson said at a laboratory just outside Edinburgh.
""I don't see the advantage of getting lost in pointless constitutional wrangling when after all we had a referendum not so very long ago,"" he said.
""The very same people who...go on and on about another referendum also said only a few years ago, only in 2014, that this was a once-in-a-generation event - I'm inclined to stick with what they said last time.""
His visit to Scotland, at a time when the nation is in a lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19, drew criticism from Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her Scottish National Party (SNP) who questioned whether it qualified as ""essential"" under coronavirus guidelines.
'PART OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S JOB' 
Johnson's spokesman defended the trip, saying it was ""a fundamental part of the prime minister's job to go out and see businesses and communities and people"", particularly during the pandemic.
Sturgeon, who runs Scotland's semi-autonomous government, is hoping a strong SNP performance in its May 6 parliamentary election would give her the mandate to hold a second referendum.
If Scotland became independent, the United Kingdom - already grappling with the economic consequences of Brexit and the pandemic - would lose about a third of its landmass and almost a 10th of its population.
Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in 2014. But a majority of Scots also backed staying in the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum - though a majority in the United Kingdom overall, including England, Johnson's base, voted to leave - and Scottish nationalists say this boosts their case for secession.

Johnson's Cabinet Office Minister, Michael Gove, himself Scottish, told Sky News: ""At the moment, when we are prioritising the fight against the disease and also the need for economic recovery in due course, talking about changing the constitution and so on is just a massive distraction.""

Washington said on Wednesday it had temporarily paused some pending arms sales to U.S. allies. The Trump administration, having brokered formal Israel-UAE ties in September, approved a first sale of F-35 warplanes and other weaponry for Abu Dhabi.
Reviews of this sort are typical after a U.S. presidential handover. The UAE said it had anticipated the move and would work closely with the Biden administration.
Israel is the only country in the region to have the F-35. After initially voicing misgivings at its sale to the UAE, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Benny Gantz relented amid Trump administration assurances that Israeli military superiority would be preserved.
Asked by reporters if the review might set back Israel's efforts to build up relations with the UAE and other Arab countries, Netanyahu said: ""I don't think so. I think we have passed the point of no-return."" 
""Everyone understands that there are huge advantages here. It's peace in exchange for peace ... I think it'll move ahead.""
Gantz described the review as ""routine"". 

Interviewed by Ynet TV, Gantz said he would speak to his U.S. counterpart, Lloyd Austin, on Thursday but did not elaborate.

GHAZIABAD, India (Reuters) - Hundreds of Indian farmers protesting against agricultural reforms and refusing to disperse were locked in a stand-off with riot police on Thursday on the outskirts of the capital, New Delhi. 
Angry at what they see as laws that benefit large private buyers at the expense of growers, tens of thousands of farmers have been camped peacefully at sites on the outskirts of Delhi for more than two months.
But a procession of tractors on Tuesday turned violent when some protesters deviated from pre-agreed routes, tearing down barricades and clashing with police who responded with tear gas.
Some reached as far as Delhi's historic Red Fort, where they scaled the ramparts and hoisted flags. The violence left one dead and hundreds injured. 
Several hundred police arrived at the Ghazipur protest site to the east of the capital, where hundreds of protesters remain.
More than two dozen people also gathered nearby, chanting slogans against the farmers, according to a Reuters witness. 
Rakesh Chauhan, information officer for Ghaziabad district where the protest is taking place, told Reuters the protesters had been ordered to move by Thursday evening.
But after meeting with police and government officials, farm leaders had refused. 
""We will not empty this protest site,"" said Rakesh Tikait, one of the farm leaders. ""I will take a bullet here if I have to.""
Agriculture employs about half India's population of 1.3 billion and unrest among an estimated 150 million landowning farmers is one of the biggest challenges to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi since coming to power in 2014. 
Protests at other locations around Delhi have not yet been ordered to end.

Portugal, where infections and deaths have spiked to record levels after Christmas, initially hoped to receive close to 3 million vaccine doses in the first quarter, but this figure has fallen to just 1.5 million due to delivery delays, vaccination taskforce head Francisco Ramos said.
He had said in December the original plan envisaged 950,000 people - health professionals, key workers, people over 50 with pre-existing conditions and key political figures - being fully vaccinated in January and February. 
Under the new constraints, 810,000 people should be fully vaccinated by end-March and 520,000 will receive a first dose, Ramos said. 
""The first phase will happen until April,"" Ramos said, adding over-80s would now also be included in this phase.
""This will certainly not be the last change in the (vaccination) plan ... due to the uncertainty the availability of vaccines imposes on us."" 
A total of 74,000 people, including care home residents and staff, have been fully inoculated in Portugal so far, all with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Ramos said.
He said if the shot produced by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) was approved by Brussels, Portugal could receive another 2.2 million doses by end of March and reach its revised goal. 
AstraZeneca said last week it would reduce EU supplies in the first quarter due to production issues, and  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) warned of a temporary slowdown in shipments to the European Union in late January caused by changes to manufacturing processes, angering EU officials.

After criticism from lawmakers over politicians being included in the first phase of vaccination, the government said on Wednesday each state institution - from parliament to the courts - should say which workers it considers essential and in need of a vaccine.

""It's been extremely difficult since October,"" said Dudu Dagli, nursing director at the hospital's intensive care unit.
Some patients are no longer able to move or breathe on their own, and depend on nurses to take care of their most basic needs. ""We have adjust their position, wash them, take care of their eyes,"" Dagli said.
Germany has been battling its second wave since the autumn and has been in lockdown since mid-December as it tries to ease the pressure on its healthcare system by bringing down the number of new infections.
German hospitals association DKG said on Tuesday that about 4,600 COVID-19 patients were in intensive care, down from a peak of 5,781 on Jan 4.
Of the 17 coronavirus patients currently at the Havelhoehe hospital, 12 are receiving mechanical ventilation.
""In a way, you get used to everything somehow - the stress level, the high number of patients, the need to isolate. However, it is still absolutely exhausting,"" nurse Miriam Bloessner told Reuters. 
Intensive care unit nurse Carlos Reuss spoke of the emotional drain of taking care of patients who burst into tears when they wake up in a hospital bed with a tube down their throats.
""You have to have strength to deal with that and to not bring it home with you,"" he said.
Solidarity among staff, support from loved ones, and a sense of purpose can make the challenge less daunting. 
""I say to myself: 'You are a nurse, you have a very important job', get up with joy and come here,"" Dagli said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian investigators searching the Moscow flat of an ally of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny were given an unusual welcome late on Wednesday - a spirited Beethoven piano recital by the activist who they later arrested. 
Police are targeting Navalny's allies after tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand he be released from jail, something a judge on Thursday refused to do. 
Navalny's allies have called for new protests this weekend.
Police in Moscow went to the flat of Anastasia Vasilyeva, head of the Russia's Doctors Alliance trade union and a close ally of Navalny, late on Wednesday.
In a show of quiet defiance, footage of the moment shows Vasilyeva playing Beethoven on a white piano as police inform her they are about to search her flat. 
Vasilyeva continues to play, temporarily drowning out the words of a policewoman informing her that she must hand over all her electronic devices. She then stops playing and asks if anyone is going to applaud her. 
Nobody claps. 
Lawyer Dmitry Djulai said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that investigators later detained Vasilyeva for 48 hours in connection with alleged and unspecified violations of COVID-19 rules.
The moment she was detained was also caught on video.
""Her detention was inappropriate and stupid revenge for her human rights activities,"" wrote Djulai. 
""Anastasia's two children, minors, were left at home and tomorrow her patients will not be able to see her.""
Vasilyeva helped treat Navalny in 2017 after he suffered a serious chemical burn to his right eye as a result of an assault by pro-Kremlin activists.
In a video she made on Wednesday before being arrested, she called on people to not be afraid and take to the streets on Sunday to demand Navalny be freed from jail. 
""I really hope to see you there. Bye!"" she said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States should act first by returning to world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran that it ditched in 2018, the Iranian foreign minister tweeted on Thursday after Washington demanded Tehran reverse its breaches of the pact first. 
New U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed on Wednesday President Joe Biden's policy that Tehran must resume complying with curbs on its nuclear activity under the deal before the United States rejoins the pact abandoned by former president Donald Trump.
""Reality check for @SecBlinken: The US violated JCPOA
-blocked food/medicine to Iranians -punished adherence to UNSCR 2231. Throughout that sordid mess, Iran -abided by JCPOA -only took foreseen remedial measures,"" tweeted Mohammad Javad Zarif.
The JCPOA is the nuclear deal's official acronym, and Zarif was again accusing Washington of having illegally barred humanitarian imports to Iran after Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran, while Tehran had breached limits on uranium enrichment activity only in response to Trump's repudiation of the accord.
""Now,"" Zarif tweeted, ""who should take 1st step? Never forget Trump's maximum failure."" 
The 2015 accord lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs to its disputed nuclear programme but after Trump's withdrawal, Iran violated its conditions in a step-by-step response to Trump’s ""maximum pressure"" policy. 
Iran has repeatedly said it can quickly reverse those violations if U.S. sanctions are removed. 
In December, Iran's hardline-dominated parliament passed legislation that forces the government to harden its nuclear stance if U.S. sanctions were not eased within two months. 
Earlier this month, Iran resumed enriching uranium to 20% fissile strength at its underground Fordow nuclear plant, a level Tehran achieved before the 2015 accord. 
It had earlier breached the deal’s 3.67% limit on the purity to which it can refine uranium, but it had only gone up to 4.5% so far, well short of the 20% level and of the 90% needed to fuel an atomic bomb.

The new law also obliges Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation to produce 120 kilograms (264.55 pounds) of 20% enriched uranium annually. However, parliament speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said on Thursday Iran had exceeded the timetable by producing more than 17 kilograms within a month.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China toughened its language towards Taiwan on Thursday, warning after recent stepped up military activities near the island that ""independence means war"" and that its armed forces were acting in response to provocation and foreign interference.
Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, reported multiple Chinese fighter jets and bombers entering its southwestern air defence identification zone last weekend, prompting Washington to urge Beijing to stop pressuring Taiwan.
China believes that Taiwan's democratically-elected government is moving the island towards a declaration of formal independence, though Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has repeatedly said it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.
Asked at a monthly news briefing about the air force's recent activities, Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said Taiwan is an inseparable part of China.
""The military activities carried out by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the Taiwan Strait are necessary actions to address the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty and security,"" he said.
""They are a solemn response to external interference and provocations by 'Taiwan independence' forces,"" he added.
Wu said a ""handful"" of people in Taiwan were seeking the island's independence.
""We warn those 'Taiwan independence' elements: those who play with fire will burn themselves, and 'Taiwan independence' means war,"" he added.
While China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, it is unusual for Beijing to make such overt, verbal threats of conflict.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said China should think carefully and not underestimate the island's determination to defend its sovereignty and uphold freedom and democracy.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry reported six Chinese air force aircraft, including four J-10 fighter jets, flew into its air defence zone on Thursday, close to the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the top end of the South China Sea.
The weekend Chinese incursions coincided with a U.S. carrier battle group entering the disputed South China Sea to promote ""freedom of the seas"".
China routinely describes Taiwan as its most important and sensitive issue in relations with the United States, which under the former Trump administration ramped up support for the island in terms of arms sales and senior officials visiting Taipei.
President Joe Biden's government, in office for a week, has reaffirmed its commitment to Taiwan as being ""rock solid"", potentially auguring further strains with Beijing.

Taiwan has denounced China's threats and efforts at intimidation, and Tsai has vowed to defend the island's freedom and not be coerced.

The visit, which eluded Francis's predecessors, takes place amid deteriorating security in some parts of Iraq and after the first big suicide bombing in Baghdad for three years.
The programme for the March 5-8 trip, announced at a news conference by Patriarch Louis Raphael Sako, who is a Catholic cardinal and head of Iraq's biggest Christian denomination, will include Masses in Baghdad and the northern city of Erbil.
The pope will visit the former Islamic State stronghold of Mosul which has a significant Christian minority, and the ruins of ancient Ur in southern Iraq, revered as the birthplace of Abraham, father of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
Francis said in an interview broadcast on Jan. 10 that his Iraq trip might be cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic, but it now appears that preparations are going ahead, including vaccinations for potential participants.
In meeting the 90-year-old Sistani, Francis will hold talks with one of the most important figures in Shi'ite Islam, both within Iraq and beyond.
Sistani commands a vast following among Iraq's Shi'ite majority and huge influence over politics and public opinion. His edicts sent Iraqis to the polls for the first free elections after dictator Saddam Hussein was toppled, rallied the country to fight Islamic State in 2017 and ousted an Iraqi government during mass demonstrations in 2019.
Francis has visited predominately Muslim countries including Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Bangladesh, Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and the Palestinian territories, using those trips to call for inter-religious dialogue.
Iraq is trying to recover from the destruction caused by the campaign to defeat Islamic State, and beset by economic hardship after a fall in oil prices during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Iraq has been home to Christian communities for centuries. Hundreds of thousands of Christians fled sectarian violence after the fall of Saddam or were driven out when Islamic State captured much of the north in 2014.

But hundreds of thousands remained, divided among a number of denominations, with the largest being Chaldean Catholics, who practice an ancient Syriac rite and are loyal to the pope. Since Islamic State was driven from the north in 2017, Christians have largely recovered the freedom of worship.

BEIRUT/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - A man was killed in the Lebanese city of Tripoli on Thursday in clashes between security forces and protesters angry over a strict coronavirus lockdown that has cut off livelihoods in a collapsing economy.
The 30-year-old man, Omar Taybah, was hit by a bullet overnight, according to a local hospital that treated him, a security source and residents. Dozens marched at his funeral later in the day.
Witnesses and local media said police fired live bullets overnight as protesters tried to storm the northern city's government building. Scores of people were wounded. 
Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who hurled stones and Molotov cocktails, witnesses and police said. 
The police did not respond to a question on whether they had fired live rounds and whether a protester was killed.
Reuters footage showed sparks hitting the ground, apparently from ricocheting bullets, with the sound of gunfire.
It was the third straight night of violence in one of Lebanon's poorest cities, after the government imposed a 24-hour nationwide curfew this month to curb the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 2,500.
""People are tired. There's poverty, misery, lockdown and there's no work... Our problem is the politicians,"" said Samir Agha at the protest. 
ICU WARDS FULL
Aid workers say the lockdown is piling extra hardship on the poor, now more than half the population, with little government aid. A currency crash has triggered fears of rising hunger.
Still, Lebanese leaders have yet to launch a rescue plan or enact reforms to unlock aid, prompting rebuke including from foreign donors.
Lebanon's Internal Security Forces said rioters threw hand grenades, including at a patrol, injuring at least nine officers. They said they would respond with ""full severity and decisiveness"".
Human Rights Watch called for an investigation into Thursday's death. ""The government neglected the needs of Tripoli's people and used brute force...when they demanded a better life,"" researcher Aya Majzoub said.
The Red Cross said it took 35 people to hospitals, which are struggling with some of the region's highest COVID-19 infection levels.
Caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab has said the lockdown was necessary.

Lebanon's financial meltdown, it worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, erupted in 2019, sparking protests across the country against leaders who oversaw decades of state graft.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court on Thursday ordered Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny to be kept in jail after rejecting an appeal against his detention, a decision that Navalny called predictable. 
Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin, was remanded in custody for 30 days on Jan. 18 after flying back to Russia for the first time since being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent in August.
A court at the time ordered him detained for alleged parole violations, which he denied. With various legal cases pending against him, Navalny, 44, could face years in jail. The West has called on Russia to release him and tens of thousands of Russians protested against his jailing on Saturday.
Addressing the presiding judge by video link from jail before the ruling, Navalny demanded to be released and railed against what he said were absurd allegations he said had been trumped up by Russia's authorities to sideline him for political reasons. 
""We'll never allow ... these people to seize and steal our country. Yes, brute force is on your side now. You can...put me in handcuffs. (But) that will not continue forever,"" he said. 
His lawyers said Navalny would appeal against the ruling to keep him in custody, the Interfax news agency reported. 
After the ruling was handed down, Navalny said to the judge: ""Everything was clear to me before the start of the court hearing, thank you.""

Navalny's allies have called for new protests this weekend to demand his release. The authorities have said any demonstrations will be illegal and broken up.

Eloise, at the time a cyclone, slammed into Mozambique's central port city of Beira and surroundings - an area still recovering from the devastation of Cyclone Idai in 2019 - on Saturday. It then weakened to a tropical storm and moved inland to cause heavy rain and flooding across southern Africa.
Homes, crops and infrastructure in Mozambique, Zimbabwe, eSwatini - formerly Swaziland - and South Africa have been destroyed, with tens of thousands of people displaced in Mozambique especially after vast swathes of land were left underwater.

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar's election commission on Thursday rejected allegations by the country's military of vote fraud in last year's election and said there were no errors big enough to impact the credibility of the vote.
The commission's statement comes two days after the armed forces spokesman declined to rule out a coup and warned the military would ""take action"" if its demands to investigate irregularities were not met. 
The National League for Democracy (NLD) party won the Nov. 8 election in a landslide, taking 83% of available seats, in what was seen as a referendum on the democratic government of former political prisoner Aung San Suu Kyi.
The military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party won just 33 of the 476 available seats. 
""In this election, weaknesses and errors in voters lists cannot cause voting fraud,"" the commission said in a six-page statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, adding voting was conducted transparently before election observers.
It said it was investigating 287 complaints and that errors like duplicated names had appeared in some lists, but voters could not cast multiple ballots with fingers marked in indelible ink.
A military spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
The latest show of discontent by the army, which ruled Myanmar for half a century until 2011, comes just a few days before a new parliament convenes, prompting speculation the military could intervene before a new government is formed. 
Adding to the intrigue, commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, mentioned during a widely publicised video address to military personnel on Wednesday that a constitution should be repealed if it was not abided by.
He cited previous instances when charters had been abolished in Myanmar. 
NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt welcomed the commission's statement and said the military's claims had no grounds.

""For the voters and observers, there were no errors nor fraud substantial enough to flip the result of the election,"" Myo Nyunt said.

Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Croisdale-Appleby, head of the UK Mission to the EU who took office last week, was informed that his meeting with the chief of European Council President Charles Michel's cabinet had been postponed.
The official, who declined to be named, said the postponement was due to a lack of clarity about the diplomatic status of EU representatives in Britain, which became the first country to leave the bloc one year ago.
Britain has refused to grant the same diplomatic credentials and privileges to Brussels' ambassador to London and his team as it gives to envoys of countries, on the basis that the 27-member EU is not a nation state.
A British government source declined to comment on the postponement of Croisdale-Appleby's meeting and said the diplomatic status issue remained subject to negotiation.
Under the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations, envoys representing countries have certain privileges such as immunity from detention and, in some cases, prosecution, as well as tax exemptions.
Representatives of international organisations whose status is not covered by the convention tend to have limited and less clearly defined privileges.

The European Commission, the EU's executive body, said the its 143 delegations around the world had all been granted a status equivalent to that of diplomatic missions of states, and Britain was well aware of the fact.

The commission has the power to compel witnesses to appear before it and failure to obey will be a breach of law, the Constitutional Court said in a judgement posted on Twitter.
Zuma would have to obey all summons and directives issued by the commission and did not have a right to remain silent, the ruling said.
Zuma's lawyers did not immediately comment on the order. 
Zuma was removed as president in 2018, a year before his second term was due to end, amid allegations of corruption and fraud involving the presidency and collusion between several public and private companies. He has denied any wrongdoing.
The enquiry commission was set up in the same year to investigate the allegations. 
The commission, headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, applied to the Constitutional Court in November to compel Zuma to appear after he walked out during a break in proceedings. 
The Judicial Commission said in an emailed response to Reuters that it welcomed the decision, adding it was still studying the judgement.
The former president has been mostly uncooperative with the commission, and has unsuccessfully called for Zondo to recuse himself from the case.

ROME (Reuters) - Former premier Matteo Renzi, a central figure in an Italian government crisis, will meet the head of state on Thursday and tell him whether he is ready to support a new government headed by caretaker Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
Renzi triggered Conte's resignation this week when he pulled his Italia Viva party out of the ruling coalition, depriving it of a majority in the upper house Senate and throwing the country into political limbo in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.
The crisis is worrying Rome's partners and hampering its efforts to put together a recovery plan needed to obtain more than 200 billion euros ($242 billion) of European Union financing to rebuild its coronavirus-battered economy.
Renzi, whose tiny party has less than 3% of voter support, has accused Conte of lacking a strategic vision, saying he risked squandering the unprecedented EU bonanza on hand-outs rather than long-term investments.
Conte has no desire to patch things up with the man who unseated him, especially as any reconciliation would come at the price of a new policy agenda more to Renzi's liking.
But the caretaker prime minister's options are dwindling as he has so far had no success in luring unaligned and opposition senators to the government's ranks to restore his majority.
Renzi will meet president Sergio Mattarella at 5:30 p.m. local time (1630 GMT) as part of the head of state's formal consultations with party chiefs to try to resolve the crisis.
EU URGES QUICK RESOLUTION
Playing his cards close to his chest, Renzi has said so far that he has no veto on Conte returning, while attacking his handling of the economy and the COVID-19 emergency.
On Wednesday he called Conte's bid to replace Italia Viva with senators from the centre-right ranks ""a scandal,"" making it hard for the premier to accept a resurrection of the previous coalition without appearing humbled.
Conte, a lawyer with no direct political affiliation, needs to find up to 10 senators to rebuild a workable majority. 
Both the main ruling parties - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) - say they will ask Mattarella to give Conte a new mandate, but they seem unable to guarantee him a majority in both houses of parliament.
In this case, the president may designate another candidate to try to form a government to manage the Recovery Fund from the European Union in the hope that they can command more parliamentary backing than Conte.
Dissolving parliament and calling elections two years ahead of schedule would be Mattarella's last resort.
After Renzi's visit, a PD delegation will meet Mattarella at 6:30 p.m., while the consultations will end with 5-Star on Friday.
EU budget commissioner Johannes Hahn this week urged Italy to rapidly solve its crisis.
""If its politicians were to be distracted by an election campaign they couldn't concentrate on what the country needs,"" he told La Stampa newspaper.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 06:27AM ET</span>",Anger in Somalia as sons secretly sent to serve in Eritrea military force,"By Abdi Sheikh
MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Ali Jamac Dhoodi thought his son was working as a security guard in Qatar, helping prepare for next year's soccer World Cup. Then one day last April, officials from Somalia's National Intelligence Agency arrived with $10,000 in cash.
They told him his son had died - not in Qatar, but in Eritrea, one of the world's most secretive countries.
""They showed me a picture from their WhatsApp and asked me, 'do you know this picture and his full name?' I said, 'yes he is my son,'"" Dhoodi, 48, told Reuters. ""They said to me 'your son died'. I cried.""
They gave him the money, and told him not to ask questions.
Ali's son was one of three young Somali men whose families told Reuters they had been recruited by Somalia's federal government for jobs in Qatar, only to surface in Eritrea, where they were sent to serve in a military force against their will. Two other families said their sons had simply disappeared.
The apparent secret recruitment of young Somali men for a fighting force in Eritrea is stirring public anger in Somalia, a poor country where opportunities to work abroad are eagerly sought. Protests erupted last week in the capital Mogadishu and in the towns of Guriel and Galkayo over the missing recruits.
Reports that Eritrean forces have taken part in fighting that broke out in November last year in neighbouring northern Ethiopia - which Eritrea and Ethiopia strongly deny - have led some Somalis to worry their sons may have been sent there.
Asked if Eritrea had recruited Somalis, trained them or sent them to Ethiopia, Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Meskel told Reuters: ""This is ludicrous ... There is massive disinformation floating around.""
Somali government spokesman Mohamed Ibrahim and Information Minister Osman Dube did not respond to requests for comment on the Somali government's apparent role in the recruitment, but Ibrahim said no Somalis had been sent to Ethiopia.
The leaders of Somalia, Ethiopia and Eritrea have been drawing closer together since 2018, after a change of leadership in Ethiopia. Ethiopia and Eritrea, once archenemies, signed a peace deal and have regular high level visits. Somalia - which once accused Eritrea of supporting Islamist rebels - now has friendly relations with its president. 
'A BULLET IS THE REPLY'
Hussein Warsame said his son Sadam, 21, had been recruited for a security job in Qatar in October, 2019. Nothing was heard from him for more than a year. Finally, last November, he phoned from Eritrea.
""We were all shocked to land in Eritrea. We thought we were being flown to Qatar,"" he quoted his son as telling him. ""Dad, there is no life here, I have not seen food save a lump or slice of bread since I left Somalia in 2019, and when recruits demonstrate or reject orders, a bullet is the reply.""
Sahra Abdikadir, whose son Aqil Hassan Abdi disappeared in 2019 under similar circumstances, told Reuters that he had called in January and said he was in a camp in an unknown location in Eritrea.
Eritrea, a heavily militarised society, has never held elections, has no independent media and forces its citizens into indefinate government service. Former guerrilla leader Isaias Afwerki has been president since 1993.
Somalia has had only limited central government rule since 1991.
Both countries have a history of decades of conflict in the Horn of Africa region, often involving their much larger neighbour Ethiopia.
A regional security analyst who asked not to be identified told Reuters he had learned from conversations with Somali security officials that about 1,000 Somalis had been recruited and taken to Eritrea in at least three groups. One group had returned to Somalia, the second group was unreachable and the third was still in Eritrea.

Reuters was unable to confirm those details.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea and the United States should seek an initial denuclearisation deal that includes a halt to the North's nuclear activity and a cut in its programme in exchange for some sanctions relief, South Korea's prime minister said on Thursday. 
Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun, in his first interview with a foreign media outlet since taking office a year ago, told Reuters that ""creative"" thinking and mutual incentives were needed to get negotiations going again and prevent another breakdown. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former U.S. President Donald Trump promised to build new relations and work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula at their first summit in 2018, but a second summit and ensuing working-level talks fell apart.
North Korea had offered to dismantle its main nuclear complex in exchange for the lifting of major U.N. sanctions but the United States said North Korea should also hand over its nuclear weapons and bomb fuel.
""We can begin with a freeze in all nuclear activities and reduction of some of their programme,"" Chung said. ""It would be best if we could get rid of all of it, once and for all, but it's not easy and we need an alternative."" 
The new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden has not announced any new policy for North Korea. Biden said in a presidential debate in October he would meet Kim only if he agreed to ""draw down"" North Korea's nuclear capacity.
Chung said limited sanctions relief could help revive and sustain the momentum of any talks as that was the most attractive incentive for North Korea.
""South Korea and the United States know what North Korea wants,"" he said.
MORE COVID SHOTS NEEDED
Chung's remarks came days after South Korea's President Moon Jae-in called for new U.S. President Joe Biden to build on progress made by Kim and Trump.
But it was the first time a South Korean official offered details about a potential interim deal that both sides should pursue.
Chung said the Biden administration might implement a new policy but it had shown interest in the North Korea issue and would ultimately seek talks.
South Korea plans to hold in-depth discussions with new U.S. officials soon on how to revive the negotiations and whether the allies should postpone or scale back annual joint military exercises which North Korea has long condemned as preparation for war. 
""Everyone knows that the problem cannot be solved without dialogue,"" Chung said. ""Our job is to come up with creative ideas so that talks will be held as quickly as possible.""
Chung is dubbed South Korea's coronavirus czar, overseeing an aggressive testing and tracing campaign that made the country a global success story when others grappled with surging infections and imposed lockdowns. 
But South Korea has been struggling to stamp down its third and largest wave of outbreaks, with severe hospital bed shortages, though daily cases have halved after peaking at around 1,200 last month.
""Finding the right balance between anti-virus efforts and the economy is a tough task, and we went through twists and turns as we adjusted distancing,"" Chung said. 
South Korea on Thursday unveiled its plans to begin vaccinating its 52 million population starting next month. It has secured sufficient doses for 56 million people. [L1N2K30CH]
The government had decided to procure more vaccines due to the uncertainty over the length of immunity, Chung said. 
""You might need another shot when the next winter comes,"" he said. 

""We will hopefully have achieved herd immunity and people have normal life back by then. I know that's a rosy picture but least we know more about the enemy now.""

Walter Luebcke, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, was found dead in a pool of blood outside his house in the western state of Hesse in June 2019. He had been shot in the head at close range.
The court convicted the defendant, Stephan Ernst, of the homicide of Luebcke in Hesse by shooting him on the night of June 1-2 2019. 
""The accused was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Dr. Luebcke,"" the Higher Regional Court in Frankfurt said on its official Twitter account. 

Luebcke was a figure of hate for the far-right because of his outspoken support for Merkel's decision in 2015 to open Germany's doors to hundreds of thousand of migrants and asylum seekers, many of them fleeing conflicts in the Middle East and beyond.

CASCAIS, Portugal (Reuters) - COVID-19 patient Joao Cordeiro has beaten the virus and is about to go home, and his children also made quick recoveries from the disease. But his family's battle with an epidemic that is raging across Portugal is far from over.
Cordeiro's wife remains at the Cascais Hospital outside Lisbon, fighting for her life in the emergency unit a few floors below the room he was treated in.
""She is down there with pneumonia and everything,"" said the visibly tired 48-year-old, relieved to be discharged after weeks in hospital but dismayed at the prospect of leaving her behind. 
""I'm afraid ... I want her to get better.""
The Cordeiros are among the nearly 250,000 people infected with the coronavirus in Portugal so far this month, and the country has the world's highest seven-day average of daily cases and deaths per million.
Watching news on TV about the impact of the pandemic, Cordeiro had a simple message for his compatriots: ""Be careful. This (virus) can affect anyone.""
Portugal's epidemic has entered a ""terrible"" phase, Prime Minister Antonio Costa admitted on Wednesday, and the surge in cases has left hospitals on the brink of collapse.
Some are running out of beds, others' oxygen supplies are dwindling and, with doctors and nurses also over-stretched, military medics have been drafted in from Germany to offer help. 
Like elsewhere, staff at Cascais are exhausted and sometimes struggle to stay motivated. ""There is no end in sight,"" one nurse mumbled after removing her personal protective equipment (PPE).
That uncertainty is also taking a toll on their mental health, said the hospital's clinical chief, Nuno Côrte-Real. 
""The psychological well-being is the big challenge now because everyone can handle an adverse situation if they know it will end,"" he said. ""Not knowing when this will end is very stressful."" 
'CLOSE TO LIMIT'
Cascais has 16 intensive care unit beds for coronavirus patients. They are all occupied. And whenever there is a free spot, it is quickly filled. 
""We hope we are approaching the peak of this wave,"" Côrte-Real said. ""But we are very close to the hospital's capacity limit."" 
Across Portugal's health service, 830 ICU beds have been allocated to COVID-19 patients out of a total of 1,200. Currently 783 COVID-19 patients are in ICUs. 
Large military health units in Lisbon and Porto have stepped in to help. 
""We can handle it for a few weeks but if it takes too long (for the situation to improve) we won't be able to,"" Côrte-Real said.
Nearby, a nurse was helping a shocked visitor put on protective gear so she could visit a family member for what could be a final goodbye. But it's not all tears. 
Other staff, trying to keep coronavirus patients in good spirits, could be heard laughing or telling jokes - and sending patients home, COVID-free, gives everyone a lift. 
For nursing department chief Dulce Gonçalves, the process of regaining control needs to begin long before then, however. ""It is not (only) in the hospital where there's a battle,"" she said. ""It is in everyone's home.""

Echoing those sentiments, hospital president Jose Bento added: ""Together - hospitals, politicians, the general public - we will be able to win this fight. That's our hope.""

Under the old normal, Chinese railway stations would be swarming with travellers jostling to collect tickets and scrambling to board trains bound for distant provinces where many reunite with family to celebrate, in the world's biggest annual human migration event.
But with northern China fighting clusters of COVID-19 infections and several cities under lockdown, authorities - fearful of a super transmission event - are discouraging people from leaving town during the New Year season, which runs between Jan. 28 and March 8 this year. 
On Thursday the public appeared to be heeding those warnings.
""It's the first time I see a station like this - almost empty,"" said programmer Wu Dongyang, 27. 
Around 3 billion trips are normally made during what is known as the Spring Festival travel rush.
Officials forecast about 1.15 billion trips this year, down 20% from early 2020 when the epidemic started to spread from the inland Chinese city of Wuhan, and falling 60% from 2019. 
To further dissuade travel, authorities have allowed plane tickets for trips between Jan. 28 and March 8 to be cancelled at no charge.
On Thursday, as of midday, 7,638 flights across China had been scrapped, or nearly 52% of all scheduled flights, according to aviation data provider Variflight. 
For workers sacrificing their family unions and staying put, some companies are offering additional wages and even free entertainment. 
But not all have it easy. 
Yang, a 39-year-old Shandong native who works in the Beijing services sector, said she had to stay at her company's dormitory and not at her own flat, and be tested for COVID-19 every two weeks. 

While her company did not restrict her movements within Beijing, Yang was reluctant to go out, especially for meals with others. ""The location of my phone is being tracked,"" she said.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan's Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the release of an Islamist convicted of beheading U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl, a decision that has left his family in ""complete shock"", lawyers said. 
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was the main suspect in the 2002 kidnapping and murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl, was acquitted by a panel of three judges.
""By a majority of two to one, they have acquitted all the accused persons and ordered their release,"" a provincial advocate general, Salman Talibuddin, told Reuters.
Pearl, 38, was investigating Islamist militants in Karachi after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States when he was kidnapped.
His case grabbed headlines globally after a video of his beheading emerged weeks after he was abducted.
Sheikh and his co-accused are to be released immediately if they aren't required in any other case, the head of the court panel, Justice Mushir Alam, said in a short court order. 
A high court last year commuted the death penalty of the British-born Sheikh into a life sentence and acquitted his three co-accused, citing lack of evidence.
The government and Pearl's parents challenged that decision and pleaded to the Supreme Court to reinstate the death penalty.
The Supreme Court turned down both pleas on Thursday.
The United States had said that it may seek to try Sheikh if efforts to keep him in prison failed.
The Pearl family was in ""complete shock"", the family's lawyer, Faisal Siddiqi, told Reuters, adding that the court decision was a travesty of justice. 

""No amount of injustice will defeat our resolve to fight for justice for Daniel Pearl,"" he said.

The case against Volkov, currently outside Russia, is part of a police crackdown targeting Navalny's allies after tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand the Kremlin release Navalny from jail. 
A court at 1100 GMT later on Thursday is due to hear an appeal into the jailing of Navalny, who is serving a 30-day stint for alleged parole violations which he denies.
The Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, accused Volkov in a statement of urging teenagers to take part in what it said were illegal protests on Saturday.
A protest monitor has said that police detained close to 4,000 people at the demonstrations in Moscow and dozens of other cities after saying they were unauthorised. 
The Interfax news agency cited a source on Thursday as saying that police had detained a fugitive 20-year-old Chechen man who was shown brawling violently with riot police in footage of Saturday's protests.
Navalny's supporters plan to hold new rallies this Sunday which the authorities have also declared illegal. 

Late on Wednesday, police carried out mass searches at the homes of Navalny's supporters and other properties linked to him, detaining several people, including his brother Oleg for allegedly breaching COVID-19 safety restrictions.

1141,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 04:05AM ET</span>",Polls shows Hong Kong residents' distrust of Chinese vaccines,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong people are less trusting of Chinese novel coronavirus vaccines than those made in Europe and the United States, with fewer than 30% of people questioned in a survey finding China’s Sinovac vaccine acceptable.
The survey by the University of Hong Kong, in which up to 1,000 people were polled this month, showed that general acceptance of vaccines in the Chinese special administrative region was low, with only 46% likely to take a COVID-19 vaccine.
Trust was significantly lower in the Sinovac vaccine, with 29.5% of respondents accepting it compared with 56% of people who would take one produced by Germany's BioNTech and 35% who would take one produced by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and Oxford University.
Hong Kong's government has ordered 7.5 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine and said it would be the first to arrive in the Asian financial hub, in January.
But the arrival of the vaccine has since been delayed and the government said it is waiting for more clinical information.
Before the pandemic arrived in Hong Kong in January 2020, the former British colony was roiled by months of anti-government and anti-China protests driven by a perception that Beijing was pushing the semi-autonomous city onto a more authoritarian path.
""How do you repair a trust deficit? I think there’s no quick and easy way,” Professor Gabriel Leung, dean of the University of Hong Kong's medical school, told a press briefing on the survey results, referring to the Sinovac vaccine.
""I think there is only one way, and that’s openness and really allowing science to lead.""
Hong Kong formally approved use of a Fosun Pharma-BioNTech vaccine on Monday, the first vaccine to be accepted in the city. The first batch of one million doses is expected to arrive in the second half of February.
Hong Kong has secured a total of 22.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Fosun Pharma-BioNTech, Sinovac and Oxford-AstraZeneca, the city government leader Carrie Lam said in December.
Fosun Pharma is German drug manufacturer BioNTech's partner in Greater China and is responsible for the cold-chain management, storage and distribution. The vaccines are being manufactured in Germany.

Hong Kong has largely managed to keep the coronavirus under control. It has had 10,283 cases and 174 deaths over the past year.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal is in a terrible phase of the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said, warning that it would be some weeks before things might start to improve and only limited help could be expected from abroad.
With a total of 668,951 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 11,305 deaths, including a record 293 dead on Wednesday, Portugal has the world's highest seven-day average of new daily cases and deaths per million inhabitants.
The situation was not ""bad"", it was ""terrible"", Costa told the TVI broadcaster overnight. 
""There is no point in feeding the illusion that we are not facing the worst moment,"" he said. ""And we'll face this worst moment for a few more weeks, that is for sure.""
More than 20 ambulances with COVID-19 patients queued outside Portugal's largest hospital on Wednesday evening as they waited for beds to become available, while doctors in other hospitals warned of a risk of the oxygen support system collapsing.
Costa said the situation had worsened partly because his government relaxed restrictive measures between Christmas and the end of the year, but also due to the virulence of a new variant of the virus first detected in Britain.
""There were certainly errors: often the way I transmitted the message to the Portuguese ... and, when the recipient of the message did not understand the message, then it is the messenger's fault, I have no doubt about it,"" he said.
OUTSIDE HELP
Germany said on Wednesday that it was sending military medical experts to Portugal to see what kind of support it could bring.
But Costa warned there was only so much Germany and other European partners could do, adding that ""one should be cautious"" about the idea of sending patients to foreign countries - like Germany, for instance, did last year with patients just across the border in France.
""It is different for a country which has a geographical position like Portugal - between the Atlantic and Spain - than for a country that is at the centre of Europe with borders with several countries and therefore where cross-border collaboration is much more common and much easier.""
Regarding possible German aid, he said: ""In everything Portugal has asked for, unfortunately they have no availability, namely doctors, nurses. They have ventilators, but at the moment we don't need it because we have enough.""

In a rare note of hope, he did add that the lockdown measures decided last week should, in principle, start having an impact on contagion numbers next week.

The group's annual report on business leaders' perceptions of corruption - which gave the United States a score of 67 out of 100, down from 69 in 2019 - also cited weak oversight of the country's $1 trillion COVID-19 relief package.
That put the United States behind Bhutan and Uruguay in 25th place, down from 23rd in 2019. 
Referring to alleged conflicts of interest and abuse of office at the highest level, it described what it called the U.S. president's attempts to pressure election officials and incite violence in order to change certified vote counts as ""among the most serious departures from ethical democratic practice.""
Denmark and New Zealand continued to top the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), both with 88 points, while Syria, Somalia and South Sudan are still at the bottom.
Delia Ferreira Rubio, who chairs the global civil society group, said the COVID-19 pandemic was also a corruption crisis.
""The past year has tested governments like no other in memory, and those with higher levels of corruption have been less able to meet the challenge,"" she said in a statement.
Transparency International noted that Uruguay, with the highest score in Latin America, invests heavily in health care, which has helped its response to COVID-19, while low-ranked Bangladesh has seen corruption flourish during the pandemic.
It also said that countries with more corruption had shown the worst record on the rule of law during the crisis, including the Philippines, where it said the response to COVID-19 had brought major attacks on human rights and media freedom.

The group said that 26 countries had significantly improved their scores since 2012, including Ecuador, Greece, Guyana, Myanmar and South Korea.

Haswani was named by Reuters and other media outlets this month after it emerged that a company he owned, Hesco Engineering and Construction Company Ltd, maintained its corporate register at the same London address as British firm, Savaro Ltd. The Mozambican firm that ordered the fertiliser, FEM, has said it ordered the shipment through Savaro. 
Speaking to Reuters at his Damascus home, Haswani said he had employed the same Cypriot agency, Interstatus, to register his company that also registered Savaro, and the agent had shifted the location of the registers to the same address on the same day.
But he said he knew nothing about Savaro, and suggested any links between it and his own company were purely a coincidence arising from using the same agent. As previously reported, Reuters could not determine whether Haswani had any involvement with Savaro.
""I don't know what other companies are registered by this Cypriot company, five or three or 70 or more,"" Haswani said. 
""It is a fabricated media whirlwind,"" Haswani told Reuters of reports suggesting he might have been implicated in the blast. ""We don't know Savaro and we hadn't heard about them before this.""
Interstatus did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
The boss of Interstatus, Marina Psyllou, is listed in Savaro's registration documents as Savaro's owner and sole director, but has denied being the firm's true owner.
She told Reuters last week that the firm's beneficial owner was someone else, whom she declined to identify. She has said Savaro was a dormant company that had never conducted business. 
Haswani said he had not been contacted by any investigators from Lebanon or any other country in relation to the blast, and that he would soon file a legal case in Paris against media reports linking him to it. 

""I am living my life normally and laughing because I am someone who knows well that I have nothing to do with this matter at all,"" Haswani said. ""Why would I worry?""

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - A World Health Organization-led team investigating the origins of the deadly COVID-19 pandemic left a quarantine hotel in Wuhan on Thursday to begin field work, two weeks after arriving in the Chinese city where the virus emerged in late 2019.
The mission has been plagued by delays, concerns over access and bickering between China and the United States, which has accused Beijing of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and has criticised the terms of the visit, under which Chinese experts conducted the first phase of research. 
The team left its hotel shortly after 3 p.m. (0700 GMT) without speaking to journalists, who were kept at a distance behind yellow barriers, and boarded a bus whose driver wore full protective gear.
""Slightly sad to say goodbye to my 'gym' & my 'office' where I’ve been holed up for last 2 wks!!,"" team member Peter Daszak tweeted earlier on Thursday, along with photos of exercise equipment and a desk in his hotel room.
""Moving into next phase of work now w/@WHO mission team & China counterparts,"" he said.
The luggage of the team members, which was loaded onto the bus by workers in protective suits, included several yoga mats and what appeared to be a guitar case.
The team, which worked by videoconference while in quarantine, is led by Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO's top expert on animal diseases that cross to other species, and is expected to remain in China for two more weeks.
The WHO has tried to manage expectations for the investigation.
""There are no guarantees of answers,"" WHO emergency chief Mike Ryan told reporters earlier this month. ""It is a difficult task to fully establish the origins and sometimes it can take two or three or four attempts to be able to do that in different settings.""
SCIENCE AND POLITICS
The origins of COVID-19 have been highly politicised.
The investigating team had been set to arrive in Wuhan earlier in January, and China's delay of their visit drew rare public criticism from the head of the WHO, which former U.S. President Donald Trump accused of being ""China-centric"" early in the outbreak.
China has been pushing a narrative that the virus existed abroad before it was discovered in Wuhan, with state media citing the presence of the virus on imported frozen food packaging and scientific papers claiming it had been circulating in Europe in 2019. 
China's foreign ministry has also hinted on several occasions that the sudden closure of the U.S. army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland in July 2019 was linked to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. 
A man surnamed Lei who was gathering discarded shared bicycles into a truck outside the quarantine hotel said it was not a certainty that the virus had originated in China.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 03:01AM ET</span>",Yemen 'Arab Spring' unity torn asunder by hunger and war,"SANAA/TAIZ, Yemen (Reuters) - Ten years after joining an uprising in Yemen against autocratic rule and an economy in shambles, the same activists find themselves on opposite sides of a war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine with dim prospects for peace.
Ahmed Abdo Hezam, 35, a fighter with government forces known by his nom de guerre Ahmed Abu Al-Nasr, had been a university graduate in the agro-industrial city of Taiz when he first joined youth-led protests that ended Ali Abdullah Saleh's 33-year rule.
Even back then some 40% of Yemen's population lived on less than $2 a day and a third suffered chronic hunger. Jobs were scarce and corruption rife. The state was facing a resurgent Al Qaeda wing and rebellions by the Houthis in the north and separatists in the south.
""When we joined the uprising it was like a breath of air. They tried to drag us into violence ... but we remained peaceful,"" said al-Nasr who like many resented jobs cronyism in the public sector, the biggest employer.
More than 2,000 people died in the uprising before Saleh in 2012 yielded to pressure from the United States and Gulf Arab states to step down. He was the fourth autocrat to be toppled in the ""Arab Spring"" unrest that first began in Tunisia.
Riyadh and Washington hoped former Saleh deputy Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi would improve the government's legitimacy and oversee a transition to democracy. Instead it disintegrated. 
The Houthis, enemies of Saudi Arabia and friends of Iran, partnered with erstwhile foe Saleh to seize the capital, Sanaa, and ousted Hadi's government in late 2014, triggering a Saudi-led military coalition backed by the West to intervene.
Al-Nasr, a poet with four children, joined government forces when the Houthis, who later killed Saleh when he turned on them, entered Taiz, which is still effectively under siege.
""We did not think the uprising would lead to this,"" said al-Nasr, who has seen comrades die, his home destroyed and family scatter. ""We were forced to take up arms to defend ourselves.""
""I hope with all my heart the war ends...that weapons are laid down and all factions sit at the table.""
SELF-DETERMINATION
The war has killed more than 100,000 people and pushed millions to the verge of starvation. Now 80% of the population, or some 24 million, need help and are vulnerable to disease, first cholera and now COVID-19.
Ali al-Dailami, a rights defender briefly detained under Saleh's rule who is now Houthi deputy minister of human rights, joined the uprising in ""Change Square"" in Sanaa in the hopes it would lead to a state representing all.
Speaking to Reuters in the square, al-Dailami recalled the early days of the revolution, and lamented its results. 
""At times we thought we would not live to see the sun rise because of the threats and (pro-Saleh) soldiers and hoodlums,"" he said. ""We wanted to move from a failed state, we wanted to break the impasse."" 
He saw the Gulf initiative that ushered in Hadi as interference that ""killed the revolution's principles"".
""We wanted real change, not to repackage the old system as democracy.""
Dejected, Dailami left Sanaa for Cairo but returned as the Saudi-led coalition bombarded and blockaded Yemen, killing thousands of civilians and exacerbating hunger.
Once rebels largely kept at bay, the Houthis now hold northern Yemen, from where they have repeatedly attacked Saudi cities with missiles and drones. The government is based in the south where separatist seek more power.
WEST MUST ACT
Rights advocate Tawakkol Karman, a 2011 Nobel Peace Prize winner for her role in Arab Spring protests, was abroad when the Houthis seized Sanaa and has not returned. She is a vocal critic of the group and of the Saudi-led coalition, accusing them of repressing democratic change in the region.
""After the revolution we lived three of the most beautiful years ever...we were days away from the referendum of the constitution and holding multiple elections,"" she said, blaming the Houthi coup, the war and Western inaction for what followed.
Karman urged new U.S. President Joe Biden to ""fulfil his commitment and his promises to end this war in Yemen"" and to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia and its ally the United Arab Emirates.
In the southern port of Aden, civil engineer Waddah al-Hariri, 49, hopes the United Nations can revive stalled peace talks. He has moved his family to Hodeidah, then Sanaa and back to Aden to escape fighting.
A member of the Socialist Party that ruled South Yemen before unification with the North under Saleh in 1990, he believes the aims of the uprising he joined are still possible.

""Building peace is the priority now, and then a new constitution,"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Thursday it would begin COVID-19 vaccinations for the general public in the third quarter but review the use of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN)'s vaccine to the elderly because of limited efficacy data overseas.
Health authorities will expand vaccinations towards the second half of the year with an aim to reach herd immunity by November, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) director Jeong Eun-kyeong told a news briefing.
Inoculations would begin in February starting with key groups, including around 50,000 medical workers in the front line of coronavirus treatment, the elderly and staff in nursing homes, Jeong said.
AstraZeneca denied media reports this week that its vaccine is not very effective for people over 65, saying a strong immune response to the vaccine had been shown in blood analysis of elderly trial participants.
South Korea plans to vaccinate a 1.3 million priority group in the first quarter and 9 million people over 65 years of age and remaining medical staff by the second quarter, followed by the general population starting in July.
The country has designated about 250 large indoor gyms and community halls nationwide to vaccinate people with  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines that require cold chain storage, an interior ministry official told reporters.
For inoculations using vaccines from AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson’s Janseen which do not require ultra cold storage, authorities designated 13,317 hospitals and clinics nationwide.
South Korea has mobilised 57 military units as well as police and fire personnel to transport and escort the vaccines for distribution.
""We plan to revise the order of the immunisation plan depending on the situation of the time of COVID-19 transmission and the timeline of vaccine arrivals,"" Jeong said.
South Korea has secured 106 million doses to allow for coverage of 56 million people, more than the 52 million residents of the country.
It has deals with four drugmakers - AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen, Moderna Inc and the World Health Organization-backed global COVAX scheme.
SK bioscience, a drugmaker unit of SK Chemicals, will manage the transport of the Pfizer, J&J (NYSE:JNJ) and AstraZeneca vaccines, Jeong said.
The KDCA reported 497 daily new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday. The total number of infections reported in the country now stands at 76,926, with the death toll of 1,386.

Nearly half of infections in South Korea over the past year were caused by cluster infections emerging from specific close-knit groups, including religious facilities and nursing homes.

BLEAN WOODS, England (Reuters) - Conservationists in England are looking for the country's first ever rangers to look after European bison, Europe's largest land mammal, which is being introduced to Kent more than 15,000 years after its ancestors roamed the landscape.
    Kent Wildlife Trust and the Wildwood Trust are bringing a small herd of the animals to Blean Woods near Canterbury in Kent, the south-eastern county known as the Garden of England, to help naturally manage the habitat.
    ""These will be the first bison rangers in the UK probably ever,"" said Stan Smith, wilder landscapes manager at Kent Wildlife Trust. ""We've never had European Bison here in the past.""
    The ideal applicant would need to understand animal behaviour, he said, but they were not expected to have worked with bison before, ""because you can't until now"".
    The bison, which will come from the Netherlands, Romania or Poland, will be kept in a near wild state, he said, helping to manage the woodland by their unique ability to fell trees by rubbing up against them and eating the bark, creating space for other species to thrive.
    ""They are ecosystem engineers, they can manage habitats in a way no other animals can,"" he said. 
    ""They will be in our woodland with other species like Exmoor ponies, longhorn cows and iron age pigs.""
    Vicki Breakell, conservation officer at the Wildwood Trust, said steppe bison were native to Britain until about 15,000 to 18,000 years ago when they became extinct.  
    ""The European bison is the closet living relative to what was here historically,"" she said.
    The bison will live in a semi-wild state in a fenced area of the 500 hectare site, she said, adding that roaming bison were not a possibility in the crowded south-east corner of England. 
    If not a stampede, there has certainly been a rush of applicants for the two jobs.

    ""We've had hundreds and hundreds of applications,"" Smith said. ""We've had loads of creative applications... people seem to be really really excited by this idea.""

1149,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2021 02:35AM ET</span>",Ghislaine Maxwell denied seeing Jeffrey Epstein being massaged in New York,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of Jeffrey Epstein, has testified she never saw him receive massages from anyone other than herself at his home in New York, where prosecutors are pursuing criminal charges that she helped the late financier procure underage girls for sex.
The denial came in a July 2016 deposition that Maxwell gave in a long-settled civil defamation lawsuit against her by Virginia Giuffre, one of dozens of women who have accused Epstein of sexual misconduct.
More than 100 documents from that lawsuit were made public late on Wednesday night in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
Lawyers for Maxwell could not immediately be contacted for comment outside business hours.
Maxwell gave the deposition after Giuffre's lawyers deemed the British socialite uncooperative during earlier questioning, where she rejected suggestions she saw Epstein have sex with girls or helped arrange illegal sexual encounters.
In response to questions from Giuffre's lawyer David Boies, Maxwell said she had seen people give Epstein massages at his homes in Palm Beach, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
She said she believed all were professional masseuses, and that Epstein ""never had clothes on"" when being massaged.
Asked if anything led her to believe she no longer wanted to be around Epstein, she said: ""I ceased to be happy in the job and I ceased to be happy spending time with Mr. Epstein."" Maxwell said Epstein had become ""more difficult to work with.""
Portions of the testimony were redacted after U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska, who ordered the documents' release, said the more ""prurient"" details about Maxwell's own sex life could be kept secret.
The redactions included 20 lines of testimony that Maxwell's lawyers have said are the basis for a perjury charge in her criminal case, and which if disclosed could undermine her constitutional right to a fair trial.
Giuffre wants that testimony made public. Preska, who delayed releasing that testimony after Maxwell's lawyers objected, has yet to rule.
Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom three underage girls for sex in the mid-1990s, and lying about her involvement under oath.
Her trial is scheduled for July 12. Earlier this week, Maxwell asked the judge in the criminal case to dismiss the indictment on several grounds, including that she was shielded by Epstein's 2007 non-prosecution agreement.
Epstein agreed to plead guilty the following year to Florida state prostitution charges, register as a sex offender, and accept a 13-month jail sentence. That punishment is now widely regarded as too lenient. 
Among the other materials released on Wednesday were documents referring to Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law School professor who Giuffre has said Epstein forced her to have sex with.
Dershowitz has denied her claims, and he and Giuffre have been suing each other for defamation.
Maxwell is being held at a federal jail in Brooklyn, and has been denied bail twice following her arrest last July.

Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

Blinken made the remarks in a call with Philippine Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin, the U.S. State Department said in a statement, in which he also stressed the importance of a long-standing defense agreement between the allies and its clear application if Manila came under attack in the South China Sea.
""Secretary Blinken pledged to stand with Southeast Asian claimants in the face of PRC pressure,"" it said, referring to the People's Republic of China.
""Secretary Blinken stressed the importance of the Mutual Defense Treaty for the security of both nations, and its clear application to armed attacks against the Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in the Pacific, which includes the South China Sea,"" it said.
Blinken's assurances came after Locsin said on Wednesday the Philippines had filed a diplomatic protest over China's passing of a law allowing its coastguard to open fire on foreign vessels, describing it as a ""threat of war"".
China passed the legislation on Friday allowing its coastguard to use ""all necessary means"" to stop or prevent threats from foreign vessels, including demolishing other countries' structures built on Chinese-claimed reefs.
China claims almost all of the energy-rich South China Sea, which is also a major trade route. The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.
The United States, which has accused China of taking advantage of the distraction of the coronavirus pandemic to advance its presence in the South China Sea, has sent a carrier group through the waterway to promote ""freedom of the seas"".
China on Tuesday said it would hold military drills of its own this week. 
A spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte said on Monday the Philippines hoped no country would do anything to increase tension.

The State Department said Blinken, who took office this week in Democratic President Joe Biden's administration, ""underscored that the United States rejects China’s maritime claims in the South China Sea to the extent they exceed the maritime zones that China is permitted to claim under international law.""

""Foreign Minister Ashkenazi and Secretary Blinken acknowledged the steadfast partnership between the United States and Israel, and that the two countries would work closely together on challenges ahead,"" it said.
The so-called Abraham Accords is a U.S.-brokered agreement to normalize diplomatic ties between Israel and Arab and Muslim countries. In the past few months, Israel reached deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco as part of the accords.

While U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to move U.S. foreign policy away from Trump's ""America First"" posture, the Democrat has indicated he would continue with the pursuit of the Abraham Accords.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Chicago teachers' union told its members on Wednesday to remain at home and vowed further job actions if the district moved to discipline them, delaying a staggered reopening of schools that began earlier this month. 
Pre-school and special education students, who had returned to classrooms on Jan. 11, were told there would be no school on Thursday. And the return next week of some 70,000 elementary and middle school students to in-person teaching is now in question. 
Chicago Public Schools, the nation's third-largest school district, has been trying to reopen its classrooms after students had been kept home for months by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The district, which oversees 355,000 students, ordered 10,000 teachers back to work on Wednesday despite a vote by 71% of union members to keep teaching remotely until a stronger health and safety agreement is reached. 
""Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) leadership continues to direct their members who support pre-k and cluster programs to remain at home. Therefore, we must ask parents to continue keeping your children home as we are unable to guarantee adequate staffing levels to cover in-person learning,"" the district said in a message to families on Wednesday evening. 
On Sunday, Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson warned that if teachers do not report to their schools on Wednesday, it would be construed as an illegal strike. 
""We have got to put our children first and schools are such an important part of who they are, a community's identity,"" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at an afternoon news conference, making her case for schools to be reopened. 
'STOP THE SHOUTING'
Miranda Byrd Jameson, an attorney with two children in the Chicago school district, said both sides have lost her trust and that she believes neither have the best interest of children and teachers at heart. 
""It is time for both organizations to put the political differences aside, stop the public shouting contest and start working together in good faith on behalf of our children and teachers,"" she told Reuters. 
""Another strike, legal or illegal, hurts our kids even more.""
The possible work stoppage in Chicago comes 15 months after the city's teachers staged an 11-day strike over overcrowded classrooms, support staff levels and pay. 
In a message to teachers on Tuesday night, the union said if the district takes action against teachers who did not report, members will stop working altogether on Thursday and picket, the Chicago Tribune reported. CTU President Jesse Sharkey said if the district took any disciplinary action, union delegates would decide whether to set a strike date. 
The district had also canceled in-person classes on Wednesday for 6,500 pre-kindergarten and special education students who were given the option to take classes in their school as part of the CPS's reopening plan. 
The teachers' union says classrooms lack proper ventilation and that the district has failed to provide cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment. The district says ventilation meets industry standards for classroom learning and that it would provide schools with adequate PPE. 
The union has urged school and city officials to move quickly to vaccinate teachers. Inoculations are expected to begin in mid-February. 

The district said on Wednesday in its latest proposal that it has offered to make accommodations for those teachers who have family members with medical conditions, and that it has expanded testing and prioritized vaccines for staff working in the hard-hit areas of the city.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Treating China as a ""strategic rival"" of the United States is a misjudgement that could lead to mistakes, China's ambassador to the United States said in a speech to an online forum.
Since the Trump administration defined China as a strategic rival in 2018, Washington and Beijing have frequently clashed over issues ranging from trade to Beijing's handling of the coronavirus, and the new administration of President Joe Biden is expected to maintain pressure on China.
In the first major speech by a Chinese official on relations between the world's two biggest economies since Biden took office, Ambassador Cui Tiankai reasserted China's long-standing position of seeking peaceful coexistence with the United States, while warning it not to cross China's red lines.
""Treating China as a strategic rival and imaginary enemy would be a huge strategic misjudgement,"" Cui told the forum that took place late on Wednesday, U.S. time, Thursday in Beijing.
""To develop any policy on the basis of that would only lead to grave strategic mistakes.""
Cui stressed that China wanted cooperation, not confrontation, and called for both sides to address differences through dialogue. But he also said China would not yield on matters concerning sovereignty and territorial integrity.
""China will not back down. We hope the United States will respect China's core interest and refrain from crossing the red line,"" Cui said.
Hong Kong, the western region of Xinjiang, the South China Sea and Taiwan were points of intensifying contention between China and the United States during the Trump administration.
With the Biden administration expected to take a more multilateral approach to China, Cui warned that a coalition of allies against China could create ""new imbalances"".

He said China welcomed Biden's decisions to rejoin the Paris climate agreement and the World Health Organization, and said China hoped to work with the United States on fighting the coronavirus pandemic and on global policy coordination to fend off economic and financial risk.

The boy, an unnamed Christian of Indian ethnicity, had purchased a tactical vest online and had intended to also buy a machete at the time of his arrest in December, the Internal Security Department (ISD) said in a statement on Wednesday.
He had conducted reconnaissance of the mosques near his home, intended to livestream his attack and prepared statements that referenced Christchurch attacker Brenton Tarrant who is serving life imprisonment for killing 51 Muslim worshippers and injuring dozens of others on March 15, 2019.
""He could only foresee two outcomes to his plan: that he is arrested before he is able to carry out the attacks, or he executes the plan and is thereafter killed by the Police,"" the ISD said, adding he planned to carry out the attack on the anniversary of the Christchurch killings. 
The boy is the youngest person to be detained under Singapore's colonial-era Internal Security Act, which allows authorities to detain anyone seen as a threat to security for up to two years. 
He is also the first in the low crime island nation to be detained for far-right extremist ideology, while there have been a number of cases involving Islamic extremism including a 17-year-old arrested for supporting Islamic State last year.
It was not immediately clear for how long the 16-year-old would be detained. Home Minister K. Shanmugam said on Wednesday that he would be given psychological counselling and will be able to continue his education while in detention but may not face criminal charges.

""It would be said in a court of law, that he was only thinking about it. He has planned it, but he hasn't actually taken a step yet. So, in many countries, without laws similar to the Internal Security Act, you can't move early until there is some further act of preparation,"" Shanmugam told local broadcaster ChannelNewsAsia.

DENVER (Reuters) - Three teenage boys were arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of murder and arson stemming from a house fire last year that killed a family of five Senegalese immigrants, including two small children, police said.
Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen said the three juveniles were being held for investigation on nearly two dozen charges, including five counts of first-degree murder, three counts of attempted first-degree murder and eight counts of first-degree arson.
Besides the five victims who perished in the blaze, three people inside the house escaped the flames by leaping from an upstairs window, police said.
Pazen declined to name the suspects, a 16-year-old boy and two other boys 15 years of age, because they are minors and have not been formally charged. All three were taken into custody in neighboring Jefferson County.
The Aug. 5, 2020, fire deaths shook members of Denver's ethnic Senegalese community who feared the family whose house burned may have been targeted because they were Muslim immigrants from the West African nation.
The case garnered widespread media attention, and police early on released surveillance photos of three masked individuals wearing hooded sweatshirts who investigators believed set the home ablaze.
At a news conference on Wednesday, Pazen declined to offer a possible motive for the alleged arson attack other than to say investigators lacked evidence of a ""bias-motivated crime.”
The deadly blaze erupted in the early morning hours in the city’s Green Valley Ranch neighborhood, killing Djibril and Adja Diol and the couple’s 2-year-old daughter, Khadija. The blaze also claimed the lives of the husband's sister, Hassan Diol, and her infant daughter, Hawa Baye.
The police chief was joined at the news conference by Papa Dia, an immigrant from Senegal and a family friend.

“We are grateful but still in pain,” Dia said. “Arrests have been made, but we know it’s not going to bring these beautiful people back.”

Security forces fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who threw stones, hurled Molotov cocktails and lit a car on fire, a witness and police said. Dozens were wounded.
The police did not immediately comment on whether live rounds had been fired. Reuters footage showed sparks hitting the ground, apparently from ricocheting bullets, and the sound of gunfire.
It marked the third night of violence in a row in one of Lebanon's poorest cities, where protesters railed against a strict lockdown that they say has left them with no means to survive the country's economic collapse.
The government imposed a 24-hour curfew earlier this month in a bid to curb a raging COVID-19 outbreak that has killed more than 2,500 people. 
Aid workers warn that with little to no aid, the lockdown piles extra hardship on the poor, now more than half the population. Many rely on daily wages.
The financial meltdown, which crashed the currency, poses the greatest risk to Lebanon's stability since its 1975-1990 civil war. 
""People are tired. There's poverty, misery, lockdown and there's no work... Our problem is the politicians,"" said Samir Agha at the Tripoli protest before clashes erupted on Wednesday night.
The Red Cross said rescuers treated at least 67 people for injuries and took 35 others to hospital. The state news agency said 226 protesters and police were wounded.
Lebanon's Internal Security Forces wrote in a tweet that ""hand grenades"" were thrown and injured nine officers. They pledged to respond to rioters with ""full severity and decisiveness."" 
Earlier on Wednesday, caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab said the lockdown was necessary to contain the virus. He acknowledged that government aid was not enough to cover needs but said it would help ""reduce the burdens."" 
The COVID-19 response has also triggered anger in Beirut, where infections reached some of the region's highest levels and many ICU wards are full.

The surge has overwhelmed hospitals, already struggling with dollar shortages and some damaged by an August port explosion. Diab's cabinet resigned over the huge blast that devastated much of Beirut and killed 200 people.

Australian Acting Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd said the travel pause on green zone flights from New Zealand to Australia was extended until Sunday.
""This allows continuing protection of the people of Australia, while the extent of the situation in New Zealand continues to be clarified,"" Kidd told a news conference.
Australia suspended a one-way ""travel bubble"" with its trans-Tasman neighbour for 72 hours earlier this week after New Zealand confirmed its first case in months on Monday.
Since then, two people have tested positive to the South African variant of the coronavirus, and all cases are linked to the same quarantine facility in Auckland, New Zealand's largest city.
The new infections come as New Zealand was ranked the best performing in an index of almost 100 countries based on their containment of the coronavirus.
Responding to the news, a New Zealand government spokeswoman said Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ""retained confidence in our systems and processes but acknowledged the decision was for the Australian government to make.""
Under the bubble, travellers were able to arrive in Australia from New Zealand without the need to quarantine though movement in the other direction requires 14 days' quarantine.
Health authorities on Thursday conducted further tests and began contact tracing efforts on the two new cases in Auckland.
Both cases were returned travellers in hotel quarantine who were released after returning negative tests following their 14-day isolation.
They had stayed at the same hotel at the same time as the first case of coronavirus in the country in over two months that was confirmed on Monday.
New Zealand also said it would tighten rules at quarantine facilities and people will not be able to leave their rooms following their day 12 COVID test, until they depart from the facility. 
The country has largely avoided the high numbers of infections and deaths from the virus as seen in many other nations. 

The total number of active cases in New Zealand is 69. The country has had a total of 1,943 confirmed cases and 25 deaths so far.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Police in Moscow detained Oleg Navalny, the brother of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and searched the homes of the opposition politician's associates and other properties linked to him, his allies said. 
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand that the Kremlin release Alexei Navalny from jail, where he is serving a 30-day stint for alleged parole violations, which he denies.
Police had said the protests were illegal and OVD-Info, a monitoring group, said officers had detained close to 4,000 people. Navalny's allies plan to hold new rallies this Sunday.
Ivan Zhdanov, director of Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, tweeted that Oleg Navalny had been in his brother's apartment as it was being searched. 
Oleg Navalny was released from prison in 2018 after serving three-and-a-half years for an embezzlement conviction that critics say was designed to put pressure on his brother Alexei and smother dissent. Alexei Navalny was given a suspended sentence in the same case.
Zhdanov said police appeared to be conducting the searches as part of an investigation into calls to hold protests, which breached social distancing restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""They started breaking down the door,"" he tweeted.
Zhdanov later said Oleg Navalny would remain in police custody for 48 hours on suspicion of violating sanitary and epidemiological regulations.
The Interior Ministry said in a statement earlier on Wednesday it had opened criminal cases against some of the participants in last week's protests. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the searches. 
Zhdanov later added that police had detained Ilya Pakhomov, an aide to Alexei Navalny, outside the opposition politician's apartment.
Zhdanov also posted video taken at another apartment showing Yulia Navalnaya, Alexei Navalny's wife, telling police to wait for her lawyer to arrive as they banged loudly at the door. 
Navalnaya's lawyer, Veronika Polyakova, was allowed inside the apartment by police after standing outside the door for several hours. 
""It used to be that touching the family was against the code of honour,"" Polyakova tweeted. ""Now there is neither code, nor honour.""
Police also searched the home of Lyubov Sobol, an ally of Alexei Navalny who was detained at last week's protests, and the offices of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, Alexei Navalny's allies said. Photos on social media showed around 20 masked men waiting to gain entry. 
Police took Sobol in for questioning as a witness but she was later ordered to remain in police custody for 48 hours, also for allegedly violating sanitary regulations, Navalny's team said. 

Alexei Navalny has not yet returned to his home since being poisoned and almost killed in Russia last summer. Last week, he was arrested at the airport as he returned to Moscow from Germany, where was treated and recovered.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - In a temple on the outskirts of Bangkok, participants at a daily ritual clutch a bunch of flowers and lie down in a coffin with a sheet pulled over them as monks chant. 
The Wat Bangna Nai temple in the Thai capital draws more than 100 people a day who choose to perform the ceremony in the hope it can improve their fortunes or give them a fresh start. 
And for some at least, the pressures of life during the pandemic have made the ritual take on more importance. 
""I have to admit that I'm stressed these days because I am earning less income because of the pandemic and I'm sure everyone here is feeling the same,"" said Nutsarang Sihard, a 52-year-old food stall owner, who took part in the ceremony. 
Participants pay 100 baht ($3.30) for the flowers, candles, and clothing that are part of the ceremony.
They follow the instructions of the monks, by at first lying in a coffin with their heads facing to the west, the direction bodies may be buried, before switching sides to symbolise rebirth. 
""I felt like I was reborn, came back to life again and became a new person,"" said Nutsarang. 
Another participant at the ceremony, Chonlathit Nimimenwai, 23, said she attended because a fortune teller told her that her life was in danger. 
    ""It made me feel stressed. That's why I'm here today because I want to feel better."" 
Many temples in Thailand hold similar ceremonies and Prakru Prapath Waranukij, a monk who performed this ceremony, said that while the ritual had received some criticism online he felt it was important to ponder death. 
""It reminds people that one day we will die, so we must be careful about the way we live our lives,"" said Prakru.

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 08:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Proud Boys leader was ‘prolific’ informer for law enforcement,"By Aram Roston
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys extremist group, has a past as an informer for federal and local law enforcement, repeatedly working undercover for investigators after he was arrested in 2012, according to a former prosecutor and a transcript of a 2014 federal court proceeding obtained by Reuters.
In the Miami hearing, a federal prosecutor, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent and Tarrio’s own lawyer described his undercover work and said he had helped authorities prosecute more than a dozen people in various cases involving drugs, gambling and human smuggling.
Tarrio, in an interview with Reuters Tuesday, denied working undercover or cooperating in cases against others. “I don’t know any of this,” he said, when asked about the transcript. “I don’t recall any of this.”
Law-enforcement officials and the court transcript contradict Tarrio’s denial. In a statement to Reuters, the former federal prosecutor in Tarrio’s case, Vanessa Singh Johannes, confirmed that “he cooperated with local and federal law enforcement, to aid in the prosecution of those running other, separate criminal enterprises, ranging from running marijuana grow houses in Miami to operating pharmaceutical fraud schemes.”
Tarrio, 36, is a high-profile figure who organizes and leads the right-wing Proud Boys in their confrontations with those they believe to be Antifa, short for “anti-fascism,” an amorphous and often violent leftist movement. The Proud Boys were involved in the deadly insurrection at the Capitol January 6.
The records uncovered by Reuters are startling because they show that a leader of a far-right group now under intense scrutiny by law enforcement was previously an active collaborator with criminal investigators.
Washington police arrested Tarrio in early January when he arrived in the city two days before the Capitol Hill riot. He was charged with possessing two high-capacity rifle magazines, and burning a Black Lives Matter banner during a December demonstration by supporters of former President Donald Trump. The D.C. Superior Court ordered him to leave the city pending a court date in June.
Though Tarrio did not take part in the Capitol insurrection, at least five Proud Boys members have been charged in the riot. The FBI previously said Tarrio’s earlier arrest was an effort to preempt the events of January 6.
The transcript from 2014 shines a new light on Tarrio’s past connections to law enforcement. During the hearing, the prosecutor and Tarrio’s defense attorney asked a judge to reduce the prison sentence of Tarrio and two co-defendants. They had pleaded guilty in a fraud case related to the relabeling and sale of stolen diabetes test kits.
The prosecutor said Tarrio’s information had led to the prosecution of 13 people on federal charges in two separate cases, and had helped local authorities investigate a gambling ring.
Tarrio’s then-lawyer Jeffrey Feiler said in court that his client had worked undercover in numerous investigations, one involving the sale of anabolic steroids, another regarding “wholesale prescription narcotics” and a third targeting human smuggling. He said Tarrio helped police uncover three marijuana grow houses, and was a “prolific” cooperator.
In the smuggling case, Tarrio, “at his own risk, in an undercover role met and negotiated to pay $11,000 to members of that ring to bring in fictitious family members of his from another country,” the lawyer said in court.
In an interview, Feiler said he did not recall details about the case but added, “The information I provided to the court was based on information provided to me by law enforcement and the prosecutor.”
An FBI agent at the hearing called Tarrio a “key component” in local police investigations involving marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, or ecstasy. The Miami FBI office declined comment.
There is no evidence Tarrio has cooperated with authorities since then. In interviews with Reuters, however, he said that before rallies in various cities, he would let police departments know of the Proud Boys’ plans. It is unclear if this was actually the case. He said he stopped this coordination after December 12 because the D.C. police had cracked down on the group.
Tarrio on Tuesday acknowledged that his fraud sentence was reduced, from 30 months to 16 months, but insisted that leniency was provided only because he and his co-defendants helped investigators “clear up” questions about his own case. He said he never helped investigate others.
That comment contrasts with statements made in court by the prosecutor, his lawyer and the FBI. The judge in the case, Joan A. Lenard, said Tarrio “provided substantial assistance in the investigation and prosecution of other persons involved in criminal conduct.”
As Trump supporters challenged the Republican’s election loss in often violent demonstrations, Tarrio stood out for his swagger as he led crowds of mostly white Proud Boys in a series of confrontations and street brawls in Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere.
The Proud Boys, founded in 2016, began as a group protesting political correctness and perceived constraints on masculinity. It grew into a group with distinctive colors of yellow and black that embraced street fighting. In September their profile soared when Trump called on them to “Stand back and stand by.”
Tarrio, based in Miami, became the national chairman of the group in 2018.
In November and December, Tarrio led the Proud Boys through the streets of D.C. after Trump’s loss. Video shows him on December 11 with a bullhorn in front of a large crowd. “To the parasites both in Congress, and in that stolen White House,” he said. “You want a war, you got one!” The crowd roared. The next day Tarrio burned the BLM banner.
Former prosecutor Johannes said she was surprised that the defendant she prosecuted for fraud is now a key player in the violent movement that sought to halt the certification of President Joe Biden.

“I knew that he was a fraudster – but had no reason to know that he was also a domestic terrorist,” she said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state of New South Wales recorded its 11th day of zero local coronavirus cases on Thursday, allowing neighbouring Queensland state to lift border restrictions while Victoria state also hinted at relaxing travel with Sydney.
Australian states imposed quarantine or hard border restrictions for travellers from New South Wales (NSW) after an outbreak in Sydney in late December, throwing Christmas holiday plans of thousands of Australians into chaos.
The Sydney clusters have now been curbed, giving other states the confidence to reopen borders. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said her state would welcome NSW residents from Feb.1.
""I want to see families and friends reunited,"" Palaszczuk said in a televised news conference.
""We know how important that New South Wales market is, so for those viewers currently in Sydney and you're looking for an escape, there is no better place than the tropical far north.""
The south eastern state of Victoria, which is hosting the Australia Open tennis grand slam, too hinted at changing border settings with Sydney on Friday. The state recorded its 22nd day of zero local cases.
Victoria introduced a permit system for all travellers which allows for areas to be designated as green, orange or red according to their risk.
Travellers from a red zone are not permitted into Victoria while those from orange zone will need to take a coronavirus test within three days of arrival.
""I'd hope to have by the end of tomorrow no red zones in New South Wales, a much larger green zone but there may be some remnants of a couple of areas that remain orange,"" Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said.
Australia has reported more than 22,000 local COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since March. 

The country, which closed international borders early in the pandemic and imposed lockdowns and strict social distancing measures, has ranked among the top 10 in a COVID performance index for its successful handling of the disease.

1162,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 07:41PM ET</span>",Biden's immigration changes too late for grandfather deported on Inauguration Day,"By Mica Rosenberg, Kristina Cooke and Jose Luis Gonzalez
CIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - As U.S. President Joe Biden took the oath of office last Wednesday, Felipe Ortega sat in a van handcuffed and chained at the waist and feet, headed toward Mexico and the end of his 30-year life in the United States. 
A day earlier, the 58-year-old grandfather of eight U.S. citizens was on his way to work when immigration agents surrounded his car in Midland, Texas, just blocks from his home. They told Ortega he had an outstanding deportation order from 15 years ago. 
After one sleepless night in jail and a long ride to the border, Ortega, a Mexican national, was sent across the international bridge at El Paso in Texas around 6:30 p.m. on Wednesday.
Ortega missed by some 24 hours a dramatic policy change by the new president that could have spared him.
In one of his first acts of office, Biden rescinded an executive order by former President Donald Trump that had targeted more immigrants living in the country illegally for arrest and deportation, including those with no criminal records like Ortega.
The abrupt about-face on policy shows how, without a long-term fix from Congress, the fate of millions of immigrants can change dramatically with the flick of a presidential pen.
Those actions can also face swift challenges in federal court, throwing more lives in limbo as legal battles drag on.
This risk was apparent on Tuesday, when a federal judge in Texas blocked a 100-day moratorium on deportations issued by the Biden administration.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) deported more than 185,000 people in the 2020 fiscal year, not including those quickly expelled at the border under a rule Trump put in place during the coronavirus pandemic.
Biden has pledged ICE officers in his administration will use more discretion. On his first day in office he proposed an immigration reform bill to Congress, that if passed would provide a pathway to citizenship for an estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally.
""SHOCKING""
On Tuesday Jan. 19, Ortega asked border agents before he was sent across the border if there was anything else he could do to continue fighting his case, but he says he was told no. 
""I think that what they wanted was to kick me out before Biden signed what he signed,"" Ortega told Reuters in a series of phone interviews after his deportation. ICE did not respond to a request for comment on Ortega's case.
His wife, Maria Ortega, a U.S. permanent resident, and three adult daughters, one a U.S. citizen and the other two permanent residents, drove four hours to cross into Ciudad Juarez and meet him on the other side. The family embraced, weeping.
Ortega said his family never planned to stay long in the United States when they crossed in the 1990s. They entered on a 15-day visa intending to help his brother who was caring for a child with cancer. But the treatment dragged on for months and the Ortegas' young girls started going to school. Life took over. 
After working a few years as a ranch hand, Ortega moved into construction, eventually going into business for himself remodeling homes. 
""My dad is his house, his work, his family and that's it,"" said his middle daughter Adriana, 35, who has a special ringtone programmed in her cell phone for her father's frequent calls. ""That's why it is all kind of shocking.""
In 2006, Ortega was moving house from Spearman, Texas, to Midland when his truck broke down at a gas station. A local sheriff stopped to see if he needed help but then asked for his residency papers. When Ortega admitted he didn't have any, he was arrested and sent to immigration court. 
He lost his case and appealed, though he said he never knew the outcome until deportation officers handed him a three-page document with the 2007 denial last week because the paperwork didn't arrive at his house after he moved, he said.
The document, seen by Reuters, said the judge believed he had not sufficiently proven his relationship to his U.S. citizen daughter and that his deportation would not cause his family enough ""extreme and unusual"" hardship to have his removal canceled.
A SCARRED HOMETOWN
Ortega returned to Mexico for the first time in 30 years to find his hometown of El Porvenir, around an hour south of Ciudad Juarez, totally transformed. When he and Maria started dating at 15, they would eat ice cream in the plaza and go to dances, strolling the streets late into the night, Maria said. 
Now on a drive around the town a couple days after he arrived, he saw burned and abandoned buildings and few people outside, the legacy of years of violent clashes between rival drug cartels.
Staying with his brother-in-law - Ortega's only remaining relative in the city - he is trying to make himself useful around the house by fixing up the aging electrical system and other odd jobs. But he had not been prepared to live out his retirement years in a different country than his family. 
Maria, who has diabetes and other health problems, has to stay close to her U.S. doctors and can't drive on her own. Adriana, a single mom, is thinking of picking up another job to help support her two aging parents on both sides of the border.
""Everything is different, I am scared to be in my hometown,"" said Ortega. ""I don't know where to begin."" 
Barring changes to immigration laws under Biden, there is currently no clear path for him to return.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand, Vietnam and Taiwan rank the top three in a COVID Performance Index of almost 100 countries for their successful handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Britain and America near the bottom of the pile.
The Lowy Institute said its index published on Thursday excludes China, where the first cases were identified in December 2019, due to lack of publicly available data. 
Other countries in the top 10 include Thailand, Cyprus, Rwanda, Iceland, Australia, Latvia and Sri Lanka - countries with fewer reported cases and deaths both in aggregate and per capita terms.
In total, 98 countries were evaluated in the 36 weeks that followed their hundredth confirmed case of COVID-19, using data available to Jan. 9, 2021.
Fourteen-day rolling averages of new daily figures were calculated for confirmed cases, confirmed cases per million people, confirmed deaths, confirmed deaths per million people, confirmed cases as a proportion of tests, and tests per thousand people, the Lowy Institute said.
The report comes as world coronavirus cases surpass 100 million with the death toll exceeding 2 million.
The United States, with over 25 million confirmed cases, ranked 94 while India, with more than 11 million cases, was 86th. Britain, with the highest number of the deaths in Europe, stood at the 66th spot.
The index showed countries in Asia-Pacific proved the most successful in containing the pandemic as Europe and the United States were ""quickly overwhelmed"" by the rapid spread of COVID-19.
""Levels of economic development or differences in political systems between countries had less of an impact on outcomes than often assumed or publicised,"" the Sydney-based Lowy Institute said in its analysis.

""In general, countries with smaller populations, cohesive societies, and capable institutions have a comparative advantage in dealing with a global crisis such as a pandemic.""

1164,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 06:21PM ET</span>",Poland puts into effect new restrictions on abortion,"By Joanna Plucinska and Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's government put into effect on Wednesday a constitutional court decision banning terminations of pregnancies with foetal defects, as conservative policies increasingly take root in one of Europe's most devout Catholic countries.
The Oct. 22 ruling had led to weeks of massive protests, forcing the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government to delay its implementation. 
Small protests gathered late on Wednesday following an announcement PiS would take the official step to enforce the decision imminently, and abortion rights activists announced more would take place on Thursday.
Abortion has emerged as one of the most divisive issues since PiS took power in 2015, promising poorer, older and less educated Poles a return to a traditional society mixed with generous welfare policies.
The court's verdict was published in the official gazette late on Wednesday.
""This idiotic ruling will not prevent abortions,"" said Cezary Jasiński, a 23-year-old student, standing in front of the Constitutional Tribunal building in central Warsaw.
""But for every woman who will experience pain because of this ruling, or will be forced to give birth to a child with Down's Syndrome, they (court judges) will be to blame.""
Last year's protests quickly morphed into an eruption of anger against the government, particularly among young people, suggesting PiS may face a fresh challenge from new voters in coming years. 
On Wednesday, officials said the government would now focus on assisting parents of disabled children, although PiS as well as its centrist predecessors have been accused by critics of not doing enough in that regard.
""The state can no longer take a life away only because someone is sick, disabled, in poor health,"" PiS lawmaker Bartlomiej Wroblewski said.
The party denies opposition criticism that it had influenced the court, called the Constitutional Tribunal. It is one of the judicial bodies PiS overhauled during reforms that the European Union said has politicised the courts.
""No law-abiding government should respect this ruling,"" Borys Budka, leader of Poland's largest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform, told reporters.
Access to abortion has declined even without the legislative curbs as more doctors refuse to perform them on religious grounds and many women seek abortions abroad.
Under the new rules, terminations will be permitted only in cases of rape and incest, and when the mother's life or health is endangered. Doctors performing illegal abortions in Poland face jail.
In a justification published on Wednesday, the tribunal left open the possibility of the parliament regulating some circumstances covered by the law.
Marek Suski, a PiS lawmaker, said the party would consider introducing new rules that could allow the most extreme foetal deformities to be excluded. But political commentators say consensus between PiS and its arch-conservative governing allies would be difficult to achieve.
""In cases when the foetus doesn't have a skull or has no chance to live outside the womb, there should be a choice. We will work on this,"" Suski told public radio.

Opinion surveys have shown some decline in PiS popularity in recent months, but an opinion poll by the government-affiliated CBOS pollster showed it edging back up to 35% this month, from 30% in October. PiS and its two small parliamentary allies won re-election in 2019 with a 44% share of the vote.

Making his first public comments on Iran as the chief U.S. diplomat, Blinken reiterated President Joe Biden's policy ""that if Iran comes back into full compliance with its obligations under the JCPOA, the United States would do the same thing.""
The nuclear deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), was struck by Iran and six major powers in 2015 and committed Iran to restricting its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief from the United States and others.
Trump abandoned the deal in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions, leading Iran to begin violating its terms.
If Iran returns to the deal, Washington would seek to build what Blinken called a ""longer and stronger agreement"" that would deal with other ""deeply problematic"" issues.
He did not name these but Biden has said they include Iran's development of ballistic missiles and its support for proxy forces in countries such as Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.
""Iran is out of compliance on a number of fronts and it would take some time, should it make the decision to do so, for it to come back into compliance and time for us then to assess whether it was meeting its obligations,"" Blinken told reporters.

""We are not there yet, to say the least,"" he added. He declined to say which U.S. official would lead talks with Iran but said ""we will bring to bear different perspectives on the issue.""

(Reuters) - An Iraqi-born British national has been criminally charged in New Jersey with involvement in a bribery scheme to obtain millions of dollars of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reconstruction contracts in Iraq, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Wednesday.
The defendant, Shwan Al-Mulla, and his co-conspirators allegedly received confidential information to get an edge in the bidding process for the contracts, in exchange for more than $1 million in bribes paid from 2007 to 2009 to a USACE employee deployed in Tikrit, Iraq.
Al-Mulla, 60, the former owner of Baghdad-based Iraqi Consultants & Construction Bureau (ICCB), was charged with seven counts of honest services wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit bribery.
Each fraud count carries a maximum 20-year prison term.
The charges were announced by Acting U.S. Attorney Rachael Honig in New Jersey. Her office said Al-Mulla is at large.
A lawyer for Al-Mulla could not immediately be located.
The USACE employee, John Salama Markus of Nazareth, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to fraud, money laundering and tax offenses in 2012 and is serving a 13-year prison term.
Another co-conspirator, Ahmed Nouri, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in 2018 and has yet to be sentenced, Honig's office said.
ICCB paid $2.7 million in 2013 to resolve Justice Department allegations it violated the federal False Claims Act by paying bribes to Salama Markus.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic underlined the benefits of being part of the United Kingdom as he prepares to visit Scotland on Thursday to confront growing support for another independence referendum.
The bonds holding together the United Kingdom have been severely strained over the last five years by Brexit, the government’s handling of the pandemic, and repeated calls by the Scottish National Party for a new referendum on independence.
Ahead of his visit, Johnson said that Scotland as a part of the United Kingdom gained access to a coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and they are being administered by their shared armed forces, who are creating 80 new vaccine centres in Scotland.
""We have pulled together to defeat the virus,"" Johnson said. ""Mutual cooperation across the UK throughout this pandemic is exactly what the people of Scotland expect and it is what I have been focussed on."" 
Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Wednesday criticised Johnson’s planned trip to Scotland, questioning whether his reasons for visiting are ""really essential"" and arguing it sets a bad example to the public.
Sturgeon, who runs Scotland's semi-autonomous government, is hoping a strong performance by her Scottish National Party in an election for the country's devolved parliament in May would give her the mandate to hold a second referendum.
If Scotland voted for independence it would mean the United Kingdom would lose about a third of its landmass and almost a tenth of its population - just as the world's sixth-biggest economy is grappling with the impact of Brexit.
Johnson, who would have to agree to a new referendum, has said there is no need for a new vote after independence was rejected by Scottish voters in 2014.
Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in a 2014 referendum. But a majority of Scots also backed staying in the European Union in the subsequent 2016 Brexit vote, stoking demands by Scottish nationalists for a new independence vote after the UK as a whole voted to leave.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department is reviewing a Trump administration determination that China has committed genocide by repressing Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang region to make sure that it sticks, President Joe Biden's pick for U.N. ambassador said on Wednesday. 
""The State Department is reviewing that now because all of the procedures were not followed,"" Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""They're looking to make sure that they are followed to ensure that that designation is held."" 
Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the move last week, one day before Biden took office, ""after careful examination of the available facts,"" accusing the Chinese Communist Party of crimes against humanity targeting the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities.
China has been widely condemned for its complexes in Xinjiang, which it describes as ""vocational training centers"" to stamp out extremism. It denies accusations of abuse.
Later on Wednesday, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators said it had reintroduced legislation intended to bar any goods made with forced labor in Xinjiang from entering the United States.
The rare American genocide determination came after Congress passed legislation on Dec. 27 requiring the U.S. administration to determine within 90 days whether China had committed crimes against humanity or genocide.
Biden's secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told the foreign relations panel during his confirmation hearing last week that he agreed with the genocide declaration. 
China's embassy in Washington had responded to Pompeo's announcement, saying: ""The so-called 'genocide' in Xinjiang is simply a lie. It is a farce used to discredit China."" It rejected the U.S. declaration as a ""gross interference in China's internal affairs.""
The Uighur forced-labor bill passed the House of Representatives by a huge margin last year, but had to be introduced again because it did not pass the Senate and become law before the new Congress was seated this month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said the State Department was taking a ""very urgent and very close look"" at the Trump administration designation of Yemen's Houthi movement as a foreign terrorist organization and wants to make sure aid groups can deliver assistance to the country.
Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blacklisted the Iran-aligned Houthis last week - a day before President Joe Biden took office - despite warnings from the United Nations and aid groups that it would push Yemen into a large-scale famine.
""It's vitally important even in the midst of this crisis that we do everything we can to get humanitarian assistance to the people of Yemen, who are in desperate need. And what we want to make sure is that any steps we are taking do not get in the way of providing that assistance,"" Blinken told reporters at his first press briefing after being sworn in.
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need.
""We want to make sure that not only are American aid groups able to do what they can to provide assistance, but so are aid groups around the world,"" Blinken added.
The United Nations on Tuesday said it was still hearing concerns that companies are planning to cancel or suspend business with Yemen despite a U.S. decision on Monday to allow all transactions with the Houthi movement for the next month as Washington reviews the designation.

A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis in a war widely seen as a proxy conflict between U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as Yemen's suffering is also worsened by an economic collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin praised Germany for hosting U.S. troops in a call with his German counterpart on Wednesday, fueling speculation that President Joe Biden could overturn a drawdown ordered by his predecessor Donald Trump.
Austin plans to carry out a global review of U.S. troop positioning, which would include Trump's order last year to eventually withdraw about a third of the 34,000-strong U.S. troop contingent in Germany.
Trump, declaring that ""We don’t want to be the suckers any more,” faulted the close U.S. ally for failing to meet NATO’s defense spending target and accused it of taking advantage of the United States on trade.
Austin took a different tack.
""Secretary Austin expressed his gratitude to Germany for continuing to serve as a great host for U.S. forces,"" the Pentagon said in a statement following Austin's call with German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
Under Trump's withdrawal plan, just under 6,000 of the roughly 12,000 U.S. troops withdrawing from Germany would reposition to the Black Sea region and some could temporarily deploy in waves to the Baltics.
Other forces leaving Germany would permanently move to Italy and the U.S. military's European headquarters would relocate from Stuttgart, Germany, to Belgium.
The Trump pullout caught Germany off guard.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Austin assured Kramp-Karrenbauer that whatever the United States did in the future, it would do it in consultation with Germany.
While in office Trump attacked Germany repeatedly. Biden, who took office last week, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday underscored the need for cooperation on global challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Pentagon said Austin also spoke with Kramp-Karrenbauer about ""force posture in Afghanistan and Iraq, and combating the malign influence of our shared strategic rivals.""

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas spoke with new U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday and agreed to cooperate on issues including China and Iran's nuclear capacity, the German Foreign Ministry said in a tweet.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling parties are reluctantly coming to terms with the prospect of having to forge a new deal with the centrist Italia Viva party which quit the government and forced this week's resignation of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, political sources said on Wednesday.
The government crisis could hardly come at a worse time, with Italy in its steepest recession since the end of World War Two and having registered 86,000 deaths from COVID-19.
Conte, a lawyer with no direct political affiliation, still hopes to pull together a new administration to manage some 200 billion euros ($240 billion) that Italy expects from a European Union fund to help relaunch its COVID-battered economy.
Yet as the political crisis deepens, lawmakers from the main planks of the coalition, the 5-Star Movement and the Democratic Party, are pushing Conte towards negotiating again with Italia Viva's leader and former premier Matteo Renzi, despite the bitter recriminations amid his walk-out last week.
""I have spoken to Italia Viva members and we can work together. Since Conte doesn't have enough support we should talk to them,"" a 5-Star lawmaker who asked not to be named told Reuters. 
Conte, now a caretaker prime minister after handing in his resignation to the head of state on Tuesday, has got little response to his impassioned call for unaligned lawmakers to fill the hole left by Renzi and his party.
He needs around 10 in the upper house Senate where his coalition is most fragile, but his hopes that waverers would join the government's ranks to avoid the risk of new elections are dwindling by the day. 
""Not many people are up for this, not everyone is ready to blatantly contradict his political history to guarantee his future,"" said Andrea Cangini, a senator from the centre-right Forza Italia party which is often cited as a possible source of support for Conte.
President Sergio Mattarella is unlikely to give Conte a fresh mandate if the premier cannot offer him a guarantee that he now has a stable majority, a senior PD Senate source told Reuters. Patching things up with Renzi looks like the only option, he said.
For its part, Italia Viva says it has no veto against a return of Conte with a new policy platform, but it is playing its cards close to its chest.
""Conte is not the only option. We don't want to discuss names, let's first focus on the policies,"" said Teresa Bellanova, an Italia Viva senator and former minister.
If Conte does not get enough support, Mattarella may ask another candidate to try to form a government. Dissolving parliament and calling elections two years ahead of schedule would be his last resort.

1174,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 03:35PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Do we need to sanction each other? German minister asks after Blinken call,"By Andreas Rinke
BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's foreign minister questioned whether transatlantic sanctions are appropriate even if Washington and Berlin have policy differences following a constructive first phone call with new U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday.
Last week, in the final days of the Trump administration, the United States imposed sanctions on a ship involved in building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to take Russian natural gas to Europe.
Washington has long argued the project will increase Russia's leverage over the region and new U.S. President Joe Biden believes Nord Stream 2 is a ""bad deal for Europe"". But Russia and Germany say it is just a commercial project.
Pressed about Nord Stream 2 after his call with Blinken, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: ""I think that overall we have to consider in transatlantic relations whether it makes so much sense to impose punitive tariffs or sanctions on each other.
""We want to talk to the United States about it (Nord Stream 2), but our position on this issue has not changed in principle,"" he told Reuters in a television interview.
The pipeline, which would double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream link from Russia to Germany and bypass Ukraine, is a contentious issue between Berlin and Washington, which wants to sell its own liquefied natural gas to Europe.
Maas was otherwise struck by the positive tone of his first phone call with Blinken.
""I have to get used to the fact that I talk to my American colleague on the phone and we agree on almost all points. This has not been the case in the past,"" he said, adding this was the basis for transatlantic relations to improve ""step by step"".
Turning to China, with which the European Union last month agreed an investment deal that will give its companies greater access to Chinese markets, Maas said ""decoupling"" from Beijing would not be sensible.
But he said Western policy towards China could become more effective on issues of human rights, climate, fair competition and disarmament.
""All these are things we can talk about with the United States, where we can be more effective, and where we can achieve more if we represent our interests together towards China,"" Maas said.
Asked if he feared U.S. foreign policy could change little under Biden, Maas replied: ""I rather have the impression that not much will remain of Donald Trump's policy of the last four years with a president like Joe Biden.""
Biden's move to rejoin the 2015 Paris Agreement on combating climate change, and readiness to move back towards the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran were ""fundamental changes compared with the last four years"".
Turning finally to a row between the EU and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) over the Anglo-Swedish company's delays in delivering its COVID-19 vaccine, Maas said the EU Commission was conducting ""very intense"" negotiations on the matter.
""The question why ordered deliveries have not been received is very open,"" he added.

Quebec's Junior Health Minister Lionel Carmant said on Twitter the province would ""modify its decree in order to exempt homeless people from the curfew,"" and not challenge the court ruling.
Quebec, which imposed an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew on Jan. 9 to combat a second wave of infections, faced criticism over its refusal to exempt homeless people from potential C$1,500 fines for not following the measure, especially after a homeless man unable to find shelter died in a public toilet.
By comparison, the province of Ontario exempted the homeless from a stay-at-home order put in place earlier this month, while France has said the country's poorest citizens would not be penalized by its curfew.
Quebec Premier François Legault opposed changing the rule, arguing residents could pretend to be homeless, while arguing that adequate shelter would be available. 
The pandemic has taken a toll on Canada's vulnerable and unhoused. A January study published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found that Ontario residents with a recent history of homelessness were more likely to test positive for coronavirus, and over five times more likely to die within 21 days of a positive test. 
Quebec Superior Court Judge Chantal Masse on Thursday granted an injunction suspending the curfew's application to the homeless, arguing that their ""lives, security and health were being put in danger."" 
Donald Tremblay, director of the Mobile Legal Clinic which spearheaded the court action, said, ""It's about time"" the government backed off. 

""It was completely absurd not to exempt the homeless,"" he said by phone.

They also agreed to arrange a U.S. visit for Suga as early as possible, Suga told reporters. 
The White House said the two affirmed the importance of the U.S.-Japan alliance ""as the cornerstone of peace and prosperity in a free and open Indo-Pacific.""
They two sides said they also reconfirmed that the U.S.-Japan security treaty applied to a group of Japan-controlled East China Sea islets that China claims, called the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
Biden reaffirmed too the U.S. commitment to provide ""extended deterrence"" to Japan, a reference to the U.S. nuclear umbrella covering Japan, the White House said in a statement.
The two leaders affirmed the necessity of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it added.
""We managed to have substantial exchanges,"" Suga said.
""We agreed to strengthen our alliance firmly by having more phone calls like this.""
Shortly after his Senate confirmation on Tuesday, Biden's new secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke to both his South Korean and Japan counterparts and emphasized Biden's commitment to strengthening the U.S. alliances with both countries.
Blinken also stressed the need for continued trilateral cooperation among the allies.
Ties between Washington and its two key Northeast Asian allies were bruised under former President Donald Trump, who demanded that both pay more for U.S. troops there and raised questions about their future presence.
Biden has said rebuilding relations with allies will be a key priority. 

Japan-South Korea ties have been strained by a dispute over treatment of Korean women by Japanese forces in World War Two. Last week, Suga called South Korea an important neighbor but said bilateral ties were in a very severe situation.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Anti-Kremlin protester Filipp Kuznetsov was detained in Moscow on Saturday and found guilty by a court on Monday of taking part in an illegal protest. But it was only late on Wednesday that the authorities were able to find a jail cell for him.
After arresting what one monitoring group said was a record number of protesters at weekend rallies demanding Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny be freed from jail, Moscow police appear to be struggling to find enough space in detention facilities.
Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets across Russia on Saturday to demand the release of Navalny, who was arrested at a Moscow airport this month after flying home for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent. 
Kuznetsov, a 28-year-old entrepreneur, was arrested on Saturday near the prison housing Navalny. A court on Monday sentenced Kuznetsov to 10 days in jail for taking part in the protests, deemed illegal because they had not been pre-sanctioned by the authorities. 
""I'm sitting in a police bus because there is no space in the jails,"" Kuznetsov told Reuters by phone on Wednesday afternoon. 
He said he knew Moscow's jails were full from policemen who had guarded him and 17 other protesters in a police bus overnight outside a jail that had refused to accept them because it was full.
Kuznetsov messaged later on Wednesday to say the police had eventually found a prison for him after driving from jail to jail for more than 16 hours.
The policemen guarding him and the others had allowed volunteers to bring food while they were waiting in the bus and had sometimes escorted them to the nearby jail to use the bathroom, Kuznetsov said.
By the time he got to jail, he said he had not slept for over 30 hours.
""Free people don't get tired. We support each other,"" he said.
The Moscow police department did not respond to a request for comment. 
MASS ARRESTS
The OVD-info protest monitoring group, which counts arrests one by one and offers legal support, said police on Saturday detained nearly 4,000 people at protests across Russia, over 1,500 of them in Moscow. 
It said it had compared the figures with the number of arrests counted at previous protests, and found both were record figures for President Vladimir Putin's long rule. 
""The number of people arrested after the rallies was really big and there is no space for them in Moscow jails,"" said Grigory Durnovo, an OVD-info analyst.

Putin has called the pro-Navalny marches illegal. Kremlin critics cite their constitutional right to protest.

1180,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 12:21PM ET</span>","Within hours, Indian farm protests turned from carnival to violent clashes","By Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A line of tractors stood ready at dawn on Tuesday to move out of a protest site near New Delhi where thousands of farmers had been camping for the last two months and rallying against farm reforms they say will hurt them and benefit large private firms.
Within hours, the huge tractor procession that started in a carnival spirit had smashed through barricades, reached the heart of the city and turned violent.
It was an escalation in a standoff with protesters that poses a major challenge to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as it tries to contain the coronavirus pandemic and its economic impact.
Several hundred demonstrators breached the outer walls of Delhi's Red Fort - one of its most recognisable landmarks - before raising flags from the ramparts and clashing with police.
Among those who reached the fort was Vikramjit Singh, who said farmers had not originally planned to storm the historic complex, a favourite tourist attraction where prime ministers deliver the annual Independence Day speech.
""Nobody had given a call to go to Red Fort,"" said Singh, a farmer from Punjab's Tarn Taran district. ""It all happened suddenly.""
The events came after protest leaders held lengthy talks with police and promised a massive but peaceful rally along a pre-determined route.
Some farm leaders bemoaned the violent turn protests took, saying it undermined their cause.
""These incidents have only delayed our fight,"" said farmer leader Darshan Pal.
Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava told reporters on Wednesday that police realised farmers may not follow the agreed route when ""aggressive and militant elements"" made provocative speeches the night before the tractor rally.
He added that 394 policemen were injured in clashes, leaving some in intensive care. His personnel ensured no protester had been killed, he said.
""The police has been very restrained,"" he said.
Since the violence in the centre of the capital, police have reinforced their presence at major protest camps on the outskirts of the city and the Red Fort.
INTO THE CAPITAL
A convoy of tractors drove out of the protest site at Singhu, a village outside the capital, at around 8 a.m., several hours ahead of schedule.
By noon, hundreds of protesters had dismantled a roadblock of concrete slabs, shipping containers and trucks.
After firing a few rounds of teargas, more than 100 policemen stood aside as the protesters passed through, according to Reuters reporters at the scene.
The crowds moved into Delhi's centre, sometimes losing their way, and thousands of people eventually coalesced around the Red Fort that stands next to the old city.
For the first hour or so after the tractors began arriving, the mood was relaxed. A large contingent of policemen waited on the lawns in front of the 17th-century monument, two protesters said, looking on as the crowd steadily grew.
Even when protesters broke through two gates and climbed the ramparts, there was no sign of confrontation. In social media posts, heavily outnumbered policemen, some in riot gear, mingled with the crowds on the ramparts.
But the situation quickly turned violent. Video footage taken at around 3 p.m. showed protesters attacking policemen with sticks and tipping over a police jeep. One man was holding a sword. It was not clear what triggered the change.
The clashes lasted around 30 minutes, during which time protesters drove away most policemen from the area. The crowds gradually dissipated after that.
Balbir Singh Rajewal, another protest leader, said the demonstrations had been hijacked by a tiny minority.

""99.9% of the protesters were peaceful,"" he told reporters.

OSWIECIM, Poland (Reuters) - Marian Turski, a 94-year-old survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, marked the 76th anniversary of its liberation by Soviet troops on Wednesday only virtually, aware that he might never return as the coronavirus pandemic drags on.
Survivors and museum officials told Reuters they fear the pandemic could end the era where Auschwitz's former prisoners can tell their own stories to visitors on site. Most Auschwitz survivors are in their eighties and nineties.
""Even if there was no pandemic, there would be fewer survivors at every anniversary,"" Turski told Reuters in a Zoom interview from his Warsaw home.
""People at my age who are already vulnerable to many other illnesses are also in the first line of fire for this virus.""
He declined an in-person interview, in part due to the pandemic risks. 
The Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum and Memorial preserves the Auschwitz death camp set up on Polish soil by Nazi Germany during World War Two. More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished in gas chambers at the camp or from starvation, cold and disease.
Wednesday's ceremony marking the camp's liberation included speeches by survivors, Poland's President Andrzej Duda and Israeli and Russian diplomats, as well as a debate on the Holocaust's influence on children.
Other virtual ceremonies also took place to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day.
The Memorial has been closed to visitors for 161 days due to the pandemic. In 2019 it was visited by around 2.3 million people. In 2020 that number dropped to around 502,000.
The Museum's director, Piotr Cywinski, acknowledged virtual events and education programmes were not as effective in passing on the lessons of the Holocaust and World War Two.
""Nothing will replace witnessing the place in its authentic state, because this isn't just about seeing and listening. This is about looking around, in your own steps, touching, experiencing different perspectives, understanding,"" Cywinski told Reuters.
WARNING THE WORLD
Survivors emphasized the importance of finding ways to keep Auschwitz relevant after they can no longer tell their own stories, amid a rise in far-right movements and anti-Semitism.
In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel thanked survivors for their first-hand accounts and warned against anti-semitism in a message for a virtual commemoration of International Holocaust Remembrance day organized by the UN and UNESCO.
""We must stand with the utmost determination against anti-semitism, be it open or veiled, and against denial or diminishing of the Holocaust,"" she said. 
Pope Francis urged people to keep a close watch on ideological extremism, because ""these things can happen again"".
He spoke three weeks after displays of anti-Semitism surfaced at the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6 and two weeks after one of Montreal's largest synagogues was vandalised and almost set on fire.
Speaking at his general audience, held inside the papal library because of coronavirus restrictions, Francis said it was imperative that the world did not forget.
""To remember ... means being careful because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that claim to want to save a people but end up destroying a people and humanity,"" he said.
Some Auschwitz survivors, like Bogdan Bartnikowski, 89, said they were optimistic that the pandemic would not end their chances of returning to the memorial and telling their stories. 

""I have hope that for sure there will continue to be groups of visitors to the museum,"" Bartnikowski said. ""Us former prisoners will not be lacking.""

Leah Nebenzahl was a baby when her parents, Pipha and Zvi Herschman, were murdered in Nazi-occupied Poland.
The Jewish infant, rescued by a priest who placed her in an orphanage run by nuns, survived World War Two as the adopted daughter of a Christian couple.
On Wednesday, Holocaust survivors mark the 76th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp by Soviet troops.
The stories and photos of Jewish youngsters, some of them orphans like Leah who were placed in seven children's homes for survivors in Europe after the war, are part of a new online exhibition - ""My Lost Childhood"" - by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust museum.
Many were reunited with relatives and went on to live their lives in Israel, the United States, Canada, Latin America and other places.
In her home in Jerusalem, Nebenzahl held up a photograph of herself as a baby. Her mother had sent it to the infant's grandmother after her birth in 1942.
""She signs as if she was me: 'Leah Herschman' - and that's how I learned my name that was given to me by my parents. This is the only source. That's why this is a historic photograph,"" she said.
Another photograph shows a woman clutching a baby.
""There is no doubt that I am the baby, and I assume that the woman who holds me is my mother, but it's not very clear because nothing was written (on the back of the photo),"" she said.
After the war, Leah's aunt learned that her sister had given birth.
The aunt won a court custody battle against the adoptive parents in Poland and brought the child to Israel in 1949 after Leah was housed temporarily in one of the children's homes featured in the Yad Vashem exhibit.
Now a great-grandmother, Nebenzahl faces new risks from a coronavirus pandemic that has put the elderly particularly in danger.

But she said she still held fast to her life's motto - ""to turn darkness into light and bitter into sweet"".

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh will move 2,000-3,000 more Rohingya Muslim refugees to a remote island in the Bay of Bengal this week, a navy officer said on Wednesday, despite complaints by rights groups concerned about the site's vulnerability to storms and flooding.
Bangladesh has relocated about 3,500 of the refugees from neighbouring Myanmar to Bhasan Char island since early December from border camps where a million live in ramshackle huts perched on razed hillsides.
Bhasan Char emerged from the sea only two decades ago and is several hours by boat from the nearest port at Chittagong. The Rohingya, a minority group who fled violence in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, are not allowed to move off the island without government permission.
""Most probably, they will be taken to Chittagong tomorrow and the next day, they will be sent to Bhasan Char from there,"" Navy Commodore Abdullah Al Mamun Chowdhury told Reuters.
""Last time, we had preparations for 700 to 1,000 but finally more than 1,800 Rohingya moved there. People who moved earlier are calling their relatives and friends to go there. That's why more people are going there.""
Bangladesh justifies the move to the island saying overcrowding in the camps in Cox's Bazar is leading to crimes.
It also dismisses concerns of floods, citing the construction of a 2-metre (6.5 feet) embankment for 12 km (7.5 miles) to protect the island along with housing for 100,000 people, as well as facilities such as cyclone centres and hospitals.
Its actions, nevertheless, have attracted criticism from relief agencies that have not been consulted on the transfers.
""The U.N. has previously shared terms of reference with the government for the technical and protection assessments to evaluate the safety and sustainability of life on Bhasan Char, though we have not yet been permitted to carry out these assessments,"" the U.N. refugee agency said in an email.
""We emphasize that all movements to Bhasan Char must be voluntary and based upon full information regarding the conditions of life on the island and the rights and services that refugees will be able to access there.""

The government says the relocation is voluntary but some refugees from the first group that went there in early December have spoken of being coerced.

1186,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2021 10:47AM ET</span>","Factbox: The Brexit impact so far - paperwork, process and higher prices","By Kate Holton
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's departure from the European Union has triggered the biggest change in trade since it joined the bloc 48 years ago, with companies grappling with export documents, longer delivery times and the need to re-engineer supply chains. 
Freight volumes moving between the United Kingdom and the European Union were down 38% in the third week of January compared with the same week a year ago, real-time truck movement data shows.
Below are just some of the ways in which trade is changing since Britain exited the EU's single market and customs union on Dec. 31: 
LONGER DELIVERY TIMES 
Fishermen were the first workers to be hit in January when the introduction of health checks, certificates and customs declarations delayed the movement of stocks to such an extent that they were rejected by European buyers as no longer fresh. 
Since then food producers of products ranging from cheese to high-end beef have stopped exporting to Europe for now, put off by expensive health certificates and overwhelming paperwork.
Some companies are trying to find a solution. Some Scottish fishermen have taken their catch directly to Danish markets to avoid the British bureaucracy. However about a fifth of small and medium-sized businesses that export to the EU have temporarily halted sales.
SUPPLY CHAINS
The new friction has forced those companies that can afford it to re-examine their supply chains, particularly those British firms that risk tariffs by selling goods into the EU that were made from materials originally imported from Asia.
Online clothing giant ASOS (LON:ASOS) expects a 15 million pound ($21 million) tariff hit because, although most of its European sales go via a Berlin warehouse, some still enter Britain first. Superdry will use bonded warehouses.
Japanese carmaker Nissan (OTC:NSANY) plans to source more batteries from Britain to avoid tariffs on electric cars.
VAT AND COSTS 
Companies and consumers have received unexpected charges for customs fees, VAT and higher logistics costs that will make some sales prohibitive.
Logistics groups said the cost of hiring European drivers to bring goods into Britain had surged. The fact that drivers also need a negative COVID test to leave means the island nation is a much less attractive destination for them.
A CBI survey of UK manufacturers showed optimism about their competitiveness with EU rivals has deteriorated at the fastest pace on record. Despite that, EU orders improved, suggesting that EU firms are still sourcing from the UK. 
FINANCIAL SERVICES
Britain's Brexit trade deal with the EU, in force since Jan. 1, does not cover financial services, leaving its City of London financial centre largely cut off from the bloc.
European daily share trading worth 6 billion euros ($7.36 billion) left the City of London for the continent in early January, along with a chunk of swaps trading. That raises questions over the value of any future EU access, given that UK banks and trading platforms have opened units in the bloc.
Brussels has said it will not consider granting more equivalence access until a regulatory cooperation pact with Britain is in place and planned UK divergence from EU rules have been examined.
London has no desire for a bonfire of regulations to retain its position as a top international finance centre after Brexit but it is ready to act if the EU blocks access, the City of London's political leader told Reuters.
The Bank of England has said Britain should not submit to EU rules just to secure better access, warning that the price could be too high.
IRELAND
The most obvious sign of the Brexit impact can be seen in the ports where large ferries now ship goods directly between EU member Ireland and the rest of the bloc to cut out the paperwork and delays associated with the once speedier route via Britain. 
Some gaps have appeared on supermarket shelves in Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland as retailers struggle to cope with the customs paperwork, a situation that could deteriorate after a three-month grace period for Northern Ireland supermarkets expires.
E-commerce has also been badly hit due to the numbers of Irish customers who shop online from UK stores. Some British suppliers have stopped trade while Northern Irish logistics groups have warned that prices are rising as trailers return from Britain empty, without a return load to cover the cost.

Signed in 2010, the New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) is a cornerstone of global arms control and limits the numbers of strategic nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers that Russia and the United States can deploy.
The White House did not immediately confirm a Kremlin announcement on Tuesday of a deal to extend the treaty but said new President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed the issue by telephone and agreed that their teams work urgently to complete the pact by Feb. 5, the expiry date.
Both Russia's lower and upper houses of parliament, the State Duma and Federation Council, rushed through votes on Wednesday to approve the extension of the last major pact of its kind between the two nuclear powers. 
""The essence of the agreement is to extend it for five years, as it was signed, without any changes,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Duma.
The next step is expected to be President Vladimir Putin signing the legislation. 
Ryabkov said the treaty would be formally extended once Russia and the United States had exchanged diplomatic notes after completing all their respective domestic procedures.
He said the extension had been agreed ""on our terms"", the TASS news agency reported. 
Moscow and Washington had failed to agree an extension under former U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration had wanted to attach conditions to a renewal that Moscow rejected.
Addressing a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Putin cast the extension as ""a step in the right direction"" - at a time when U.S.-Russian relations are strained in other areas.
Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international affairs committee of the Federation Council, described it as a good treaty that ensured Russia's national security. 

""If the treaty had not been extended, ceilings and quantitative limits would have disappeared, which would open the opportunity for an arms race,"" he said.

The letter, published in Ethiopia's The Reporter newspaper, echoed points raised in the past by U.S. officials. But the ambassadors adopted a more forthright tone than Washington often took in public under former President Donald Trump towards Ethiopia, an ally.
""We have watched the conflict in Tigray with grave unease,"" wrote diplomats David Shinn, Aurelia Brazeal, Vicki Huddleston and Patricia Haslach.
""We are also worried about the reported presence of Eritrean troops in Tigray, which could jeopardize Ethiopia's territorial integrity ... We are concerned about the worsening ethnic tensions throughout the country, reflected in the proliferation of hate speech and rising ethnic and religious violence.""
Abiy's federal army ousted the former local ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), from the regional capital Mekelle in November, but low-level fighting has continued and humanitarian needs are dire.
Thousands of people have died, hundreds of thousands have been forced from homes and there are shortages of food, water and medicine around the region of more than 5 million people. Aid agencies have struggled for access. 
Abiy's spokeswoman Billene Seyoum did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment on the ambassadors' letter.
Abiy and other officials have from the outset blamed the TPLF for provoking the conflict with attacks on army bases in Tigray, denied any ethnic motivations, and said they are channelling aid into the region as fast as possible.
Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied that Eritrean troops participated in the conflict, though dozens of eyewitnesses, diplomats and an Ethiopian general have reported their presence.
In a statement sent to Reuters on Wednesday, a U.S. State Department spokesperson called for humanitarian access to Tigray, and said there were ""credible reports of looting, sexual violence, assaults in refugee camps, and other human rights violations"" there.
""There needs to be an independent and transparent investigation into reports of human rights violations and abuses, with those responsible held accountable,"" the spokesperson said. ""The United States has stressed the need for all Eritrean troops to leave Tigray immediately.""

Foreign Minister Demeke Mekonnen met European Union envoys on Wednesday, telling them supplies were being delivered to Tigrayans at 92 centres and rights abuses would be investigated, his office said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday it was seeking details about 25 of its nationals who were among 61 crew on two supertankers seized by Indonesia on suspicion of illegally transferring oil.
Indonesia said on Sunday it had seized the vessels after they were detected making the transfer from Iranian-flagged MT Horse to Panamanian-flagged MT Freya, causing an oil spill.
The Indonesian authorities said the seizure was not related to U.S. sanctions, which Washington imposed in a bid to shut off Iran's oil exports in a dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme.
The MT Horse, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company, and MT Freya, managed by Shanghai Future Ship Management Co, were detected off Indonesia's Kalimantan island.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said 25 of the crew members were Chinese, without saying whether the crew were all on one vessel or split between both.
""Our embassy has expressed concern to Indonesia,"" Zhao said. ""We urged them to verify the situation about the Chinese seamen as soon as possible and inform us formally.""
He said China called on Indonesia to conduct an investigation ""fairly and in accordance with the law"".
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah, told Reuters there had been ""initial communication"" with China and Iran, and said further discussion would depend on results from the investigation.
Iran's Foreign Ministry said on Monday the seizure of its tanker was over a technical issue and that it had asked Indonesia to provide more details.
Iran has been accused of seeking to conceal the destination of its oil sales by disabling tracking systems on its tankers.
The Indonesian authorities said the ships concealed their identity by not showing national flags, turning off automatic identification systems and failing to respond to a radio call.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires ships to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards.
""We welcome the Indonesian Coast Guard efforts to counter illicit maritime activity,"" a U.S. embassy spokesman in Jakarta told Reuters, saying Washington supported efforts to ensure IMO standards for safety and environmental compliance were upheld.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday marked the 76th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp by urging people to keep a close watch on ideological extremism, because ""these things can happen again"".
He spoke three weeks after displays of anti-Semitism surfaced at the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6 and two weeks after one of Montreal's largest synagogues was vandalised and almost set on fire.
Speaking at his general audience, held inside the papal library because of coronavirus restrictions, Francis said it was imperative that the world did not forget.
""To remember is an expression of humanity. To remember is a sign of civility. To remember is a condition for a better future of peace and fraternity,"" said Francis, who visited Auschwitz in 2016. 
The Nazis and their allies murdered around 6 million Jews, as well as others, in German-occupied Europe. 
More than a million people, most of them Jews, were killed at Auschwitz in southern Poland, which was liberated by Soviet troops on Jan. 27, 1945. The vast majority were gassed to death.
Francis said society should never let its guard down against the dangers of nationalism.
""To remember also means being careful because these things can happen again, starting with ideological proposals that claim to want to save a people but end up destroying a people and humanity,"" he said.
""Be wary of how this path of death, extermination and brutality started,"" he said, referring to the Nazis' rise to power in the 1930s on a wave a extreme nationalism.
At the U.S. Capitol riot, some supporters of former President Donald Trump wore clothes bearing anti-Semitic messages or displayed Nazi symbols.

One wore a T-shirt reading ""Camp Auschwitz"" and another wore a T-shirt with the inscription ""6MWE,"" a far-right acronym that stands for ""6 Million Wasn't Enough"".

The news is another headache for Suga whose approval rating has tumbled because of dissatisfaction with his handling of the pandemic, which critics have called too slow and inconsistent.
""I'm terribly sorry that this happened when we are asking people not to eat out after 8 p.m. and to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings,"" Suga told parliament.
""Each lawmaker should behave to gain the public's understanding.""
Japan this month issued a state of emergency in Tokyo and other areas to tame a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases. The measure includes a request for restaurants and bars to close by 8 p.m. although there are currently no penalties for non-compliance.
""My behaviour was careless at a time when we are asking people to be patient,"" Jun Matsumoto, a senior lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, told reporters.
Matsumoto was speaking following a Daily Shincho magazine report that he had visited two night clubs in Tokyo's posh Ginza district after dining at an Italian restaurant last Monday.
Kiyohiko Toyama, a lawmaker from the coalition's junior partner Komeito, also apologised after tabloid Shukan Bunshun reported he had visited a high-end night club in Ginza until late last Friday. 
Other incidents have stoked public anger.
LDP lawmaker Nobuteru Ishihara was swiftly admitted to hospital despite not showing symptoms after he tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Friday.
Yet Japan has more than 35,000 people recuperating at home as hospitals struggle to provide beds for COVID-19 patients and at least 25 people died while at home, according to a recent survey by broadcaster TBS.

""I can't feel sorry enough for the people who died in agony in their own homes after not being able to find a hospital,"" said one Twitter user.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hundreds of police guarded the historic Red Fort in the heart of the Indian capital on Wednesday following violent clashes between farmers and authorities in which one person was killed and at least 80 injured. 
Tens of thousands of farmers, protesting against reforms of the agriculture sector that they say benefit big private buyers at the expense of growers, have been camped on the outskirts of the city for two months.
A protest parade of tractors around the city's fringes to coincide with Tuesday's Republic Day celebrations turned into chaos when some farmers diverged from agreed routes, breaking through barricades and clashing with police, who used tear gas and batons to try to restrain them.
Some farmers carrying ceremonial swords reached as far as the Red Fort, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi gives an annual speech, where they scaled outer walls and hoisted flags.
By Tuesday evening police had removed protesters from the fort complex but a heavy security presence remained on Wednesday.
Agriculture employs about half of India's population of 1.3 billion, and unrest among an estimated 150 million landowning farmers is one of the biggest tests Modi has faced since coming to power in 2014. 
While the protests are beginning to undermine support for Modi in the countryside, he retains a solid majority in parliament and his government has shown no sign of bending to farmers' demands.
The government says agriculture reform will open up new opportunities for farmers.
Police said they had registered 22 cases against protesters including ""rioting, damage to public property and assault on public servants with deadly weapons"" in several locations.
Roads across the New Delhi remained closed while extra police, including paramilitary were at protest sites on the outskirts.
The government blocked the internet in some parts of the capital, and mobile speeds were low.
Tuesday's violence was condemned by Samyukt Kisan Morcha, the group of farm unions organising the protests. They are due to meet later on Wednesday to decide on a response to the violence.
Farm leaders from the eastern state of Odisha to the western state of Gujarat said on Wednesday they would continue to support protesters in Delhi. 
""We have already made it clear that we want all three agriculture bills to be repealed,"" said Raman Randhawa, a farm leader from Rajasthan state. 

""We will not step back before the laws are scrapped totally by the government.""

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar launched a COVID-19 vaccination programme on Wednesday, with healthcare staff and volunteer medical workers the first to receive shots of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University vaccine donated by neighbouring India. 
The Southeast Asian country managed to contain the number of COVID-19 cases early in the pandemic, but is now fighting a second wave, recording more than 138,000 cases and 3,082 deaths. 
Last week, Myanmar received 1.5 million doses of the vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, amid a diplomatic drive by New Delhi to supply neighbouring countries just as regional rival China has also pledged vaccine consignments.
""This should create a situation to reduce the rate of infection, so it is such a relief for healthcare workers,"" Tun Myint, a health ministry official at Yangon General Hospital, told reporters.
The number of daily new COVID-19 cases has dropped recently, though medical experts say it is unlikely to provide a full picture given relatively low testing rates.
""We are so tired from the long fight"" against the pandemic, said volunteer medical worker Khant Ko Ko, who received a vaccine shot at the Ayeyarwady Centre in Yangon where coronavirus patients are treated.
Myanmar's fragile healthcare system has relied heavily on thousands of volunteers to assist during the pandemic and some workers at the centre proudly pointed to the spots on their upper arms where they had been vaccinated. 
In the capital Napyitaw, Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi witnessed vaccinations at a hospital and warned that people still needed to keep up their guard against the virus.
""I worry some people will become careless,"" she was quoted by online news portal Myanmar Now as saying. 
Myanmar has an ambitious target to vaccinate the whole population of about 54 million people this year.
The health ministry has said up to 30 million additional doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine have been ordered with a further two million due to arrive by the first week of February.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi during a visit this month promised Myanmar 300,000 doses of a Chinese COVID-19 vaccine.

The two countries are at loggerheads over the right of some 150,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Transcarpathia in western Ukraine to use their native tongue, especially in education. The region borders Hungary.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government in Budapest has responded by blocking Kyiv's efforts to build closer ties with NATO and the European Union, of which Hungary is a member. 
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that he would meet his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba to ""discuss ways to stop these negative trends... or at least sketch a way out"".
""Unfortunately the Hungary-Ukraine relationship has gone in a very bad direction after a temporary thaw,"" he said.
Overnight, Szijjarto added, Hungarian diplomatic missions in Ukraine received threats ""from people claiming to be Ukrainian patriots promising all sorts of bloodletting in the event of our talks taking place"".
He gave no further details. Kuleba said the Ukrainian police were investigating the threats, which he said appeared to originate from outside Ukraine.
Kuleba also struck a firm tone towards Hungary.
""Nobody should think it is possible to come to Kyiv and dictate any conditions,"" he said on Facebook, adding that he expected Hungary to make concrete proposals to end their row.
Ukraine angered Hungary in 2017 with a law restricting the use of minority languages in schools. Ukraine has large Russian, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Romanian and Polish minorities as well as Hungarian.

The enmity has wider dimensions. Hungary's Orban has forged good ties with President Vladimir Putin's Russia and has called for the lifting of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow over its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine and its support for pro-Russian separatists battling Kyiv's forces in eastern Ukraine.

New COVID-19 cases in the Russian capital have not exceeded 3,000 in the past week and more than 50% of beds in coronavirus hospitals were vacant for the first time since mid-June, Sobyanin wrote on his personal blog. 
Russia, which launched a voluntary vaccination programme with the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine in December, has seen cases steadily fall in the last month, since a record daily rise on Dec. 24. It has resisted imposing a strict new lockdown, relying instead on targeted measures.
""The pandemic is on the decline and under the circumstances our duty is to create conditions for the quickest possible recovery of the economy,"" said Sobyanin.
""My warmest congratulations to you, friends, on our joint victory and one more step to a return to normal life in the beautiful city of Moscow.
The mayor lifted a ban on entertainment venues, including restaurants, bars and nightclubs, serving customers between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., a measure that has been in place since Nov. 13.
He also said that businesses would no longer have to have at least 30% of employees working remotely.
""Please remember that the likelihood of being infected with coronavirus, though reduced, still exists. The fight is not yet over. We still should exercise caution,"" Sobyanin said.
Measures requiring state-run universities to operate remotely, with distanced learning for students, would be reviewed on Feb. 6, Sobyanin said.

On Monday, over 1,600 party delegates began nine days of meetings, mostly behind closed doors, at a five-yearly congress. The meetings will pick a new leadership team, aiming to bolster Vietnam's ongoing economic success - and the legitimacy of the Party's rule.
Trong, 76, who is also Vietnam's president, had been widely tipped to continue as party chief despite health issues and old age - which should technically disqualify him for the position, although ""special case"" exceptions are granted. 
""According to the Party Charter, members of the Central Committee up for re-election must not be over 60 and re-elected Politburo members must be under 65,"" delegate Hau A Lenh told the state-run Tien Phong newspaper.
""The General Secretary and President is one of the overage nominees and a special case,"" Lenh told Tien Phong.
Vietnam has no paramount ruler and is officially led by four 'pillars': the chief of its Communist Party, a president, a prime minister and the National Assembly chair.
While ascent to the highest levels of Vietnamese politics is governed by party regulations, in reality the highly secretive process revolves around building consensus and vying for control of the powerful, decision-making Politburo. 
That means exceptions to rules are often granted - especially if consensus on the top candidates cannot be reached.
Since coming to power in 2011, Trong has become one of Vietnam's most powerful figures in decades after he emerged on top in a power struggle against the former prime minister at the last congress in 2016.
His ""blazing furnace"" crackdown on corruption, as it has been officially dubbed, has seen dozens of high level officials - including one politburo member - sentenced to lengthy jail terms.

Government critics have described the crackdown as politically motivated.

(Reuters) - As the 76th anniversary on Wednesday of the liberation of Auschwitz draws closer, Bill Harvey, who survived the concentration camp, said he was shocked by displays of anti-Semitism during the U.S. Capitol riot.
Some of the supporters of former President Donald Trump who broke into and ransacked the seat of Congress on Jan. 6 wore clothes bearing anti-Semitic messages, or displayed Nazi symbols. 
""I never thought I was going to live in this country and witness something like that,"" Harvey, 96, said, calling it ""very, very sad.""
Harvey, interviewed by Zoom from his Los Angeles home on Monday, expressed concern that the lessons that should have been learned from World War Two's Nazi Holocaust are fading.
The Nazis and their allies murdered around 6 million Jews, as well as others, in German-occupied Europe. 
More than a million people, by far most of them Jews, were killed at Auschwitz in southern Poland, which was liberated by Soviet troops on Jan. 27, 1945. The vast majority were gassed to death.
Harvey said he lost 37 members of his family at Auschwitz, including his mother and his father.
""It's unbelievable how much hatred we experience right now, so I'm very sad and disappointed,"" he added.
He said the attack on the Capitol in Washington reminded him of the misinformation and propaganda that accompanied the rise of the Nazis in Germany before the war.
The images also shocked people like Michele Gold, who runs the Holocaust Museum L.A. and whose mother was a Holocaust survivor.
""When we reflect back on Jan. 6th ... it was horrific,"" Gold said in an interview on Monday.
""It wasn't the tipping point, but I think it was a very strong reminder of what can happen if education and memory and history goes unchecked."" 
Gold took particular notice of a sweatshirt saying ""Camp Auschwitz"" on the front and ""staff"" on the back, worn by one rioter.
After the war, Harvey said, he never expected to see a swastika again.
""None of those symbols truly portray what we went through every single day,"" added Harvey, who has spent recent years lecturing at high schools, prisons and museums about his wartime experiences.

""We never want the history of the Holocaust to be a footnote in the history books,"" said Gold. ""We need to talk about the Holocaust, we need to teach about the Holocaust because it is the most effective way to combat anti-Semitism and racism in all its forms ... and it's never been as important as it is today.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's vaccination roll-out faces logistical hurdles that could further delay the slow-moving campaign, experts and officials say, complicating plans to deliver widescale coronavirus inoculations in time for the Olympics.
Already the last major industrial country to start mass vaccinations, Japan is likely to be hampered on the ground by a lack of containers and dry ice and difficulties in recruiting medical staff, more than a dozen people involved in the inoculation drive told Reuters.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said vaccines are critical to holding a successful Olympics after last year's delay. The first shots for medical workers are planned at the end of February, leaving just 145 days until the start of the Games on July 23. 
Japan will need to deliver about 870,000 injections a day to inoculate half its population by then, with each person needing two shots of the vaccine.
""The government's plan puts a big burden on the individual municipalities in giving out the vaccines,"" said Koji Wada, an adviser on the government's COVID-19 response. ""The big metropolitan areas like Tokyo may have the infrastructure to roll out the vaccinations smoothly, but more rural areas... could have more difficulty.""
Companies that specialise in moving medicines say there may not be enough specialised containers to transport the  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) vaccine, which has to be stored at minus 75 degrees Celsius, much colder than standard freezers. 
A government source told Reuters that officials did not begin assessing whether there were enough containers or dry ice to pack freezer boxes until late last year. 
Japan's vaccination tsar, Taro Kono, outlined the scale of the challenge last week. The coordination of medical workers, transport, freezer production, needle disposal and dealing with local governments are handled by different ministries, he said on Twitter.
Medical staff, already exhausted from caring for a third, deadly wave of infections, will need to be mobilised to give out shots. 
The vaccine is still not approved, although that is widely expected by the middle of next month. Ahead of that, the health ministry on Wednesday carried out a mock inoculation exercise in a college gym in Kawasaki, 17 miles (27 km) south of Tokyo.
DRY ICE (NYSE:ICE) 
Japan has purchased enough Pfizer vaccines to inoculate 72 million people, more than half its population. The government is buying some 20,000 speciality coolers and sourcing massive quantities of dry ice for its transportation.
Japan produces about 350,000 tonnes of dry ice per year, but it's mostly for food preservation, according to an official with one of the major makers. To transport the vaccine, the government will need either a granular or powder type of ice, which can keep temperatures colder than the standard dry-ice blocks used for food.
""It's not just a case of being able to switch a part on a machine, the production method (for the ice) is different,"" said the official, who asked not to be identified. ""It would take several months to retool.""
Transport company Nippon Express Co Ltd was involved in discussions to distribute Pfizer's vaccine, but was depending on the drugmaker to provide special containers, a spokesman said. 
The company is building four specialised warehouses across Japan to store medical products, but those won't be ready until February and aren't designed for the super cold needed for Pfizer's vaccine, he said. 
FREEZERS
Nihon Freezer Co, which makes industrial refrigerators, is making 2,300 coolers for the government, but without a formal contract until the first vaccines are approved, a company official said. 
Those can be plugged in to any 100V outlet, the standard in Japan, although temporary vaccination centres such as schools may need rewiring. 
""We have made about half of them and should have the remainder finished by June,"" the official said about the freezers, which are manufactured in Denmark. ""Finding enough components has been difficult because of the sudden increase in production.""
Medical equipment maker PHC Corp, which has been tapped by the government for ultra-low temperature freezers, said it is operating its main plant round-the-clock.
Once delivered, the vaccines must be administered by already overstretched medical workers. A Kyodo News survey showed about 80% of prefectural governments were concerned about having enough staff to give injections.
Multiple front-line doctors have said they lack manpower to deal with the crisis.
Nurses from the Self-Defense Forces have already been deployed to some pandemic-stricken cities, and could be called on again, a defence official said. The SDF has about 2,000 doctors and nurses qualified to give injections, though all can't be spared, he said.
Japan has also contracted for hundreds of millions more vaccine doses from multiple overseas makers, but those won't be mobilised for months.
That could add to doubts about the Olympics, but hurrying along the process would be worse, said Yoshihito Niki, an infectious disease specialist at Showa University Hospital.

""It's better to move more cautiously and carefully with vaccinations than to make local municipalities rush forward with preparations,"" he said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's parliament on Tuesday approved a Cabinet reshuffle that deepened the conflict between the prime minister and the president, as hundreds protested outside the heavily barricaded parliament over social inequality and police abuses.
Riot police turned water cannon on protesters outside the parliament earlier on Tuesday, trying to quell the largest rally since demonstrations began this month.
Hundreds of protesters had marched from the Ettadhamen district of the capital, Tunis, where young people have clashed with police several nights this month, and were joined by hundreds more near the parliament. 
Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi named 11 new ministers and said he hoped it would inject new blood into his government.
‮""‬Young people protesting outside parliament reminds us of our priorities. Their protests are legitimate‮ ‬and the government will listen to the angry youth,‮""‬ he said.
But President Kais Saied indicated on Monday he would reject the Cabinet reshuffle, condemned the absence of women among the new ministers and said some likely new Cabinet members may have conflicts of interest.
Saied, who appointed Mechichi last year but has taken issue with some of his moves, said he would not swear in any ministers suspected of corruption. 
Police blocked the march with barricades to prevent protesters approaching the parliament building where lawmakers were debating the government reshuffle. 
""The government that only uses police to protect itself from the people - it has no more legitimacy,"" said one protester, Salem Ben Saleh, who is unemployed. 
Later, police also blocked Avenue Habib Bourguiba, the broad tree-lined boulevard that is home to the Interior Ministry and where major protests have traditionally taken place, as demonstrators tried to gather there. 
ARAB SPRING ANNIVERSARY 
Protests flared earlier this month on the 10th anniversary of Tunisia's 2011 revolution that inspired that Arab Spring and introduced democracy in the North African country.
Political paralysis and economic decline have soured many Tunisians on the fruits of the uprising.
The political deadlock in Tunisia since elections in 2019 has stymied efforts to address festering economic problems, with both foreign lenders and the main labour union demanding reforms. 
Last year, as the global coronavirus pandemic struck, Tunisia's economy shrank by more than 8%. The fiscal deficit rose above 12% of gross domestic product, ballooning public debt to more than 90% of GDP. 
The nightly clashes between young people and police have been matched by growing daytime protests at which demonstrators have chanted slogans including: ""The people want the fall of the regime"" - echoing Arab Spring uprisings. 
On Tuesday, with anger high over the death on Monday of a young man whose family said had been hit by a tear gas canister, protesters chanted against the security forces.
In Sbeitla, the hometown of Haykel Rachdi, who was buried on Tuesday, mourners later clashed with police, witnesses said. 
As parliamentary debate on the reshuffle paused, some opposition lawmakers left parliament to join the protest outside. 
""Mechichi has transformed this into a police state. ... No work, no development, no investment... just police against the people,"" said Imed, another protester who did not want to give his family name.

""Much as we disagree with the ICC’s actions relating to the Afghanistan and Israeli/Palestinian situations, the sanctions will be thoroughly reviewed as we determine our next steps,"" the spokesman said in a written response. 
The Trump administration last year accused the Hague-based tribunal of infringing on U.S. national sovereignty when it authorized an investigation into war crimes committed by Afghan forces, the Taliban or U.S. troops. 
It targeted court staff, including prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, with asset freezes and travel bans for investigating American citizens without U.S. consent. The United States is not a member of the court.
Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also opposed an investigation launched in 2019 into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian Territories, including by Israeli forces.

The new U.S. administration supports reforms ""to help the court better achieve its core mission of punishing and deterring atrocity crimes"" and may cooperate with the ICC in ""exceptional cases,"" the State Department spokesman added.

KINGSTON (Reuters) - Jamaican police said on Tuesday they had detained a person of interest as part of their investigation into an attack over the weekend on six homeless men in Kingston in which four were hacked to death and two critically injured.
While Jamaica has one of the highest homicide rates in the world, the attack was particularly grisly. All suffered chop wounds to the head and the two who survived were in a critical state, police said.
More worrying still to the local homeless population, this was not the first such occurrence and could be the work of a serial killer. 
Several years ago, homeless men were the victims of a pattern of similar attacks, killed while they were sleeping, said Dennis Brooks, a spokesman for the Jamaica Constabulary Force.
“We will spare no effort in investigating the heinous and barbaric murders of these men who are among our society’s most vulnerable,"" Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness said. 
Minister of Local Government Desmond McKenzie said the incident was a reminder ""to ensure that the vulnerable among us are never seen or treated as expendable,” urging the homeless population to stay in shelters. 
Some were defiant, though, and preferred the relative freedom of the streets over the constraints of shelters.
Lying on some cardboard on a city sidewalk, flanked by two shopping bags full of possessions, Zenas Gayle, 55, said he would not consider going to a shelter although there was always a level of fear from living on the streets of Kingston. 
""But if anybody goes for me (attacks me), I will go back,” he said. 
Over 1,300 people were murdered last year in Jamaica, with gang violence to blame for much of the violence, and several communities remain under a state of emergency, under constant watch by security forces.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two men have been extradited from Australia to face U.S. criminal charges over an alleged scheme to bilk hundreds of thousands of mobile phone users out of more than $50 million for unwanted text messaging services, U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said on Tuesday.
Both Michael Pearse and Yongchao Liu arrived in the United States on Monday, prosecutors said. The defendants and their co-conspirators allegedly used a practice they called ""auto-subscribing"" to charge monthly fees for unsolicited messages about celebrity gossip, horoscopes, jokes, love tips and trivia, without customers' knowledge or permission.
Prosecutors said Pearse was the chief executive and Liu was a Java development engineer for a company called Bullroarer. 
According to court papers, Bullroarer was affiliated with Tatto Inc, a company that purchased large numbers of mobile phone numbers to target with messages.
Victims were charged $9.99 a month even if they ignored or deleted the messages, and were often unaware anything was amiss until unintelligible charges such as ""96633IQ16CALL8668611606"" began appearing on their phone bills, prosecutors said.
The scheme allegedly ran from 2011 to 2013. Several other alleged co-conspirators have also been charged, including Lin Miao, who prosecutors said ran Tatto.
Prosecutors charged Pearse, a 52-year-old Australian national, and Liu, a 33-year-old Chinese national, with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Pearse was also charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering.
Lawyers for the defendants could not immediately be located.
Miao pleaded guilty in a related criminal case in 2015. A year earlier, Miao and several corporate entities settled related U.S. Federal Trade Commission civil charges by surrendering more than $10 million of assets.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's top general said on Tuesday that its military was refreshing its operational plans against Iran and that any U.S. return to a 2015 nuclear accord with Tehran would be ""wrong.""
The remarks are an apparent signal to U.S. President Joe Biden to tread cautiously in any diplomatic engagement with Iran. Such comments by Israel's military chief of staff on U.S. policymaking are rare and likely would have been pre-approved by the Israeli government.
""A return to the 2015 nuclear agreement, or even if it is a similar accord with several improvements, is bad and wrong from an operational and strategic point of view,"" Lieutenant-General Aviv Kohavi said in an address to Tel Aviv University's Institute for National Security Studies.
Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, abandoned the nuclear agreement in 2018, a move that was welcomed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who criticised the sanctions relief it offered and warned of the likelihood of Iranian nuclear arms development after its expiration.
Antony Blinken, confirmed on Tuesday as Biden's secretary of state, said last week the United States was ""a long way"" from deciding whether to rejoin the deal and it would need to see what Iran actually did to resume complying with the pact. 
Since Washington pulled out of the deal, Iran has gradually breached its key limits, building up its stockpile of low enriched uranium, enriching uranium to higher levels of purity, and installing centrifuges in ways barred by the accord.
Kohavi said those actions by Iran, which denies it is seeking atomic arms, showed it could ultimately decide to push forward rapidly towards building a nuclear weapon.
""In light of this fundamental analysis, I have instructed the Israel Defense Forces to prepare a number of operational plans, in addition to those already in place,"" Kohavi said.
""It will be up to the political leadership, of course, to decide on implementation, but these plans need to be on the table.""
Netanyahu had threatened possible Israeli strikes against Iran in the run-up to the accord. But a senior Israeli officer, who spoke to reporters in 2015 on condition of anonymity, underscored differences in Israel over the issue by saying a deal had potential security benefits.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 03:40PM ET</span>",Indian farm protesters battle police to plant flags at historic Red Fort,"By Devjyot Ghoshal and Adnan Abidi
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of Indian farmers protesting against agricultural reforms on Tuesday overwhelmed police and stormed into the historic Red Fort complex in New Delhi after tearing down barricades and driving tractors through roadblocks.
Police fired tear gas in an unsuccessful bid to force the protesters back. One protester was killed, a witness said, and Delhi police said 86 officers had been injured across the city.
Some of those who scaled the walls of Red Fort carried ceremonial swords, scattering police who tried to prevent them from entering. Footage from Reuters partner ANI showed police jumping from the ramparts to escape. Once inside, the protesters hoisted flags.
Angered by laws they say help large, private buyers at the expense of producers, famers have camped outside the capital for almost two months, posing one of the biggest challenges to Prime Minister Narendra Modi since he came to power in 2014.
""Modi will hear us now, he will have to hear us now,"" said Sukhdev Singh, 55, a farmer from the northern state of Punjab.
The body of one protester draped in an Indian tricolour lay in the street after the tractor he rode overturned in one clash, said a witness, Vishu Arora.
""He died right there,"" Arora said. 
A Reuters witness saw several police and protesters with head injuries following clashes at the Red Fort, from whose ramparts Modi delivers an annual speech. 
The government ordered internet services in some parts of the capital to be blocked, according to mobile carrier Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea, in an attempt to prevent further unrest. 
LOST CONTROL
Tens of thousands of farmers began the day in a convoy of tractors festooned with Indian and union flags along the city's fringes.
But hundreds of protesters - some on horseback - broke away from approved routes, heading for government buildings in the city centre where the annual Republic Day parade of troops and military hardware was taking place. 
They commandeered cranes and used ropes to tear down roadblocks, forcing constables in riot gear to give way, Reuters witnesses said. A second group rode tractors to a traffic junction, also breaching barricades after clashes with police. 
Police accused those who diverged from the agreed routes of ""violence and destruction"".
""They have caused great damage to public property and many police personnel have also been injured,"" a police statement said. 
Protest organiser Samyukt Kisan Morcha said the groups deviating from set routes did not represent the majority of farmers.
""We also condemn and regret the undesirable and unacceptable events that have taken place today and dissociate ourselves from those indulging in such acts,"" the group of farm unions said in a statement. 
Amarinder Singh, chief minister of Punjab state, where many of the protesters came from, called the clashes ""shocking"". 
""The violence by some elements is unacceptable,"" he said in a tweet. ""It'll negate goodwill generated by peacefully protesting farmers.""
FARMER PRESSURE
Agriculture employs about half of India's population of 1.3 billion, and unrest among an estimated 150 million landowning farmers worries the government.
Nine rounds of talks with farmers' unions have failed to end the protests, as farm leaders rejected the government's offer to delay the laws for 18 months, making a push for repeal instead. 
""The farm organisations have a very strong hold,"" said Ambar Kumar Ghosh, an analyst at New Delhi think tank the Observer Research Foundation.
""They have the resources to mobilise support, and to continue the protest for a long time. They have also been very successful in keeping the protest really focused.""

1207,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 02:25PM ET</span>","Exclusive: U.N. report accuses Yemen government of money-laundering, Houthis of taking state revenue","By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Independent U.N. sanctions monitors accused Yemen's government, in a report seen by Reuters on Tuesday, of money-laundering and corruption ""that adversely affected access to adequate food supplies"" and said the Houthi group collected at least $1.8 billion in state revenue in 2019 to help fund its war effort.
The annual report to the U.N. Security Council on the implementation of international sanctions on Yemen coincides with U.N. officials saying that the country is on the verge of a large-scale famine with millions of civilians at risk.
The monitors said Saudi Arabia deposited $2 billion with the Central Bank of Yemen in January 2018 under a development and reconstruction program. The money was intended to fund credit to buy commodities - such as rice, sugar, milk and flour - to strengthen food security and stabilize domestic prices.
The U.N. investigation found that Yemen's Central Bank broke its foreign exchange rules, manipulated the foreign exchange market and ""laundered a substantial part of the Saudi deposit in a sophisticated money-laundering scheme"" that saw traders receive a $423 million windfall. 
""The $423 million is public money, which has been illegally transferred to private corporations. Documents provided by the Central Bank of Yemen fail to explain why they adopted such a destructive strategy,"" according to the U.N. report. 
The monitors said they view it as ""an act of money-laundering and corruption perpetrated by government institutions, in this case the Central Bank of Yemen and the Government of Yemen, in collusion with well-placed businesses and political personalities, to the benefit of a select group of privileged traders and businessmen.""
Yemen's government and the Central Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusations.
The U.N. report said that in areas controlled by the Houthis the group was collecting taxes and other state revenue needed to pay government salaries and provide basic services to citizens. It estimates the Houthis diverted at least $1.8 billion in 2019, ""a large portion"" of which was used to fund their war effort. 
The Houthis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusations in the U.N. report. 
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis in a war widely seen as a proxy conflict between U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as Yemen's suffering is also worsened by an economic collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The U.N. monitors reported ""there is a growing body of evidence that shows that individuals or entities within the Islamic Republic of Iran are engaged in sending weapons and weapons components to the Houthis"" in violation of a U.N. arms embargo. Iran denies such support for the Houthis.

1208,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 01:45PM ET</span>","At U.N., Washington assures support for two-state solution in Middle East","By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden's administration supports a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians and will overturn several Trump administration decisions, the acting U.S. envoy to the United Nations assured the Security Council on Tuesday.
The Palestinians want a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with east Jerusalem as its capital, all territory captured by Israel in 1967. However, under a failed peace proposal by former President Donald Trump, Washington would have recognized Jewish settlements in occupied territory as part of Israel.
Acting U.S. envoy to the U.N., Richard Mills, told the Security Council Washington would urge Israel and the Palestinians ""to avoid unilateral steps that make a two-state solution more difficult, such as annexation of territory, settlement activity, demolition, incitement to violence and providing compensation for individuals imprisoned for acts of terrorism"".
""We hope it will be possible to start working to slowly build competence on both sides to create an environment in which we might once again be able to help advance a solution,"" Mills told the 15-member body.
He said the Biden administration intended to restore Palestinian aid and take steps to re-open the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Washington. Under Trump, Washington cut some $360 million in annual funding for the U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).
""We do not do these steps as a favor to the Palestinian leadership,"" Mills said. ""U.S. assistance benefits millions of ordinary Palestinians and helps to preserve a stable environment that benefits both Palestinians and Israelis.""
He added that Washington steadfastly supported its ally Israel and would continue to push back against any bias toward the country at the United Nations or other international bodies.
The Biden administration would continue to urge other countries to normalize ties with Israel, while recognizing it was ""not substitute for Israeli-Palestinian peace"", Mills said.

In what is widely seen as one of Trump's few foreign policy successes, Washington secured agreements late last year by four Arab states - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco - to start normalizing relations with Israel.

Arlene Foster, first minister in the Northern Ireland government, said the accounts of cold and uncaring treatment were truly harrowing, and the separation of mothers from their children a terrible legacy.
The research carried out by a team of university academics found that the mortality rate for babies born in institutions in Northern Ireland was not as high as the 15% found by an inquiry into the Irish Republic this month. In part this was because women did not tend to stay as long after they gave birth.
But it found that women, including victims of rape, incest and other crimes, were often treated cruelly and put under severe pressure to give their children up for adoption.
At least 10,500 women and girls, some as young as 12, spent time at the homes in the British-run region between 1922 and 1990, when a ""culture of stigma, shame and secrecy"" was attached to unmarried mothers.
""In the majority of testimony gathered ... women provided vivid accounts of being made to feel ashamed about their pregnancy and suggested that the atmosphere was authoritarian and judgmental,"" said the report, by academics from Ulster University and Queen's University Belfast.
A report earlier this month on so-called Mother and Baby Homes south of the border in the Irish Republic, where such institutions were overwhelmingly run by the Catholic Church, found that 9,000 children had died in them in a 70-year period.

The issue has prompted a further reappraisal of the Catholic Church's role in what had long been one of parts of Europe where it retained the most influence. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin formally apologised for the ""profound generational wrong visited upon Irish mothers and their children"".

1210,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 01:19PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hong Kong police obtain financial records of arrested democracy activists,"By Jessie Pang, Alun John and Sumeet Chatterjee
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong authorities are scrutinizing the financial records of pro-democracy activists as they crack down on political opposition, according to some activists and a senior bank executive.
Six pro-democracy activists told Reuters that Hong Kong police obtained some of their bank records without their consent and questioned them about certain transactions after they were arrested earlier this month on suspicion of subversion under the territory’s national security law. 
The number of requests for customers’ financial records by Hong Kong police has more than doubled over the past six months or so, an executive at a major retail bank in Hong Kong with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The executive said the number of people affected likely remains in double figures overall. The person said the increase was due to requests for information about pro-democracy activists. 
The increasing use of bank records in questioning activists, which has not previously been reported, shows police in the Chinese-run city are using the full extent of their powers to investigate people suspected of breaking the stringent national security law which was introduced on June 30, according to the six activists.
Some of the banks involved include  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) and its Hang Seng Bank Ltd subsidiary,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C) unit Citibank and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc. Representatives of those banks declined to comment on individual accounts. 
Banks in Hong Kong have little choice but to comply with police requests, the senior bank executive told Reuters: ""The aggrieved party can go to the court if they think their accounts were frozen or their transaction details were shared for wrong reasons, but there's very little we can do here."" 
On Tuesday HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn told British lawmakers that his bank wasn't in a position to ""judge the motives"" of Hong Kong police when they made requests to see accounts.
""I can't cherry-pick which laws to follow,"" Quinn told a committee of lawmakers in a hearing over the lender's freezing of Hong Kong democrats' bank accounts. He added that the bank would have to comply with police requests in any country in the world.
A Hong Kong police representative declined to comment on why officers were seeking activists’ financial records, saying the department would not disclose details of its operations or investigations. The Hong Kong government did not respond to a request for comment on how or why police sought the bank information of arrested suspects. 
Police in Hong Kong, as in most places in the world, have long been able to request customer information from banks as part of criminal investigations. Reuters could not determine whether the national security law has made it easier for police to get hold of individuals’ bank records. 
The law does not mention access to bank information. It does give authorities the power to seize funds they believe are the proceeds of, or are intended to be used for, breaking the national security law. Authorities have not announced the seizure of any funds under that provision. 
A spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which regulates the banking sector, said: ""Financial institutions are expected to cooperate with (law enforcement agencies) on investigations and law enforcement actions.""
CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN FOR VOTE 
Ninety-four people have been arrested under the national security law, which punishes anything authorities regard as secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. 
China’s parliament imposed the law on Hong Kong in response to sometimes violent protests in 2019. The protests were prompted by fears that Beijing was stifling the city’s freedoms, guaranteed by the “one country, two systems” formula agreed when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong say the law is only aimed at a few “troublemakers” and not wider rights that underpin the city’s role as a gateway for capital flows in to and out of China. 
The six activists who spoke to Reuters were among 53 arrested in a dawn sweep on Jan. 6. They were questioned about their roles in a July vote organized by pro-democracy parties to choose candidates for a legislative council election that was scheduled for September. The legislative council election was later postponed. The Hong Kong government has described the pro-democracy vote as part of an attempt to overthrow the government. None of the arrested activists have been charged and all have been released on bail.
One of the arrested activists, Owen Chow, told Reuters that police obtained his financial records from Citibank, Hang Seng Bank and PayMe, a phone payment app operated by HSBC, and asked him about the source of funds of up to HK$100,000 ($13,000) paid into the three accounts. He said police confiscated his debit and credit cards issued by Citibank and Hang Seng Bank. 
Another activist, Ventus Lau, told Reuters that police showed him paper copies of statements from his Hang Seng Bank account and questioned him regarding a ""few dozen"" transactions that took place in the run-up to the vote. Lau told Reuters he used the account to receive money from a crowdfunding campaign to finance the unofficial election.
Four other arrested activists, who asked not to be named, told Reuters police produced copies of their bank records during questioning. Two of those activists said police showed them copies of their bank statements from Standard Chartered Bank. The other two declined to say which banks were involved. 
Police requests for customer data are a further headache for international banks caught in the crossfire between China and the United States over Hong Kong, according to three executives at foreign banks in Hong Kong who spoke to Reuters. Tension between the two countries has escalated since the introduction of the national security law, which Beijing said was necessary to restore stability, but Washington characterized as an assault on democracy. 
Shortly after the passage of the law, the U.S. government barred American companies and people from doing business with Chief Executive Carrie Lam and 10 other Hong Kong and Chinese officials. International banks including HSBC, Hong Kong’s largest bank, have complied with the U.S. sanctions.
Hong Kong authorities have compelled banks to freeze the accounts of several pro-democracy activists, including media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who was charged in December under the national security law and is now in prison in Hong Kong awaiting a bail hearing. HSBC froze Lai’s account last year, according to Mark Simon, an associate of Lai. HSBC declined to comment. 

Banks ""are between a rock and a hard place,"" said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies, part of the University of London in Britain. ""When the police come and ask for whatever, as long as it is in accordance with the laws of Hong Kong, they have to comply,"" he said. ""This can conflict with the expectations people have of their multinationals back in their home country.""

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Netherlands braced on Tuesday for a fourth consecutive night of coronavirus anti-lockdown riots, with some shops boarding their windows and sending staff home early for safety.
Dutch police detained more than 180 people on Monday night, when roaming groups set fires, threw rocks and looted stores in several cities.
The Netherlands' first curfew since World War Two was imposed on Saturday despite weeks of falling infections, after the National Institute for Health (RIVM) said a faster-spreading variant first found in England was causing a third of cases.
A hospital in Rotterdam warned visitors of patients to stay away, after rioters tried to attack hospitals in various cities in the past days.
A nationwide appeal issued by law enforcement authorities Tuesday evening called on parents to keep teenagers indoors, warning they could end up with a criminal record and forced to pay for ""enormous damage to cars, shops and public property"".
""We have had riots in the past, but it's rare to have this for several nights across the entire country,"" said National Police spokeswoman Suzanne van de Graaf. ""It's not only in known problem areas, but much more widespread.""
Riot police with shields and batons were called out in more than 10 cities, many of which had issued emergency decrees to provide officers with greater powers to conduct searches. 
Police had scuffled with rioters in several cities late into the night, chasing them down narrow streets with vans or on foot as helicopters hovered overhead.
In Amsterdam on Monday, groups of youths threw fireworks, broke store windows and attacked a police truck, but were broken up by a massive police presence.
Ten police officers were injured in Rotterdam, where 60 rioters were detained overnight after widespread looting and destruction in the city centre, a police spokeswoman said. Supermarkets in the port city were emptied, while rubbish bins and vehicles were set ablaze. 
Two photographers were hurt after being targeted by rock-throwing gangs, one in Amsterdam and another in the nearby town of Haarlem, police said.
Coronavirus infections have been falling in recent weeks, with the number of new cases down by 8% over the past week. A little under 4,000 new infections were reported on Tuesday, the smallest daily increase since Nov 24.
But the RIVM said the situation in the Netherlands was still very serious as a result of the more contagious variant that has caused a massive surge in cases in Britain.
Van de Graaf said much of the aggression during the three days of unrest had been targeted at police officers. More than 470 people have been arrested, with riot police deploying water cannon and officers on horseback in several places.

Schools and non-essential shops across the Netherlands have been shut since mid-December. Bars and restaurants were closed two months earlier. The country's death toll stands at 13,664, with 956,867 infections to date.

Margarita Yudina, 54, was among tens of thousands of people across Russia who protested against the jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Saturday. Police had said the protests were illegal and detained nearly 4,000 people, according to the OVD-Info protest monitoring group. 
The way Yudina was treated at the protests in St Petersburg has become a national scandal after the moment the policeman kicked her in the stomach for asking why he and his colleagues had detained a man was caught on camera and went viral online.
In the video, Yudina is seen falling back on the pavement after being kicked, banging her head hard. Hospital documents show she suffered concussion and needed stitches to the back of her head. 
She says she was taken to intensive care before being moved to a regular hospital ward where she was visited by a police officer who brought her flowers and apologised. 
Yudina says she told the man, who was shown on national television saying he had been sprayed with pepper gas before the incident and that his visor had steamed up meaning he couldn't see clearly, not to worry because she wanted to be left alone. 
She later complained though that she had not learned the officer's full name and that no one from the police had come to take her testimony.
In an interview with the Novaya Gazeta newspaper published on Tuesday, she said she now wanted justice. 
""This case needs to run its legal course,"" she said.
""So I intend to appeal to the Investigative Committee and to find out who attacked me. I want the person who kicked me to be found, named and punished according to the law.""
Rights workers say a wave of criminal cases has already been opened against protesters over Saturday's demonstrations, but that police are seldom held to account.
Navalny's supporters plan to rally again this weekend to demand his release after he was put in pre-trial detention over parole violations he denies. 

The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the violence on Saturday by some protesters was unprecedented and aggressive. Incidences of police violence were far fewer and being investigated, it said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations is still hearing concerns that companies are planning to cancel or suspend business with Yemen despite a U.S. decision to allow all transactions with the Houthi movement ""given this move does not resolve underlying uncertainties,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Tuesday.
The United States on Monday approved all transactions involving Yemen's Houthi movement for the next month as Washington reviews a Trump administration designation of the Iran-aligned group as a foreign terrorist organization.
""With millions of civilians at risk of starvation, Yemen cannot afford even a temporary disruption in commercial activity and it is not yet clear that the new license will prevent those kinds of disruptions,"" Dujarric said. ""We continue to call for a reversal of the designation on humanitarian grounds.""
Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blacklisted the Houthis last week - a day before President Joe Biden took office on Wednesday - despite warnings from the United Nations and aid groups that it would push Yemen into a large-scale famine.
The designation freezes any U.S.-related assets of the Houthis, bans Americans from doing business with them and makes it a crime to provide support or resources to the movement.
U.N. officials and aid groups have said the designation will scare off commercial trade in Yemen, which relies almost solely on imports, creating a gap the humanitarian operation cannot fill regardless of U.S. humanitarian exemptions.
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need.
""Already, about 50,000 people are essentially starving to death in what is essentially a small famine. Another 5 million are just one step behind them,"" U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council earlier this month. 
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis in a war widely seen as a proxy conflict between U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as Yemen's suffering is also worsened by an economic collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 12:10PM ET</span>",Iran will take steps next month to curb short-notice IAEA inspections: official,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran threatened on Tuesday to block short-notice inspections of its nuclear facilities, demanding Washington reverse economic sanctions before it returns to compliance with a nuclear deal that President Joe Biden aims to restore.
Biden, who took office last week, aims to reverse a decision by his predecessor Donald Trump to pull out of the 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers.
The agreement lifted sanctions on Iran in return for curbs to Iran's nuclear programme, but after Trump quit and reimposed sanctions, Iran violated its conditions. Biden says Tehran should return to compliance before sanctions are lifted; Iran wants the sanctions lifted first.
Under the accord, the International Atomic Energy Agency was given wide-ranging access to gather information on Iran's nuclear activities, including the right to demand short-notice inspections of any site it deems necessary.
Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei said the first steps to restrict those inspections would begin in the week from Feb. 19.
""Our law is very clear regarding this issue,"" he told a televised news conference. ""But it does not mean Iran will stop other inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency."" 
Iran's hardline-dominated parliament passed a law in December that obliges the government to harden its nuclear stance if U.S. sanctions are not lifted in two months. 
Iran has repeatedly said it can quickly reverse its violations of the deal if U.S. sanctions are removed. 
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif reiterated that possibility at a news conference in Moscow on Tuesday.
""If favorable actions are taken before that time...Iran will not interfere with the admission of (IAEA) inspectors under the additional protocol,"" he said.
In a later tweet, Zarif repeated that it was up to Washington to make the first move: ""Why on earth should Iran — a country that stood firm & defeated 4 years of a brutal US economic terrorism imposed in violation of JCPOA & UNSC (United Nations Security Council) Resolution — show goodwill gesture first?""
""It was the US that broke the deal—for no reason. It must remedy its wrong; then Iran will respond.""
Iran this month resumed enriching uranium to 20% fissile strength at a nuclear plant, a level Tehran achieved before striking the deal.
A French presidential official said Iran must end its provocations and return to the terms of the deal if it expects the United States to rejoin it.
""If they are serious about negotiations and if they want to obtain a re-engagement of all the stakeholders in the JCPOA, they firstly need to refrain from further provocations and secondly respect what they no longer respect, that's to say their obligations,"" the official told reporters on condition of anonymity. 

The official did not spell out how a lifting of sanctions during a return to compliance would work, but said the French and U.S. administrations were clear on what needed to be done.

The herders from the border village of Wazzani say Israeli patrols crossed into a grey zone on Sunday between a technical fence that separates the two countries and the 'Blue Line' that constitutes the internationally recognised border, and started rounding up livestock, taking seven cows. 
Lebanon and Israel are still in a formal state of war and have long contested their land and maritime borders. 
Israeli Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
""For twenty years and more these cows are there, from the time of the grandparents of our grandparents and this is the first time that someone takes them,"" villager Kamal al-Ahmad, who lost three cows in the incident, told Reuters. 
""I don't know if they did this as a challenge or what?""
A cow is worth around $2,000, meaning the loss of an animal is no small matter to the farmers who are already living through the tough reality of Lebanon's ongoing financial crisis. 
The area near a river where the Wazzani cows graze is only around 200 meters away from Israel. 
The two countries disagree over a border wall Israel started building in 2018. 
A U.N. peacekeeping force monitors the boundary since Israel's military withdrew from south Lebanon in 2000, ending a 22-year occupation.
""We are aware of the alleged incident and we are in touch with both parties in relation to this issue,"" the U.N. Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) spokesperson Andrea Tenenti, told Reuters by phone.
The two countries are also in a maritime dispute over an area in the sea on the edge of three Lebanese offshore energy blocks. 
""God help these people, this is their livelihood,"" Ahmad al-Mohammed, the head of the Wazzani municipality, said of the herders. 
Not far from Wazzani, in another border village called Mais al-Jabal, local teenager Hussein Chartouni complained earlier of the loss of one of his chickens to Israel - earning him the nickname in the village of 'Chicken Hussein'. 
When one of his chickens wandered off behind the border barbed wire, it was snatched and never returned he said. 
""I want my chicken,"" he told Reuters, using the phrase that has now become a hashtag on Twitter.

NAYPYITAW, Myanmar (Reuters) - Myanmar's army warned on Tuesday it would ""take action"" if an election dispute was not settled and declined to rule out staging a coup if its demands were not met, just days out from the convening of a new parliament. 
Military spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun told a new conference there may have been fraud in the November contest, which was won in a landslide by Aung San Suu Kyi's National league for Democracy (NLD) party.
""We will take action according to the constitution and existing laws if they don't resolve the issue,"" he said of the election commission, declining to give further details.
The military wants the poll body to investigate voter lists it said contained discrepancies. 
The NLD claimed a resounding victory in what was the second parliamentary election since the end of decades of strict military rule, during which the party and its supporters were persecuted.
The election was viewed as a referendum on Suu Kyi's fledgling democratic government. 
NLD spokesman Myo Nyunt told Reuters it was up to the election commission to decide whether there had been fraud. A commission spokesman could not be reached for comment. 
Under a constitution it drafted, Myanmar's military gets control of three ministries and a quota of 25% of house seats, a de facto veto on major decisions, ensuring it retains a key stake in national politics. 
Zaw Min Tun sidestepped questions on what the military would do if its concerns about the election were not addressed. 
Asked by reporters if it would cooperate with the NLD government and new legislature when it convenes on Feb. 1, Zaw Min Tun said ""wait and watch on that matter."" 
Asked if he would rule out staging a coup, he said ""cannot say so"". 
""We will take all available action including sending to the Supreme Court,"" he added. 

""We do this because we want a strong democratic system.""

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 07:51AM ET</span>",Conte quits as Italy's PM in tactical bid to build new majority,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte handed in his resignation to the head of state on Tuesday, hoping he would be given an opportunity to put together a new coalition and rebuild his parliamentary majority.
The deepening political crisis is playing out against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 85,000 Italians -- the second highest death toll in Europe after Britain and the sixth highest in the world.
Conte lost his absolute majority in the upper house Senate last week when a junior partner, the Italia Viva party headed by former premier Matteo Renzi, quit in a row over the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis and economic recession.
Efforts to lure centrist and independent senators into the coalition to fill the hole left by Renzi have met little success, leaving Conte no choice but to resign and open a formal government crisis that will give him more time to find a deal.
President Sergio Mattarella will start a rapid round of consultations with party leaders on Wednesday afternoon to test the political waters, his office said. 
If he thinks Conte can secure the necessary backing to pull together a new administration, the president will likely give him a few days to try to finalise a deal and draw up a new cabinet. 
Financial markets edged higher despite the latest political tumult, with investors hopeful that Conte might eventually emerge with a more stable government.
Until now the main coalition parties -- the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and centre-left Democratic Party (PD) -- have backed Conte's efforts to stay in power.
""Conte is the essential element and we need to broaden and relaunch the government's action,"" Debora Serracchiani, the deputy head of the PD, told state broadcaster RAI.
EARLY ELECTION?
However, if Conte cannot find new allies, Mattarella will have to come up with an alternative candidate deemed capable of piecing together a workable coalition. 
If all else fails, the president will have to call an election, two years ahead of schedule, although political analysts say this is the least likely scenario.
Italy's coronavirus crisis has triggered its worst recession since World War Two and the government has been struggling to draw up a plan on how best to spend some 200 billion euros ($240 billion) of European Union funds to help the economy recover.
Renzi has accused Conte of lacking a strategic vision, saying he risked squandering the unprecedented EU bonanza on hand-outs rather than long-term investments.
Conte is a lawyer with no direct political affiliation, but is close to 5-Star, the largest party in parliament. 
He first came to power in 2018 after 5-Star formed an unexpected coalition with the far-right League. When that pact unravelled a year later, he stayed on as head of a new administration involving the 5-Star and leftist parties.
Opinion polls show that Conte is Italy's most popular leader, with an approval rating of 56%, almost 20 points above the next closest politician, according to a poll published by Corriere della Sera daily on Saturday.
If he is ousted from office, political sources have suggested he might try to cash in his popularity by forming his own party or else by taking charge of 5-Star.

Several witnesses also reported hearing two loud bangs and seeing a small plume of smoke above the capital just before 1 P.M. local time (10 A.M. GMT). 
Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV cited local reports of an explosion and videos circulating on social media purporting to show a missile being intercepted over Riyadh. 
There was no immediate comment from Saudi authorities, or any claim of responsibility. 
Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi forces have carried out many cross-border attacks into Saudi using drones and missiles since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen early 2015 to restore the government the Houthis ousted from power.
Missile attacks and drone strikes claimed by Houthi forces have targeted civilian airports and oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, occasionally reaching Riyadh. 
On Saturday, the Saudi-led military coalition operating in Yemen had said it had intercepted and destroyed an ""enemy air target"" launched towards Riyadh. 
The Houthis denied responsibility for that attack, while a hitherto unknown group calling itself Alwiya Alwaad Alhaq, which roughly translates as 'The True Promise Brigades', claimed it.

1219,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2021 07:11AM ET</span>","'Everywhere I am in chains,' says Uganda's Wine after home arrest lifted","KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's opposition leader Bobi Wine accused security forces on Tuesday of humiliating him, his family and staff as he was freed from house arrest in place since a disputed Jan. 14 election that he lost to long-serving President Yoweri Museveni.
Soldiers and police left the 38-year-old pop star's large compound, in a leafy northern suburb of the capital Kampala, in compliance with a court order and under pressure from the United States and other Western countries.
""It has been an experience of isolation, of torture, of humiliation, having our compound turned into a military garrison,"" Wine told Reuters from his garden, wearing a red beret with the words ""People Power. Our Power"". 
""Having our employees traumatised, beaten, an experience of hunger. We were not allowed to access our garden. But again, it has been a reminder that we can overcome any kind of stress.""
Blockaded at home since he voted, Wine has alleged that soldiers touched his wife's breasts when she sought food in the garden, that his gardener was beaten, that food ran out, and there was no milk for an 18-month-old niece trapped with them.
The government said security forces were there for Wine's own protection, while police said food had been delivered by a motorcycle courier each day. The army denied his wife had been assaulted but has not responded to the allegation about the gardener. 
With the vote behind him and fraud protests failing to gain significant traction, Museveni, 76, appears to be calculating that he can mollify pressure from Western allies to free his rival without significant risk to his power base. 
'BORN FREE'
Former guerrilla leader Museveni has long been a Western ally, receiving copious aid and sending troops to fight Islamist militants. But foreign governments are increasingly frustrated over his crackdowns on foes and reluctance to cede power. 
Having for years denounced corruption and nepotism in his songs, Wine rode a wave of youth disillusionment to challenge Museveni's 34-year rule at the ballot box.
But the incumbent was declared winner with 59% of votes versus 35% for Wine. The opposition rejected the result, alleging fraud and unfair conditions, including pre-filled ballot sheets, result tallies showing impossibly high numbers of voters and harassment of opposition polling agents. 
The government denied irregularities, casting Wine as a foreign puppet and troublemaker, with Museveni the sole guarantor of political stability and economic progress. 
Despite the end of the siege, a helicopter circled low over Wine's residence on Tuesday. Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesman Luke Owoyesigyire said that was normal surveillance.
""I was born free and I am free. Only that I am everywhere in chains. As you saw, while the court ordered the police to vacate our premises, you still have police and military helicopters, over us,"" added Wine, looking tired and stressed. 

""General Museveni is reading from the same script as all dictators.""

Von der Leyen said the programme would seek to prepare the EU before the next pandemic hits by seeking to discover and prepare for known and emerging pathogens, and then developing and manufacturing vaccines at scale to respond to them. 
The scheme would secure long-term and predictable funding and bring together cutting-edge tech-companies and blue-chip manufacturers, as well as regulators such as the European Medicines Agencies or the European Commission.

""We know that preparedness is everything. And we know that in a pandemic there is no time to lose. We need this new public-private approach to detect earlier, develop together and manufacture faster at scale,"" von der Leyen said.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - A team of Nepali climbers that made the first winter summit of K2, the world’s second tallest peak, arrived back in the country to a heroes' welcome on Tuesday from crowds of well-wishers.
The 10 men, who climbed the 8,611 metre (28,251 foot) K2 peak on Jan. 16, attributed their success to team spirit and a resolve to raise their country’s pride.
The mountain, that straddles the Pakistan-China border, was first climbed in 1954 but had never been summitted in the winter.
""We succeeded in our effort because we worked as a team,"" Nirmal Purja, the climbing leader, said at a public function to welcome them back. ""If we unite we conquer … if we are divided we fall,"" he added. 
He said the K2 ascent was a huge achievement for all climbers to celebrate. ""It is bigger than winning the World Cup."" 
Purja, 37, also holds the record of climbing the world's 14 highest mountains in the shortest time of six months and one week.
Fans and families placed colourful Buddhist prayer scarves on the climbers' shoulders on their arrival at Nepal’s only international airport in Kathmandu.
""With the success, we made our country proud even by risking our own lives,"" Purja told reporters at the airport, before they were driven around the temple-studded city in an open truck.
All except one of the group are Sherpas, an ethnic group known for their climbing skills more commonly known as support workers for foreign expeditions.

Navalny was remanded in custody for 30 days last week after returning from Germany where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning. He could face years in jail for parole violations and other legal cases he calls trumped up. 
Nikolai Patrushev, secretary of the Security Council, called for Navalny to face the full force of the law in comments that offered a glimpse into the mood inside Russia's security establishment after tens of thousands of Navalny's supporters protested against his jailing on Saturday. 
""He (Navalny), this figure, has repeatedly (and) grossly broken Russian legislation, engaging in fraud concerning large amounts (of money). And as a citizen of Russia he must bear responsibility for his illegal activity in line with the law,"" Patrushev told the Argumenty i Fakty media outlet. 
""The West needs this figure to destabilise the situation in Russia, for social upheaval, strikes and new Maidans,"" Patrushev said, in a reference to the 2014 revolution in Ukraine that ousted a Moscow-backed president. 
When asked about Patrushev's comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was up to a court to make further decisions in the opposition politician's case and that it was not a matter for the Kremlin. 
Navalny faces a court hearing on Feb.2. 
Police detained more than 3,700 people on Saturday as protesters called on the Kremlin to release Navalny. The Kremlin said the protests were illegal.
Peskov on Tuesday said there could be no dialogue with illegal protesters, accusing them of behaving aggressively and of using what he called unprecedented violence against the police.
He said incidences of police violence against protesters, some of which were captured on video, were far fewer and being investigated. 
In a sign that Russian authorities may crack down hard after the protests, the Kommersant newspaper on Tuesday cited unnamed security sources as saying they may open a criminal investigation that would treat the demonstrations as ""mass unrest"". 

The West has called for Navalny's release, but the European Union has said it will refrain from fresh sanctions on Russian individuals if Moscow releases Navalny after 30 days.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - The Iranian and Panamanian-flagged vessels seized by Indonesian authorities for suspected illegal oil transfers are making their way to dock at Batam island in the country's Riau Islands Province for further investigation, a Indonesia coast guard spokesman told Reuters. 
The two supertankers, with crew members from Iran and China, were seized on Sunday in Indonesian waters near Kalimantan island. The MT Horse, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company and MT Freya, managed by Shanghai Future Ship Management Co, had a total of 61 crew members onboard.
""The ships will arrive in Batam at around 3pm (0600GMT) to 4pm later today,"" Wisnu Pramandita, spokesman of the Indonesian coast guard, told Reuters.
Wisnu said some of the crew remained in the supertankers, but others were being detained on coast guard ships for questioning while the investigation was under way.
Wisnu told Reuters on Monday that the ships were ""caught red-handed"" transferring oil from MT Horse to MT Freya and that there was an oil spill around the receiving tanker.
Iran said on Monday that MT Horse was seized over a ""technical issue"" and had asked Indonesia to explain the seizure.
""The ministry of foreign affairs has coordinated with the coast guard and obtained information that two motor tanker ships ... are suspected of violating the law,"" Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman Teuku Faizasyah said.
""Currently, further investigations are being carried out in order to obtain a more complete picture of the violations committed.”
The tankers were first detected at 2130 GMT on Jan. 23. Indonesia authorities said the two vessels concealed their identity by not showing their national flags, turning off automatic identification systems and failed to respond to a radio call. 
Wisnu said that the ships were caught during a regular patrol.
The International Maritime Organization requires vessels to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off the devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards. But transponders are often shut down to conceal a ship's location during illicit activities.
Iran has been accused of concealing the destination of its oil sales by disabling tracking systems on its tankers, making it difficult to assess how much crude Tehran exports as it seeks to counter U.S. sanctions. Wisnu said on Tuesday the seizure of the ships had ""nothing"" to do with the U.S. sanctions, when asked by Reuters. 
Iran sent the MT Horse vessel to Venezuela last year to deliver 2.1 million barrels of Iranian condensate.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's ruling Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong hailed booming economic development and containment of the COVID-19 pandemic as major achievements on Tuesday as he presided over the opening of a key party congress in Hanoi.
Over nine days of meetings, mostly behind closed doors, delegates will pick a new leadership team, aiming to bolster Vietnam's ongoing economic success - and the legitimacy of the Party's rule. Party congresses take place once every five years.
""Our country has been developing rapidly and sustainably, consolidating people's confidence in the Party, the state and the socialist regime,"" said Trong, reflecting on the Party's record since 2016.
""Growth quality has improved, the economy has been stable, inflation has been kept under control,"" said Trong, 76, speaking in an expansive, 75-minute address to 1,600 delegates from across Vietnam. 
Trong has suffered from health complications over the last few years, but if - as observers expect - he continues as Party chief, he will become the longest-serving General Secretary since Le Duan, the leader who took control and ruled with an iron fist after the death of Vietnam's founding revolutionary, Ho Chi Minh.
A feature of the last five years has been a crackdown on corruption spearheaded by Trong - officially dubbed a ""blazing furnace"". Trong said on Tuesday many cases of corruption cases had been detected, investigated and prosecuted, boosting people's support for the campaign: ""Corruption has been gradually contained and prevented,"" he said. 
Government critics have described the crackdown as politically motivated.
In the months running up to the meeting there has been intense competition for the limited number of top posts in the country's government. Vietnam officially has four 'pillars' of leadership: the Party chief; the state president; the prime minister and the National Assembly Chair.
CHALLENGES AHEAD
Security at the congress, being held at the country's national convention centre, is tight. Cellular signals were jammed in and around the venue, and wireless devices - apart from laptops - were prohibited.
Strict health measures are also in force: Vietnam's ministry of health said a total of 10,000 people had been tested ahead of the meeting for COVID-19.
The country has seen its economy outstrip much of Asia in the past year, keeping the coronavirus pandemic at bay thanks to stringent quarantine measures, testing and tracing: it has reported just over 1,500 COVID-19 infections and 35 deaths in total, far fewer than most other countries. 
Referring to the pandemic, Trong said, ""In the context of rapid and complicated global evolution, we have been focusing on consolidating national defence and security,""
One of the last five Communist-ruled countries in the world besides China, Cuba, Laos and North Korea, Vietnam is already eyeing average annual gross domestic product growth of 7.0% over the next five years.
Despite the buoyant expansion - Vietnam's economy grew 2.9% last year even as regional peers buckled under the pandemic - Trong acknowledged issues to be resolved for future prosperity.
""Our country is still facing several difficulties, challenges and shortcomings,"" Trong said, looking ahead to the next five years and beyond.
""The economy is not yet highly resilient and self-reliant, the efficiency of many state-owned enterprises is low and the growth of the private and foreign-invested sectors is not yet sustainable,"" Trong said.
Without mentioning them by name, Trong also addressed tensions with China over the latter's increasing aggressiveness in claiming vast, potentially energy-rich, swathes of the South China Sea which overlap with Vietnam's exclusive economic zone.
As Trong spoke, China announced that it would hold military drills in the Gulf of Tonkin, just to the east of Vietnam. 
Vietnam is ""determined and persistent to protect its independence and sovereignty ... rightly and effectively handling relations with large countries and neighbouring countries,"" said Trong.

""Thank you, and apologies for going on for a bit long,"" Trong said, concluding his speech.

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Five people were arrested in Sydney in largely peaceful Australia Day protests on Tuesday with thousands defying public health concerns and rallying across the nation against the mistreatment of the Indigenous people.
The Jan. 26 public holiday marks the date the British fleet sailed into Sydney Harbour in 1788 to start a penal colony, viewing the land as unoccupied despite encountering settlements.
But for many Indigenous Australians, who trace their lineage on the continent back 50,000 years, it is ""Invasion Day"".
Chants of ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""always was, always will be Aboriginal land"" rang out during most rallies across the country, television footage showed. 
""Until they abolish Australia Day then maybe Invasion Day will be a bit quieter,"" said Lizzie Jarrett, an Indigenous Australian protest organiser in Sydney.
""At this moment, until this nation celebrates genocide, we will not be silent, we will not stop and we will keep coming.""
Around 2,000-3,000 people gathered in Sydney, according to estimates by the New South Wales police. The handful of arrests were made for breach public conduct rules and scuffling with the police, but the police said most protesters were 'well-behaved'. 
In Melbourne, television footage showed several thousand people marching through the city centre, many wearing T-shirts with the Aboriginal flag, while organisers tried to ensure social distancing rules were observed. 
In Adelaide, an estimated 4,000 people gathered at a sit-down protest, while in Brisbane the crowd reached 5,000 people.
Most official events involved formal recognition of the loss and destruction of Indigenous culture and history of dispossession, with speeches by Indigenous elders, smoking ceremonies, welcome to country ceremonies, and traditional dancing.
Aboriginal flags flew from landmark buildings, including Sydney's Harbour Bridge, while the Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) House was lit up with Indigenous art.
A recent Ipsos poll for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald newspapers showed that 28% of people favoured changing the date of the Australia Day holiday, while nearly 50% opposed. 
While thousands of people flocked to beaches and picnic spots around the country to celebrate the national day, many official events were cancelled due to coronavirus restrictions.
Australia has fared better than most other developed economies in the pandemic, with just under 28,800 cases and 909 deaths, mostly in Victoria state. On Tuesday, the country recorded its ninth consecutive day of zero community transmissions, according to the health ministry. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia Day represents how far the country has come since the First Fleet arrived.
""There is no escaping or cancelling this fact. For better and worse, it was the moment where the journey to our modern nation began,"" Morrison said at an official ceremony in Canberra. ""

""We have risen above our brutal beginnings.""

TAINAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Armed and ready to go, Taiwan air force jets screamed into the sky on Tuesday in a drill to simulate a war scenario, showing its fleet's battle readiness after dozens of Chinese warplanes flew into the island's air defence zone over the weekend.
Taiwan, claimed by China as its territory, has been on edge since the large-scale incursion by Chinese fighters and nuclear-capable bombers into the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone on Saturday and Sunday, which coincided with a U.S. carrier group entering the South China Sea.
The base in the southern city of Tainan, home to F-CK-1 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defence Fighters (IDF), frequently scrambles jets to intercept China's air force.
In a hardened shelter, flight crew from the First Tactical Fighter Wing rushed to ready two IDFs as an alarm bell rang out, aiming to get them off the ground within five minutes of an emergency call, armed with U.S.-made Sidewinders and domestically-developed Wan Chien air-to-ground cruise missiles.
Colonel Lee Ching-shi told Reuters their jets usually go up armed with guns, Sidewinders and Taiwan-made Sky Sword missiles when reacting to Chinese jets and they can respond ""at any time"".
""We are ready,"" he said during a government-organised visit to the base. ""We will not give up one inch of our territory.""
Four IDFs carried out tactical formation landing and rolling take off drills, roaring away from the runway.
China has provided no public explanation for what its aircraft were doing at the weekend. Washington responded by calling on China to cease pressuring Taiwan and reaffirming its commitment to the democratic island.
Taiwan's air force is well trained, but has far fewer combat aircraft than China and has strained under the pressure of almost constantly having to scramble in recent months, responding to stepped up Chinese activity near the island.

""All the wings are under quite a lot of pressure, but as long as the air force is here, we will react according to related battle readiness rules,"" said pilot Wang Chih-chan.

A notice issued by the country's Maritime Safety Administration prohibited entry into a portion of waters in the Gulf of Tonkin to the west of the Leizhou peninsula in southwestern China from Jan. 27 to Jan. 30, but it did not offer details on when the drills would take place or at what scale. 
A U.S. carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt entered the South China Sea on Saturday to promote ""freedom of the seas,"" the U.S. military said, days after Joe Biden began his term as president.
The contested waters have become another flashpoint in the increasingly testy bilateral relationship between Beijing and Washington. The U.S. military has steadily increased its activities there in recent years as China asserts its territorial claims in the area in conflict with neighbouring countries including Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan.
The announcement of the drills in the Gulf of Tonkin, just east of Vietnam, came as the Southeast Asian country opened a key Communist Party congress in Hanoi.

The change comes as a third wave of the pandemic overwhelms Japan's public health centres, which handle everything from tests and tracing to finding hospital beds.
Despite its early success, experts have warned that the country's strategy to trace clusters of cases rather than conduct mass tests could face limits as virus cases surge nationwide.
Public health officials and doctors have lobbied for months for authorities to increase testing to ensure early detection and contain the spread of the virus. 
Since infection cases began to rise in November, public health centre officials have asked to further narrow their contact-tracing efforts due to staffing shortages. 
""Regarding epidemiological investigations, each public health centre will focus on finding out places and groups that contain people with higher risks,"" said the Tokyo metropolitan government's letter dated Jan. 22 seen by Reuters, referring to the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.
Asked about concerns over scaling back efforts to trace the contacts of every person, Naomi Seki, an official at Tokyo Metropolitan Government's health bureau, told Reuters the new policy would help public health workers cope with the rising number of coronavirus cases. 

Neighbouring Kanagawa prefecture has also revised its contact-tracing policy to focus more on high-risk individuals.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemalan Maya families said on Monday they feared relatives were among bodies found over the weekend in a remote part of northern Mexico along a route popular with migrant smugglers heading towards the U.S. border.
After receiving a tip off in the border state of Tamaulipas in northern Mexico, Mexican authorities recovered 19 bodies, many of which had gunshot wounds and were badly charred. So far, the dead have not been identified.
Evaristo Agustin was among some 30 indigenous men and women who traveled to the foreign ministry in Guatemala City from distant highland provinces on Monday after word spread their relatives may be among the deceased. 
The group provided officials with DNA samples to help with identification.
Agustin was looking for his 22-year-old brother-in-law. 
""We heard about it from people already in the United States, family members and neighbors, who said our relatives were part of this group,"" Agustin said, accompanied by women dressed in traditional yellow, blue and pink woven blouses and woolen skirts.
If confirmed that the victims were migrants, the attack would be among the worst atrocities in recent years against Central Americans in Mexico.
Migration has been on the rise from the region in recent months as families flee the devastation of two severe hurricanes and the economic damage from coronavirus.
The Guatemalan foreign ministry said in a statement it was working with Mexico to determine if any of its citizens were among the victims. Tamaulipas state prosecutor's office said the case was being investigated.
A Twitter account for Guatemala's Congress shared a statement later on Monday saying lawmakers ""mourned the tragic death of our migrant brothers from San Marcos,"" without offering more details. 
DNA samples will be compared with samples taken from the bodies by the prosecutor's office in Tamaulipas. The prosecutor's office said the victims included 16 men and a woman. They were unable to determine the gender of two others.
Mario Ernesto Galvez, a Guatemalan lawmaker, said 13 victims were from his mountainous San Marcos province, listing their names in a statement. 
""I only feel pain and sadness,"" said Ramiro Coronado, who feared for his 31-year-old nephew.

""It was the first time he'd tried to travel to the United States to improve his life and that of his family. He's leaving behind a wife and two children.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Once part of daily life for Singapore, conferences in the era of COVID-19 are a meticulously planned operation in the global business hub, which is due to host 'Davos in Asia"" in May. 
After safety marshals check masks are properly fitted and social distancing adhered to, registration is accompanied by a swab of both nostrils by medics in top-to-toe protective suits.
Guests then wait 10 to 15 minutes for a rapid antigen test result and can proceed after receiving a text message that reads: ""You're Okay!"", accompanied by a smiley face.
""Singapore is just gearing up,"" said Irene Lim of think-tank Institute of Policy Studies, which this week held an event for around 250 local delegates at the city state's Marina Bay Sands complex, which has facilities for more than 45,000 conference attendees, a hotel, casino and restaurants.
Organisers of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting are also targeting the venue, sources told Reuters, to host the 2021 event after the gathering normally held in the Swiss Alpine ski resort of Davos was cancelled due to the COVID-19 crisis.
The WEF is also holding a virtual event this week, the time when global political and business leaders would normally gather amid high security in the remote Swiss town. 
With Singapore's borders largely closed, and the pandemic still raging across the world, there is still significant uncertainty over plans for the island nation's 2021 alternative.
But its tentative restart of smaller conferences offers a glimpse into what Davos attendees might expect if they are able to travel safely and to meet in person rather than remotely.
Guests arriving at the glitzy Singapore complex, which had a starring role in the 2018 movie ""Crazy Rich Asians"", first have their temperatures and contact tracing devices, either a bluetooth-powered app or a pocket-sized dongle, scanned.
Then in the resort's ballroom red ropes section participants into 40-50 person groups to limit mingling, while questions from the audience trigger a frenzy of microphone cleaning by glove-wearing stewards. 
In a country that has helped bring the coronavirus under control through its strict rules, there is also a reminder to guests that any breaches will not go unheeded.
A menu placed at each seat advertising a lunch of kale salad and salmon, includes an advisory saying the government may request footage of the event ""to conduct checks and investigations on adherence"" to safety measures. 

""It's been quite a surreal experience. Quite different from what it was before,"" conference participant Ian Mak said.

Sudan joined the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco last year in agreeing to move toward normal relations with Israel. The new U.S. administration of President Joe Biden has said it wants to build on those deals.
Cohen, the first minister to head such a trip, said he met with Sudanese leaders and that the Israeli delegation discussed with their hosts a variety of diplomatic and security issues as well as the potential for economic cooperation.

It was agreed that a Sudanese delegation will travel to Israel, according to the Israeli statement.

Haykel Rachdi's family told local media he was struck by a tear gas canister after joining the protests that erupted this month on the anniversary of Tunisia's 2011 revolution that introduced democracy. 
The Public Prosecutor's office in Kasserine, the biggest city near Sbeitla, about three hours south of the capital, Tunis, has ordered an autopsy to determine the cause of Rachdi's death, the state news agency, TAP, said. 
After news of his death, a group of young men tried to storm and torch the police station in Sbeitla, leading to more clashes, TAP reported. 
It raised the temperature ahead of demonstrations over inequality and police abuses planned on Tuesday in Tunis and other cities and backed by rights groups. 
At a protest in central Tunis on Saturday, demonstrators were stopped from accessing the main central boulevard, but hundreds marched through the city centre chanting: ""The people want the fall of the regime"". 
Although Tunisia has free elections and greater freedom of speech than its neighbours, its revolution has failed to deliver material benefits for most citizens with an economy that has faltered for years and declining public services.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States on Monday approved all transactions involving Yemen's Houthi movement for the next month as Washington reviews a Trump administration designation of the Iran-aligned group as a foreign terrorist organization.
The move appeared designed to allay fears of companies and banks involved in commercial trade to Yemen, which relies almost solely on imports. The Treasury Department in a Frequently Asked Question specifically stated that foreign banks will not be exposed to sanctions ""if they knowingly conduct or facilitate a transaction"" for the Houthis. 
""It essentially wipes out the entire effect of the designation while giving the Biden administration a chance to make the decision on its own rather than getting stuck with Mike Pompeo's decision,"" said Brian O'Toole, a former Treasury official under the Obama Administration. 
Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blacklisted the Houthis last Tuesday - a day before President Joe Biden took office - despite warnings from the United Nations and aid groups that it would push Yemen into a large-scale famine.
The Trump administration exempted aid groups, the United Nations, the Red Cross and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine and medical devices from its designation, but U.N. officials and aid groups said the carve-outs were not enough and called for the decision to be revoked. 
The U.S. State Department said on Friday that it has initiated a review of the designation and is working as quickly as it can to conclude the process and make a determination. 
The new Treasury Department license issued on Monday allows all transactions involving the Houthi group or any entity in which it owns 50% percent or more - though not its blacklisted leaders - until Feb. 26, 2021. 
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need.
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis in a war widely seen as a proxy conflict between U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as Yemen's suffering is also worsened by an economic collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

(Reuters) - Troubled by deaths and questionable care in the state’s jails, several Georgia legislators convened Monday to explore reforms including requiring the state to investigate every fatality and escalating oversight of mental health and drug withdrawal crises.
Monday’s hearing was called following a Reuters series, Dying Inside, that disclosed death tolls at the nation’s largest jails. The series cited several Georgia case studies and documented 272 inmate deaths among the state’s 13 largest jails from 2008 to 2019. Suicides and medical conditions, often treatable, caused most of the deaths.
Lawmaker David Wilkerson said he and his colleagues intend to craft legislation requiring the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to examine every jail death across the state. Right now, the GBI only gets involved when asked by local sheriffs.
Wilkerson, a Cobb County Democrat, also wants a state body to monitor jails’ intake procedures for inmates suffering mental health and drug withdrawal issues. The ultimate goal, he said, is “making sure that nobody goes to jail, not convicted of a crime, and just sits there and dies.”
He and fellow Democrats Sandra Scott and Kim Schofield heard from witnesses including Craig Owens, the newly elected sheriff of Cobb County. One Reuters report examined the case of Chinedu Efoagui, who died at the Cobb County Adult Detention Center in 2017 of a treatable medical condition after spending 512 days behind bars.
Sheriff Owens said he supported having the GBI investigate every jail death. “We're doing this in order to be transparent going forward,” Owens said. The GBI, which did not take part in the meeting, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Georgia ranks among 17 state governments with no mechanism for oversight of local jails, according to research by Reuters and Michele Deitch, a corrections specialist at the University of Texas.

James Woodall, the Georgia head of the NAACP, told the legislators the state should divert more mentally ill people from incarceration. “Jails are not a hospital nor a mental health institution,” he said. “We need to be investing in mental health resources.”
Monday’s meeting, held over Zoom, is the start of a larger process the legislators say will lead to new bill proposals. A second session, focused just on mental health care, will come next.
For any proposals to become law, the Democrats will need support from the legislature’s GOP majority. No Republicans took part in Monday’s call but will be invited to the next meeting, said Wilkerson, who cited Reuters’ investigation and local television reports on jail deaths. Last year, the parties passed a law allowing people convicted of misdemeanors to petition to seal their criminal records.

1239,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 01:55PM ET</span>","Italy PM Conte to resign on Tuesday, seek fresh mandate","By Gavin Jones and Crispian Balmer
ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte will hand in his resignation to the head of state on Tuesday after a morning cabinet meeting to inform his ministers, Conte's office said.
The prime minister, who has been in office since June 2018, hopes President Sergio Mattarella will give him a mandate to form a new government with broader backing in parliament, senior government sources said.
Conte lost his majority in the upper house Senate last week, when the centrist Italia Viva party led by former premier Matteo Renzi quit the coalition in a row over the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis and economic recession.
Conte's efforts to lure centrist and independent senators to the government's ranks have met little success.
The cabinet is convened for 9 a.m (0800 GMT), at which Conte ""will inform his ministers of his intention to resign. He will then go to see President Sergio Mattarella,"" the cabinet office statement said.
Italy has had 66 governments since World War Two and administrations are regularly ripped up and then pieced back together in tortuous, behind-the-scenes talks that open the way for cabinet reshuffles and policy reviews.
However, once a prime minister resigns, there is no guarantee that a new coalition can form, and always a risk that early elections might end up as the only viable solution.
Earlier, lawmakers in the prime minister's own coalition warned he would face defeat in parliament this week in a vote over a contested report on the justice system, which could only be averted by handing his resignation.
Conte had resisted resigning so far for fear that he might not be reappointed. Instead, he tried to draw wavering senators into his camp with vague promises of a new government pact and possible ministerial positions.
But his efforts have floundered and lawmakers from the co-ruling Democratic Party (PD) said he needed to stand down and open formal negotiations in order to win time to create a new coalition. 
Trying to allay his fears of a political imbroglio, PD lawmakers said they would support him to lead a new cabinet.
Conte has no direct party affiliation but is close to the largest coalition group, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement. It also reiterated its support for him, and has also made clear that it does want any attempt at reconciling with Renzi.
""He is a problem and cannot be part of the solution,"" said Stefano Patuanelli, industry minister and a 5-Star politician.
Renzi has indicated he would return to the coalition on the condition that Conte accepts a string of demands. 
If the prime minister shuns him, his path to securing a solid parliamentary majority will be more difficult, with relatively few senators seen as open to joining the government.
Looking to put pressure on waverers, the main ruling parties have warned that snap elections, two years ahead of schedule, will be the only way out of the impasse unless a solution is rapidly found.
A recent reform cut by one-third the number of parliamentary seats up for grabs at the next national ballot, meaning that many of the current lawmakers are unlikely to win re-election, whatever the result. 

This means that there will be no rush in parliament for a vote, putting pressure on party leaders to find a compromise.

The protesters filled a wide avenue in the Houthi-held capital, many holding banners that read: ""America is the mother of terrorism"".
The Trump administration's designation of the group as a foreign terrorist organisation took effect on Jan. 19 but is being reviewed by the new administration of Joe Biden.
U.N. officials and aid agencies have called for the move to be revoked over concerns it could trigger a large-scale famine and complicate efforts to end the war that has killed more than 100,000 people and left 80% of the population in need of aid. 
""The American (designation) decision ... does not only concern one group, but concerns every Yemeni, and thus, its consequences will be felt amongst all Yemenis,"" Houthi official Mohammed Haidara, who was among demonstrators, told Reuters.
Northern Yemen is held by the Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, prompting the Saudi-led coalition to intervene months later. 
The United States and other Western nations have provided arms and intelligence to the coalition. 

The United States and Saudi Arabia see the Houthi movement as an extension of Iranian influence. The Houthis deny being puppets of Tehran and say they are fighting a corrupt system.

1241,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 01:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Saudi Arabia to get AstraZeneca shots in about a week from India,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Serum Institute of India (SII) will supply Saudi Arabia with 3 million AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVID-19 vaccine doses priced at $5.25 each in about a week on behalf of the British drugmaker, its chief executive told Reuters on Monday.
SII has no immediate plans, however, to divert supplies to Europe, even though AstraZeneca has come under pressure from the EU to deliver more shots after announcing a big cut in shipments due to production problems at a Belgian factory.
SII, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer, has partnered with AstraZeneca, the Gates Foundation and the Gavi vaccine alliance to make up to a billion doses for poorer countries. 
The Indian company supplies doses on behalf of AstraZeneca but is also free to strike its own supply deals.
""We continue to support AstraZeneca wherever they need the support. We are happy to do so,"" Chief Executive Adar Poonawalla told Reuters in an interview.
""But we have not been asked to supply any more products for Europe because then that would mean supplies to Africa and India would suffer, and we certainly don't want that,"" he said. ""Once I satisfy that I can look at other, richer nations. Six months to a year, that could change.""
He said the doses destined for Saudi Arabia would be shipped in a week or 10 days. SII is also supplying South Africa with 1.5 million doses at the same price of $5.25 each on behalf of AstraZeneca.
""We have our hands full, in fact, with the volumes even we need to supply,"" Poonawalla said. ""We have been on time and we are able to supply to all these nations.""
The pricing of the deal between South Africa and AstraZeneca has sparked some controversy as it is higher than the $3 a dose that South Africa and other countries on the continent are due to pay for the vaccine under an African Union arrangement.
AstraZeneca has said it will not profit from the vaccine during the pandemic.
Brazil last week received 2 million doses of the vaccine from SII and Poonawalla said it also paid about $5 per dose.
Poonawalla said that SII would raise production of the AstraZeneca vaccine by 30% by the end of March from its current daily output of about 2.4 million doses, once the third and final facility making the shot comes online.
SII also plans to start stockpiling a vaccine candidate from U.S. company  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX) Inc in a few months, despite a fire last week that killed five people and damaged one of its new plants in the western Indian city of Pune.
Poonawalla said SII had no intention of partnering with companies such as  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) whose COVID-19 vaccine needs to be stored at about minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit) as India currently lacks such facilities.
Pfizer, which developed the shot with Germany's BioNTech, told Reuters it would pursue its request for India to approve the vaccine if the government committed to buying shots. 
Pfizer was the first drugmaker to seek emergency use authorisation for its vaccine in India in early December but it has yet to be approved. 

India's drug regulator says Pfizer officials failed to attend subsequent meetings it had called. The U.S. drugmaker says its officials had not been given enough notice.

ANKARA/ATHENS (Reuters) - Turkey and Greece resumed talks aimed at addressing long-standing maritime disputes on Monday, ending a five-year hiatus after months of tension in the eastern Mediterranean.
The neighbouring NATO members are at odds over claims to Mediterranean waters and energy rights, air space and the status of some islands in the Aegean Sea. They made little progress in 60 rounds of talks from 2002 to 2016.
Plans for resuming talks foundered last year over Turkey's deployment of a seismic survey vessel in contested waters and disagreements over which topics they would cover. The vessel was withdrawn to Turkish shores last year.
Ankara and Athens agreed this month to resume the talks in Istanbul, in a test of Turkey's hopes of improving its relations with the European Union, which has supported EU-member Greece and threatened sanctions on Turkey.
As the talks resumed, French Defence Minister Florence Parly said France will present proposals to Greece for the renewal of its fleet of frigates, and had finalised a 2.5-billion-euro ($3.04 billion) deal for Greece's purchase of 18 Dassault-made Rafale fighter jets.
""Under the strong leadership of our president, the solution to all problems, including the Aegean, is possible and our will for this is strong,"" said Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin, who was part of Monday's talks.
Washington welcomed the talks, saying it backed efforts to reduce tension in the eastern Mediterranean. ""The United States welcomes...the commitment of both governments to this process,"" U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said on Twitter.
The exploratory talks are meant to reach common ground on disputed issues to allow for formal negotiations. But, despite agreeing to resume talks, Ankara and Athens still appeared to disagree over the topics to be covered in the run-up to Monday's meeting.
Athens has said it will discuss only the demarcation of exclusive economic zones and continental shelf in the Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean, not issues of ""national sovereignty"", while Ankara has said it wants all issues, including air space and the Aegean islands, on the table.
Greek government spokesman Christos Tarantilis said on Monday Greece was ""attending the talks in good faith and expects Turkey to act similarly"", reiterating the Greek position that the talks are unofficial and focused on maritime zones only.
The agenda for Monday's talks, which lasted more than three hours, was not disclosed. Another round of talks is expected to be held in Athens, a Greek diplomatic source said, without providing any further details.
Despite the technical disagreements, both sides voiced guarded optimism, though they were still trading barbs in the days leading up to Monday's meetings. 
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said last week Greece would approach the talks with optimism but ""zero naivety"", while Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he hoped the resumption of talks would herald a new era.

Analysts have said an immediate breakthrough is unlikely given decades-old policy differences, but that resuming dialogue is an important first step after EU pressure on Ankara.

MADRID (Reuters) - Racial and ethnic discrimination in Spain has worsened in the past few years, especially in housing and education, the Equality Ministry said on Monday, fuelled by far-right politicians and fake news.
In its 2020 report, the ministry said almost one in three Black or ethnic minority respondents said they had experienced discrimination while house-hunting, starting with real estate and housing agencies and extending to landlords. This was double the levels reported in the previous 2013 study.
""The media noise about squatters mean people associate North African, Latino and Sub-Saharan people with over-crowding and squatting,"" said study coordinator Anabel Suso. ""People don't want to rent to them, and real estate agencies reflect that.""
Discrimination in the educational sector also increased, by more than 50% from 2013, with one in five respondents saying they had endured insults, assault and racist jokes from fellow students, and been excluded from games and activities.
""Racially-motivated hate speech against determined groups is surging, gaining traction through social media,"" the report said. 
""The growing fake news trend...creates alternative outlets which publish xenophobic images and create a negative public perception towards migration flows and minority groups.""
People from sub-Saharan Africa and Spain's Roma community, known locally as Gitano, experienced the highest levels of racism based on their physical aspect - 82% and 71% for the respective demographics.
Without naming any particular party, the study said that far-right parties incited hate crimes and spread racial stereotypes and xenophobic attitudes which have gained momentum in the political debate.
The ultranationalist, anti-immigrant Vox party became the third-largest force in parliament in late 2019.
The report said people were now better able to identify certain types of racism than in 2013, leading to a heightened awareness of everyday racism and partly explaining the rise in perceived discrimination. The Asian community - often better-educated than other minorities - perceives high levels of abuse.
""The younger, more educated individuals are more conscious of discrimination and their ability to call it out, even if only socially,"" said study coordinator Suso. ""Those who were born in Spain don't resign themselves to racism as their parents did.""
A United Nations expert said last year that Spain's discriminated-against communities suffer staggeringly high rates of disease, inequality, and poor access to education and housing.
Religion-related discrimination also increased considerably, the report said, with North African and Indo-Pakistani communities hardest-hit as a result of growing stigmatisation, Islamophobia and being likened to terrorists, the report said.

Her cabinet will take its oath of office on Tuesday, marking the end of the far-right EKRE party's spell in the governing coalition in the European Union nation of 1.3 million people.
Kallas, who had ruled out taking over the government with EKRE still in it, has pledged not to define marriage strictly as a union between a man and woman, which was a signature policy of the far right. In another shift, she has promised to bar any further investment in the fossil fuel industry.
""The first thing we are going to deal with is the health crisis,"" Kallas said on Monday, alluding to the coronavirus pandemic, BNS wire reported. ""Our goal is to keep Estonia as open as possible so that people can go to work, children to school and economic activities to continue.""
Ratas' centre-left Centre party remains in the government as Reform's partner, despite corruption charges filed by prosecutors who allege the party's general secretary agreed to a donation of up to 1 million euros from a businessman in exchange for a permit to build on public land. Ratas denies knowledge of any wrongdoing by his party. 
The Reform party, which won the 2019 election but was outmanoeuvred by Ratas, will have only seven of 15 ministers in the two-party cabinet, according to a list published by the Estonian public broadcaster.
Six ministers are women and eight are in their 30s or 40s, including the 43-year old Kallas. Ratas is not in the new cabinet but remains Centre party chief.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned weekend protests demanding the release of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny as dangerous and illegal, as the opposition politician's allies said they planned a similar protest for Sunday.
Police detained more than 3,700 people and used force to break up rallies across Russia on Saturday as tens of thousands of protesters ignored extreme cold and police warnings to demand Navalny be freed from jail where he is serving out a 30-day stint for alleged parole violations he denies. 
Putin, who avoids mentioning Navalny by name, told students on Monday that nobody should use illegal protest action to further their own political interests.
""Everyone has the right to express their point of view within the framework provided by the law. Anything outside the law is not just counter-productive, but dangerous,"" said Putin.
He cited upheaval caused by the 1917 Russian Revolution and the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union as examples of how illegal action could cause misery to people and should therefore best be avoided.
As Putin was speaking, Leonid Volkov, a close ally of Navalny currently outside Russia, announced plans for a new protest this Sunday that would once again ask the authorities to free Navalny.
Putin, in a rare public rebuttal of something Navalny has accused him of, on Monday rejected an accusation made in a video last week that has since gained more than 86 million views on YouTube.
Navalny alleged in it that Putin owned an opulent Black Sea palace that the Russian leader's friends had paid for, sometimes using public money.
""I haven't watched the film, simply because I don't have the free time to watch such information, but I scrolled through video compilations,"" Putin said. 
""...Nothing of what was indicated there as my property belongs either to me or to my relatives and never has belonged (to us). Never,"" he said. 
Tensions between Moscow and Washington have flared over the Navalny protests.
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Monday it had issued a diplomatic protest to U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan over what it said it regarded as interference in its domestic affairs.
It said it took exception to social media posts by the U.S. embassy which it alleged supported the illegal protests and to what it called an unacceptable stance from the State Department.
The United States on Saturday condemned what it described as ""harsh tactics"" used against protesters and journalists and called for Navalny's ""immediate and unconditional"" release. 
Putin will address the World Economic Forum by video conference on Wednesday, Russian news agencies cited the Kremlin as saying. 

The appearance is likely to be contentious with critics at a time when the West is weighing possible new sanctions against Russia over its treatment of Navalny.

The arms control treaty, which is due to expire on Feb. 5, limits the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 strategic nuclear warheads each.
A spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry said earlier on Monday that experts from Russia and the United States had started ""practical"" work on the treaty extension.
The White House said last week that U.S. President Joe Biden would seek a five-year extension to the treaty, in one of the first major foreign policy decisions of his new administration.

The Kremlin had said it remained committed to extending New START and would welcome efforts promised by the Biden administration to reach agreement.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will hold off from imposing fresh sanctions on Russian individuals if the Kremlin releases pro-democracy campaigner Alexei Navalny, EU foreign ministers said on Monday, sending the bloc's top diplomat to Moscow next week.
Despite calls from Baltic countries, Italy and Romania for sanctions on Russian officials in response to Navalny's detention as he returned to Russia from Germany on Jan. 17, Germany pushed to give the Kremlin more time.
""We have agreed today to wait for the court's decision, to wait to see ... whether Alexei Navalny is set free after 30 days,"" German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters following a meeting with his EU counterparts. ""This is not over.""
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was detained and jailed for alleged parole violations after flying back to Russia for the first time since being poisoned by what Germany says was a military-grade nerve agent in August. 
He accuses Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies. His supporters held nationwide protests on Saturday, leading to more than 3,000 arrests and intensifying international calls for Navalny's release.
In central Moscow on Saturday, where Reuters reporters estimated up to 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans. 
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said he would go to Moscow next week to press the Kremlin to free demonstrators and Navalny. EU leaders could discuss any further steps at a planned summit on March 25-26, he said.
Earlier, Lithuania's foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said the EU needed to send a ""very clear and decisive message"" to Moscow, pushing for the bloc to agree sanctions under its new human rights sanctions framework, which allows for quicker adoption of asset freezes and travel bans. 
The EU already has economic sanctions on the Russian energy, financial and arms sectors over its 2014 annexation of the Crimea peninsula. It has imposed sanctions on six Russian officials close to Putin in response to Navalny's poisoning, as well as on one entity responsible for the destruction of Soviet-era chemical weapons stockpiles.
Fellow Baltic countries Latvia and Estonia support more EU sanctions on Russian individuals, and Italy's foreign minister said on Sunday that Rome was ready to support more travel bans and asset freezes. Romania publicly backed sanctions on Monday.

Germany and France, the EU's main powers, will be central to deciding if the bloc goes ahead with punitive measures on Russia, a big oil and gas exporter to the bloc.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Barely 1.6% of 1.44 million people with refugee status who were prioritised for resettlement in another country of asylum last year found new homelands through the U.N. refugee agency, the lowest number in nearly two decades, it said on Monday.
The drop to 22,770 admissions was due to lower quotas set by recipient countries, limited flights and delays in processing during the coronavirus pandemic, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said. In 2019, it resettled 63,696 refugees in need of transfer from one asylum country to another. 
""We can only hope that 2020 will be an extreme anomaly for refugee resettlement. We urgently call on governments to boost their programmes this year, offer more places, expedite the processing of cases and help us save lives of those most in need and at greatest risk,"" Gillian Triggs, UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection, said in a statement.
Refugees from Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Myanmar were the largest groups resettled in 2020.
The United States resettled the highest number of refugees last year, 6,740, but this was less than one-third of the 21,159 that it admitted in 2019, UNHCR figures show.
President Joe Biden has said he would raise the cap for refugees resettled in the United States from abroad to 125,000 from the historic low-level of 15,000 set by his predecessor Donald Trump for this U.S. fiscal year that began in October.
Sweden and Canada ranked second and third last year, resettling 3,543 and 3,496 refugees respectively through UNHCR programmes. 

The vast majority of the world's total 26.4 million refugees who have fled wars and persecution remain in neighbouring countries, but the most vulnerable and those with special needs are given priority for resettlement.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 10:50AM ET</span>",Explainer: Why are pirates attacking ships in the Gulf of Guinea?,"By Libby George
LAGOS (Reuters) - Pirates are stepping up attacks on ships in West Africa's Gulf of Guinea, defying regional navies. On Saturday, pirates off Nigeria kidnapped 15 sailors from a Turkish container ship and killed one.
Pirates in the Gulf of Guinea kidnapped 130 seafarers in 22 separate incidents last year, accounting for all but five of those seized at sea worldwide.
WHO ARE THE PIRATES AND WHY ARE THEY ATTACKING?
The pirates come from Nigeria's turbulent Niger Delta, experts say. The region produces the bulk of the nation's petroleum, but is woefully underdeveloped, scarred by pollution and has some of the highest unemployment in the country. 
Bands of men desperate for money engage in a variety of illegal but lucrative activities, including kidnapping, stealing and refining oil, and piracy. 
They often bring the kidnapped crew to the creeks that snake through the swampy region.
WHY ARE THE PIRATES KIDNAPPING MORE SAILORS?
The International Maritime Bureau has tracked a steady increase in kidnappings over recent years, affecting everyone from fisherman to international supertanker crew. Pirates who once stole cargo, or siphoned oil, discovered that some companies will pay large sums to ransom kidnapped crew.
Last year's oil price crash and Nigeria's second recession in five years worsened unemployment and economic hardship.
Max Williams (NYSE:WMB), chief compliance officer for security firm Africa Risk Compliance, said Saturday's attack reflects yet more risk.
""Breaching the citadel and killing a crew member is a serious escalation,"" Williams said. 
Williams added that attacks further out to sea - Saturday's attack took place 200 nautical miles offshore - reflected increasing sophistication, as vessels further from shore are less likely to have naval protection. 
WHAT IMPACT ON TRADE?
The Gulf of Guinea borders more than 20 countries. The waters are the key route in for everything from steel to soda in a region that relies heavily on imports, and the main export avenue for oil, cocoa, and other commodities. 
Ships still ply the lucrative route, but at a cost. Jakob Larsen, head of security with shipping trade association BIMCO, said insurance costs rise due to attacks, and freight rates are more expensive as some ships avoid the region, cutting the number of available vessels.
Kidnapping and ransom insurance can also cost shipping companies several million dollars annually, though most refuse to discuss specifics due to fears it could make covered vessels a target.
Such costs are typically passed to consumers, and Larsen said there are also high indirect costs due to business and investment that fail to materialize.
WHAT RESPONSE HAS THERE BEEN?
In 2013, 25 countries in the region developed the Yaounde Code, which established coordination on piracy and other maritime crimes. 
Nigeria has its own ""Deep Blue"" initiative to develop maritime surveillance and security, and last year secured its first conviction under a new anti-piracy law.
Most countries in the region bar international navies or armed private security staff from their waters.
Foreign navies, such as France, Spain and Italy, already patrol the region's international waters, but BIMCO said there is an ""urgent need"" for a coordinated international law enforcement operation. 
Denmark's A.P. Moller Maersk, the world's biggest container line, agrees.
""International mandates were found to secure the Hormuz Strait and the Indian Ocean,"" said Aslak Ross, Maersk's head of marine standards. ""So we ought to be able to find a mandate in West Africa.""

GAROWE, Somalia (Reuters) - At least 11 people were killed on Monday after fighting broke out between the Somali federal army and Jubbaland state forces in the Gedo region of southwestern Somalia, a local doctor told Reuters. 
Somalia's federal government confirmed there had been fighting, concentrated in the town of Bula Hawa bordering Kenya. But it and Jubbaland, one of Somalia's five semi-autonomous states, reported no casualties. 
Mogadishu accused Kenya of backing Jubbaland in the fighting, an accusation that Jubbaland denies.
""Kenya and its guerrilla rebels attacked Bula Hawa town last night,"" Osman Dube, Somalia's information minister, told reporters in Mogadishu. ""We overpowered the enemy and captured 100 of them."" 
Kenya's security minister, Fred Matiang'i, said ""no troops"" had crossed into Somalia and called it an internal Somali matter. 
Kenya's foreign ministry called for hostilities to cease, warning that ""the situation could further destabilize the region, complicate the security situation and reverse gains made in the fight against terrorism."" 
""We received 11 dead civilians, including five from one family. And 14 other civilians were injured,"" Mohamud Gomey, a doctor at Bula Hawa hospital, said.
Mohamud Sayid Aden, Jubbaland's vice president, told Reuters that federal forces had shelled residential areas. 
""The shells landed on a house and killed a family of five people,"" he said.
The Somali government blamed local forces for the shelling of residential areas.
The fighting precedes an election on Feb. 8 that was delayed from December because of disagreements between the government and opposition over the make-up of the electoral board. 
The bloodshed could further damage strained relations between Mogadishu and Nairobi. 
Somalia cut diplomatic ties with Kenya in December, accusing it of political meddling after Somalia expelled Kenya's ambassador and recalled its own envoy after alleging interference in the electoral process in Jubbaland.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - A Ugandan court ordered security forces on Monday to free opposition leader and pop star Bobi Wine, whose house arrest since a presidential election has drawn international pressure on President Yoweri Museveni's government.
Hours later, his large compound in a leafy northern suburb of the capital Kampala remained blockaded. 
""The military and police are still surrounding our home and indeed, they are still locking our gates and are not allowing anybody to move out, or anybody to come in,"" he told Reuters in a video message. 
Former guerrilla leader Museveni, 76, has long been a Western ally, receiving copious aid and sending troops to trouble spots including Somalia to fight Islamist militants. 
But foreign governments have become increasingly frustrated at his reluctance to cede power and crackdowns on opponents. 
Wine, 38, has been besieged at home since voting in the Jan. 14 election where he rode a wave of youth disillusionment to challenge Museveni's 34-year rule.
The incumbent was declared winner with 59% of votes versus 35% for Wine, who had for years denounced corruption and nepotism in his songs. The oppposition rejected the result, alleging fraud which the government denies.
FOREIGN PRESSURE 
Uganda's military was aware of the ruling by High Court judge Michael Elubu and would comply, said military spokeswoman Brigadier Flavia Byekwaso, without specifying when.
Pressure has been mounting on the government, including from the United States and rights group Amnesty International which called Wine's incarceration arbitrary and politically motivated. 
Joel Ssenyonyi, spokesman for Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP), said lawyers would serve the court order to security agencies. ""Their continued presence there is illegal,"" he said.
Last week, U.S. ambassador Natalie E. Brown tried to visit Wine, drawing an accusation of meddling and subversion from the Ugandan government. 
Wine is a hero to many young Ugandans who view former guerrilla leader Museveni as an out-of-touch autocrat repressing dissenters and failing to create jobs.
""The Ugandan government continues to use state security in a partisan manner to harass and intimidate its citizens, press, and political opposition,"" tweeted U.S. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Sunday. ""Mr. Museveni's tactics towards those who advocate for an inclusive democracy is dangerous and must be addressed by the global community.""

Museveni casts Wine as an upstart backed by foreign powers and says only his administration can guarantee political stability and economic progress. There was no immediate government comment on the court ruling about Wine.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Caravans of tractors clogged a key highway in northern India on Monday as tens of thousands of farmers protesting against agriculture reforms streamed into the capital ahead of Republic Day, and police said they were prepared to deal with the crowds. 
India marks its founding as a republic on Tuesday with a military parade in the historic city centre, but the farmers, who are demanding a rollback of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's deregulation effort, plan their own peaceful show of strength. 
Delhi's police said protesters have been told to use three main routes for the tractor procession, which had been agreed upon after six days of discussion with farmer leaders.
But there are lingering concerns that ""anti-national people"" may seek to foment trouble during the demonstration, Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava told reporters.
""We are aware of all this and we are taking whatever action is required,"" Shrivastava said, ""I have trust that everything will go on peacefully.""
On National Highway 44, loudspeakers blared anti-government songs as the lengthy procession of vehicles rolled down, fuelled by dozens of community kitchens that handed out hot meals and beverages in the winter cold.
""We will teach Modi a lesson that he will never forget,"" said one of the protesters, from the district of Ludhiana in Punjab, who drove his own tractor. The 35-year-old, who cultivates 10 acres (4 hectares), asked not to be identified.
Farmers mainly drawn from the breadbasket states of Punjab and adjoining Haryana have blockaded approaches into New Delhi for about two months to protest against three new farm laws they say will hurt their livelihoods and help big companies.
Their unions are pushing for repeal of the laws, after rejecting a government proposal to suspend the measures it says will usher in much-needed steps to boost farmer incomes.
Several rounds of talks with Modi's government have made little headway, and protesters now aim to up the ante with the procession set to follow Tuesday's military parade.
Top leaders and military officials attend the annual high-security parade to mark the day India's constitution took effect in 1950.
A farmers' group exhorted its members to refrain from violence in detailed instructions issued for Tuesday's event.
""Remember, our aim is not to conquer Delhi, but to win over the hearts of the people of this county,"" it said.
In the western state of Maharashtra, thousands of farmers were also on the move, flocking to a flag-hoisting ceremony on Tuesday in the heart of Mumbai, India's financial capital.

""We are here to support farmers in Delhi, to highlight that farmers across the country are against the farm laws,"" said Ashok Dhawale, a state protest leader.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The death toll from storm Eloise rose to at least 13 on Monday after heavy winds, rain and flooding destroyed buildings, drowned crops and displaced thousands in parts of southern Africa. 
Eloise weakened from a cyclone to a tropical storm after making landfall in central Mozambique on Saturday, but continued to dump rain on Zimbabwe, eSwatini - formerly known as Swaziland - South Africa and Botswana. 
Six people were killed in Mozambique, the country's National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction (INGD) reported, while the number of displaced people rose to more than 8,000, with thousands of homes wrecked or flooded. 
A five-year-old child was killed in South Africa's eastern Mpumalanga province after being swept away, said George Mthethwa, head of communications for the provincial department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs.
In neighbouring Limpopo, fast-flowing rivers destroyed a makeshift bridge, leaving people hoping to cross stranded on either side. Others waded through the knee-high flood waters. 
The death toll stood at two in eSwatini, according to police. Three people had been reported killed in Zimbabwe and one in Madagascar. 
""Rainfall is starting to ease off slowly,"" said Puseletso Mofokeng, senior forecaster at the South African Weather Service, adding there was still a risk of localised flooding as more rain was expected on saturated ground.
Zimbabwe's national water authority also warned that dams were spilling over and could cause floods further downstream.
Following Cyclone Idai in 2019, rainwater flowed from Zimbabwe back into Mozambique causing devastating floods. Over 1,000 people died across the region, with the impoverished coastal nation bearing the brunt. 
Eloise struck an area still recovering from that devastation and already flooded in parts. 
Evacuations, warnings and higher community awareness have led to a much lower death toll, but some temporary camps, where evacuees were taken, have been cut off. 

Sergio Dinoi, head of the advisory team in Mozambique for the U.N.'s humanitarian arm, said groups were venturing out, in some cases via boat, on Monday to assess the damage.

DUBAI/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Iran has asked Indonesia to provide details about the seizure of an Iranian-flagged vessel, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Monday, a day after Jakarta said it had seized Iran and Panama-flagged tankers in its waters. 
Indonesia said on Sunday its coast guard had seized the Iranian-flagged MT Horse and the Panamanian-flagged MT Freya vessels over suspected illegal oil transfer in the country's waters. 
Khatibzadeh said that the seizure was over a ""a technical issue and it happens in shipping field"".
""Our Ports Organisation and the ship owner company are looking to find the cause of the issue and resolve it,"" Khatibzadeh told a televised weekly news conference.
Coast guard spokesman Wisnu Pramandita said the tankers, seized in waters off Kalimantan province, will be escorted to Batam island in Riau Island Province for further investigation. 
Wisnu told Reuters on Monday that the ships were ""caught red-handed"" transferring oil from MT Horse to MT Freya and that there was an oil spill around the receiving tanker.
He added that 61 crew members onboard the vessels were Iranian and Chinese nationals and had been detained. Indonesia's foreign and energy ministries did not immediately comment on the matter.
Both the supertankers, each capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil, were last spotted earlier this month off Singapore, shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.
Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) MT Horse, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), was almost fully loaded with oil while VLCC MT Freya, managed by Shanghai Future Ship Management Co, was empty, the data showed.
Asked to comment on the seized tanker, Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told reporters : ""It was carrying oil ... the issue is being followed up by Iran."" 
The International Maritime Organization requires vessels to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off the devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards. But transponders are often shut down to conceal a ship's location during illicit activities.
""The tankers, first detected at 5:30 a.m. local time (2130 GMT on Jan. 23) concealed their identity by not showing their national flags, turning off automatic identification systems and did not respond to a radio call,"" Wisnu said in a statement on Sunday.
A search by Reuters on a Chinese company directory found that the registered office address of Shanghai Future Ship Management Co came under another firm named Shanghai Chengda Ship Management. Several calls made to the office went unanswered.
Iran has been accused of concealing the destination of its oil sales by disabling tracking systems on its tankers, making it difficult to assess how much crude Tehran exports as it seeks to counter U.S. sanctions. 
Iran sent the MT Horse vessel to Venezuela last year to deliver 2.1 million barrels of Iranian condensate. 
Over the past few months, MT Freya has delivered two crude oil cargoes totalling about 4 million barrels into Qingdao port on the east coast of China and northeast Yingkou port, said Emma Li, a senior crude analyst with Refinitiv.
The Qingdao cargo was declared as Upper Zakum crude produced in the United Arab Emirates, said Li, who tracks China-destined crude oil shipments.

Scotland's first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said on Sunday she was hoping a strong performance by her Scottish National Party (SNP) in an election in May would give her the mandate to hold a second referendum.
To get a legal referendum, any such vote must be approved by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has ruled out doing so. But the SNP has said it will ""vigorously"" oppose any legal challenge by the British government.
Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said anyone who believes in the union and in democracy should not ""enter into this wildcat referendum that would ... not be enforceable"".
Speaking to the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, he added: ""I would absolutely boycott that ... We were told the 2014 referendum was a gold standard of referendums, Nicola Sturgeon accepted that.""
Scotland voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014 but opinion polls suggest many in the nation now are in favour of independence, with some feeling the country was taken out of the European Union against its will by Johnson's government.
Johnson's Conservatives, much like the main opposition Labour Party, have a tough task to win back voters in Scotland, and the British leader is taking steps to try to counter the SNP's message by boosting a special unit in Downing Street.
It is as yet unclear whether the May election will take place, with Scotland, like the rest of the United Kingdom, struggling to control the spread of COVID-19 and moving fast to try to vaccinate as many people as possible.
But at the weekend, Sturgeon again said she wanted a referendum. 
""I want to have a legal referendum, that's what I'm going to seek the authority of the Scottish people for in May and if they give me that authority that's what I intend to do,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday.

""Have a legal referendum to give people in Scotland the right to choose. That's democracy. It's not about what I want or about what Boris Johnson wants, it's about what the people of Scotland want and the increasing evidence is that they want independence.""

The EU's 27 states had said on Jan. 6 they could no longer legally recognise Guaido as after he lost his position as head of parliament following legislative elections in Venezuela in December, despite the EU not recognising that vote.
Following the disputed re-election of President Nicolas Maduro in 2018, Guaido, as head of parliament, became interim president. Guaido is still seen by the United States and Britain as Venezuela's rightful leader.
The status of interim president gives Guaido access to funds confiscated from Maduro by Western governments, as well as affording him access to top officials and supporting his pro-democracy movement domestically and internationally.
The 27 EU members said in a joint statement that he was part of the democratic opposition - despite a resolution by the European Parliament last week for EU governments to maintain Guaido's position as head of state. 
""The EU repeats its calls for ... the freedom and safety of all political opponents, in particular representatives of the opposition parties elected to the National Assembly of 2015, and especially Juan Guaido,"" the statement said following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. 
""The EU considers them to be important actors and privileged interlocutors,"" it said, calling for the opposition to unite against the disputed rule of Maduro.
The assembly elected in 2015 was held by the opposition, whereas the new assembly is in the hands of Maduro's allies, after the opposition called on Venezuelans to boycott the vote. 

Guaido last week thanked the European Parliament for recognising him as president of the National Assembly, a committee of lawmakers who assert they are the country's legitimate legislature, arguing the 2020 parliamentary elections were fraudulent.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States often sends ships and aircraft into the South China Sea to ""flex its muscles"" and this is not good for peace, China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday, after a U.S. aircraft carrier group sailed into the disputed waterway.
The strategic South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in trade flows each year, has long been a focus of contention between Beijing and Washington, with China particularly angered by U.S. military activity there.
The U.S. carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt and accompanied by three warships, entered the waterway on Saturday to promote ""freedom of the seas"", the U.S. military said, just days after Joe Biden became U.S. president..
""The United States frequently sends aircraft and vessels into the South China Sea to flex its muscles,"" the foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, told reporters, responding to the U.S. mission.
""This is not conducive to peace and stability in the region."" 
China has repeatedly complained about U.S. Navy ships getting close to islands it occupies in the South China Sea, where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all have competing claims.
The carrier group entered the South China Sea at the same time as Chinese-claimed Taiwan reported incursions by Chinese air force jets into the southwestern part of its air defence identification zone, prompting concern from Washington.
China has not commented on what its air force was doing, and Zhao referred questions to the defence ministry.
He reiterated China's position that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and that the United States should abide by the ""one China"" principle.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited a radar base in the north of the island on Monday, and praised its ability to track Chinese forces, her office said.
""From last year until now, our radar station has detected nearly 2,000 communist aircraft and more than 400 communist ships, allowing us to quickly monitor and drive them away, and fully guard the sea and airspace,"" she told officers.
Taiwan's defence ministry added that just a single Chinese aircraft flew into its defence zone on Monday, an anti-submarine Y-8 aircraft.
Biden's new administration says the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is ""rock-solid"".

The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is the democratic island's most important international backer and main arms supplier, to China's anger.

NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a ""minor face-off"" last week in a disputed stretch of their shared border in the eastern Himalayas, the Indian army said on Monday, underlining the fraught situation at the border. 
China said the two sides must refrain from escalatory actions.
Nuclear-armed India and China have been in a tense standoff since April in the western Himalayas and since then have bolstered forces all along the 3,800-km (2,350-mile) border. 
""It is clarified that there was a minor face-off at Nakula area of North Sikkim on 20 January 2021 and the same was resolved by local commanders as per established protocols,"" the Indian army said in a statement. It gave no details. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said he didn't have anything to offer on the incident but urged India to exercise restraint. 
""I would like to stress though that China's border troops are committed to upholding peace and tranquillity along the border with India. We urge the Indian side to work in the same direction as us and refrain from actions that might escalate or complicate the situation along the border,"" he told a regular news briefing. 
""We hope both sides will take proper actions to manage their differences and take concrete actions to safeguard peace and stability along the border.""
Sikkim is in the eastern Himalayas, thousands of miles away from Ladakh where the military crisis began last year and erupted into a hand-to-hand combat that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and an unspecified number of Chinese casualties.
Indian media reports said the latest row in Sikkim had resulted in injuries on both sides. The military offered no comment but advised caution on such reports. ""Media is requested to refrain from overplaying or exaggerating reports which are factually incorrect,"" it said.
On Sunday, India and Chinese military commanders held talks running for several hours to try and find a way out of the stalemate. Several rounds of talks have been held over the past few months to disengage troops facing each other off on inhospitable mountains in freezing temperatures. 
No word has yet emerged on the latest round of talks. 
The editor-in-chief of China's state affiliated Global Times dismissed the Indian media reports of a clash as wrong. 
""This is fake news. Based on what I learned, there is no record of this clash in the patrol log of the Chinese side,"" Hu Xijin said in a tweet.
""Small frictions often occur on China-India border area, but a clash that caused multiple injuries will definitely be recorded and reported,"" Hu said. 

India and China went to war in 1962 and have not been able to settle their border dispute since then. Both lay claim to thousands of kilometres of territory in each other's control.

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2021 04:42AM ET</span>","Earth is losing ice faster today than in the mid-1990s, study suggests","By Yereth Rosen
ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Earth’s ice is melting faster today than in the mid-1990s, new research suggests, as climate change nudges global temperatures ever higher.
Altogether, an estimated 28 trillion metric tons of ice have melted away from the world’s sea ice, ice sheets and glaciers since the mid-1990s. Annually, the melt rate is now about 57 percent faster than it was three decades ago, scientists report in a study published Monday in the journal The Cryosphere.
“It was a surprise to see such a large increase in just 30 years,” said co-author Thomas Slater, a glaciologist at Leeds University in Britain.
While the situation is clear to those depending on mountain glaciers for drinking water, or relying on winter sea ice to protect coastal homes from storms, the world’s ice melt has begun to grab attention far from frozen regions, Slater noted.
Aside from being captivated by the beauty of polar regions, “people do recognize that, although the ice is far away, the effects of the melting will be felt by them,” he said.
The melting of land ice – on Antarctica, Greenland and mountain glaciers – added enough water to the ocean during the three-decade time period to raise the average global sea level by 3.5 centimeters. Ice loss from mountain glaciers accounted for 22 percent of the annual ice loss totals, which is noteworthy considering it accounts for only about 1 percent of all land ice atop land, Slater said.
Across the Arctic, sea ice is also shrinking to new summertime lows. Last year saw the second-lowest sea ice extent in more than 40 years of satellite monitoring. As sea ice vanishes, it exposes dark water which absorbs solar radiation, rather than reflecting it back out of the atmosphere. This phenomenon, known as Arctic amplification, boosts regional temperatures even further.
The global atmospheric temperature has risen by about 1.1 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. But in the Arctic, the warming rate has been more than twice the global average in the last 30 years.
Using 1994–2017 satellite data, site measurements and some computer simulations, the team of British scientists calculated that the world was losing an average of 0.8 trillion metric tons of ice per year in the 1990s, but about 1.2 trillion metric tons annually in recent years.
Calculating even an estimated ice loss total from the world’s glaciers, ice sheets and polar seas is “a really interesting approach, and one that’s actually quite needed,” said geologist Gabriel Wolken with the Alaska Division of Geological and Geophysical Surveys. Wolken was a co-author on the 2020 Arctic Report Card released in December, but was not involved with the new study. 
In Alaska, people are “keenly aware” of glacial ice loss, Wolken said. “You can see the changes with the human eye.”
Research scientist Julienne Stroeve of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado noted the study had not included snow cover over land, ""which also has a strong albedo feedback”, referring to a measure of how reflective a surface is.

The research also did not consider river or lake ice or permafrost, except to say that “these elements of the cryosphere have also experienced considerable change over recent decades.”

The number of new cases of coronavirus infection in Ukraine has significantly decreased from 6,000 to 9,000 cases a day at the beginning of January to 2,516 new cases on January 25, the fewest since early September. 
""Such statistics, which indicate the stabilisation of the situation, the improvement of the situation could be obtained only thanks to you, Ukrainians,"" health minister Maksym Stepanov told a televised briefing.
""We believe that this (lockdown) has significantly improved the situation now and in the future,"" he said.
He said Ukraine, which has registered around 1.2 million cases of coronavirus with 21,924 deaths, would retain some restrictions, mainly related to the work of the service sector, restaurants and transport.
Stepanov said the ministry would analyse the results of the lockdown this week and would then like to return to a system of local restrictions responding to conditions in a particular city or region.

Ukrainian officials earlier this month said the health ministry expected it would not have to introduce any further strict measures in the future.

France has the world's seventh-highest COVID-19 death toll, with more than 73,000 deaths.
""It is a worrying moment. We are looking at the figures, day by day. We need to take measures pretty quickly....but at the same time, not too hastily,"" said HAS head Dominique Le Guludec.
Jean-François Delfraissy, head of the scientific council that advises the government on COVID-19, had said on Sunday that France probably needed a third national lockdown, perhaps as early as the February school holidays, because of the circulation of new variants of the virus.
French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune, when asked about this on French radio on Monday, replied that no firm decision had been taken on the matter.
France is currently in a nationwide 6pm to 6am curfew, in a bid to slow down the spread of the virus, but the average number of new infections has increased from 18,000 per day to more than 20,000.

Geoffroy Roux de Bézieux, head of the MEDEF French business lobby group, said he would call on the government to keep as many businesses and schools open as possible in any new lockdown, to protect the economy and help children's education.

Malka Leifer had fought her return to Australia, including with a submission of mental illness, and the case has been in Israeli courts since 2014. 
Leifer, who was principal of an ultra-Orthodox Jewish school in Melbourne, has denied the allegations against her. 
Wanted by Australian police on 74 sexual assault charges, including rape, involving girls at her former school, Leifer, who also holds Israeli citizenship, fled Australia in 2008 after the accusations surfaced.
Leifer had appealed her extradition to Israel's Supreme Court, which in December upheld a lower court ruling that she could be extradited on the basis of a series of psychiatric examinations that found she had faked mental illness.
Leifer's defence counsel, Nick Kaufman, told Reuters she was extradited on Monday morning. A spokeswoman for the Israel Prison Service also confirmed her extradition. 
A spokesman for Australian Attorney-General Christian Porter said that the Australian government ""does not comment on logistics involving extradition arrangements against individuals until the extradition process has been concluded"".
Photos published by Israel's YNet news site showed what appeared to be prison officials escorting Leifer, who was dressed in civilian clothing, aboard an aircraft at Israel's Ben Gurion airport. 
Kaufman said that Israeli authorities had been expected to ensure ""maximum respect for Leifer's dignity"" until she left Israel. 
""This clearly did not happen, given the fact that photographs of her being led in handcuffs and legcuffs were leaked to the press,"" Kaufman said. 
Leifer's extradition comes hours before Israel is due to ban passenger flights in and out of the country for a week in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The flight restrictions begin on Monday evening.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal's caretaker Prime Minister K. P. Sharma Oli was ejected from the country's ruling Communist party on Monday, his opponents said, in protest at his abrupt move in December to dissolve parliament and call for an early general election.
Despite being stripped of party membership, Oli remains in office.
Meanwhile judges in the Himalayan country's top court are hearing more than a dozen petitions from independent lawyers and Oli opponents on whether his move to dissolve parliament and call an early election was legitimate or unconstitutional. The court is expected to deliver its verdict next month.
The ruling Nepal Communist Party has split over Oli's call for a new parliament to be elected more than a year ahead of schedule on the basis that his colleagues were not cooperating with the government on policy interventions. 
""We have expelled Oli from the party on the grounds that he was not following the party rules and was working against collective decision-making,"" said Pampha Bhusal, a senior leader of the faction opposing Oli.
But Surya Thapa, an aide to Oli, said the expulsion holds no political meaning as the leader continues to remain prime minister, adding that Oli was confident of a legal and political victory.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia said its coast guard seized the Iranian-flagged MT Horse and the Panamanian-flagged MT Freya vessels over suspected illegal oil transfer in the country's waters on Sunday.
Coast guard spokesman Wisnu Pramandita said the tankers, seized in waters off Kalimantan province, will be escorted to Batam island in Riau Island Province for further investigation. 
""The tankers, first detected at 5:30 a.m. local time (2130 GMT on Jan. 23) concealed their identity by not showing their national flags, turning off automatic identification systems and did not respond to a radio call,"" Wisnu said in a statement on Sunday.
Wisnu told Reuters on Monday that the ships were ""caught red-handed"" transferring oil from MT Horse to MT Freya when they were discovered by the authorities and there was an oil spill around the receiving tanker.
He added that 61 crew members from both vessels have been detained.
The International Maritime Organization requires vessels to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off the devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards. But transponders are often shut down to conceal a ship's location during illicit activities.
Both the supertankers, each capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil, were last spotted earlier this month off Singapore, shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.
Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) MT Horse, owned by the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), was almost fully loaded with oil while VLCC MT Freya, managed by Shanghai Future Ship Management Co, was empty, the data showed.
NITC was not immediately available for comment.
A search by Reuters on Chinese company directory found that the registered office address of Shanghai Future Ship Management Co came under another firm named Shanghai Chengda Ship Management. Several calls made to the office went unanswered.
Iran, which has not commented on the seizure, has been accused of concealing the destination of its oil sales by disabling tracking systems on its tankers, making it difficult to assess how much crude Tehran exports as it seeks to counter U.S. sanctions. 
In 2018, former President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers and reimposed sanctions aimed at cutting Tehran's oil exports to zero. 
Iran sent the MT Horse vessel to Venezuela last year to deliver 2.1 million barrels of Iranian condensate.

California Governor Gavin Newsom's office has decided to lift the orders as ICU availability in the regions that remained under the stay-at-home order, including the Bay area and Southern California are projected to rise above the 15% threshold that triggered the lockdown measures, according https:// to San Francisco Chronicle.
According to the report, counties will move back to the tiered system, with most regions across the state expected to move into the purple tier, meaning personal care services like hair salons can re-open with modifications and restaurants can open for outdoor service.
California, the United States' most populous state, emerged as a leading U.S. epicenter of the pandemic despite re-imposing some of the most stringent restrictions on social gatherings and business activity.
Total cases in the United States crossed 25 million on Sunday, even as states accelerate their vaccine distribution. California has reported over 3.1 million cases and 36,745 deaths so far, a Reuters tally showed.
But the number of new infections appear to be slowing after a surge following the Holiday season.
The state' top health official said earlier this month that the number of hospitalized coronavirus patients statewide had steadily declined, showing signs of the virus leveling off.

Strict stay-at-home orders were renewed for much of California in December to avert a crisis in hospitals.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's acting ambassador to Kuwait has defected to South Korea, the latest in a recent string of high-profile escapes from the isolated country, a South Korean lawmaker said on Monday. 
Ryu Hyun Woo had led North Korea's embassy in Kuwait since former Ambassador So Chang Sik was expelled after a 2017 U.N. resolution sought to scale back the country's overseas diplomatic missions. 
Ryu defected to South Korea last September, according to Tae Yong Ho, who was North Korea's deputy ambassador to Britain before settling in the South in 2016 and being elected as a lawmaker last year.
Kuwait had been a key source of foreign currency for Pyongyang, which sent thousands of labourers there, mostly for construction projects. 
Tae said Ryu is also the son-in-law of Jon Il Chun, who once oversaw a Worker's Party bureau responsible for managing the ruling Kim family's secret coffers, dubbed Room 39.
The National Intelligence Service declined to comment. 
Ryu's defection could be a sign that the North Korean elite who shore up leader Kim Jong Un's power base has been drifting away from him slowly but constantly, Tae said.
Ryu fled several months after Jo Song Gil, who was North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, vanished with his wife from the embassy and resurfaced in South Korea.
Tae told Reuters that the knowledge and experiences of the outside world gained as a diplomat had fostered disillusionment among his family, and he decided to escape to ""give freedom"" to his children, calling for other officials to follow suit. 

""I want to deliver to my colleagues working around the world and North Korean elites that there is an alternative to North Korea, and the door is open,"" Tae said in an interview at the recent Reuters Next conference.

(Reuters) - A U.S. aircraft carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt entered the South China Sea over the weekend to promote ""freedom of the seas"" at a time of U.S. concern about China-Taiwan tensions and Beijing asserting its maritime agenda.
     Taiwan, meanwhile, reported an incursion of Chinese bombers and fighter jets into its air defence identification zone.
    The patrol comes just days after Joe Biden was sworn in as U.S. president and follows a year of repeated demonstrations of military power by both Beijing and Washington.
    
    REGIONAL TENSIONS
    China has complained about U.S. vessels in the South China Sea close to islands it controls, claims, or constructed and turned into military installations.
    The Trump and Obama administrations carried out such patrols regularly, ostensibly to challenge China's ""nine-dash line"" claim to jurisdiction over almost the entire South China Sea, which an international arbitral tribunal ruled has no legal basis.
    The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Saturday's patrol was to ""ensure freedom of the seas, (and) build partnerships that foster maritime security"" suggesting Biden, as with the ""pivot"" strategy of the Obama administration he served as vice president, will pursue deeper engagement and alliance-building in Southeast Asia, to try to prevent China establishing regional hegemony.  
    
    TROUBLED WATERS
    Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei, as well as Taiwan, have territorial claims in the waterway and largely welcome the U.S. presence, mainly as a check on China's militarisation and its vast coastguard and fishing fleet.
    Southeast Asian countries last year expressed worry that the escalating U.S.-China tensions could lead to military confrontation, with potential for big disruptions to a vital trade route, which would have devastating consequences for their economies. 
    The United States has accused China of bullying and attempting to build a ""maritime empire"", announcing several rounds of sanctions on Chinese state companies involved in building artificial islands.
    China sees the United States as an outsider interfering in a region in which it sees itself as a force for peace and stability. 
    ""It's business as usual for strategic competition,"" said Renato de Castro, a defence expert at Manila's De La Salle University, adding the U.S. patrol was ""both reassuring and concerning"". 
    ""The Biden administration cannot show weakness in foreign policy,"" he added.
    
    VIRUS DISTRACTION
    Tensions have risen as a result of what the United States saw as underhanded tactics by China to advance its territorial claims while its neighbours were fighting coronavirus epidemics.
    Vietnam and the Philippines have protested China's establishment of administrative districts in the disputed Paracel islands and in the Spratly islands. Protests also followed China's military drills near the Paracels, including the firing of ballistic missiles from several locations into waters nearby. 
    Chinese coastguard and survey vessels were repeatedly tracked in 2020 near energy exploration in offshore plots operated by Malaysia and Vietnam, disrupting activities and leading to weeks-long standoffs.
    
    TROUBLE AHEAD?
    Though not directly linked, the U.S. patrol came a day after China passed a law allowing its coastguard to open fire on foreign vessels. That could increase the risk of conflict given the competing territorial claims and the vast distances travelled by China's coastguard fleet. 
    The bill, which China says is in line with international practices, also allows coastguard personnel to demolish other countries' structures on reefs it claims, and to board and inspect foreign vessels in China-claimed waters. 
    ""The law heightens the risk of inducing unintended incidents at sea,"" said Ha Hoang Hop, a fellow at Singapore's ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute, adding it could also be considered a warning to Washington.

    Several analysts expect the United States to continue the patrols and firm up relations with littoral states, and for China to increase military exercises and disrupt any efforts to resume energy activities in waters it considers its own.

The 11 miners were rescued on Sunday, with most of them in good condition, after 14 days trapped underground, although 10 workers remain unaccounted for. 
Officials had earlier said the trapped workers may have to wait another 15 days before they could be rescued due to a blockage along their intended escape route. The workers had been able to receive medical and food supplies while they were trapped.
China's mines are among the world's deadliest. The country recorded 573 mine-related deaths in 2020, according to the National Mine Safety Administration.
The Jan. 10 explosion in the Hushan mine in Qixia, a major gold-producing region under the administration of Yantai in coastal Shandong province, trapped 22 workers about 600 metres (2,000 feet) underground. 

One miner is known to have died. More than 600 rescuers have been on the site working to reach the men.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - As Australia prepares for its national day of festivities on Jan. 26, Indigenous woman Rita Wright will be protesting the celebrations at a march in Sydney.
Australia Day marks the date the British fleet sailed into Sydney Harbour in 1788 to start a penal colony, viewing the land as unoccupied despite encountering settlements.
For Wright, holding national celebrations on the highly sensitive date reinforces a legacy of mistreatment of Indigenous people. She said the date of the national holiday should be changed.
""I always thought Captain Cook owned this land and not the Aboriginal people,"" said Wright, referring to the British explorer who mapped Australia's eastern coastline in 1770, paving the way for the establishment of the colony.
""But as I got older and stronger I was so proud that I'm Aboriginal.""
Snatched off the street at the age of two and re-homed at a church mission, Wright, of the Muruwari people from Australia's east, is part of the Stolen Generation, a dark era in the continent's history. 
She said she was forced to sleep in a chicken coop at the mission as a child.
The push to change the date of Jan. 26 celebrations has never been stronger, with protests growing in size every year.
""This is the day that started all of our people being murdered, our children being stolen, our land being stolen and for people to celebrate it, it's pretty disgusting,"" said artist and Darug woman, Leanne Watson.
The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is eight years shorter than for non-Indigenous people and they are over-represented in prison, government statistics showed.
The Jan. 26 debate remains highly emotive in Australia.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison told journalists last week that the day represents how far the country has come since the fleet arrived.
""It wasn't a particularly flash day for the people on those vessels either,"" he said.
Morrison also criticised a decision by cricket authorities to no longer refer to Jan. 26 as ""Australia Day"".
The Australian leader last month amended the national anthem to remove reference to the country being ""young and free"" amid calls to recognise its Indigenous people are the oldest continued civilization in the world.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathered for its first national congress since 2016 on Monday with a mission to select new leaders and shape policy for the next five years and beyond.
The event, the 13th congress since the Communist Party of Vietnam was established in 1930, brought nearly 1,600 delegates from across the country to Hanoi. On a foggy morning in the capital, they paid a ceremonial visit to the mausoleum of founding revolutionary Ho Chi Minh before meetings began.
Vietnamese officials traditionally visit the mausoleum ahead of important meetings and national events.
Amid stringent coronavirus testing to preserve Vietnam's comparative success in keeping the pandemic at bay, delegates will pick a new leadership team in nine days of meetings, mostly behind closed doors, aiming to bolster both the country's ongoing economic success and the legitimacy of the Party's rule.
Delegates to the congress, foreign dignitaries, support staff and media attending the event were all tested twice for the coronavirus in the days leading up to the gathering. According to the health ministry, a total of 10,000 people have been tested in conjunction with the congress.
That approach echoes the tough quarantine measures, testing and tracing that have contributed to Vietnam having far fewer virus cases than most other countries: it has reported just over 1,500 COVID-19 infections and 35 deaths in total.
In turn, that has helped Vietnam's economy outstrip much of Asia in the past year. One of the last five Communist-ruled countries in the world besides China, Cuba, Laos and North Korea, Vietnam is already eyeing average annual gross domestic product growth of 7.0% over the next five years.
But a new leadership will be faced with the challenge of balancing relations with China and the United States, for which Vietnam has become an important strategic partner, in a world economy that's become detached from previous certainties.
In the months running up to the meeting there has been intense competition for a limited number of top posts. Vietnam officially has four 'pillars' of leadership: the Party chief; the state president; the prime minister and the National Assembly Chair.
Vietnam's two-term Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, 76, has been struggling with bad heath but is expected by analysts to continue for a third term. Trong wasn't seen in images/footage of the mausoleum visit released by state media, and wasn't mentioned in a report on the event by state news agency VN News, but was seen attending a meeting later. 
While a 2016 power struggle and subsequent crackdown on corruption in government has deepened factional fault lines across Party ranks, most analysts expect continuity in Vietnam's economic, domestic and foreign policy-making after the congress.
The main candidates for the new positions to be determined at the congress are all widely known in Hanoi's political circles, but were officially declared top secret in December to discourage potentially critical debate.

The Communist Party retains tight control of domestic media and tolerates little criticism.

KORAPUT, India (Reuters) - Reena Jani rose early, finished her chores in the crisp January cold and walked uphill to the road skirting her remote tribal hamlet of Pendajam in eastern India.
Riding pillion on a neighbour's motorcycle for 40 minutes through hillsides dotted with paddy fields, the 34-year-old health worker headed for the Mathalput  Community Health  (NYSE:CYH) Centre.
Jani's name was on a list of 100 health workers at the centre, making her one of the first Indians to be inoculated against COVID-19 earlier this month, as the country rolls out a vaccination programme the government calls the world's biggest.
But she had heard rumours of serious side effects and worried about what would happen were she to get ill.
""I was frightened because of my son and daughters. If something happens to me, what will they do?"" Jani told Reuters, visibly relieved after the injection produced no immediate side effects.
The vaccine she received had travelled much further. It was taken by plane, truck and van some 1,700 km from the factory to the clinic where Jani waited, and it had to be kept cold the whole way.
Its safe arrival in Koraput district, where leftist guerrillas wage a low-level insurgency amid rolling hills and thick forests, was testament to detailed planning and groundwork by authorities in the state of Odisha.
But officials acknowledge this is just the tip of the iceberg.
The 1.5 million vaccinated so far, mainly targeting key workers like Jani, are a tiny first phase of a vaccine programme that India hopes will eventually protect its 1.4 billion people from the coronavirus.
Only when the much larger third phase is launched, aimed at 270 million people deemed vulnerable, will the government know if its plan to distribute shots across sometimes hostile terrain and amid high temperatures will succeed.
""The problem will start from the third phase when the public will start coming,"" said Madhusudan Mishra, Koraput's district collector. ""That will be a real challenge.""
Supplying vaccines is one thing. Convincing people to take them is another.
Scepticism about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 shots is high in India, particularly in rural areas, officials say, and misinformation via social media platforms and word-of-mouth could undermine the effort.
The COVID-19 vaccine Jani took was developed by AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University. India is also using another developed by Bharat Biotech.
The deployment comes as the number of coronavirus cases in India approached 11 million and deaths exceeded 150,000.
'MOST AWAITED VACCINE'
Manufactured in the western city of Pune by the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine maker by volume, some 40,800 vials of the AstraZeneca shot were flown on a commercial airline into Odisha's capital city on Jan. 12.
A fire last week at the Pune plant killed five people but officials said vaccine production would not be affected.
India has distributed 16.5 million doses of the two approved vaccines to its states and territories, which dispersed them using an army of drivers and an infrastructure established for existing vaccination programmes but bolstered for the pandemic.
In Odisha, after a delayed start on Jan. 13, government staff at the vaccine centre pulled out vials from a cavernous refrigerator and carefully counted them, before packing them into insulated boxes with ice packs to keep them at between 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to three days.
Then it was over to veteran health department driver Lalu Porija. He drove his delivery van all night to reach the site, and now had to truck the vaccines 500 km (310 miles) back to Koraput with an armed policeman in plain clothes for company.
""I am feeling a little tired,"" said Porija, as he stopped to sip tea late that evening after a traffic jam delayed the trip by several hours.
Negotiating cows, debris, thick fog and hairpin bends, and fighting fatigue, Porija drove nearly 24 hours within three days to collect and deliver the vaccine shots to Koraput town.
On Jan. 15, at Koraput's main vaccine store, healthcare workers counted, packed and loaded smaller quantities for the district's five vaccination sites, including the Mathalput Community Health Centre some 30 km away.
A small white van drove out at noon, kicking up dust on narrow countryside roads, for a delivery run to multiple sites. Again, an armed policeman sat inside.
""The most awaited vaccine,"" a healthcare worker at Mathalput said to colleagues, as a box of shots was unloaded.
CHALLENGES LOOM
India has mapped out a plan to vaccinate around 300 million people by July-August.
In the first phase, which got underway earlier this month, the target is 10 million healthcare workers, including Jani. Next are 20 million essential services workers, followed by 270 million people deemed susceptible to the coronavirus.
Beyond that there is no clear road map, although the government has said every Indian who wants or needs the vaccine will get it.
In Koraput, a team of officials spent months putting together a local COVID-19 vaccination plan, officials said.
With much of the district lacking internet access, they chose vaccination sites with good connectivity and conducted dry runs, said Koraput's top health official Dr Makaranda Beura.
And where mobile coverage was patchy, like Jani's Pendajam village, health workers were called to meetings to inform them of vaccination plans, followed by visits from supervisors to people registered to be inoculated.
Despite initial glitches, particularly with CO-WIN - a centralised digital platform to roll out and track India's mammoth vaccination programme - officials in Koraput said the system would suffice for the first two phases.
For the much bigger third phase, district collector Mishra said he anticipated deploying the entire local police force to manage crowds as well as acquiring additional vehicles to support staff working in far-flung areas.
But moving the vaccine deep into the interiors, where Maoist insurgents are known to operate, also requires police to work with paramilitary troops and special forces, said southwest Odisha's police chief Rajesh Pandit.
""We have to take extra care,"" Pandit said.
RUMOURS AND HESITANCY
Jani became an accredited social health activist (ASHA) community health worker, a lynchpin of India's rural healthcare system, around seven years ago.
She monitors pregnant women in her village of 500 people, helps with malaria tests and doles out basic medication for fever and diarrhoea.
The main breadwinner for her family of five, Jani draws a monthly salary of 3,000 rupees ($41), helping put her two daughters and one son through school.
When she first learned she was to be vaccinated, Jani said she wasn't worried. Then she heard a rumour.
""Someone told me that people are fainting, they are developing fever and some are dying after taking the injection,"" she said. ""That is why I was frightened.""
In a survey conducted by New Delhi-based online platform LocalCircles, 62% of 17,000 respondents were hesitant to get vaccinated immediately, mainly due to worries over possible adverse reactions. 
The fears are rife among health workers too, prompting India to appeal to frontline workers not to refuse vaccines after many states failed to meet initial vaccination targets.
Dr Tapas Rajan Behera, the medical officer in charge of the Mathalput Community Health Centre, said authorities were aware of possible reluctance to take the vaccine and had instructed health workers to allay fears over safety.

A jittery Jani eventually received her shot, partly vaccinating her against COVID-19: one tiny step in India's mission to beat the pandemic.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Ten years ago protesters surged onto Egypt's streets, emboldened by the success of Tunisia's Arab Spring uprising. 
Some young activists formed the Revolution Youth Coalition to draw together the uprising's disparate strands and give the protesters occupying Cairo's Tahrir Square a coherent voice.
They demanded freedom, dignity, democracy and social justice amid battles with police and state-hired thugs, and on Feb. 11 President Hosni Mubarak resigned.
But the coalition fragmented as it faced two much more established forces: the Muslim Brotherhood that swept to power in later elections, and the military that toppled it in 2013. 
Egypt now faces a different landscape. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who became president in 2014 after leading the overthrow of the Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, has overseen a crackdown that activists call the harshest for decades. 
Sisi says in response that he has brought stability, allowing the country to move on from the turmoil that followed 2011. Officials did not respond to a request for further comment. 
Sisi has referred to the uprising as a ""great revolution"" while blaming it for unleashing economic disruption and security problems. Tahrir Square has been redesigned, and a new capital is being built in the desert. 
Some former leading members of the coalition are in prison, some are in exile. One is a pro-Sisi member of parliament. Here are some of their stories: 
ISLAM LOTFY
A senior member of the Muslim Brotherhood's student division as the uprising started, Islam Lotfy was dismissed from the movement later that year as youth members split with the more hesitant senior leadership. 
Lotfy, 42, left Egypt in 2013 amid a crackdown on those associated with the Brotherhood, and now works in television production from London. 
Egypt has placed him on a terrorist list and frozen his assets. Many of his former political companions are in jail, he says.
""Personally we are in a difficult position but we will keep fighting,"" he said. ""My mother got dementia and she's very old, and I didn't get a chance to be beside her or to visit her.""
He is marking the 10th anniversary of the uprising by contacting fellow activists outside Egypt ""and trying to build a real political movement"".
""What we are calling for, it doesn't disappear because we are not here or because we are in jails or because we are in exile.""
BASSEM KAMEL
Bassem Kamel was active in liberal opposition politics in Mubarak's final years in power. 
After the uprising he co-founded the Egyptian Social Democratic Party and was elected to a short-lived parliament. By June 2013 he was among the organisers of anti-Brotherhood protests. 
His optimism at Mursi's fall quickly turned to concern that civilians were being sidelined by the military.
Now 51, he remains deputy head of his party, which gained seven seats in parliament by joining an election list headed by a strongly pro-Sisi party. But he didn't take a seat, dividing his time between party activities and the interior decoration company he owns in Cairo. 
""There is no political life, really. There is a very, very limited margin for political or party activity, and in light of that I'm there,"" he said during an interview at his office. 
""Change must come from cumulative work and organisation, long-term persistence."" 
SALLY TOMA
Doctor Sally Toma remembers being chased out of Tahrir Square on Jan. 25, 2011 and watching in awe as protesters moved to reclaim it three days later.
A representative of Egypt's Coptic Christians in the coalition, she continued protesting until 2013, campaigning against both the military and the Muslim Brotherhood.
""Agreeing to bring down a regime is one thing and then agreeing on how to build is another, and you had a counterrevolution working against you from the very start,"" she said in an interview.
Now 42 and a practicing psychiatrist, she says most of her companions are in detention or exile and those who remain are trying to survive the trauma of the past decade. 
An informal network from the ""revolutionary camp"" works discreetly on human rights issues, she says.
Toma says she still meets people who profess attachment to the uprising and its goals.
""Revolutions don't just happen like that like and they die. Seeds are there and you find them in the strangest of places.""
TAREK EL-KHOULY 
Lawyer Tarek el-Khouly blames the Brotherhood for undermining the uprising by seeking to impose Islamic rule. He backed the overthrow of Mursi in 2013, seeing it as an extension and ""correction"" of 2011.
Khouly, 35, was re-elected last year to a second five-year term in parliament after joining the pro-Sisi Nation's Future party.
""Ten years ago, I was among the thousands of young people who participated in this great revolution that called for bread, freedom and social justice. I believe that we are in the middle of the road,"" he said in an interview.
Security measures post-2013 were needed to prevent militant attacks, and those jailed for social media posts were inciting crimes, he said. 
Tens of thousands of civil society organisations are allowed to operate in Egypt, he added, praising government efforts to improve living conditions and saying parliament was gaining strength as an expression of popular will.
SHADY EL-GHAZALY HARB 
A surgeon active in opposition politics before the uprising, Shady el-Ghazaly Harb was jailed from 2018-2020 on charges of spreading false news and joining a terrorist organisation, accusations frequently levelled at opposition figures. 
Harb, 42, believes he was arrested due to social media posts critical of government policies. He has returned to his Cairo clinic but remains suspended from a university teaching job. 
""I moved away completely from political participation not just because of the risk of prison but because the political climate and the political field are not encouraging any political participation whatsoever,"" he said.
The priority now is pressing to get detainees released. But he believes the uprising's ideas have lived on, both in protests in Sudan, Algeria and Lebanon, and in Egypt itself. 

""It changed the collective consciousness of a nation of 100 million,"" he said.

1276,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 24, 2021 10:09PM ET</span>",China’s Xi to Address Davos in First Remarks During Biden Era,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping is set to deliver his first speech since Joe Biden entered the White House, remarks that could set the tone for relations between the world’s biggest economies over the next four years.
Xi will speak later Monday at the Davos Agenda event, which he last addressed in 2017 days before Donald Trump took office. At the time, Xi warned that a trade war would hurt both sides while stressing China’s openness and condemning protectionism. Chinese state media has recently promoted that speech, casting Xi as a visionary.
Xi’s earlier address “illuminated the turbulent world economic voyage” and “transcends time and space,” Qiushi Journal, a bimonthly magazine published by the Chinese Communist Party’s Central Committee, said in an editorial last month.
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were also slated to be among the speakers at the online event hosted by the World Economic Forum from Monday to Friday. The in-person meeting, which is usually held in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, has been postponed due to the pandemic and is now scheduled to take place in May in Singapore.
The landscape is much different for Xi than four years ago. The Trump administration has since moved to impose tariffs on Chinese exports, sanction officials over moves to restrict freedoms in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and deny vital technology to some of China’s biggest companies. Xi has since emphasized a “dual circulation” policy that prioritizes self-sufficiency.
Biden’s team has signaled it would continue to hold a tough line on China while seeking cooperation in areas like climate change. In its first week, the U.S. issued statements blasting China for sanctioning Trump officials and for a military show of force against Taiwan. China’s foreign ministry has called for bilateral relations to be “rebuilt and repaired” while asserting the right to defend its interests.
Biden hasn’t given many specifics on how he would deal with the thorniest issues between the countries, including export curbs on companies like Huawei Technologies Co., data security regarding apps like Bytedance Ltd.’s TikTok and tariffs on almost $500 billion of products. But he has signaled a shift from confrontation to competition, with members of his administration calling for greater investments in the U.S. to “outcompete” China.
Xi is speaking from a position of strength: China has been the only major economy to report growth amid the pandemic last year. Economists are forecasting an expansion of 8.3% this year, compared with 4.1% in the U.S. Xi recently committed China to be carbon-neutral by 2060, although Beijing has revealed few details on how it plans to achieve the target.

The total number of confirmed cases in the mainland rose to 124 on Jan. 24 from 80 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said in a statement, amid the worst wave of new infections China has seen since March 2020. 
Of the 117 new local infectons, Jilin accounted for 67 cases - all but three of whom were previously asymptomatic patients who were reclassified as confirmed cases after developing symptoms. Heilongjiang reported 35 new cases, while Hebei reported 11 new cases. 
Though new infections remain at a fraction of those reported by other countries, the world's most populous country is determined to keep the spread in check ahead of next month's Lunar New Year holiday when millions travel to their home provinces. 
Local authorities have rolled out a combination of measures including home quarantine of millions of people, travel curbs, mass COVID-19 testing and screening in a bid to contain the disease. 
The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, fell to 45 from 92 cases a day earlier.

Less than a week after President Joe Biden announced the return of the United States to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, his Special Climate Envoy John Kerry will join China's Deputy Prime Minister Han Zheng, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other leaders at the Climate Adaptation Summit.
This online event, hosted by the Netherlands, aims to set out practical solutions and plans for dealing with climate change in the period until 2030.
Ahead of the summit, more than 3,000 scientists from across the globe pressed leaders to better protect people from the fall out of global warming.
""Our fast-warming world is already experiencing major disruptions from more intense droughts, fires, heat waves, floods, destructive tropical cyclones and other extreme events"", the scientists, including five Nobel laureates, said in a statement.
""Unless we step up and adapt now, the results will be increasing poverty, water shortages, agricultural losses and soaring levels of migration with an enormous toll on human life.""
Climate change could depress global food production by up to 30%, while rising seas and greater storms could force hundreds of millions in coastal cities out of their homes, summit organiser the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA) said.
""There is no vaccine for climate change"", GCA chair and former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told reporters on the eve of the event. 
""It is happening much, much faster than we think, causing cascading risks and impact. Building resilience to climate change is not nice to have, it is a must have.""
No binding commitments will be made at the summit, but leaders will try to set an action agenda, charting plans and proposals to create a climate resilient planet by the end of the decade.
Britain said it plans to team up with Egypt, Bangladesh, Malawi, Saint Lucia and the Netherlands in an initiative that could include early warning systems for storms and investments in flood drainage and in drought-resistant crops.

Support for Suga's cabinet dropped to 33% from 39% last month, with disapproval rising 10 points to 45%, the poll showed.
Critics say Suga was too slow to act after COVID-19 cases began surging late last year, with his decisions to halt a domestic tourism campaign and declare a one-month state of emergency for Tokyo and other areas coming too late. 
The Asahi poll, which was conducted by telephone on Saturday and Sunday, showed 80% of respondents thought the emergency declaration was too slow.

The arrest comes against the backdrop of a state of emergency in the Central African Republic, with fighting between the country's army, backed by U.N., Russian and Rwandan troops, and rebels seeking to overturn a Dec. 27 vote in which President Faustin-Archange Touadera was declared the winner.

A judge for the court said there was reasonable grounds to believe that Said, 50, was responsible for crimes including torture, persecutions, enforced disappearances and other inhumane acts.
The Central African Republic has been mired in violence since a coalition of mostly northern and predominantly Muslim rebels known as Seleka, or ""alliance"" in the Sango language, seized power in March 2013. Their brutal rule gave rise to the opposing ""anti-balaka"" Christian militias, several of whose former leaders also face charges at the ICC.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy will take legal action and step up pressure in Brussels against  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) over delays in deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines with a view to securing agreed supplies, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Sunday.
The aim was to get the companies to meet the vaccine volumes they had promised and not to seek compensation, Di Maio said on RAI state television.
""This is a European contract that Pfizer and AstraZeneca are not respecting and so for this reason we will take legal action... We are working so our vaccine plan programme does not change,"" he said.
Pfizer said last week it was temporarily slowing supplies to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output. On Friday, AstraZeneca said initial deliveries to the region will fall short because of a production problem.
Asked why he thought the pharmaceutical companies had been forced to announce reductions, Di Maio said he believed they had simply bitten off more than they could chew.
""We are activating all channels so the EU Commission does all it can to make these gentlemen respect their contracts,"" he said.
No one was immediately available to comment at Pfizer in Italy. AstraZeneca did not immediately reply to an email and voice message.
Also on Sunday European Council President Charles Michel said the EU would use legal means to ensure pharmaceutical companies respect supply contracts for COVID-19 vaccines.
""We plan to make the pharmaceutical companies respect the contracts they have signed ... by using the legal means at our disposal,"" Michel said on Europe 1 radio.
Sky Italia TV cited Pfizer on Sunday as saying the cuts, to the number of vials delivered and not the number of doses, had been due to work to increase capacity at a Belgian plant. 
Supplies would return to normal as of next week, Sky cited Pfizer as saying.
On Saturday Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the delays in vaccine supplies were ""unacceptable"" and amounted to a serious breach of contractual obligations, adding that Italy would use all available legal tools.
Speaking on Italian TV on Sunday Italy's Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri said the cut in supplies announced by Pfizer and AstraZeneca would put back vaccination of the over-80s in Italy by about four weeks and the rest of the population by about 6-8 weeks.
""This kind of delay affects the whole of Europe and a good part of the world but I am confident the delay can be made up for further down the road,"" he said.

Italy was the first Western country to be hit by the virus last March and has registered 85,461 deaths so far, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the sixth-highest in the world.

Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent he says was slipped to him by state security agents in August.
Even before the friction over Navalny, relations between Moscow and Washington have been at their lowest since the end of the Cold War, with the two sides also at odds over Russia's role in Ukraine and allegations of its meddling in U.S. elections, which it denies, among other issues.
But Peskov had, nonetheless, struck a more conciliatory tone earlier on Sunday, when he said Russia was ready to set up a dialogue with the new administration of President Joe Biden.
""Of course, we count on success in setting up a dialogue,"" he was quoted as saying on TV by Interfax news agency.
""This will be the dialogue where, of course, differences will have to be stated to a greater extent, points of differences. But at the same time, a dialogue is a possibility to find some rational kernels, the little parts where our relations are getting closer,"" he said.
""And if the current U.S. administration is ready for such an approach, I have no doubts that our president will respond in kind.""
Putin was one of the last global leaders to congratulate Biden on his victory in the U.S. presidential election after the Nov. 3 vote.
One of the burning issues to be resolved by the two nuclear powers is the arms control treaty, known as New START, which is due to expire on Feb. 5.
The White House said last week that Biden would seek a five-year extension to the deal, while the Kremlin requested concrete proposals from Washington.

Washington was joined by the European Union and Britain in condemning the security forces' handling of Saturday's protests, while the foreign minister's of Italy and France on Sunday both expressed support for sanctions against Moscow.

The U.S. State Department has initiated a review of the designation, which came into effect Jan. 19, the day before President Joe Biden's inauguration. The designation freezes any U.S.-related assets of the Houthis, bans Americans from doing business with them and makes it a crime to provide support or resources to the movement. 
""This designation comes at a time when famine is a very real threat to a country devastated by six years of conflict, and it must be revoked immediately. Any disruption to lifesaving aid operations and commercial imports of food, fuel, medicine and other essential goods will put millions of lives at risk,"" the aid groups' statement said. 
The United States has exempted aid groups, the United Nations, the Red Cross and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices from its designation.
But the aid organisations say the legal implications of the designation are not fully understood, and the exemptions do not cover enough of the commercial sector. 
""The licences and associated guidance do not provide sufficient guarantees to international banks, shipping companies and suppliers that still face the risk of falling foul of US laws. As a result, many in the commercial sector will likely feel the risk is too high to continue working in Yemen,"" they said.
Signatories to the statement include Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee. 
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis in a war widely seen as a proxy conflict between U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will ban passenger flights in and out of the country from Monday evening for a week as it seeks to stop the spread of new coronavirus variants.
""Other than rare exceptions, we are closing the sky hermetically to prevent the entry of the virus variants and also to ensure that we progress quickly with our vaccination campaign,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in public remarks at the start of a cabinet meeting.
The ban will come into force from Monday at 2200 GMT and last until the end of January, a statement from Netanyahu's office said. 
The country's borders have largely been closed to foreigners during the pandemic, with only Israeli passport holders allowed entry. 
Also on Sunday, Israel expanded its rapid vaccination drive to include late teens. The vaccines were initially limited to the elderly and other high-risk categories, but are now available to anyone over 40 or - with parental permission - those between 16 and 18.
The inclusion of late teens is meant ""to enable their return (to school) and the orderly holding of exams,"" the Education Ministry spokeswoman said. 
Israel awards a matriculation certificate to high school students in grades 10-12 who pass exams, administered by the Education Ministry, that play a major role in acceptance to universities. They can also affect placement in the military, where many Israelis do compulsory service after high school. 
Israel has the world's fastest vaccine distribution rate. With regular imports of  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE) vaccines, it has administered at least one dose to more than 25% of its 9 million population since Dec. 19, the Health Ministry says.
The country has been under a third national lockdown since Dec. 27, which it plans to lift at the end of January. Critics say the government has mishandled the crisis, lacking a clear long-term strategy and allowing politics to cloud its decisions. 

Education Minister Yoav Galant, speaking on Ynet TV, said it was too early to know if schools would reopen next month.

One person was hurt, although the severity of the injuries was unclear, according to local media.
The short video, which was shot by an onlooker just before 7 p.m. local time on Saturday and later posted online, shows cars with squealing tires turning donuts on downtown streets. Then the Tacoma Police patrol car - surrounded by people - surges forward, knocking roughly five people to the ground before driving off.
Tacoma Police spokeswoman Wendy Haddow said police were alerted to the street racers and a 100-person crowd blocking area streets, according to the News Tribune. When the patrol car responded, the crowd began pounding on the vehicle's windows, she told local media. 
“He was afraid they would break his glass,” Haddow told the News Tribune, saying the officer sped away from the scene for his own safety.
One person was injured in the incident and taken to a local hospital, she said.

Tropical cyclone Eloise hit Mozambique's Sofala coastal province on Saturday morning before weakening and heading inland to dump rain on Zimbabwe, eSwatini - formerly known as Swaziland - and South Africa. 
Authorities initially said Eloise had only caused minor damage in Mozambique's port city of Beira but that it was too early to gauge the full extent of the damage across the rest of the region. 
On Sunday, Mozambique's National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction (INGD) said investigations had shown Eloise had injured 12 people and displaced 6,859. The region's Buzi district had been particularly hard hit with wind speeds of up to 150 kph.
""Families are in urgent need of essential supplies like food, water, blankets and shelter,"" Marcia Penicela, project manager at ActionAid Mozambique said, speaking from Beira.
""With high flood waters and power lines down in Buzi, the challenge will now be reaching people most in need,"" she added.
Eloise had ruined 136,755 hectares of crops, destroyed nine schools and damaged about 17 other schools and 11 hospitals, INGD said in a statement.
It had completely destroyed 1,069 houses, partially destroyed 3,343 and flooded another 1,500, the agency added.
Eloise later weakened and was downgraded to a tropical storm, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. 
On Sunday it moved on from Zimbabwe to dump heavy rain on some areas of South Africa's Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Kwa-Zulu Natal provinces, authorities there said. eSwatini was also experiencing rainfall.
""So far the highest amount that we've recorded is somewhere between 115-128 mm of rainfall in Limpopo, especially in the northeast,"" Puseletso Mofokeng, a senior forecaster at the South African Weather Service, told Reuters.
Floods had hit the low veld of Limpopo and Mpumalanga, and winds had blown the roofs of houses and knocked down trees, blocking roads, he said. 
Certain parts of those provinces were likely to see another 100 mm of rain tonight and more expected rain on Monday, he added. 

Heavy rains were also recorded in eastern and south eastern parts of Zimbabwe on Saturday, filling most dams and flooding some rivers. At least three people were swept away when they tried to cross flooded rivers in eastern Zimbabwe, authorities said.

The police statement comes after India's Supreme Court on Wednesday declined a government petition to ban the rally.
Farmers have been camping on the outskirts of national capital for around two months in protest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's controversial farm laws which they say will hurt their livelihoods and help big companies.
To up the ante, farmers wanted to drive tractors to the centre of New Delhi on Jan. 26, the Republic Day national holiday when Modi will join a parade of military forces in the capital.
Senior police officer Dependra Pathak said the city police would allow at least 12,000 tractors on Delhi's roads to move over a 100 km (62.14 mile) stretch away from the centre on Jan. 26 after the parade.
""This will be a very challenging task but we decided upon it so that there is a peaceful and disciplined solution,"" he told a news conference.
Security arrangements were being made to allow tractors through certain designated entry and exit points on the day, Pathak said, adding that intelligence inputs indicate some people may try to disrupt a peaceful rally by the farmers.
The government - which says the agriculture reforms will boost farmer incomes - has agreed to suspend the laws, but the farmers have said New Delhi must repeal them. 

Talks between farmers and Modi's government have so far failed to break the deadlock - landing Modi with one of his most significant challenges since he was re-elected in 2019.

Caracas says much of eastern Guyana is its own territory, a claim that is rejected by Georgetown. The conflict has flared up in recent years as Guyana has started developing oil reserves near the disputed area.
""The Venezuelan vessel was illegally manoeuvring within Guyana's EEZ and Contiguous Zone when it intercepted, boarded and commandeered the Guyanese fishing vessels,"" Guyana's foreign ministry said in a statement. 
""Guyana condemns in the strongest possible terms this wanton act of aggression by the Venezuelan armed forces against Guyana and Guyanese citizens.""
The vessels were intercepted on Thursday and taken to Venezuela's port city of Guiria, where the crew and ships were detained, the statement said. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Exclusive Economic Zones, or EEZs, are maritime areas in which countries have special rights with regards to the exploration and use of marine resources. They generally extend 200 miles off the coast.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro this month issued a decree creating a ""Strategic Zone for the Development of the Atlantic Facade"" in an area that Guyana says encompasses its EEZ and its territorial waters.

Austin, in talks with Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi, confirmed that Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan security treaty, which stipulates U.S. defence obligations to Japan, covers the uninhabited islands, the Pentagon said in a statement.
The islets are known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and Diaoyu in China.
Austin also reaffirmed that the United States remains opposed to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea, the Pentagon said. 
Japan has become increasingly concerned about Chinese activity in the East China Sea, including incursions into waters around the islands. 
The talks marked the first ministerial discussions between Tokyo and Washington since U.S. President Joe Biden took office on Wednesday. Retired Army general Austin made history on Friday by becoming America's first Black defence secretary.
Japan's defence ministry was not immediately available for comment.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday urged Romans to help the homeless in the Italian capital, after a spike in the number dying from the cold. 
Speaking at his noon blessing, Francis told the story of Edwin, a 46-year-old Nigerian who died of exposure near St. Peter's Square on Wednesday.
""His story joins those of others who have recently died in Rome in the same dramatic circumstances. Let us pray for Edwin,"" Francis said.
The Sant' Egidio charity group said Edwin was at least the fourth homeless person to die of the cold in the city this year and the 10th since November.
""Let us think of Edwin, let us think of what this 46-year-old man felt in the cold, ignored by all, abandoned, even by us. Let us pray for him,"" the pope said.
Sant' Egidio and other groups scour Rome streets to direct homeless to shelters, and give out blankets and food.
They have asked city authorities to open subway stations at night. 
The Vatican and its related charities run facilities including night shelters, bathing places, soup kitchens, and a clinic.
The 84-year-old pope delivered the address while standing in the Vatican library despite a renewed flare-up of a sciatica condition that causes pain in his legs and forced him to miss three events on Sunday and Monday.
Francis had been scheduled to say a Mass on Sunday morning and a vespers service on Monday. Both require the main celebrant to stand for long periods. He also postponed his annual address to the diplomatic corps that was set for Monday.

It was the second time this month that he had to miss events because of the flare-up.

Scotland voted against independence by 55% to 45% in a 2014 referendum. But a majority of Scots also backed staying in the European Union in the subsequent 2016 Brexit vote, stoking demands by Scottish nationalists for a new independence vote after the UK as a whole voted to leave.
Sturgeon's Scottish National Party (SNP), which runs the semi-autonomous Edinburgh executive, laid out plans on Saturday for a new referendum if, as expected, it wins Scottish elections in May.
Johnson said earlier this month he thought there should be a gap of about 40 years before any new referendum.
""He's frightened of democracy,"" Sturgeon said during a BBC television interview on Sunday.
""If the SNP win the Scottish election in a few months' time on a proposition of giving the people that choice, what democrat could rightly stand in the way of that?"" she said.
Johnson says the SNP presented the 2014 referendum as a ""once in a generation"" event and cannot now insist on another. 
The SNP counters that the situation has changed because of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union. Scots' votes against Brexit in 2016 were outweighed by a majority voting in favour in more populous England.
Sturgeon's party says EU membership was presented in 2014 as a key argument for Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom, only for Scots to be dragged out of the bloc against their will.
NORTHERN IRELAND
Brexit has led to similar discussions in Northern Ireland, which also voted to stay in the EU. Republicans there want a so-called ""border poll"" on unification with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member, while Unionists want to remain part of the United Kingdom.
""There is an unstoppable conversation underway on our constitutional future,"" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn Fein, a Republican party, said on Twitter on Sunday.
""It is time for the Irish government to step up preparations. We can overcome the barriers of partition and build a new Ireland.""
First Minister Arlene Foster of the Democratic Unionist Party criticised O'Neill for raising constitutional issues in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We all know how divisive a border poll would be, and for us in Northern Ireland what we have to do at the moment is all come together to fight against COVID,"" she said on Sky News.

President Rodrigo Duterte's government has stepped up efforts to end a Maoist-led rebellion, one of the world's longest insurgencies that has killed more than 40,000 people.
Last week, Philippine students and activists protested against a government decision to allow security forces to patrol the campuses of the country's biggest university, the University of the Philippines (UP), which authorities also accused of being a breeding ground for communist rebels. 
A number of UP students, some killed in military operations or captured, had been identified as members of the communist party's armed wing, the defence ministry said in a letter to UP's president this month, without providing evidence.
Lieutenant General Antonio Parlade, head of an anti-rebel task force, has named the Far Eastern University, De La Salle University, University of Santo Tomas, and the Ateneo De Manila University as among 18 schools where the New People's Army has been recruiting new members.
""We object to General Parlade's statement and emphasize that our institutions neither promote nor condone recruitment activities of the New People's Army and, indeed of any movement that aims to violently overthrow the government,"" the presidents of the four universities said in a statement. 
The United Nations had warned in a report that ""red-tagging"", or labelling people and groups as communists or terrorists, and incitement to violence have been rife in the Southeast Asian nation.

Since coming into power in 2016, Duterte's government has seen repeated breakdowns in peace talks with the communist rebels.

A protest against lockdown measures is planned for Sunday afternoon on Amsterdam's Museum Square, and Mayor Femke Halsema designated the area as a ""high-risk zone"" to give police the power to frisk people for weapons.
Last Sunday, protesters clashed with riot police on horseback on the square, leading to the detention of 143 people.
Parliament voted narrowly last week to approve the curfew, swayed by assertions that an English variant is about to cause a new surge in cases. New infections in the country have generally been declining for a month.
Police said those who were arrested on Saturday night were people who refused to go home or who committed acts of violence. A group of youths in the fishing village of Urk threw fireworks and rocks at police and burned down a temporary COVID-19 testing centre.
Exceptions to the curfew, which runs through Feb. 9, include medical emergencies, people performing essential jobs and people walking their dogs. Violators can be fined 95 euros ($115).
Schools and non-essential shops in the Netherlands have been shut since mid-December, following the closure of bars and restaurants two months earlier.

The Netherlands was the last country in the Europe Union to begin vaccinations and so far has vaccinated a total of 77,000 doctors and nurses.

Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmed al-Sabah, facing his first big political challenge since taking power in September, tasked Sheikh Sabah with nominating a new cabinet for approval, state news agency KUNA said.
The barely one month-old government had been acting in a caretaker role since it resigned over the confrontation with parliament. The situation has complicated efforts to tackle a severe liquidity crunch in the wealthy OPEC member state caused by low oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic.
Frequent rows and deadlocks between cabinet and the elected assembly have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament over decades, hampering investment and economic and fiscal reform.
The motion earlier this month to question Sheikh Sabah, premier since late 2019, was supported by more than 30 MPs in the 50-seat assembly in which the opposition made gains.
The motion, seen by Reuters, referred to a cabinet that did not reflect last year's legislative elections and to government “interference” in electing the speaker and members of parliamentary committees.

Kuwait has the most vibrant political system among Gulf Arab states, with a parliament able to pass, and block, legislation and question ministers. However, senior government posts are occupied by members of Kuwait's ruling family, and the emir has final say in state matters.

Matt Hancock said all 77 cases were connected to travel from South Africa and were under close observation, as were nine identified cases of a Brazilian variant.
""They are under very close observation, and we have enhanced contact tracing to do everything we possibly can to stop them from spreading,"" he said during an interview on BBC television.
Oxford professor Anthony Harnden, deputy chair of a scientific committee on vaccination that advises the government, said the South African and Brazilian variants were of concern because COVID-19 vaccines may not be effective against them.
""The new variants abroad are a real worry. The South African and the Brazilian Amazonian ones, there are hints that there will be vaccine escape,"" he said on Sky News, adding that new variants would keep appearing around the world.
Britain has the highest death toll in Europe from COVID-19, at close to 100,000, and has been in lockdown for most of January with hospitals struggling to cope with record numbers of seriously ill COVID patients.
The government has attributed the high transmission rates that led it to impose the lockdown in part to a highly contagious variant first identified in southeast England and now prevalent in many areas.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday the English variant may be associated with a higher level of mortality, although scientists have said the evidence on that remained uncertain, a message Hancock re-emphasised on Sunday.
""The scientists do think that it may be more deadly, and they've put various estimates on that from about 10% more deadly to a bit more than that, we are not exactly certain about how much more deadly,"" he said on Sky News.

""In a way, for all of us, that doesn't matter, what matters is we have got to get this virus under control and the only way you do that is by stopping the social contact and following the rules,"" he said.

AMSTERDAM/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Dutch police have arrested the alleged leader of a large Asian drug syndicate who is listed as one of the world's most-wanted fugitives and has been compared to Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
Tse Chi Lop, a Chinese-born Canadian national, was detained on Friday at the request of Australian police, who led an investigation that found his organisation dominates the $70 billion-a-year Asia-Pacific drug trade, Dutch police spokesman Thomas Aling said on Saturday.
Tse is expected to be extradited after appearing before a judge, Aling said, adding that his arrest by national police took place without incident at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.
""He was already on the most-wanted list and he was detained based on intelligence we received,"" Aling said. 
Dutch police were unable to provide details about the legal proceedings and it was not clear if Tse had a lawyer.
Tse's crime syndicate allegedly dominates the Asia-Pacific crystal methamphetamine trade, which increased fourfold in the five years to 2019, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.
Regional law enforcers say the syndicate has imported highly potent meth into more than a dozen countries, including Japan, Australia and New Zealand, as well as trafficking heroin and MDMA. 
Tse, 57, an ex-convict who formerly lived in Toronto, has moved between Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan in recent years, according to counter-narcotics officers from four countries and documents reviewed by Reuters.
The group has ""been connected with or directly involved in at least 13 cases"" of drug trafficking since January 2015, the documents showed. 
Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for the UNODC, told Reuters in 2019 that ""Tse Chi Lop is in the league of El Chapo or maybe Pablo Escobar,"" referring to Latin America's most notorious drug lords.
The UNODC estimated that Tse's drug syndicate earned as much as $17 billion in 2018.
The syndicate he is suspected of running is known to its members as ""The Company"". Law enforcers also refer to it as ""Sam Gor"" - or Brother Number Three in Cantonese - after one of Tse's nicknames, Reuters reported at the time. Reuters was unable to contact Tse for comment on the report at that time.
'THEY GOT THEIR MAN'
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) said on Sunday it issued an arrest warrant for Tse in 2019, ""in connection with AFP-led Operation Volante, which dismantled a global crime syndicate operating in five countries.""
The AFP also led an international investigation, dubbed Operation Kungur, into Tse and his syndicate that included about 20 agencies from more than a dozen countries. 
""The syndicate targeted Australia over a number of years, importing and distributing large amounts of illicit narcotics, laundering the profits overseas and living off the wealth obtained from crime,"" the AFP added.
Documents reviewed by Reuters allege the syndicate's money laundering operation spans the globe, with casino junkets and property investments both used as vehicles to launder earnings.
The UNODC's Douglas hailed the arrest as a ""great result"" but cautioned that it may not have a big impact on drug trafficking in the region.
""They got their man. Kudos to the Australian Federal Police. But the organisation remains, the demand for synthetic drugs has been built, and someone will step in to replace Tse,"" said Douglas.
""It is hard to see his arrest having much of an impact on drug trafficking beyond the near-term if the poor governance, corruption and easily available drug precursors in the region remain unaddressed.""

BRUSSELS/ANKARA (Reuters) - After a five-year hiatus marked by grievances over their rival claims to Mediterranean waters, Turkey resumes talks with Greece on Monday in the first test of its hopes to reverse deteriorating relations with the European Union.
While diplomats say that rebuilding trust will be a hard slog, the talks follow Turkey's decision to stop its search for gas in disputed waters which angered Greece and Cyprus and a cooling of rhetoric around Ankara's wider disputes with the EU.
They could also pave the way for an imminent visit to Turkey by EU leaders.
Both sides say there is political will to improve relations, but after years of rancour over refugees, human rights, maritime claims, Turkey's military interventions and the divided island of Cyprus, rapprochement appears a distant prospect.
Expressing guarded optimism, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told Reuters he saw a ""window of opportunity"" but that Ankara needed to ""abandon this line of confrontation"" and seek dialogue.
President Tayyip Erdogan, who has accused the bloc of ""strategic blindness"" towards Turkey, told EU ambassadors in Ankara this month he was ready to improve ties.
Diplomats say it will need more than a shift in tone and the withdrawal of Turkey's survey vessel from disputed waters to silence calls from some EU states for sanctions on Ankara, which EU leaders will discuss in March.
""I don't see any great reconciliation to move us off the trajectory we are on. It is going to take a significant gesture from Turkey,"" one diplomat in Brussels said, adding there was no reason to be optimistic.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, in Brussels this week on a mission to maintain what he called the ""positive atmosphere"" between Ankara and the EU, said on Friday talks on Cyprus would be held in New York in the next two months.
ECONOMIC HARM
Erdogan's effort to build bridges with Turkey's main trading partner comes as his government struggles with an economic slowdown. While the COVID-19 pandemic has been the main brake on growth, international tensions have also weighed on the economy. 
Setting out a new economic path in November, Erdogan also promised reforms of Turkey's judiciary after repeated criticism from Western allies who say the rule of law has eroded in Turkey after a 2016 coup attempt and subsequent crackdown.
Turkey has ignored several rulings by the European Court of Human Rights calling for the release of the country's most prominent detainees, Kurdish politician Selahettin Demirtas and businessman Osman Kavala.
Erdogan has yet to spell out what measures will be taken, but has ruled out releasing the two men.
""How much Turkey will be able to meet its expectations from the EU without taking any (reform) steps is doubtful,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and head of Istanbul-based Centre for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies. 
Better ties with Europe may also depend in part on how much Ankara can address differences with the new administration in the United States, after Washington imposed sanctions on Turkey last month over its purchase of Russian defence systems.
A day ahead of President Joe Biden's inauguration, incoming Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would review whether further sanctions were necessary and accused NATO partner Turkey of not acting like an ally.
At a summit in December the EU said it would coordinate its response to Turkey with the United States, meaning that Ankara's relations with Washington will be ""a determinant factor in Turkey's ties with the West as a whole"", Ulgen said.
'ZERO NAIVETY'
Even before the talks with Athens start, the two sides disagree over what they should cover, with Greece insisting they should be limited to demarcating maritime territorial limits and Exclusive Economic Zones.
    Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told parliament on Wednesday Athens would not discuss issues it considered sovereign rights and would approach the talks with optimism but ""zero naivety"".
    Greece has ruled out discussion on other issues Turkey has raised, including demilitarization of eastern Aegean islands, saying that was an issue to do with sovereign rights.
Turkey has also been working on a roadmap to normalise ties with NATO partner France. French President Emmanuel Macron has been a vocal critic of Turkey's military intervention in Libya and its challenge to Greek and Cypriot maritime claims. 
Erdogan in return has accused Macron of harbouring an anti-Islamic agenda and questioned his mental state. 
Turkey has appointed a new envoy to Paris - a former university classmate of Macron's - and a diplomat said the two leaders had exchanged letters in which Macron proposed a video call.

But a French diplomatic source said it was too early to consider that Turkey had changed its ways. Paris would work with its partners on possible sanctions until Turkey's words were met with concrete actions, the source said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said it will administer homegrown coronavirus vaccine COVAXIN in seven more states from Monday as it seeks to inoculate 30 million healthcare workers across the country. 
The government this month gave emergency-use approval to the vaccine, developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd and state-run Indian Council of Medical Research, and another licensed from Oxford University and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) PLC that is being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.
The expansion from the 12 states now administering COVAXIN includes the southern state of Kerala, which has a high COVID-19 caseload, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state of Gujarat, the government said late on Saturday.
Some doctors have expressed doubt about COVAXIN, which was approved without efficacy data from late-stage clinical trials. The government says it is safe. The Lancet medical journal said on Thursday the drug produced an immune response in a small group of adults. 
Authorities have inoculated nearly 1.6 million health workers overall using the two vaccines, the government said on Sunday.
India is also exporting doses, including commercial shipments to Brazil and Morocco, and free shipments to the Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Nepal.
India recently trained immunisation-programme managers from 13 foreign countries using Indian vaccines, the government said.
With 1.35 billion people, India has reported 10.65 million coronavirus infections - the highest after the United States - with 153,339 COVID-19 deaths.

The vaccination drive, targeting frontline workers, is to be expanded later to cover 270 million people older than 50 or deemed at high risk because of pre-existing medical conditions.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2021 06:00AM ET</span>",China-Taiwan tensions rise days into Biden presidency,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Chinese air force planes including 12 fighter jets entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone for a second day on Sunday, Taiwan said, as tensions rise near the island just days into U.S. President Joe Biden's new administration.
China views democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and has in the past few months increased military activity near the island.
But China's activities over the weekend mark a ratcheting up with fighters and bombers being dispatched rather than reconnaissance aircraft as had generally been the case in recent weeks.
After eight Chinese bomber planes and four fighter jets flew into Taiwan's defence zone on Saturday, between mainland Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea, a further 15 flew into the same air space on Sunday, Taiwan said.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said China sent six J-10 fighters, four J-16s, two SU-30s, a Y-8 reconnaissance aircraft and two Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft.
Taiwan's air force was sent up to respond, it added.
""Airborne alert sorties had been tasked, radio warnings issued and air defence missile systems deployed to monitor the activity,"" the ministry said. 
China has yet to comment. It has previously said such actions are aimed at defending the country's sovereignty and designed to act as a warning against ""collusion"" between the United States and Taiwan.
The move is likely to further concern Washington, which on Saturday urged China to stop pressuring Taiwan and reaffirmed its commitment to the island and desire to deepen ties.
Earlier on Sunday, the U.S. military said that a U.S. aircraft carrier group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt had entered the disputed South China Sea to promote ""freedom of the seas"".
Biden was sworn into office only on Wednesday. His administration says its commitment to Taiwan is ""rock-solid"".
The United States, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.

Opinion polls show that the incumbent, President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of the centre-right Social Democratic Party, is likely to win with ease.
Voters queued up as polls opened in the Lisbon parish of Santo Antonio, guided by red stickers on the ground marking the two-metre gap.
""I'm here among the first to avoid groups and queues,"" Cristina Queda, 58, said as she waited. ""Since the date of the elections wasn't changed, I decided to come early to avoid that situation.""
Just under two thirds of Portuguese thought the election should have been postponed because of the pandemic, according to a poll conducted last week by research institute ISC/ISCTE.
Pollsters predict record abstention of 60-70% in part because hundreds of thousands of voters are themselves in quarantine.
Santo Antonio parish head Vasco Morgado said councils had taken all precautions - in his parish's case, including even ambulances at the door in case of emergency. 
""This is as safe as is possible at this time,"" Morgado said. ""It's a democratic act which many people have fought for over the years - the proof of which is that now, even in a pandemic, people are getting out to vote.""
The country of 10 million people is experiencing a severe post-Christmas pandemic surge, with the world's highest seven-day rolling average of new cases and deaths per capita.
Authorities reported a record daily toll of 274 deaths and more than 15,300 new cases on Saturday, with ambulances queuing for several hours at hospitals full to capacity.

""I don't agree that the date wasn't changed,"" Jose Antonio Queda, 72, who also came early with his wife, said. ""If we're in confinement, we should be avoiding the virus as much as possible.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese rescuers pulled 11 gold miners to safety on Sunday with most of them in good condition after 14 days trapped underground after an explosion, but 10 colleagues were still unaccounted for, state media reported.
Television footage showed the first miner as he was brought to the surface in the morning, a black blindfold shielding his eyes from daylight as he was lifted out of a shaft.
The miner was extremely weak, state broadcaster CCTV reported on its Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) site. Rescue workers wrapped the barely responsive man in a blanket and took him to hospital by ambulance.
Over the next few hours, 10 miners from a different section of the mine, who had been getting food and medical supplies down a shaft from rescue workers last week, were brought out in batches.
""We made a breakthrough this morning,"" chief engineer at the rescue centre, Xiao Wenru, told the Xinhua news agency.
""After clearing these broken, powdery pieces, we found that there were cavities underneath ... our progress accelerated.""
Officials had said on Thursday it could take another two weeks to drill a rescue shaft through blockages to reach the group of 10. 
One of the men brought to the surface was injured but several were shown walking, supported by rescue workers and wearing black cloth over their eyes, before being taken away by ambulance.
They were in good physical condition and had been getting normal food since Saturday, after several days of living off nutrient solutions, the Xinhua news agency said.
China's mines are among the world's deadliest. It recorded 573 mine-related deaths in 2020, according to the National Mine Safety Administration. 
The Jan. 10 explosion in the Hushan mine in Qixia, a major gold-producing region under the administration of Yantai in coastal Shandong province, trapped 22 workers about 600 metres (2,000 feet) underground.
One miner is known to have died. Ten are unaccounted for. 
More than 600 rescuers have been on the site working to reach the men. 
The workers' escape is similar to the rescue of 33 miners trapped in the San Jose copper-gold mine in Chile for more than 69 days in 2010.
The Chilean miners, who were caught in a cave-in, survived on rations of food and water for 17 days until rescue crews gave them a lifeline by drilling a tiny hole into the chamber where they had taken refuge.
Weeks later, a larger hole was drilled and the miners were pulled to the surface as a captivated global audience watched.

1313,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2021 04:25AM ET</span>",Taiwan reports large incursion by Chinese air force,"By Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Eight Chinese bomber planes and four fighter jets entered the southwestern corner of Taiwan's air defence identification zone on Saturday, and Taiwan's air force deployed missiles to ""monitor"" the incursion, the island's defence ministry said.
China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has conducted almost daily flights over the waters between the southern part of Taiwan and the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea in recent months. 
However, they have generally consisted of just one or two reconnaissance aircraft.
The presence of so many Chinese combat aircraft on this mission - Taiwan said it was made up of eight nuclear-capable H-6K bombers and four J-16 fighter jets - was unusual.
A map provided by Taiwan's defence ministry showed that the Chinese aircraft, including a Y-8 anti-submarine aircraft, flew over the same waters where the most recent Chinese missions have been taking place near the Pratas Islands, though still well away from mainland Taiwan. 
Taiwan's air force warned away the Chinese aircraft and deployed missiles to monitor them, the ministry said, using standard wording for how it responds to such activities.
""Airborne alert sorties had been tasked, radio warnings issued and air defence missile systems deployed to monitor the activity,"" it said in a brief statement.
The U.S. State Department urged China to stop pressuring Taiwan and reaffirmed its commitment to the island and desire to deepen ties.
""We urge Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan and instead engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan's democratically elected representatives,"" State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.
""We will continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining a sufficient self-defence capability.""
There was no immediate comment from China. In the past, China has said it has been carrying out exercises to defend its sovereignty and security.
Taiwan's foreign ministry expressed its thanks for the show of U.S. support, adding they would work closely with the Biden administration to strengthen their close partnership.
Lo Chih-Cheng, a senior lawmaker for Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party who sits on parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee, told Reuters China was trying to deter the new U.S. government from backing the island.
""It's sending a message to the Biden administration,"" he said.
Beijing has watched with growing concern increasing U.S. support for democratic Taiwan, especially during Donald Trump's administration, which left office on Wednesday.
Last year, during visits by senior U.S. officials to Taipei, Chinese aircraft briefly crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.
The flight by the Chinese bombers and fighters on Saturday came just days after Joe Biden assumed the U.S. presidency.
Emily Horne, spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said the U.S. commitment to Taiwan was ""rock-solid"" after the island's de facto ambassador in Washington, Hsiao Bi-khim, attended Biden's swearing-in on Wednesday.

U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement the strike group entered the South China Sea on Saturday, the same day Taiwan reported a large incursion of Chinese bombers and fighter jets into its air defence identification zone in the vicinity of the Pratas Islands. 
The U.S. military said the carrier strike group was in the South China Sea, a large part of which is claimed by China, to conduct routine operations ""to ensure freedom of the seas, build partnerships that foster maritime security"". 
""After sailing through these waters throughout my 30-year career, it's great to be in the South China Sea again, conducting routine operations, promoting freedom of the seas, and reassuring allies and partners,"" Rear Adm. Doug Verissimo, commander of the strike group, was quoted as saying.
""With two-thirds of the world's trade travelling through this very important region, it is vital that we maintain our presence and continue to promote the rules-based order which has allowed us all to prosper,"" Verissimo said in the statement.
The announcement comes just days after Joe Biden was sworn in as U.S. president. 
Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday there was ""no doubt"" China posed the most significant challenge to the United States of any nation.
China has repeatedly complained about U.S. Navy ships getting close to Chinese-occupied islands in the South China Sea, where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan all have competing claims. 

The Theodore Roosevelt is being accompanied by the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Bunker Hill, and the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyers USS Russell and USS John Finn, the U.S. statement said.

Three crew members remained aboard the Turkish vessel, called Mozart, after the attack on Saturday morning in the Gulf of Guinea. 
One crew member, an Azeri, was killed during the incident and 15 were kidnapped by the pirates, Turkey's state-run Anadolu agency said. The ship, abandoned by the pirates and now headed toward Gabon's coast, initially had a full crew of 19. 
Turkish media cited Istanbul-based ship owner Boden company as saying the owners and operators of the vessel were abducted at gunpoint. It had been headed to Cape Town from Lagos. Boden was not immediately available. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan spoke twice by phone with one of the captains who remained on the ship, Furkan Yaren, his office said, adding he directed officials on the rescue mission for the other kidnapped personnel. 
Anadolu cited Yaren as saying he was ""cruising blindly"" toward Gabon with only the ship's radar working. It was to arrive Sunday morning. 
Yaren was also cited as saying the pirates beat crew members, and left him with an injured leg while another still aboard the ship had shrapnel wounds. 
Azerbaijan's foreign minister, Jeyhun Bayramov, confirmed on Twitter the death of the Azeri crew member in the ""pirate attack"" on the Turkish ship.
The vessel last reported its location about 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of Lagos, according to MarineTraffic website. It was to have arrived in South Africa a week later.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2021 01:40AM ET</span>","Bangladesh to buy Myanmar rice, putting aside Rohingya crisis","By Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh will buy 100,000 tonnes of rice from Myanmar, putting aside a rift over the Rohingya refugee crisis as the government races to overcome a shortage of the staple food for the country's more than 160 million people.
High rice prices pose a problem for the Dhaka government, which is ramping up efforts to replenish its depleted reserves after floods last year ravaged crops and sent prices to a record high. 
Muslim-majority Bangladesh and mostly Buddhist Myanmar have been at odds over the more than 1 million Muslim Rohingya refugees in camps in southern Bangladesh. The vast majority of them fled Myanmar in 2017 from a military-led crackdown that U.N investigators said was executed with ""genocidal intent"" - assertions that Myanmar denies.
Bangladesh will import white rice in a government-to-government deal at $485 a tonne, including cost, insurance and freight (CIF) liner out basis, said Mosammat Nazmanara Khanum, the secretary at the country's food ministry.
""Our main priority is to bring down the prices of rice,"" Khanum told Reuters on Sunday, adding the government could buy as much as 10 million tonnes while private traders are allowed to buy another 10 million tonnes in the year to June.
The deal will be signed soon and the rice will be delivered by April in phases, she said.
Bangladesh is also buying 150,000 tonnes of rice from India's state-run firm NAFED in a government-to-government deal while it has issued a series of tender to buy the grain.
""We could buy more rice from India in state-to-state deals,"" Khanum said, adding that the Food Ministry was holding talks with several other Indian state agencies.
Bangladesh, traditionally the world's third-biggest rice producer with around 35 million tonnes annually, uses almost all its production to feed its people. It still often requires imports to cope with shortages caused by floods or droughts.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Authorities in Chile said on Saturday they regretted spreading panic with a mistaken tsunami warning calling for people to get out of coastal areas following an earthquake in Antarctica.
The interior ministry said on Twitter that a tremor of magnitude 7.1 struck at 8.36 p.m. 216 km northeast of the O'Higgins Chilean scientific base and called for the coastal regions of Antarctica to be evacuated because of a tsunami risk.
The ministry also sent a message to cellphones around the country urging people to abandon coastal areas, though the ministry later said it was sent in error.
""We want to provide peace of mind to the population, tell them that it is not necessary to evacuate the entire national territory, only the Antarctic base,"" Miguel Ortiz of the ministry's National Emergency Office (ONEMI) told a news conference.
He said the agency regretted the inconvenience caused by its messages, which he blamed on a technical error.
The tsunami warning for Antarctica was later lifted.
People in coastal cities including La Serena, to the north of Santiago, and Valparaiso, started to leave areas close to the coast after the warning until reports started appearing that it was a false alarm.
But as Chileans were reacting to the warning, a second tremor, of magnitude 5.6, struck the Chile-Argentina border region, at 9.07 p.m., the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences said, at a depth of 133 km and 30km east of Santiago. 
No damage was reported from either quake.
The second one was close to Codelco's Andina and Teniente copper mines and  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) PLC's Los Bronces. 
The Chilean mining regulator Sernageomin said that workers, mining operations and facilities had reported no problems after the quake. 
Sernageomin said that following the first quake, 80 people were evacuated from Chile's main base in the Antarctic, the Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva Base on Fildes Peninsula west of King George Island, and 55 more from three other bases, along with five foreign bases.

The army said no damage was reported at the Antarctic base.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2021 05:50PM ET</span>","Bolsonaro's support falls sharply, but a majority reject impeachment, polls show","RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Support for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has overseen the world's second deadliest coronavirus outbreak, has fallen sharply, a Datafolha poll shows, as a brutal second wave and a lack of vaccines sour views of his far-right government. 
However, despite his declining support, a majority of Brazilians are now against him being impeached, a second Datafolha poll found. Both were released late on Friday.
According to one of the polls, Bolsonaro's administration was rated as bad or terrible by 40% of respondents, compared with 32% in an early-December survey. Just under a third of respondents rated Bolsonaro's government as good or excellent, versus 37% in the previous poll. 
The poll results are a blow for the president. The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper said they represent the biggest drop in approval since the beginning of his government in 2019. 
Brazilians have grown increasingly irate at the slow pace of Brazil's vaccine rollout, which began last weekend but remains blighted with few vaccines to inoculate the country's 210 million people and stall a snowballing second wave. 
Pot-banging protests, a hallmark of the early days of the pandemic, erupted in some cities earlier this month, and both left- and right-wing groups convened pro-impeachment marches across the country this weekend.
To make matters worse, a new virus variant has appeared in the north of the country that researchers believe has higher levels of transmissibility. Some countries have barred entry for Brazilian travelers. 
Bolsonaro, a former army captain, is already under pressure for his handling of the outbreak. He has sought to minimize the gravity of the virus and even said he won't take any COVID-19 shot, stoking growing anti-vaccine sentiment.
On Saturday, the Health Ministry said 1,202 more people had died from COVID-19, bringing total fatalities to 216,445. There have been more than 8.8 million confirmed cases.
Another Datafolha poll found that 53% of respondents are against Congress opening impeachment proceedings against the president for his handling of the pandemic, compared with 50% in a previous survey. Those favoring impeachment fell to 43% from 46% previously. 
Both polls were conducted on Jan 20-21, interviewing 2,030 Brazilians, with a 2 percentage point margin of error.

1322,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2021 03:07PM ET</span>",Police clamp down on Russian protests against jailing of Kremlin foe Navalny,"By Tom Balmforth and Anton Zverev
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Police detained more than 2,500 people and used force to break up rallies across Russia on Saturday as tens of thousands of protesters ignored extreme cold and police warnings to demand the release of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. 
Navalny had called on his supporters to protest after being arrested last weekend as he returned to Russia from Germany for the first time since being poisoned with a nerve agent he says was slipped to him by state security agents in August. 
The authorities had warned people to stay away from Saturday's protests, saying they risked catching COVID-19 as well as prosecution and possible jail time for attending an unauthorised event. 
But protesters defied the ban and, in at least one case in temperatures below -50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit), turned out in force. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, called on them to do the same next weekend to try to free Navalny from what he called ""the clutches of his killers"". 
In central Moscow, where Reuters reporters estimated at least 40,000 people had gathered in one of the biggest unauthorised rallies for years, police were seen roughly detaining people, bundling them into nearby vans. 
The authorities said just some 4,000 people had shown up, while the foreign ministry questioned Reuters' crowd estimate.
""Why not just immediately say 4 million?,"" it suggested sarcastically on its official Telegram messenger channel. 
Ivan Zhdanov, a Navalny ally, put turnout in the capital at 50,000, the Proekt media outlet reported. 
Some protesters chanted ""Putin is a thief"", and ""Disgrace"" and ""Freedom to Navalny!"" 
U.S. CONDEMNS 'HARSH TACTICS'
Navalny's wife Yulia was briefly detained at the rally before being released. Some of Navalny's political allies were detained in the days before the protest; others on the day itself. 
At one point, protesters surrounded a sleek black car with a flashing light used by senior officials, throwing snowballs at it and kicking it. A group of policemen were also pelted with snowballs by a much bigger crowd.
The OVD-Info protest monitor group said that at least 2,509 people, including 952 in Moscow and 374 in St Petersburg, had been detained at rallies in around 100 towns and cities.
The United States condemned what it described as ""harsh tactics"" used against protesters and journalists and called for Navalny's ""immediate and unconditional"" release.
""We call on Russian authorities to release all those detained for exercising their universal rights,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement.
Navalny, a 44-year-old lawyer, is in a Moscow prison pending the outcome of four legal matters he describes as trumped up. He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him. 
Some protesters marched on the prison, where police were waiting to arrest them. 
Images of protesters with injuries such as bloodied heads circulated on social media. 
The scenes were reminiscent of the months-long unrest in Russia's neighbouring ally Belarus where anti-government protests flared last August over allegations of voter fraud. 
One Moscow protester, Sergei Radchenko, 53, said: ""I'm tired of being afraid. I haven't just turned up for myself and Navalny, but for my son because there is no future in this country.""
He added that he was frightened but felt strongly about what he called an out of control judicial system. 
'PUTIN PALACE'
There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin, which had previously called the protests illegal and the work of ""provocateurs"".
State prosecutors said they would look into alleged violence against police officers by protesters. 
In Berlin, Hamburg and Munich, nearly 1,000 people demonstrated against Navalny's arrest. Small demonstrations were also held in Bulgaria and some 200-300 people protested in Paris. 
Police in Siberia's Yakutsk, one of the coldest cities in the world, where the temperature was -52 Celsius (-62 F) on Saturday, grabbed a protester by his arms and legs and dragged him into a van, video footage showed.
In Moscow, some journalists covering the protests were detained, drawing a rebuke from the U.S. Embassy. 
""Russian authorities arresting peaceful protesters, journalists,"" spokesperson Rebecca Ross said on Twitter. ""Appears to be a concerted campaign to suppress free speech, peaceful assembly."" 
There were outages on mobile phone and internet services, the monitoring site downdetector.ru showed, a tactic sometimes used by authorities to make it harder for protesters to communicate among themselves.
Britain's foreign ministry said it was ""deeply concerned by the detention of peaceful protesters"".
In a push to galvanise support ahead of the protests, Navalny's team released a video this week about an opulent palace on the Black Sea they alleged belonged to Putin, something the Kremlin denied. As of Saturday the clip had been viewed more than 70 million times.
Navalny's allies hope to tap into what polls say are pent-up frustrations among the public over years of falling wages and economic fallout from the pandemic. 

But Putin's grip on power looks unassailable for now and the 68-year-old president regularly records an approval rating of over 60%, much higher than that of Navalny.

Lombardy, the country's wealthiest and most productive area which includes the fashion capital Milan, was forced to close most shops a week ago after being classed ""red"" under Italy's system of tiered restrictions.
Health Minister Roberto Speranza said on Saturday Lombardy had initially submitted wrong data, messing up calculations by Italy's higher health council. 
He then designated Lombardy as ""orange"", allowing shops to reopen and older students to attend classes after they were forced to switch to distance learning.
Lombardy's administration, led by the right-wing League party which has come under fire for its handling of the pandemic, hit back at Rome.
""They wanted us to say it was our mistake, but it wasn't. I'll never agree to saying there has been a mistake in the data we sent,"" Governor Attilio Fontana told a press conference. 
He said the region would press ahead with a lawsuit filed with an administrative court and seek money from the government to compensate shopkeepers who have been forced to close down just as the sales season was starting.
Retail association Confcommercio Milano estimated shops in Milan had lost around 100 million euros in revenue.
Lombardy, the country's industrial heartland, accounts for more than a fifth of Italy's 2.46 million COVID-19 cases to date.
With 26,622 deaths out of the national total of 85,162, it is by far the worst-hit region and was the epicentre of the pandemic during the first wave in the Spring.

Italy calculates its tiers using a rage of data including the number of cases and intensive care occupancy rates.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who would have to agree to a new referendum, argues there is no need for a new vote after independence was rejected by Scottish voters in 2014.
But the SNP has said that if it wins a parliamentary majority at elections scheduled for May 6, it will pass its own bill so that a referendum can take place once the pandemic is over. 
It says that the UK government will either have to agree to it or take legal action to dispute the legal basis of the referendum. 
""Such a legal challenge would be vigorously opposed by an SNP Scottish government,"" said the document, dated Jan. 24. 
Polls show that Scottish nationalists are on course to win a record majority in elections for Scotland's devolved parliament.
Scots voted 55-45% against independence in a referendum in 2014, but Brexit and the British government's handling of the COVID-19 crisis have bolstered support for the SNP, with most polls showing a majority now favour breaking away.
A poll published on The Times website on Saturday showed another potential threat to the future of the UK, with 51% of Northern Irish voters saying they favoured a referendum about their future within the next five years, compared to 44% who oppose it. 
Support for a United Ireland stands at 42% according to the polls, versus 47% who object to Northern Ireland leaving the UK.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2021 01:11PM ET</span>",Hundreds march in Tunisia as protests sharpen,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of people marched in central Tunis on Saturday against inequality and police brutality, in defiance of a ban on demonstrations and as security forces tried to block off the city's main central avenue. 
Protesters chanted ""the people want the fall of the regime"" - a chant popularised during the so-call Arab Spring a decade ago - and held up banners and slogans decrying the security response to more than a week of demonstrations and nightly clashes between youths and police in cities across Tunisia. 
The protests, 10 years after a popular revolt against autocratic rule introduced democracy in Tunisia, represent the biggest bout of political unrest in several years, with police detaining hundreds of people. 
""We can't accept a police state in Tunisia 10 years after the revolution... it is shameful,"" said Mahmoud, a young cafe worker who did not give his family name. 
While the youths clashing with riot police after dark in poor districts of Tunisian cities have voiced few clear political aims, daytime protests have focused on the lack of jobs and on the police response to demonstrations. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated an already dire economy in Tunisia, where many young people seek only to emigrate to Europe and see few opportunities at home. 
At Habib Bourguiba Avenue, the stately tree-lined thoroughfare running from the sea up to the old city of Tunis, police placed barricades to stop protesters gathering. 
Demonstrators instead rallied outside the central bank building and marched through the city, plainclothes police moving on each side with two-way radios. 
The government banned protests last week in what it said was an attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19. 

Though protesters later managed to reach Habib Bourguiba, a symbolic focal point of the 2011 uprising, the attempt to close off the avenue underscored government unease at the momentum of the protests.

Defence Minister Margarita Robles had asked General Miguel Angel Villaroya, chief of defence staff, for explanations after media reports on Friday that he had received the vaccination. 
In a statement on his resignation, the defence ministry indicated but did not explicitly state that Villaroya had had the vaccination. The general ""never intended to take advantage of unjustifiable privileges which damaged the image of the Armed Forces and put in doubt the honour of the general,"" it said.
It added that Villaroya ""took decisions which he thought to be correct"" but which ""damaged the public image of the Armed Forces"". 
It was not immediately possible to contact Villaroya for comment.
At start of the pandemic, Villaroya represented the military at media daily briefings where he detailed how troops were cleaning care homes and caring for elderly residents. 
Spaniards have been indignant over the queue-jumping.
""General Villarroya and other colleagues, my companion is 67, has Alzheimer's and is blind. We are waiting for the vaccine. A clerk and a former nurse and we are in the first group. Are you more important?"" tweeted a user with the handle @Marcosendra1. 

Nationwide infection rates have soared since late December, with 42,885 new cases added to the tally on Friday bringing the total of cases to 2,499,560. Four hundred deaths were reported, for a total death toll of 55,441.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte lashed out at suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines on Saturday, saying delays in deliveries amounted to a serious breach of contractual obligations.
Italy will have to rethink its whole vaccination programme if supply problems persist, a senior health official warned on Saturday, after Rome was forced to cut its daily rollout of COVID-19 shots by more than two thirds.
 Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) last week said it was temporarily slowing supplies to Europe to make manufacturing changes that would boost output.
On Friday, a senior official told Reuters AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc had also informed the European Union it would cut deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine to the bloc by 60% because of production problems.
""This is unacceptable,"" Conte said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. ""Our vaccination plan ... has been drawn up on the basis of contractual pledges freely undertaken by pharmaceutical companies with the European Commission.""
Italy, which is using vaccines by Pfizer and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc as AstraZeneca awaits clearance for use of its vaccines across the EU, says Pfizer deliveries were 29% lower than planned this week and would be down 20% next week.
The head of Italy's higher health council, Franco Locatelli, told a press conference they were expected to return to agreed levels from Feb. 1.
In the meantime, vaccinations in Italy have slowed to 20,000-25,000 a day from peaks of more than 90,000 around two weeks ago, Locatelli said.
Rome has threatened to sue Pfizer.
Conte said expected delays in the vaccine by AstraZeneca were even more worrying, adding Italy would receive 3.4 million doses instead of 8 million in the first quarter if the 60% reduction were confirmed.
He added the heads of AstraZeneca Italy had confirmed the reduction in production capacity at a meeting on Saturday with Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza and COVID-19 Special Commissioner Domenico Arcuri.
""Such delays in deliveries represent serious contractual violations, which cause enormous damage to Italy and other countries,"" Conte said. 
""We'll use all available legal tools as we're already doing with Pfizer-BioNTech,"" he added.
The European Medicines Agency will rule on the AstraZeneca vaccine on Jan. 29 and Locatelli said Rome would have to reassess immunisation plans after that. 
So far 1.31 million doses of vaccine have been injected in Italy, corresponding to around 70% of deliveries, placing Italy second in the EU after Germany. Nearly 40,300 people have completed the vaccination cycle after receiving the second dose.

Italy reported 13,331 new coronavirus cases on Saturday and 488 deaths.

Macron said on his Twitter account that France needs to adapt its laws to better protect children from sexual violence and he had asked the justice minister to chair a consultation aimed at quickly making legislative proposals.
""We will go after the aggressors,"" Macron said. 
Macron said France had already increased the statute of limitations on incest to 30 years, counted from the legal age of majority of the victim, and had tightened controls on people working with children, but he said much more needed to be done. 
He said that as part of current routine medical examinations for children, France would introduce sessions about incest in primary and secondary schools in order to give children a chance to talk about the issue. 
He also said that better psychological help for victims of incest would be made available and it would be reimbursed by social security. 
In recent weeks, hundreds of people have taken to social media to tell their stories of incest after the publication of the book accusing French professor and constitutional specialist Olivier Duhamel of abusing his stepson.
The book was written by Duhamel's stepdaughter Camille Kouchner, daughter of former foreign minister and founder of NGO Médecins Sans Frontières Bernard Kouchner.
Duhamel resigned earlier this month from his post overseeing Sciences Po, one of France's top universities, following publication of the book.
""Being the object of personal attacks and wanting to preserve the institutions in which I work, I put an end to my functions,"" he said on Twitter on Jan. 4.
Neither Duhamel nor his lawyer have commented on the accusations dating back to the 1980s. 

Higher Education Minister Frederique Vidal has ordered an inspection at Sciences Po to determine responsibilities and potential failings.

The holder of the winning ticket, which would have cost $2 to buy, had yet to contact the lottery as of Saturday morning following Friday night's draw, Mega Millions said in its statement. The ticket was bought at a Kroger (NYSE:KR) supermarket in Novi, Michigan, the statement said.
The winner can opt to receive the jackpot in annual payouts over 29 years, though 24% must be given in taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, or ask instead for a one-time cash payout of $739, receiving $530 million after taxes.
The jackpot grew over four months after 36 previous draws produced no winner.
The largest ever lottery jackpot was the $1.586 billion amassed in January 2016 in Powerball, the country's other multi-state lottery.
In October 2018, the Mega Millions jackpot reached $1.537 billion.

Mega Millions tickets are sold in grocery stores and gas stations in 45 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the Virgin Islands, which split the proceeds.

The neighbouring countries held 60 rounds of talks between 2002 and 2016, but plans last year for discussions to be resumed foundered over a survey vessel sent by Ankara into disputed waters and disagreements over the topics to be covered.
""The only sure thing is the positive approach of Athens. I hope the Turkish side will come to these talks in the same spirit,"" Nikos Dendias told the Efimerida Ton Syntakton newspaper in an interview. 
He said the exploratory talks, which were halted in March 2016, were not negotiations but aimed to discover whether there was enough convergence for possible future negotiations on just one specific issue.
""I want to be clear, that (subject) is the demarcation of the exclusive economic zone and continental shelf in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean on the basis of international law,"" Dendias was quoted as saying.
If negotiations did begin after the exploratory talks but the two sides were still unable to reach a deal, they would have to agree on a text to refer the issue to the International Court in The Hague, he added.
While Athens only wants to address the demarcation of maritime zones in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean, Ankara says all issues should be tackled, including air space and the status of some Greek islands in the Aegean.

""In the exploratory talks there will be no discussion on demilitarising islands. No discussion on an issue that has to do with national sovereignty,"" Dendias told the newspaper.

The cyclone has since lost its strength and has been downgraded to a tropical storm, according to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).
""Beira had mild damage, but is too early to quantify the extent and scale of destruction,"" Luisa Meque, President of Mozambique's National Institute for Disaster Risk Management and Reduction (INGD), said in a television interview with national broadcaster TVM.
The South African weather department said Eloise made landfall around 2:30 a.m. in the morning with wind speeds of 160 kilometres per hour (99 mph).
Cars were submerged in water, walls of some low lying buildings collapsed and swathes of land were flooded in Beira, posts on Twitter showed.
Beira was the epicentre of damage from cyclone Idai in March 2019, which ravaged the country's second biggest city and killed more than 1,000 people across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe.
Mozambique National Institute of Meteorology (INAM) said Sofala province, which includes Beira, had seen 200 mm (8 inches) of rainfall and was likely to see another 100 mm of rain over the next 24 hours, the television channel reported. 
Power supplies were shut down as the cyclone damaged power lines and uprooted some electricity poles, power utility EDM said, local digital news media A Carta reported.
""The cyclone is still in the territory of Mozambique and should make an exit at 8 p.m. today,"" Gorkhmaz Huseynov, head of the Mozambique delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross, told Reuters.
WMO late Friday had upgraded the storm, fuelled by the warm Indian Ocean waters of the Mozambique channel, to a tropical cyclone with strength equivalent to a Category Two storm.
Category Two strength - on a five-level scale - refers to hurricanes with maximum wind speeds of 154-177 kph.
""By tomorrow, it will be an overland tropical depression. At that time the speed will be 60 kph,"" Mbazhi Maliage, a forecaster at the South African Weather Service, told Reuters.

Ties between Tehran and Washington worsened under the administration of former President Donald Trump, who in 2018 withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled its economy.
Iran called for action and “not just words” shortly after Joe Biden was sworn in as president on Wednesday. Biden has said Washington will rejoin the nuclear deal if Iran resumes strict compliance.
“In my personal opinion, we should define our relationship with the United States: To tell the U.S. that ‘we will not cooperate with you on the issue of Israel and we will disagree with you,'” Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview with the reformist Etmad newspaper. 

Iran, he said, “will not allow you to interfere in its internal affairs, but we have no problem working with you on the question of oil. We have no problem with ensuring the security of the Persian Gulf, though we believe that foreign presence in the Persian Gulf causes insecurity and you should not be there.”

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - If he were alive today, even St. Paul would be texting, Tweeting and firing off emails to get the news out, Pope Francis said on Saturday in his message for the Roman Catholic Church's World Day of Social Communication.
St. Paul, who lived in the first century of the Christian era, spread the new faith into Europe and Asia Minor and is believed to have written a great part of the New Testament.
""Every tool has its value, and that great communicator who was Paul of Tarsus would certainly have made use of email and social messaging,"" the pope said in the message, titled ""Come and See"".
Still, Francis said Paul was at his best while preaching in person, saying journalists and other communicators today should do more ""hitting the streets ... meeting people face to face to research stories or to verify certain situations first-hand"".
He said too often investigative reporting was being replaced by a ""standard, often tendentious narrative"" not capable of grasping problems and aspirations at the grassroots level.
""In communications, nothing can ever completely replace seeing things in person,"" he said.
The world owes a debt of gratitude to journalists, camera operators, photographers and others who often risk their lives to seek the truth, he added.

""Thanks to their efforts, we now know, for example, about the hardships endured by persecuted minorities in various parts of the world, numerous cases of oppression and injustice inflicted on the poor and on the environment, and many wars that otherwise would be overlooked,"" he said.

The gap between the first and second injection in France is currently three weeks for people in retirement homes, who take priority, and four weeks for others such as health workers. 
The Haute Autorite de Sante (HAS) said spacing out the two required vaccinations of the Pfizer/BioNtech and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) vaccines would allow the treatment of at least 700,000 more people in the first month.
""The growing number of infections and the worrying arrival of new variants call for an acceleration of the vaccination campaign in order to prevent the epidemic from spiking in coming weeks,"" the HAS said in a statement. 
The HAS said that while there is no agreement between different countries about the optimal timelag between the two shots, it seemed reasonable to delay the second injection to six weeks as the first shot would already provide protection against the coronavirus from the 12th or 14th day after the injection. 
It added it was essential for people to get a second injection.
The HAS is an independent advisory body whose recommendations can inspire government policy but don't automatically translate into action.
The World Health Organization said early this month that people should get two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine within 21 to 28 days.
Several countries are considering ways to stretch scarce supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, including by delaying dosing intervals or reducing dose sizes.
In Britain, regulators have ruled that shots can be administered up to 12 weeks apart, though a group of British doctors have written to England's chief medical officer to tell him to cut the gap between doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to six weeks.

 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and BioNTech have warned they have no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose is given more than 21 days after the first.

By Michael Georgy
HAMDAYET, Sudan (Reuters) - The young coffee seller said she was split from family and friends by an Ethiopian soldier at the Tekeze river, taken down a path, and given a harrowing choice. 
""He said: 'Choose, either I kill you or rape you',"" the 25-year-old told Reuters at the Hamdayet refugee camp in Sudan where she had fled from conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region.
The doctor who treated her when she arrived at the camp in December, Tewadrous Tefera Limeuh, confirmed to Reuters that he provided pills to stop pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases, and guided her to a psychotherapist. 
""The soldier ... forced a gun on her and raped her,"" Limeuh, who was volunteering with the Sudanese Red Crescent, said the woman told him. ""She asked him if he had a condom and he said 'why would I need a condom?'""
Five aid workers for international and Ethiopian aid groups said they had received multiple similar reports of abuse in Tigray. The United Nations appealed this week for an end to sexual assaults in the region.
Among a ""high number"" of allegations, particularly disturbing reports have emerged of people being forced to rape relatives or have sex in exchange for basic supplies, the U.N. Office of the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict said in a statement on Thursday.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government and the military did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters about the reports of rape. Ethiopian authorities have previously denied rights abuses, pointing the finger instead at the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), the region's former ruling party whose forces they accuse of insurrection. 
""I call on all parties involved in the hostilities in the Tigray region to commit to a zero-tolerance policy for crimes of sexual violence,"" U.N. special representative Geraldine Boezio said in the statement.
Women and girls in refugee camps within Ethiopia appear to have been particularly targeted, and medical centres are under pressure for emergency contraception and tests for sexually-transmitted infections, the statement said. 
Reuters could not independently verify the accounts of rape. Media have been largely banned from Tigray, aid agencies have struggled for access, and communications were down for weeks.
ABUSERS IN UNIFORM
The 25-year-old woman who spoke with Reuters said her abuser wore an Ethiopian federal army uniform. 
The five aid workers said other women described their alleged assailants as being militia fighters from Ethiopia's Amhara region or Eritrean soldiers, both allied with Abiy's troops. Reuters was unable to determine the identity of the woman's assailant.
Abiy's spokeswoman, Tigray's interim governor, the mayor of the regional capital Mekelle, Eritrea's foreign minister and Ethiopia's army spokesman did not immediately reply to requests for comment on rape allegations. Reuters could not reach TPLF representatives.
""I don't have any information about that,"" Amhara regional spokesman Gizachew Muluneh told Reuters by phone. 
Ethiopia and Eritrea have both denied that Eritrean troops are in Ethiopia, contradicting dozens of eyewitness interviews, diplomats and an Ethiopian general.
'WHY IS A WOMAN RAPED?'
At a meeting of security officials in Mekelle broadcast on Ethiopian state TV earlier this month, one soldier spoke of abuses even after the city had been captured by federal forces. 
""I was angry yesterday. Why does a woman get raped in Mekelle city? It wouldn't be shocking if it happened during the war ... But women were raped yesterday and today when the local police and federal police are around,"" said the soldier, who was not identified.
Local authorities did not immediately respond to efforts to seek comment on whether any soldiers might be investigated or brought to justice.
Tewadrous, the refugee camp doctor, described two other rape cases he had handled. One woman, who said she had escaped from Rawyan town in Tigray, told of three soldiers she identified as Amhara special forces knocking at her door, the doctor said. When she refused them entry, they broke in and assaulted her. 
An aid worker in the town of Wukro told Reuters victims had recounted how a husband was forced to kneel and watch while his wife was raped by soldiers they identified as Eritrean. 
A medical worker in Adigrat said he treated six women who had been raped by a group of soldiers and told not to seek help afterwards. They found courage to come forward days later, but there were no medicines to treat them, the medic said.

In Mekelle, one man was beaten up after begging soldiers to stop raping a 19-year-old, according to a medical worker who treated both victims. Mekelle charity Elshadai said it has prepared 50 beds for rape victims.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson told a news conference on Friday that the UK may need to implement further measures to protect its borders from new variants of COVID-19.
Britain's current restrictions ban most international travel while new rules introduced earlier in January require a negative coronavirus test before departure for most people arriving, as well as a period of quarantine.
The government is considering making it mandatory for travellers to spend that 10-day quarantine period in a hotel for which they would have to pay, as a way to enforce the quarantine rules, the BBC said. 
Amid growing worries about new COVID-19 variants, critics of Britain's current quarantine policy say it is not sufficiently enforced. 
Stricter border rules would be a fresh blow for the aviation and travel sectors, already under great financial strain from close to a year of COVID-19 restrictions and minimal revenues. 

In England, the 10-day quarantine requirement can be reduced if the traveller has a negative COVID-19 test after five days, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all have slightly different rules.

Ugandan troops are part of the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia, whose aim is to support the central government and stop al Shabaab's efforts to topple it.
The Ugandan People's Defence Force (UPDF) said in a statement that its soldiers on Friday had raided al Shabaab hideouts in the villages of Sigaale, Adimole and Kayitoy, just over 100 km (62 miles) southwest of the capital Mogadishu.
""(The raid)... saw the forces put out of action 189 al Qaeda-linked fighters and destroyed a number of military hardware and items used by the terrorist attacks,"" UPDF said.
There was no immediate comment from al Shabaab on the attack.
The group - which aims to topple Somalia's government and impose its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law - controlled most of south-central Somalia until 2011, when it was driven out of Mogadishu by African Union troops.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 10:10PM ET</span>",Jailed Kremlin critic Navalny's supporters to rally for his release despite warnings,"By Tom Balmforth
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Supporters of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny were set to confront Russian authorities on Saturday at nationwide rallies that the police have declared illegal and vowed to break up. 
The gatherings will be the first protests by Navalny's supporters since he returned dramatically to Moscow and was immediately arrested last weekend after recovering in Germany from a nerve agent poisoning in Russia.
He accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies. 
The stubborn ex-lawyer who has campaigned against Putin for years despite what he describes as an unrelenting state effort to stifle his activity could now face years in jail over legal cases that he calls trumped up. 
His supporters are betting on a high-risk strategy to produce a show of anti-Kremlin street support during winter and a pandemic to pressure the authorities into freeing him. 
The gamble puts the Kremlin in a quandary as to how it responds, nine months before parliamentary elections. 
The West has told Moscow to let him go, sparking new tensions in already strained Russia ties as U.S. President Joe Biden launches his administration. 
In a push to galvanise support, Navalny's team released a video about an opulent palace on the Black Sea they alleged belonged to Putin, something the Kremlin denied. The clip had been viewed more than 60 million times as of late Friday. 
Police have cracked down in the run-up to the rallies, rounding up several of his allies they accused of calling for illegal protests and jailing at least two of them, including Navalny's spokeswoman, for more than a week each. 
Authorities also announced a criminal investigation against Navalny supporters over calls urging minors to attend illegal rallies that it said were made on various social networks. 

Navalny's allies hope to tap into what polls say are pent-up public frustrations over years of falling wages and economic fallout from the pandemic. But Putin's grip on power looks unassailable and the 68-year-old regularly records an approval rating of over 60%, many times higher than that of Navalny.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 08:10PM ET</span>","In Senate deal, Trump impeachment trial put off until early February","By David Morgan and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. Senate agreed on Friday to push back former President Donald Trump's impeachment trial by two weeks, giving the chamber more time to focus on President Joe Biden's legislative agenda and Cabinet nominees before turning to the contentious showdown over Trump.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said the trial is set to begin during the week of Monday Feb. 8, an arrangement praised by the chamber's top Republican, Mitch McConnell. 
The House of Representatives is due to formally deliver to the Senate on Monday the impeachment charge accusing Trump of inciting an insurrection, a move that ordinarily would have triggered the beginning of the trial within a day. The charge stems from Trump's incendiary speech to supporters before they stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a rampage that delayed the formal congressional certification of Biden's election victory and left five people dead, including a police officer.
Schumer said the new timeline will allow the Senate to move quickly on key Biden appointees and other tasks while giving House lawmakers who will prosecute the case and Trump's team more time to prepare for the trial.
""During that period, the Senate will continue to do other business for the American people, such as Cabinet nominations and the COVID relief bill which would provide relief for millions of Americans who are suffering during this pandemic,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor.
The timeline was a compromise after McConnell had asked the Democratic-led House to delay sending the charge until next Thursday, and called on Schumer to postpone the trial until mid-February to give Trump more time to prepare a defense.
Doug Andres, a spokesman for McConnell, said the senator was pleased Democrats had given Trump's defense more time, and laid out a timeline that could have the trial begin as soon as Feb. 9.
""This is a win for due process and fairness,"" Andres said.
Under the timeline, House impeachment managers will file their pre-trial brief and Trump's defense team will file an answer to the impeachment charge on Feb. 2, and each side will respond to those filings on Feb. 8.
Trump on Jan. 13 became the first U.S. president to have been impeached twice. The Senate acquitted him last year in the previous trial focused on Trump's request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son. Trump's presidential term ended on Wednesday.
Conviction in the Senate would require a two-thirds vote - meaning 17 of Trump's fellow Republicans would have to vote against him. A conviction would clear the way for a second vote, requiring a simply majority, to bar Trump from holding office again.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday found a slim majority of Americans believe Trump should be convicted and barred from holding public office. The responses were almost entirely along party lines, with nine out of 10 Democrats wanting Trump convicted and less than two in 10 Republicans agreeing.
Trump has said he may seek the presidency again in 2024. His fate could depend on McConnell, whose position is likely to influence other Republicans. McConnell said this week that the mob that attacked the Capitol was ""fed lies"" and ""provoked by the president and other powerful people.""
BIDEN'S AGENDA
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters earlier in the day that the Senate should be able to move forward with both the trial and Biden's agenda, beginning with his call for $1.9 trillion of fresh COVID-19 assistance for Americans and the U.S. economy. 
""What cannot be delayed through this process is his proposal to get relief to the American people at this time of crisis,"" Psaki said. 
Republican Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), a close ally of Trump, said the agreement between Schumer and McConnell was ""fair to all concerned."" 
""It allows the president's defense team adequate time to prepare and for the sake of the country, it moves the process forward,"" Graham said.
Senate rules had called for an impeachment trial to begin at 1 p.m. on the day after the single article of impeachment was delivered to Senate, except for Sundays.
The deal came even as Schumer and McConnell struggled to assert control in a chamber divided 50-50, with Democrats holding a majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.
McConnell has insisted that Democrats provide a guarantee that they will not end what is known as the legislative filibuster, which enables the minority Republicans to put up procedural hurdles for legislation sought by Biden. 

Schumer rejected McConnell's demand on Friday as ""unacceptable."" Schumer became the chamber's leader this week after Democrats won two Georgia U.S. Senate runoff elections earlier in the month.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. intelligence officer for North Korea warned on Friday the country sees diplomacy only as a means to advance its nuclear weapons development, even as the new Biden administration says it will look for ways to bring Pyongyang back to talks.
President Joe Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday the new administration planned a full review of the U.S. approach to North Korea to look at ways to increase pressure on it to return to the negotiating table.
White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki reiterated this on Friday, saying North Korea's nuclear weapons were a serious threat to peace and Washington had a vital interest in deterring Pyongyang.
Sydney Seiler, the U.S. national intelligence officer for North Korea, told the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank earlier that Pyongyang's weapons development had been a consistent policy for 30 years.
""Every engagement in diplomacy has been designed to further the nuclear program, not to find a way out... I just urge people not to let the tactical ambiguity obstruct the strategic clarity about North Korea that we have,"" he said. 
""So we should not be overly encouraged if suddenly (North Korea leader Kim Jong Un) proposes dialogue tomorrow, nor should we be overly surprised, or discouraged, if there's an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launch by Sunday.""
Seiler also said humanitarian aid - which Blinken said the United States should look at providing to North Korea if needed - was not something of interest to Pyongyang.
The force North Korea seeks to develop, while part aspirational and part years away, was far more than that needed by a country that simply wanted to be left alone, Seiler said, adding: ""That is where the real risk of inaction comes in.""
On Tuesday, Blinken had spoken of the review plan in response to a question by Democratic Senator Ed Markey, who asked whether Blinken would, with the ultimate aim of North Korea denuclearizing, support a ""phased agreement"" that offered tailored sanctions relief to Pyongyang in return for a freeze in its weapons programs.
Biden's top Asia official, Kurt Campbell, has said the administration must decide its approach quickly and not repeat an Obama-era delay that led to ""provocative"" steps by Pyongyang that prevented engagement.

Campbell also had some praise for former President Donald Trump's unprecedented summits with Kim, although these made no progress in curtailing a North Korean nuclear weapons program that expanded in the meantime.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California's top prosecutor opened an investigation on Friday into the scandal-plagued Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, probing accusations the agency had engaged in a long pattern of excessive force, illegal shootings and abuse of jail inmates.
The civil rights probe follows years of allegations that the nation's largest local law enforcement agency was rife with abuse throughout its ranks that top supervisors tolerated and in some cases covered up.
""There are serious concerns and reports that accountability and adherence to legitimate policing practices have lapsed at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. We are undertaking this investigation to determine if LASD has violated the law or the rights of the people of Los Angeles County"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said.
Sheriff Alex Villanueva, who has at times sparred with county leaders over the management and direction of the department, said in a written statement that he looked forward to the probe.
""Our department may finally have an impartial, objective assessment of our operations and recommendations on any areas we can improve our service to the community,"" Villanueva said. 
""During my administration we have routinely asked the state office of the attorney general to monitor our investigations and we will provide immediate access to all information in our possession,"" he said. We are eager to get this process started, in the interest of transparency and accountability.""President Joe Biden has nominated Becerra, a Democrat, to serve as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. Senate is expected to take up his confirmation hearings in the coming days. 
California Governor Gavin Newsom, also a Democrat, would be tasked with appointing Becerra's successor, who would presumably take over the investigation.
In September, Dijon Kizzee, a black man who was stopped on his bicycle for a suspected vehicle code violation, was shot to death by two Los Angeles sheriff’s deputies after he allegedly punched one officer and dropped a pistol on the ground.
The sheriff's department has announced an internal investigation into that incident.
Kizzee's death marked the latest in a string of shootings and alleged abuses involving deputies. Civil rights activists have called for reforms throughout the department.
In 2013 the Federal Bureau of Investigation charged 18 Los Angeles County Sheriffs deputies, including two high-ranking supervisors, with attempting to thwart a federal probe into abuse in the nation's largest jail system.

Then-Sheriff Lee Baca was among those convicted in the case and sentenced to prison.

1345,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 05:40PM ET</span>",Swiss court finds Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz guilty of corruption,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - In a landmark verdict in one of the mining world's most high profile legal cases, a Swiss criminal court found Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz guilty of corruption and forgery on Friday and sentenced him to five years in jail with a sizeable fine.
The ruling after a two-week trial is a blow for Steinmetz, a diamond trader, whose pursuit of the world's richest uptapped deposits of iron ore put him at the centre of a battle that has triggered probes and litigation around the world.
Steinmetz said he would appeal the verdict, which also included a 50 million Swiss francs ($56.48 million) fine. 
""It is a big injustice,"" he told reporters in the courtyard of the Geneva courthouse. 
Steinmetz and two others were variously accused of paying or arranging payment of $10 million in bribes between 2006 and 2010 to Mamadie Toure, whom prosecutors say was one of the wives of the former president Lansana Conte, to obtain exploration permits for iron ore buried beneath the remote Simandou mountains of Guinea and of forging documents to cover it up through a web of shell companies and bank accounts. 
Toure, who lives in Florida, could not be reached for comment. 
All three defendants denied the charges.
Presiding judge Alexandra Banna said Steinmetz and his co-defendants had used fake accounts and attempted to have incriminating documents destroyed to hide their criminal behaviour.
Banna said that Steinmetz had made an immediate profit from the rights to mine and not a cent went to the West African nation of Guinea.
No one from the government in Guinea was immediately available to comment.
Steinmetz, 64, a former Geneva resident who moved back to Israel in 2016, has in the past been ranked as a billionaire and one of Israel's wealthiest men. Asked by the court to estimate his personal fortune, he said it was $50-80 million.
""TOTALLY COMBATIVE""
Central to Steinmetz’s defence was his claim that he was not involved in the day-to-day running of Beny Steinmetz Group Resources (BSGR). He described himself as the owner and company ambassador but not the boss of the group that employs some 100,000. 
In a stinging rebuke, Banna said Steinmetz’s defence thesis of ""name dropping"" did not stand up.
""He is the effective head of the group,"" she said. 
Steinmetz's co-defendants, a French man and a Belgian woman, were also found guilty of corruption and were given a 3-1/2 year jail sentence and a two-year suspended sentence, plus fines of 5 million Swiss francs and 50,000 Swiss francs, respectively.
Jean-Marc Carnice, a lawyer for the French man, said his client was going to appeal.
""I also note that my client was acquitted of forgery, completely acquitted of forgery,"" Carnice said.
The lawyer for the Belgian woman could not be reached for comment.
They have 10 days to lodge an appeal.
In a statement, Steinmetz said the judgment went ""completely against the course of international justice"".
""I remain totally combative and confident, justice will establish the truth,"" he said.
Marc Bonnant, Steinmetz's main defence lawyer, told reporters they would launch an immediate appeal.
""If we are not welcomed before Geneva's criminal appeals court, we will go to the Federal Tribunal,"" he said, referring to Switzerland's highest court, based in Lausanne.
Several representatives of the mining industry and non-governmental organisations said the verdict could have repercussions.
""If upheld on appeal, this verdict will have far-reaching implications for the mining industry the world over,"" said Bernhard Maier, an attorney at Squire Patton Boggs, London, who represents mining companies. 
""It demonstrates that in a world of increased transparency and scrutiny, including as a result of technology and the internet, there is also increased accountability.""
Public Eye, a Swiss corporate governance watchdog whose representatives attended the trial, said in a statement the conviction sends ""a strong signal to the entire commodities sector"". 
""It also shows the importance for Switzerland to finally close the legislative gaps that facilitate such criminal activity,"" it said.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 05:20PM ET</span>",British lawmakers seek investigation into UK-registered firm possibly linked to Beirut blast,"By Tom Bergin
LONDON (Reuters) - Two senior British parliamentarians called on Friday for an investigation into a British-registered company possibly linked to last year's devastating explosion in Beirut, after Reuters found that the firm had not disclosed its beneficial owners.
The company, Savaro Ltd, is registered at a London address, and like all British firms is required to list who owns it with Britain's companies register, known as Companies House.
In an e-mail to Reuters this week, the woman listed as Savaro's owner and sole director at Companies House, Marina Psyllou, told Reuters that she was acting as an agent on behalf of another beneficial owner, whose identity she could not disclose.
""The person who was and has always been the UBO (ultimate beneficial owner) of the company was always the same. As you should be aware, we cannot disclose his name,"" she said. She did not say why she could not disclose his identity.
Global corporate governance rules define a UBO as someone who receives the benefits of an entity's transactions, typically owning a minimum of 25% of its capital.
Margaret Hodge, a British lawmaker and former cabinet minister who headed parliament's public affairs committee from 2010-2015, called the apparent failure to list Savaro's ultimate beneficiary at Companies House ""outrageous"".
""The UK authorities should investigate this, given inaccurate information appears to have been filed. We need to challenge formation agents where it appears they may have acted improperly.""
John Mann, a member of Britain's House of Lords who has investigated the use of UK-registered companies in illicit activity, said the case showed the need for stronger enforcement of Britain's company disclosure rules.
""It is shocking and very damaging to the reputation of the United Kingdom that Companies House and our national system of company registration can be so easily exploited,"" he said.
Psyllou, who provides corporate registrations for clients through her own Cyprus company, Interstatus, said in a follow-up e-mail to Reuters on Thursday that her company ""strictly complies with legislations and reports to relevant Regulators"".
She also denied this week that Savaro could have been linked to the Lebanon explosion, saying she believed it had never done any business: ""As far as we know the company in question, ever since its registration it remained dormant without any trading or other activity or keeping any bank accounts as the project for which it was incorporated was never realized."" She gave no further information about the company's intended purpose.
FERTILISER SHIPMENT 
A Reuters investigation last year into the Beirut blast that killed 200 people found that the huge shipment of ammonium nitrate fertiliser that exploded in Lebanon had been held in Beirut while en route to Mozambique. The Mozambican buyer, FEM, identified the company it bought it from as Savaro.
A Lebanese source said a sales contract for the fertiliser identified Savaro Ltd, and listed it at the London address where the company was then registered with the UK authorities.
Tracing the shipment could ultimately depend on unravelling exactly who stands behind Savaro, said Ben Cowdock, who investigates international corruption for Transparency International in London. 
Under legal changes in 2016 -- introduced as part of an anti-corruption campaign by Prime Minister David Cameron -- that should be a straightforward matter of looking the information up with Companies House, Cowdock added.
Psyllou's firm Interstatus has been listed since 2006 as the company secretary for Savaro, responsible for fulfilling its reporting requirements, and another Interstatus company was initially listed as Savaro's owner.
In July 2016, three months after the Cameron-era rule change requiring companies to list their beneficial owners, Savaro updated its records to name Psyllou herself as the owner.

Lawmakers Hodge and Mann both called on Britain's business ministry to investigate what they said appeared to be a breach of the disclosure rules. The business ministry declined to comment, saying it does not discuss individual companies.

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 05:16PM ET</span>",Special Report: How U.S. CDC missed chances to spot COVID's silent spread,"By Ned Parker and Chad Terhune
(Reuters) - In early February, 57 people arrived at a Nebraska military base, among the first Americans evacuated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak. U.S. health officials knew very little then about the mysterious new virus, and the quarantined group offered an early opportunity to size up the threat.
The federal government sought help from a team at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, including Dr. James Lawler, an experienced infectious disease specialist. Lawler told Reuters he immediately asked the world-renowned U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for permission to test the quarantined group, deeming it crucial to know whether people without symptoms were infected and could spread the deadly pathogen.
Agency officials worried that detained people couldn’t give proper consent because they might feel coerced into testing. “CDC does not approve this study,” an official at the quarantine site wrote to Lawler in a Feb. 8 email obtained by Reuters. “Please discontinue all contact with the travelers for research purposes.”
More than two months passed before the CDC expanded its testing guidelines to include all asymptomatic people, saying soon afterward that this silent spread “may meaningfully contribute to the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic.” By November, the agency estimated that more than half of cases were spread by people not currently experiencing symptoms.
Critics have widely asserted that the CDC fumbled key decisions during the coronavirus scourge because then-President Donald Trump and his administration meddled in the agency’s operations and muzzled internal experts. The matter is now the subject of a congressional inquiry. Yet Reuters has found new evidence that the CDC’s response to the pandemic also was marred by actions - or inaction - by the agency’s career scientists and frontline staff.
At a crucial moment in the pandemic when Americans were quarantined after possible exposure to the virus abroad, the agency declined or resisted potentially valuable opportunities to study whether the disease could be spread by those without symptoms, according to previously undisclosed internal emails, other documents and interviews with key players.
Soon after balking at testing the returnees from Wuhan, the agency delayed testing asymptomatic passengers among 318 evacuees from the Diamond Princess, a contaminated cruise ship in Japan. In addition, the agency failed at that time to make effective use of outside experts and appeared at times unprepared for the crisis on the ground, lacking adequate personal protective gear and ignoring established protocols, Reuters found.
“Yes, they were interfered with politically,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, referring to alleged meddling by the Trump administration. “But that’s not the only reason CDC didn’t perform optimally during COVID-19. There are a lot of things that went wrong.”
Four top public health experts or ethicists told Reuters that the question of whether to test or engage in research on detained people has always been a sensitive topic. But all said the CDC should have proceeded given the fast-moving public health emergency. 
Moreover, the CDC finalized rules in 2017 providing that medical testing was expressly allowed in quarantine, as long as participants were given the opportunity to give “informed consent” or opt out. Informed consent means giving people adequate information to understand the risks and benefits of a test or procedure.
Gostin said the CDC’s argument against testing was “unreasonable” under the circumstances. “You are asking for consent and not imposing any harm,” he said. “There is a good reason to do it.”
It’s difficult to know whether more aggressive early testing among asymptomatic people would have significantly altered the trajectory of the pandemic in the United States, which has infected 24 million people and killed more than 400,000.
The CDC was not the only agency that struggled with this issue. Notably, an official with the World Health Organization called asymptomatic spread “very rare” in June, only to say a day later “we don’t actually have that answer yet.” In recent months, the WHO has said infected people without symptoms can be contagious, but “it is still not clear how frequently this occurs.”
Still, some countries such as South Korea and Singapore used widespread testing early on to identify infected people with or without symptoms and, unlike the United States, broadly required or distributed masks.
CDC scientists infamously botched the creation of a test for the coronavirus and took weeks trying to fix it, making widespread testing - well beyond those with symptoms - impossible during the pandemic’s first months.
In response to detailed inquiries from Reuters, a CDC spokesman said the agency declined to comment.
In the final weeks of the Trump administration, White House officials did not respond to requests for comment on reports of political interference.
The problems within the CDC, which has suffered from a decade of declining funding, point to the steep challenge faced by newly inaugurated President Joe Biden and his CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, to rehabilitate the agency in the eyes of scientists, other public health officials and the public.
Walensky “acknowledges that work has to be done to restore public confidence” in the CDC, according to a Biden spokesperson.
Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, who worked at the CDC for 20 years and at one point was responsible for pandemic influenza preparedness, said the agency’s staff are “among the most dedicated professionals in the world and they were doing the best they could under the toughest circumstances.”
“This has been an incredibly challenging pandemic and it would have been hard for anyone to guess what would have happened,” she said. 
But she and other public health specialists also told Reuters that Americans deserve a thorough examination of the agency’s shortcomings in the crisis.
“We have to figure out what needs to be fixed before this happens again,” said Rasmussen, now a professor at the University of Florida.
REQUEST DENIED
On Feb. 7, a group of Americans arrived from Wuhan and the surrounding province at Camp Ashland (NYSE:ASH), a National Guard base near Omaha and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, a major outpost in the nation’s defenses against bioterrorism and infectious diseases.
Infectious disease specialist Lawler, who worked in the George W. Bush and Obama administrations on pandemic response, suspected that some of the evacuees might be infected with the coronavirus and shedding it despite having no symptoms. His suspicions were based partly on scientific reports from Asia and Europe.
Starting on Feb. 8, Lawler pressed the CDC to greenlight voluntary and limited coronavirus testing among this group, according to emails obtained by Reuters through the Freedom of Information Act.
Lawler had already won support for such testing from the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) officials in charge of the returnees at Ashland, the Nebraska health department and his university’s medical faculty, emails show. HHS oversees the CDC.
Later that Saturday, Eric Kasowski, the CDC’s representative at Camp Ashland, emailed Lawler to tell him that his request to test the 57 people in quarantine “was very quickly elevated to Dr. (Anne) Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director, CDC,” who had worked at the agency for 32 years.
Schuchat referred questions from Reuters to the CDC press office, which declined to comment.
The CDC’s answer to Lawler was no.
According to the Feb. 8 email: “It is CDC’s position that since the research is being proposed for a group of individuals who are detained under a federal quarantine order, the circumstances of voluntary participation would be extremely difficult to assure and therefore, CDC does not approve this study.”
Lawler said he kept pressing Kasowski. But Kasowski told Lawler the next morning that the testing proposal had been rejected again, this time by officials up to and including CDC director Robert Redfield.
“This is absurd,” Lawler recalled telling Kasowski.
Kasowski declined to comment, referring questions to the CDC.
Instead of having everyone tested during the two-week quarantine, only one returnee who became ill and was hospitalized got tested; the results were negative for coronavirus, Lawler said. The other 56 left quarantine without knowing whether they carried the virus, and Lawler said he knows of no CDC follow up with that group.
In a Feb. 10 email to Kasowski, Lawler warned that the federal government, by not testing symptomless individuals, “may be missing the submerged iceberg in the U.S.”
MAJOR PROBLEMS
Within days, Lawler got a new federal assignment: to help evacuate more than 300 Americans stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Yokohama, Japan.
He was joined there by Dr. Michael Callahan, a veteran infectious disease specialist from Massachusetts General Hospital, who had just been appointed a special advisor to HHS on COVID-19. Callahan, who says his two years of physician scientist training at the CDC in the mid-1990s inspired him to forgo academia for a field career battling disease outbreaks, had just treated coronavirus patients in China weeks earlier.
Major problems emerged soon after Lawler and Callahan arrived in Yokohama on Feb. 14.
The U.S. team, including HHS and other U.S. personnel, had to borrow walkie talkies from Japanese authorities because they didn’t have mobile phones that worked internationally, according to an “after-action” report submitted by Lawler and Callahan in March to HHS and obtained by Reuters.
Japan had to lend the U.S. team basic protective gear because the Americans’ supplies didn’t arrive in time, the report said. Some team members were not trained for handling a “highly contagious disease.”
According to Callahan, he had to turn back two CDC staffers seeking to board the Diamond Princess in Japan because they had no current experience in emergency medicine and infection control.
Callahan said the problem was not isolated to the CDC’s coronavirus response. In his regular interactions in the field with CDC staff in recent years, he said, he has seen “a progressive degradation of clinical expertise and incident management,” particularly during Ebola outbreaks in Africa.
The CDC needs “people that can actually do public health when bad stuff happens,” Callahan said.
NOT ENOUGH PROOF
On Feb. 17, Lawler flew with 151 cruise passengers to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio, Texas. An isolation bubble was created using a plastic curtain in the rear of the plane for five passengers who had tested positive for COVID-19 in Japan.
During the flight, Lawler moved two passengers who had become feverish to the isolation area, planning to take them to Nebraska Medical Center. But those precautions went awry when CDC personnel greeted the plane in Texas.
“The CDC officer in charge boarded the aircraft without consulting the flight crew regarding safety or contamination issues,” according to the after-action report.
The officer’s personal protective equipment “was grossly insufficient due to the high level of contamination that likely existed on the aircraft. This likely put CDC personnel and other responders on the ground at risk.”
What’s more, the CDC official moved the two people who had developed symptoms mid-flight back with the group of healthy passengers, and the CDC’s handling of the flight violated disaster medicine protocols, according to the report. The CDC official is not named in the report.
Similar problems occurred when Callahan arrived with another group of 167 Diamond Princess passengers at Travis Air Force Base in Northern California and a CDC officer boarded the plane, the report said.
Meantime, officials at Nebraska’s public health laboratory, who had been working with Lawler, asked the CDC for permission to test passengers from the Diamond Princess while they were under quarantine, even if they didn’t have symptoms, emails show.
A CDC influenza expert, Dr. Tim Uyeki, wrote back on Feb. 17 to the director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory (NYSE:LH) that the agency only wanted to test symptomatic individuals and those who had previously tested positive in Japan, citing a lack of detail on the accuracy of the Japanese tests.
Uyeki declined to comment and referred questions to the CDC press office.
Lawler and Callahan said they flew in late February to CDC headquarters in Atlanta to meet with Redfield and other senior officials, to raise concerns about the flawed evacuation and potential for asymptomatic spread based on their observations from the Diamond Princess.
Lawler said CDC officials replied that there wasn’t enough proof yet that people without symptoms spread the disease.
Redfield did not return requests for comment.
Meanwhile, at both quarantine sites in Texas and California, CDC staff began to test some cruise passengers without symptoms who previously had tested positive in Japan, according to Dr. Bela Matyas, the local health officer in California’s Solano County, as well as emails between the Nebraska hospital personnel and the CDC. 
The CDC officials had doubts about the accuracy of testing done by Japanese authorities, but the results confirmed that at least some of the passengers were indeed positive - 16 at the California base alone, Matyas said. Texas numbers were not available.
During the second week of quarantine in late February, the CDC and local health officials began offering tests to all of the cruise passengers. In California, where most sought testing, 10 more people were found to have COVID-19, Matyas said.
Despite this evidence of infections without symptoms, the CDC made no immediate changes in its public guidance on asymptomatic infection.
‘FAIRLY COMMON’
By March, signs of asymptomatic spread were mounting in the United States and abroad.
A tipping point for the CDC came when staffers were deployed to the outskirts of Seattle to handle an outbreak at the Issaquah Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, a relatively confined setting. King County and CDC officials tested 76 of the 82 residents, regardless of whether they exhibited symptoms, beginning on March 13, according to the CDC.
They found 23 infected, 13 asymptomatic at the time. Ten of those went on to develop symptoms.
“That was really ... our first hint that asymptomatic transmission was fairly common, especially in those settings,” said Dr. James Lewis, an official with the county health department’s COVID-19 response, in an interview.
Two weeks later, on March 27, the CDC published the case study as evidence of asymptomatic infection. That same week, for the first time, the agency recommended testing health workers and first responders, even without symptoms.
In a radio interview that aired on March 31, Redfield said, “We have learned that in fact” symptomless individuals “do contribute to transmission.”
Based on that evidence, the CDC recommended that even asymptomatic people wear cloth face coverings in public areas. Almost a month later, on April 27, the agency expanded its testing guidelines to include “persons without symptoms.”

That was 11 weeks after Lawler’s first request to test the Wuhan group in Nebraska.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has initiated a review of the terrorist designation of Yemen's Houthi movement and is working as fast as it can to conclude the process and make a determination, a State Department spokesperson said on Friday.
President Joe Biden's nominee for Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier this week that Washington would take a look at the designation, which U.N. officials and aid groups fear is complicating efforts to combat the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
""As noted by Secretary-Designate Blinken, the State Department has initiated a review of Ansarallah's terrorist designations,"" the spokesperson said, using another name used for the Houthis.
""We will not publicly discuss or comment on internal deliberations regarding that review; however, with the humanitarian crisis in Yemen we are working as fast as we can to conduct the review and make a determination,"" the spokesperson said.
The United Nations describes Yemen as the world’s biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need. 
Aid groups and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had warned against a possible designation, which was one of the parting shots of the Trump administration, saying Yemen was in imminent danger of the worst famine the world has seen for decades.
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis in a war widely seen as a proxy conflict between U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as Yemen’s suffering is worsened by an economic collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Tuesday, the United States exempted aid groups, the United Nations, the Red Cross and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices from its designation, but the carve outs are not enough to allay U.N. fears that Washington’s move would push Yemen into a large-scale famine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday ordered the faster issuance of pandemic stimulus checks to needy families and increased food aid for children who normally rely on school meals, an effort to ease Americans' burdens while Congress negotiates over his proposed $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package.
In the opening days of his administration, Biden is emphasizing that the government must tackle the coronavirus crisis with urgency after his predecessor Donald Trump largely played it down. 
More than 400,000 Americans have died from the virus and millions of jobs have been lost.
Biden said his stimulus package to address the economic effects of the pandemic has support from business, labor, Wall Street and Main Street.
""A lot of America is hurting. The virus is surging. ... Families are going hungry. People are at risk of being evicted. Job losses are mounting again. We need to act. No matter how you look at it, we need to act,"" Biden said.
Republican lawmakers have questioned the price tag on pandemic aid and a separate investment proposal for infrastructure, green energy projects, education and research. 
Earlier on Friday, White House National Economic Council director Brian Deese said he would speak with lawmakers on Sunday to push for relief. 
""We're at a precarious moment for the virus and the economy. Without decisive action, we risk falling into a very serious economic hole, even more serious than the crisis we find ourselves in,"" Deese said.
Biden's actions were not a substitute for legislative relief, Deese said, with about 16 million people now receiving some type of unemployment benefit and an estimated 29 million who do not have enough to eat. 
Women, minorities and low-income service workers have been disproportionately hurt, with Black and Hispanic workers facing higher jobless rates than white workers.
In an early test of whether Republicans might support Democrat Biden's plans for coronavirus relief, infrastructure investment and tax increases, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee voted unanimously on Friday to approve Janet Yellen, Biden's choice for Treasury Secretary, paving the way for her confirmation by the full chamber. 
Biden's hopes for speedy action on his legislative agenda and Cabinet appointments are complicated by the expected trial of Trump in the Senate as early as next week and bipartisan squabbling over operations in an evenly split Senate.
In an executive order on Friday, Biden asked the Treasury Department to consider taking steps to expand and improve delivery of stimulus checks, such as by establishing online tools for claiming payments.
Roberto Perli, head of global policy at Cornerstone Macro researchers said getting stimulus checks out faster would bolster consumer spending but have a ""minimal GDP impact.""
Biden is also asking the Agriculture Department to consider issuing new guidance to increase the aid given to families who normally rely on schools to provide a daily main meal for their children. It could provide a family with three children more than $100 of additional support every two months.
""This is a bold, common-sense move to address the nation’s joint hunger and public health crises,"" said Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America advocacy group.

Last June, Venezuela's health ministry and technical advisers to the then opposition-dominated National Assembly signed an agreement to implement a COVID-19 response supported by PAHO. By October, 340,000 antigen tests and 35 test-reading machines, managed by PAHO, had arrived in the country. 
The ministry and technical advisers had agreed the tests and machines would be sent to 27 hospitals, Miguel Pizarro, designated by opposition leader Juan Guaido as representative to the United Nations, said in a statement.
But the government transferred the supplies to its own network of regional laboratories and other centers that Pizarro said in his statement were ""not prepared for the care of patients with COVID-19.""
With the equipment in public health laboratories, Pizarro said, the government now has ""absolute control"" over test results and the country's COVID-19 data.
Venezuela's information ministry and spokespeople for the Washington-based PAHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Only around 3,000, or about 1%, of the 3400,000 antigen tests sent to Venezuela have so far been used, Ciro Ugarte, director of health emergencies at PAHO, said on Tuesday while giving a regular weekly update on the pandemic. 
Venezuelan authorities have reported 122,260 infections and 1,129 deaths from COVID-19 since the pandemic began. Experts say the real number is likely higher, due to low levels of testing.

Argentina and Britain have long disputed ownership of the Falklands, with Argentina claiming sovereignty over the British-run islands it calls the Malvinas. The dispute led to a brief war in 1982.
Lufthansa said it made the request for two flights supporting a polar research expedition because the normal route via Cape Town has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.
A German foreign ministry spokesman said the federal government's position on the Falkland Islands had not changed.
""The activities of private companies cannot be attributed to the Federal Republic of Germany and have no international consequences,"" he said.
The Argentine government said Lufthansa asked for permission for two flights that are due to carry scientists and logistical support staff from Hamburg to Mount Pleasant in the Falklands, where they will continue onboard the ship ""Polarstern"" to Antarctica to conduct climate change research.
Argentina said the German government also asked for its permission for the Polarstern research ship to dock in Port Stanley, the capital of the British territory.
The two, 15-hour flights are scheduled for Feb. 1 and March 30.
Argentina's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Lufthansa had asked its civil aviation authority and regional authorities to fly over Argentina and use the Argentine Patagonian town of Ushuaia as an alternative airport should it be unable to land in the Falklands.
The Foreign Ministry said the German Embassy also asked for authorization from the Argentine Naval Prefecture for the Polarstern ship to enter ""Puerto Argentino,"" the Argentine name for the Falklands capital Port Stanley.
""The relevance of Lufthansa's request presented to the Argentine authorities is highlighted as it implies the recognition of the Malvinas Islands as part of Argentine territory,"" the Foreign Ministry said. 
In the past year, Argentina has renewed its drive to reclaim the Falklands, appointing a Malvinas minister, saying it will redraw maps to emphasize its claim for use in schools and lobbying at the United Nations.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization said on Friday it had reached an agreement with Pfizer/BioNTech for 40 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine and should be able to start delivering vaccines to poor and lower-middle income countries next month under its COVAX programme.
The COVAX scheme, led by the WHO and the GAVI vaccine alliance, signed deals for hundreds of millions of doses to vaccinate people in poor and lower-middle income countries, but vaccinations have yet to start.  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)'s vaccine is so far the only one that has WHO emergency approval.
""In this world we are as protected as our neighbour,"" said Pfizer's CEO Albert Bourla, officially announcing the deal which Reuters reported on Thursday. 
Bourla said the 40 million doses, a fraction of the company's total 2021 production estimate of 2 billion, would be sold on a non-profit basis. He described it as an initial agreement, and said more doses could be provided through the COVAX programme in future.
The deal comes amid growing criticism of vaccine inequity from both the WHO and others as wealthy countries inoculate millions of people using shots procured through bilateral deals.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the new agreement with Pfizer should allow vaccinations to begin in February for health workers, although details of supply arrangements are still being finalised.
He said he hoped the agreement would also encourage other countries to donate more of their Pfizer shots to support rapid roll-out, like Norway has. 
""The commitment of the (United States) to join COVAX, together with this new agreement with Pfizer/BioNTech, mean that we are closer to fulfilling the promise of COVAX,"" he said.
U.S. President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said on Thursday the United States intended to join the facility. Biden's predecessor Donald Trump had halted funding to the Geneva-based body and announced a withdrawal process. 
The WHO said earlier this week it planned to deliver 135 million vaccines in the first quarter of 2021, without giving a breakdown by supplier.
GAVI's CEO Seth Berkley said in the same briefing that countries would receive dose estimates for the early part of this year in about a week's time.

1354,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 02:20PM ET</span>",Mexico calls for DEA internal probe of 'fabricated' case against minister,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico said on Friday the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration should carry out an internal investigation into the conduct of its case against a former defense minister, in a new test of bilateral ties with U.S. President Joe Biden's government.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said the investigation should look into who within the DEA ""fabricated"" the case against former minister Salvador Cienfuegos, days after Mexico's attorney general decided to drop charges.
""I am not going to go to any international body, but I respectfully believe that agency should do an internal investigation and clarify what happened, who made the file, who gave the order to apply it,"" said Lopez Obrador, referring to the DEA, during a regular news conference.
Both governments later confirmed that Lopez Obrador and Biden would speak by phone on Friday afternoon. 
The U.S. arrest and subsequent release of Cienfuegos put severe strain on bilateral security cooperation. Mexico retaliated with restrictions on DEA intelligence gathering. Lopez Obrador also angered Washington by publishing a large dossier from the case that the United States had provided in confidence. 
The ongoing fallout risks further souring ties just as Biden takes over from Donald Trump, with whom the Mexican president had struck an unlikely friendship. Just on Thursday, Lopez Obrador said another phone call with Biden was not needed after the two men spoke in December.
Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said Lopez Obrador's recent moves seemed ""deliberately provocative"" to the new U.S. administration.
His ""contrarian attitude is largely due to his drive to acquire leverage ahead of what he anticipates will be a more complex period in bilateral relations,"" Teneo's Nicholas Watson said in a note.
Under Trump, in return for a hardline stance on immigration, Lopez Obrador received little high-level U.S. pressure over his push for more state control in the energy sector. 
While tensions over Cienfuegos have simmered in the first days of Biden's administration, Lopez Obrador also praised him for quick action on immigration reform. Mexico has kept up its cooperation on immigration issues, including putting pressure on Central American governments to break up the most recent large U.S.-bound caravan in Guatemala earlier this week. 
""INCONSISTENCIES""
Cienfuegos, a member of former President Enrique Pena Nieto's government, was arrested in October at Los Angeles international airport and accused by U.S. prosecutors of collaborating with a splinter of a powerful drug cartel.
He returned to Mexico in November after a federal judge granted a U.S. government request to drop charges against him and turn the investigation over to Mexico, citing diplomatic sensitivities.
The Mexican attorney general's office said earlier in January the U.S. case was not strong enough to warrant charges against Cienfuegos, a decision Lopez Obrador publicly backed.
Lopez Obrador said the hundreds of pages of evidence the DEA provided, which he ordered to be shared publicly online, was riddled with inconsistencies. ""There is no way that we are going to invent crimes,"" said Lopez Obrador. ""We have said that if the DEA has additional information to present it.""

The U.S. embassy in Mexico City referred a request for comment to the Department of Justice. A spokesman for the DEA, a division of Justice, did not immediately respond.

Humanitarian organizations have documented cases of attacks, extortion, kidnapping, and sexual violence against those in the program. Most are from Central America and many live in shelters and cramped apartments in dangerous border towns or in a squalid tent city in Mexico's far northeast.
Lopez Obrador disputed the accounts, saying he had ""other data"" and that his government would release a report on the migrants next week.
""We have been taking care of the migrants and we have been careful that their human rights are not affected,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference. 
""...It's nothing like it was before, when they were kidnapped and disappeared. We have been attentive and we have protected them.""
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under Biden's new administration, said on Wednesday it would end all new enrollments in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program, which since 2019 has forced more than 65,000 asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings, sometimes for months or even years.
The announcement did not specify what will happen to the tens of thousands currently waiting in Mexico under the program, saying only that they ""should remain where they are, pending further official information from U.S. government officials.""

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A majority in Democratic Republic of Congo's lower house of parliament filed a motion of no confidence in the prime minister on Friday, a move likely to force the government's collapse and hand President Felix Tshisekedi a major political victory. 
The motion, which lawmaker Chérubin Okende said carried the signatures of more than 300 of the National Assembly's 500 members, gives Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga Ilunkamba 48 hours to resign or face a no-confidence vote. 
Last month, Tshisekedi moved to end a coalition formed with his predecessor Joseph Kabila that has constrained Tshisekedi's authority since he took office in January 2019. Since then, he has persuaded scores of MPs to defect from Kabila's alliance, which had previously controlled the majority in parliament.
While Tshisekedi's new political grouping, known as the Sacred Union, has yet to formally take over the majority, which requires a separate declaration, Ilunga's political fate appeared sealed. 
""The majority of the national assembly is in favour of the departure of the prime minister,"" Okende, one of the motion's authors, told Reuters. 
If his allies do emerge with a parliamentary majority, the president would be able to nominate a cabinet of his choosing after two years in which Kabila's allies have dominated the major ministries, stalling Tshisekedi's agenda. 
It would also free Tshisekedi's hand to nominate a head of the electoral commission a new central bank board, a precondition for badly-needed assistance from international donors.
But political analysts say behind-the-scenes horse-trading by Tshisekedi's new allies may point to a swapping of one political elite for another rather than substantive change. 

""At best we gain a few months before the next crisis without any real change at the level of governance. At worst, we are heading towards something ...worse,"" said Jean Claude Mputu, a political scientist at the University of Liege.

1357,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 01:31PM ET</span>",Judge orders Oath Keepers member detained over charges he plotted to storm U.S. Capitol,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge in Ohio ordered that Oath Keepers member Donovan Crowl be detained pending trial, after prosecutors charged him with conspiring with other members to storm the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.
""The charges against the defendant are very serious,"" said Sharon Ovington, a Magistrate Judge in the Southern District of Ohio. 
""The government alleges that he conspired with others in advance to forcibly storm the United States Capitol.""
Crowl is a self-employed carpenter in Champaign County, Ohio and a veteran of the Persian Gulf War. Prosecutors said he does not have a stable address at the moment. He and his associates Thomas Caldwell and Jessica Watkins are the first suspects to be charged with plotting to take over the U.S. Capitol, in an effort to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's election as U.S. President over former President Donald Trump. 
All three are members of the Oath Keepers, a loosely organized anti-government militia whose members generally believe they must take the law into their own hands.
Crowl's attorney said his client suffers from skin cancer and cannot get proper treatment in jail. He also said that as a war veteran, Crowl could be trusted to abide by any rules of release the judge might impose.
Ovington rejected those arguments, and said releasing Crowl to a home that apparently contains nine firearms was a ""non-starter.""
In an amended complaint, investigators said they have uncovered damning messages exchanged between the three showing an apparent coordinated effort to storm the Capitol.
Caldwell, whom prosecutors describe as a leader in the organization, also received messages from an unidentified person inside the Capitol that appeared to direct him down to the building's underground tunnels.
""All members are in the tunnels under capital seal them in. Turn on gas,"" one message said.
At Crowl's detention hearing, the government said the FBI had discovered instructions on how to build explosives during the execution of a search warrant at the home of one of Crowl's co-conspirators.
The prosecutor also read aloud excerpts from Internet posts made by Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, in which he urges his members to essentially prepare for a civil war.
On the group's site, Rhodes wrote: ""What is now being installed is ... an illegitimate regime"" and called Biden a ""puppet who will do the bidding of a mortal enemy of this nation.""
More than 150 people so far have been charged for their role in storming the U.S. Capitol, according to a Reuters tally. The FBI has been making arrests every day since the siege, as agents comb through more than 200,000 photos and videos in which many of the suspects can be seen pushing past police, ransacking offices and bragging about their actions.

The FBI has linked a number of suspects to fringe groups such as Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. Others, meanwhile, are described as believers of discredited, but widely-spread conspiracy theories such as QAnon.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said on Friday he wanted it known that he had no plans to commit suicide in prison, as he issued a message of support to his followers on the eve of protests the authorities say are illegal.
Navalny was detained on Sunday after flying home for the first time since being poisoned with what the West says was a military-grade nerve agent that Navalny says was applied to his underpants by state security agents.
The 44-year-old lawyer, in a Moscow prison pending the outcome of four legal matters he describes as trumped up, accuses President Vladimir Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him.
Navalny's allies plan nationwide protests on Saturday to try to force the Kremlin to order his release.
The authorities have opened a criminal case into protest organisers, accused Navalny's allies of trying to illegally encourage minors to attend, and warned that attendees risk catching COVID-19. 
Navalny, in a message on Instagram via his lawyer, said he wanted people to know he was in good physical and mental health.
""Just in case, I am announcing that I don’t plan to either hang myself on a window grill or cut my veins or throat open with a sharpened spoon,” the post said.
“I use the staircase very carefully. They measure my blood pressure every day and it's like a cosmonaut's so a sudden heart attack is ruled out. I know for a fact that there are many good people outside my prison and that help will come,” he wrote.
The authorities have made it clear they will crack down on Saturday's protests.
On Friday, Moscow courts sentenced Navalny's spokeswoman to nine days in jail, gave another ally 10 days, and fined another 250,000 roubles for what they said were illegal calls to attend the protests.
Navalny supporters outside Moscow were also targeted and Russia said that TikTok and other social media had deleted what it called illegal posts promoting the protests. 

Maria Zakharova, a foreign ministry spokeswoman, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): ""When minors are being invited to (political) meetings do not expect anything good. Because children are dragged into political battles when all other options are not working, which means that the ideologues of this process are ready to do anything to achieve their goals.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Iran urged new U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday to ""choose a better path"" by returning to a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and global powers, but said the opportunity would be lost if Washington insists on further Iranian concessions up front.
Under Biden's predecessor Donald Trump, Washington withdrew from the deal - designed to stop Iran developing a nuclear weapon - and bolstered sanctions in a bid to force Tehran into talks on a broader agreement that also addressed its ballistic missile program and support for proxies around the Middle East.
Biden, who took office on Wednesday, ""can begin by removing all sanctions imposed since Trump assumed office and seek to re-enter and abide by the 2015 nuclear deal without altering its painstakingly negotiated terms,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine.
""In turn, Iran would reverse all the remedial measures it has taken in the wake of Trump's withdrawal from the nuclear deal,"" he said on Friday, adding that the ""initiative squarely rests with Washington""
Since Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, Iran has breached its key limits one after the other, building up its stockpile of low-enriched uranium, refining uranium to a higher level of purity and using advanced centrifuges for enrichment.
Biden has said that if Tehran resumed strict compliance with the 2015 agreement Washington would rejoin it.
""But we would use that, as a platform with our allies and partners ..., to seek a longer and stronger agreement and also...to capture these other issues, particularly with regard to missiles and Iran's destabilizing activities,"" Antony Blinken, Biden's choice for secretary of state, said on Tuesday. 
""Having said that, I think we're a long way from there,"" he said.
Zarif said temporary limitations on Iran's defence and missile procurements under the 2015 deal cannot be re-negotiated. He reiterated that, separate from the nuclear issues, Iran was willing to discuss problems in the Middle East. 

""But the peoples of the region, not outsiders, must resolve these issues. Neither the United States nor its European allies have the prerogative to lead or sponsor future talks,"" he wrote.

QIXIA, China (Reuters) - The 10 known survivors trapped since a deadly Jan. 10 gold mine explosion in northern China have been using laser pointers and loudspeakers to try to find their missing colleagues, state media reported on Friday.
The rescue operation, which has been able to get food and medicines to the miners, was expected to take at least another two weeks, authorities have said.
White bottles of food and water sent down to the trapped workers had a note stuck on them saying, ""We are all waiting for you, keep going!"", photos shared by propaganda department officials with Reuters on Friday showed.
The food items sent to the workers include millet porridge, quail eggs, pickles and sausages and medical supplies included disinfectant, masks and cotton socks.
""The physical condition, psychological condition and living environment of 10 miners in the middle section of the mine are good,"" the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, reported on Friday.
""The miners continued to search for other trapped persons through laser pointer projection and loudspeaker shouting,"" it said.
A total of 22 workers were trapped in the Hushan mine by the Jan 10 blast in Qixia, a major gold-producing region under the administration of Yantai in coastal Shandong province.
One has died and 11 were not in contact with the rescue teams, according to a Xinhua radio report on Thursday.
At least 15 days may be needed to clear the ""severe blockages"" as rescuers continued to drill shafts to reach the 10 men, officials said on Thursday.
At the site, security was tight on Friday and Reuters journalists were not permitted to get close to the rescue operation. 
Workers in orange high visibility clothing could be seen operating heavy machinery. At the entrance to the site, a medical tent had been set up to administer COVID tests for rescue workers.
About 570 people are involved in the rescue, the newspaper said.

China's mines are among the world's deadliest. It has recorded 573 mine-related deaths in 2020, according to the National Mine Safety Administration.

The New York City Police Department on Thursday announced it had detained Kevin Gavin, 66, in connection with the murders of three women that took place at the Woodson Houses in Brownsville between 2015 and 2021. 
Gavin was familiar with many of the elderly residents of the complex, according to law enforcement, and even used to run errands for some of them. 
NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said investigators pieced together a timeline of the disturbing events thanks forensic evidence and witness testimony that led them to identify Gavin's first victim as Myrtle McKenny, 82, found by her home health aide on Nov. 9, 2015 inside her apartment.
""Initially, it was believed that Ms. McKenny died from natural causes."" Rodney told a press conference. ""But while being examined a stab wound was discovered.""
The wound in the woman's neck led investigators to classify her death as a homicide but the case remained open for years without many leads. Gavin claimed his second victim, Jacolia James, 83, in 2019, police said. Forensic evidence eventually led police to investigate Gavin as a suspect, Harrison said. 
The third and most recent victim, police say, was 78-year-old Juanita Caballero. She was found by her son on Jan. 15 with a telephone cord wrapped around her neck. 
Harrison said law enforcement is still investigating leads on other incidents in case they are linked to Gavin. 
According to Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, Gavin took advantage of relationships he had with his alleged victims who let him into their home unsuspecting.
""I am confident we have the right person in custody and we will be moving very promptly into impaneling a grand jury to hear the evidence in this case,"" he said.

The discovery of so many dead people - two as young as 15 - in the back of the truck on an industrial estate to the east of London shocked Britain and Vietnam. It also shone a spotlight on the illicit global trade that sends the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.
As oxygen levels fell, some tried desperately to escape, but in vain. Others used mobile phones to say their last farewells to devastated relatives on the other side of the world.
Judge Nigel Sweeney said they had suffered an ""excruciating slow death"" as he jailed seven men involved in the people smuggling gang for a total of 92 years at London's Old Bailey criminal court.
He said it was a sophisticated, long-running, and profitable scheme which would have netted the gang hundreds of thousands of pounds. 
The four who admitted or were found guilty of manslaughter and immigration offences, were 41-year-old haulier Ronan Hughes from Northern Ireland, the leader of the plot who was jailed for 20 years, and Romanian Gheorghe Nica, 44, another major figure, who was sentenced to 27 years behind bars.
Maurice Robinson, 26, the Northern Irish driver of the truck in which the bodies were found, was jailed for 13 years, while Eamonn Harrison, 24, also from the British province, who drove the container to the Belgian port of Zeebrugge from where the victims were taken to Britain, was given an 18-year sentence.
Most of those who died were from Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial reward abroad fuel migration.
British police have released tributes from the relatives of those who had died, including the parents of soccer fan Nguyen Huy Hung, 15.
""He always dreamt of going to the UK and he tried very hard to study at school as well as learning English for that purpose,"" they said.

The United Nations has been trying unsuccessfully for decades to reunite Cyprus, split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. The last attempt collapsed in disarray in 2017 after negotiations attended by all parties.
Only Ankara recognises the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) as an independent state. It does not recognise the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government to the south.
Cavusoglu said Turkey, Greece, Britain - the island's guarantor powers - and the United Nations would convene the talks with the two Cypriot sides in late February or early March, with the European Union as an observer.
Speaking in Brussels after talks with senior EU officials, Cavusoglu said the bloc had so far ""disregarded the rights of the Turkish side"".
""We conveyed to them that this trust needs to be re-established,"" he added.
Cyprus's division has long been a source of friction between Turkey and EU member Greece, which will hold talks next Monday on a separate dispute over maritime rights in the eastern Mediterranean.
Turkey faces the threat of EU economic sanctions over the maritime rights dispute with Greece and Cyprus.

However, the EU and Turkey have both signalled this week that they want to improve relations, which have also been strained by disagreements over migration and Ankara's human rights record.

Laschet, premier of Germany's most populous state and the self-styled Merkel continuity candidate, won 83.35% of the valid postal votes cast by 1,001 delegates, the CDU said. He beat arch-conservative Friedrich Merz in Saturday's online ballot by a 521-466 margin.
Laschet must now unite a unite a conservative bloc that, despite her four successive federal election victories, has never been entirely comfortable with Merkel's centrist course.
""The CDU remains Germany's Europe party,"" Laschet told reporters, stressing that he wanted his leadership of the party to be marked by dialogue with its grass roots.
Merkel, Europe's predominant politician and a consistent winner with German voters since taking office in 2005, has said she will not run for chancellor again in September's federal election.
Since she stepped down as CDU leader in December 2018, the party has struggled to find a suitable successor.
In choosing Laschet, delegates opted for a candidate more palatable to the left-leaning Greens party, second behind the conservatives in opinion polls and seen as a potential coalition partner come September.
Merkel said last year that Laschet, 59, had ""the tools"" to run for chancellor, the closest she has come to endorsing anyone.
But even as party leader, Laschet is not guaranteed to be the chancellor candidate for the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).

CSU leader Markus Soeder has called for the CDU/CSU alliance, the ""Union"", to decide on its chancellor candidate only after state elections in mid-March, leaving open the possibility he could run if Laschet stumbles.

1365,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 10:40AM ET</span>",Turkish appeals court overturns acquittal in Gezi trial,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish appeals court on Friday overturned the acquittal of nine people, including philanthropist Osman Kavala, in a case related to nationwide protests in 2013, according to court documents seen by Reuters.
The case had ended with the surprise acquittal of nine defendants last February due to insufficient evidence. The trial was followed closely by Turkey's Western allies and rights groups, who said it was symbolic of what they saw as a crackdown on dissent under President Tayyip Erdogan.
The total of 16 defendants in the case were accused of organising and spreading the 2013 Gezi protests. The cases of seven defendants who did not attend the hearings were separated and their trial continues.
Court documents showed the appeals court had ruled on Friday to overturn the acquittal and sent the case back to the lower court.
Among the reasons for overturning the acquittal, the court said some evidence had not been included in the reasoning for the verdict, and that a second case against Kavala should also be considered while ruling in the Gezi case.
The demonstrations in 2013 saw hundreds of thousands march in Istanbul and elsewhere in Turkey against plans approved by then-premier Erdogan to build a replica Ottoman barracks in the city's Gezi Park.
Critics say Turkey's judiciary has been exploited to punish Erdogan's perceived opponents. The president and his AK Party say the courts make independent decisions.
Among those acquitted last year was philanthropist businessman Kavala, who was accused of financing the protests. He has remained in jail over charges related to a failed coup attempt in 2016 despite the European Court of Human Rights calling for his release.
After the acquittal, Erdogan said the protests were a ""heinous attack"" aimed at the state. He said the court had ""set out to acquit (Kavala) with a manoeuvre"", adding that the second arrest order must be respected.

All defendants in the Gezi trial deny the charges. Kavala also denies the charges related to the coup attempt.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 10:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Canada deporting thousands even as pandemic rages,"By Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada deported thousands of people even as COVID-19 raged last year, data seen by Reuters shows, and lawyers say deportations are ramping up, putting people needlessly at risk in the midst of a global health emergency.
Like many other countries, Canada is struggling to stop a second wave from spiraling out of control, and its political leaders are begging residents to stay home to prevent the spread. 
Lawyers and human rights advocates are decrying Canada's November decision to resume deportations. Until now, the extent of the country's pandemic deportations was not known, but recent interviews with immigration lawyers and scrutiny of government numbers has shed light on the situation.
Canada counted 12,122 people as removed in 2020 - 875 more than the previous year and the highest number since at least 2015, according to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) data seen by Reuters. The government says this was necessary and done safely.
The CBSA says the high number last year is because it includes people who decided to leave on their own, termed ""administrative removals."" In 2019 there were 1,657 administrative removals, compared with 8,215 last year.
Even subtracting those numbers, that leaves thousands of people deported as the pandemic raged and governments cautioned against travel of any kind for safety reasons.
Even as Canada continues to deport non-citizens during a health crisis, U.S. President Joe Biden paused deportations for 100 days within hours of being sworn in on Wednesday.
Canada officially imposed a moratorium on deportations in March that it lifted at the end of November.
""As much as a human rights concern it's a common sense concern,"" said Bill Frelick, director of Human Rights Watch's Refugee Rights Program.
Countries' deportation practices have varied over the course of the pandemic. Several, including the United Kingdom, suspended deportations before resuming them. Others, like Ireland, have kept suspensions in place.
The CBSA said it has been prioritizing deportations for reasons of ""serious admissibility,"" including criminality.
The vast majority of people deported in 2020 were for reasons of ""noncompliance."" Even taking into account administrative removals, more than 1,000 people were deported during the suspension, the data shows.
'IT'S UNBELIEVABLE'
Public health experts have warned that travel of any kind can spread COVID-19 from one place to another, a risk that grows with the advent of more highly transmissible COVID variants. 
Many of the deportation trips involve transfers at multiple airports and flights during which people are placed in enclosed space in close quarters with other people for hours at a time, a situation ripe for transmission.
Since August Canada has been conducting deportations with CBSA escorts, so Canadians are also making thousands of these round-trip flights for deportation purposes.
Organizations including the Canadian Bar Association and the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers spoke out against Canada's decision to resume deportations. 
""As everybody is putting in place more restrictions in an effort to flatten the curve ... CBSA made a shocking decision to simply go back to business as usual,"" said Maureen Silcoff, president of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers.
""Canada has taken the position that nonessential travel is barred yet people are now being removed and there's no indication that those removals are essential.""
The CBSA said in a statement it lifted the moratorium on deportations because foreign government offices and borders had reopened, airlines restarted their routes and public-health protocols ""have contributed to a high degree of safety for persons being removed by air.""
""Canada continues to uphold both its human rights and public safety obligations in relation to the removal of inadmissible foreign nationals,"" the statement said. ""The removal process includes many checks and balances to ensure that the removal is conducted in a fair and just manner.""
But these deportations are endangering not only the people being deported but the government officers tasked with accompanying them to their destination, lawyers say.
Immigration lawyer Lorne Waldman's Toronto office went from getting no removal cases to getting three or four in the space of a week, he said. He is now fighting for a failed refugee claimant with two young Canadian children who faces deportation to Egypt Monday. 
""They're ramping it up as if there was no pandemic,"" he said. ""It's unbelievable.""

(Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed a law on Friday requiring political parties to disclose donations of more than 100,000 rand ($6,650) in a bid to clean up party funding, but it did not ban anonymous donations.
The Political Party Funding Act requires parties to make bank statements available from donations that size or greater.
In addition, it ""prohibits donations to parties by foreign governments or agencies, foreign persons or entities, organs of state or state-owned enterprises"", a statement from his office said, apart from funding for training or policy development. 
Whether it is drug money sloshing through Latin American elections, wealthy individuals in Western nations making hefty donations in exchange for government contracts, or African patronage networks influencing power, there is a growing global recognition that wealth subverts democracy when unregulated. 
But South Africa was one of the few democracies that had no regulation at all on private political party funding before this bill came into effect. That enabled wealthy people and companies to pull strings behind the scenes.
""The Political Party Funding Act will.. strengthen the confidence of citizens in the democratic political process,"" Ramaphosa said in a statement.
Sheilan Clarke, of MyVoteCounts, a national campaign to improve transparency in elections, welcomed the move, but said there were many loopholes in the law.
""One is that donors can still donate anonymously,"" she said, as they can still use bank accounts that hide the true source of the money. ""But we'll have the numbers...which is better than anything we've had since the arrival of democracy (in 1994)"".
Another bill, Promotion of Access to Information Act amendment, which Ramaphosa has yet to sign, will force parties to publish their donations and the associated paper trail themselves - but again, it does not prevent anonymity. 
""If you look the state of corruption...in South Africa, they were able to get away with it because there's no way for us to see,"" Clarke said. ""This will do away with that secrecy.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian farmers on Friday rejected an offer by the government to defer three farm reform laws for one-and-half years, warning they would step up protests as they seek a repeal of the laws and a guarantee on minimum crop prices.
Farm leaders said hundreds of thousands of farmers from neighbouring states including Haryana, Punjab and western Uttar Pradesh would drive tractors through New Delhi on January 26, the Republic Day national holiday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join a parade of military forces.
Although some former government officials have expressed concern that the protests could turn violent, the leaders said they would remain peaceful and urged the police to grant permission for the convoy to enter the capital. 
The 11th round of talks between government officials led by Agricultural minister Narendra Singh Tomar and forty farm leaders earlier on Friday was inconclusive. Farmers stuck to their demands while the government urged them to consider its offer to hold discussions to address their concerns after deferring the laws.
""There is a sort of deadlock as the government repeated the offer of deferring the laws, which is not acceptable,"" Darshan Pal, one of the farm leaders told reporters after the meeting.
Modi's government has said that the laws introduced in September will unshackle farmers from the obligation of selling produce only at regulated wholesale markets. But the farmers say the bills are designed to benefit private buyers.
Tomar said the government was committed to the reforms.
""If (farm leaders) agree with our proposal, we can meet tomorrow,"" he said.
Hundreds of thousands of farmers have been camping on the outskirts of national capital for nearly two months, blocking some of the roads connecting New Delhi with neighbouring states.
Supporting the farmers, the main opposition Congress party said on Friday that the government had shown ""shocking insensitivity and arrogance"" towards farmers and urged it to accept their demands.

Militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have expanded their reach in the semi-arid region on the edge of the Sahara, stoking ethnic conflict in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger and forcing whole communities to flee their homes.
More than half of those displaced within their own country are in Burkina Faso, where many are forced to sleep outside and do not have enough water, UNHCR spokesman Boris Cheshirkov said at a briefing in Geneva.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 09:00AM ET</span>",Bosnian Muslim ex-commander jailed 10 years over war crimes by Islamist fighters,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia's war crimes court on Friday jailed Bosnian Muslim wartime commander Sakib Mahmuljin for 10 years for failing to prevent or punish atrocities against Serb prisoners by foreign Islamists who fought in the 1990s conflict.
Hundreds of Islamist fighters, or ""mujahideen"", came from North Africa and the Middle East to help the mainly Muslim Bosnian government forces fight separatist Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats during the war, in which 100,000 people died.
Mahmuljin, 68, was convicted in a five-year-long trial of failing to prevent or punish killings and inhumane treatment of Serb prisoners of war, some of whom were wounded or ill, and some Serb civilians, the Sarajevo court said.
In its verdict, the court said it determined that foreign Islamists murdered 53 Serb prisoners of war from July to October 1995, towards the end of the war. During this period, they tortured some prisoners and decapitated one of them, it said. 
Mahmuljin, who commanded the Bosnian army's 3rd Corps, may appeal the verdict.
The court was set up in 2005 to ease the burden of cases taken by the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague. 
The war erupted when Bosnian Serbs, rejecting the proclamation of independence of Bosnia from Serbian-led federal Yugoslavia, attacked cities and villages across the country in a bid to carve out territory for an exclusive Serb state.
The U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement ended the conflict in December 1995 by splitting Bosnia into two largely autonomous regions along ethnic lines.
After the war ended, foreign Islamists were ordered to leave Bosnia under U.S. pressure and most did, including those who married local women but then had their citizenship revoked.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Three former Nepali prime ministers joined thousands of demonstrators on Friday to protest against Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli's abrupt move to dissolve parliament and call snap elections.
Judges in the Supreme Court are hearing arguments on more than a dozen petitions challenging Oli's plan to seek elections about two years before his government's tenure ends.
Oli, 68, has said internal squabbling and a lack of cooperation from members of his party had paralysed decision-making, forcing his December 2020 move to seek an early vote.
In recent weeks Oli has been attending rallies organised by his supporters in support of his decision that mirror regular demonstrations against it.
On Friday, the protesters demanded that he withdraw his ""unconstitutional"" move that has plunged the young republic already battling the pandemic into political turmoil.
""We will all continue our protests to pressure Oli to realise his mistake and correct it,"" former prime minister Madhav Kumar Nepal told the anti-government rally in the heart of Kathmandu. 
Former premiers Prachanda, who led a decade long Maoist insurgency that ended in 2006 and still goes by his nom de guerre, and Jhal Nath Khanal, were also at the rally. All three former premiers are from Oli’s party but oppose the dissolution.
A senior police official said an estimated 25,000 people had gathered to protest near Oli's office on Friday and more marches were planned across the Himalayan nation, which lies between India and China.
Legal experts said the hearing on Oli's decision was expected to go on until February as more than 300 lawyers had registered their names to participate in the proceedings.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's main ruling parties on Friday flagged snap elections as the only way out of its political impasse, if Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte fails to drum up a parliamentary majority after scraping through a confidence vote.
After surviving Tuesday's Senate vote thanks to abstentions, Conte appealed to centrist and unaligned upper house lawmakers outside the coalition to join his minority government's ranks. 
Few have responded and time is short, as Conte seeks a solid majority to push through urgent legislation to tackle one of Europe's worst coronavirus epidemics and the deep economic crisis it has triggered.
The deadlock and its uncertain resolution has unnerved financial markets. The risk premium on Italian debt - the gap between its and Germany's 10-year bond yields - rose on Friday to its highest since November. 
""We don't fear an election and we believe it can be one of the ways out of this situation,"" cabinet undersecretary Andrea Martella, of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), said in an interview with RAI state television on Friday.
PD deputy leader Andrea Orlando delivered a similar message on a Thursday evening talk show when asked if elections were becoming likely: ""Unfortunately they are, we believe that if Conte falls this majority will implode,"" he replied.
The PD's coalition partner, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, also said on Friday that if Conte failed to quickly get the necessary parliamentary backing a snap election was the only option. 
That would probably be won by the right-wing opposition led by Matteo Salvini's League party, opinion polls suggest. 
The crisis was triggered last week when former premier Matteo Renzi withdrew his centrist Italia Viva party from the coalition, depriving it of an outright Senate majority.
Analysts say the stance taken by the PD and 5-Star is partly a way of pressuring wavering senators to join the government, as most parliamentarians want to avoid a vote two years ahead of schedule in which many would risk not being re-elected.
The situation looks increasingly difficult. 
Underscoring internal PD tensions, four of its senators on Friday told its leaders to stop threatening elections ""directly or indirectly.""

The PD and 5-Star both rule out supporting a broad coalition with rightist parties, while 5-Star rules out backing any government not led by Conte, who does not belong to any political party. Both currently rule out a reconciliation with Renzi.

Weddings are currently supposed to take place only under ""exceptional circumstances"".
However, officers found hundreds of people gathering in Stamford Hill, in north London, with the windows covered to stop people seeing inside. The organiser of the wedding now could be fined up to 10,000 pounds ($13,700), and five others were issued 200-pound penalties.
""This was a completely unacceptable breach of the law,"" said Detective Chief Superintendent Marcus Barnett. ""People across the country are making sacrifices by cancelling or postponing weddings and other celebrations and there is no excuse for this type of behaviour.""
The wedding took place at the Yesodey Hatorah Girls School, which serves Haredi Jewish families in the area, home to the biggest Orthodox Jewish community in Europe. 
""We are absolutely horrified about last night’s event and condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" the school said in a statement. An outside organisation was responsible for letting out its hall and it had no knowledge of the wedding, the school said.
Coronavirus cases soared in Britain at the end of last year after the outbreak of a new, more contagious variant of the virus, which has led to the imposition of lockdowns across the United Kingdom.
The number of daily cases has fallen from a high of almost 70,000 on Jan. 8 to just under 40,000 in recent days, but authorities are concerned that too many people are breaking the rules, meaning the virus keeps spreading. 
On Thursday, British interior minister Priti Patel warned those who broke lockdown restrictions faced punishment by police and announced a new 800-pound fine for those who attended house parties.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan and the IOC stood firm on Friday on their commitment to host the Tokyo Olympics this year and denied a report of a possible cancellation but the pledge looks unlikely to ease public concern about holding the event during a pandemic.
Though much of Japan is under a state of emergency due to a third wave of COVID-19 infections, Tokyo Olympic organisers have vowed to press ahead with the re-scheduled Games, which are due to open on July 23 after being postponed for a year because of the coronavirus.
A government spokesman said there was ""no truth"" to a report in Britain's Times newspaper that the government had privately concluded the Games would have to be cancelled.
The Times, citing an unidentified senior member of Japan's ruling coalition, said the government's focus was now on securing the Games for Tokyo in the next available year, 2032.
""We clearly deny the report,"" Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Manabu Sakai told a news conference.
Later, Japan Olympic Committee head Yasuhiro Yamashita told Reuters the report was false and ""a fabrication"".
The governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, said there had been no talk of cancelling or delaying the Olympics and a protest should be lodged over the Times report.
The Games organising committee also denied the report, saying in a statement its partners including the government and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were ""fully focused"" on hosting the games as scheduled.
""It is very disappointing to see that the Times is developing such a tabloid-like story with an untrustworthy source,"" a source from the organising committee told Reuters.
""The national government is fully committed to delivering a safe and secure Games,"" the source said.
'UNFOUNDED RUMOURS'
The IOC issued a statement echoing that line, adding: ""We will be implementing all possible counter-measures against COVID-19 and will continue to work closely ... in our preparations for holding a safe and secure Games this summer.""
The Australian and U.S. Olympic Committees said they were preparing for the Games as planned.
""Unfortunately, I need to address unfounded rumours that the Tokyo Olympic Games will be cancelled, rumours that only create more anxiety for athletes,"" Matt Carroll, the chief executive of the Australian committee, told reporters in Sydney.
""The Tokyo Games are on. The flame will be lit on July 23, 2021.""
The Australian committee is run by the IOC's pointman for the Tokyo Games, John Coates.
The U.S. and Canadian committees wrote on Twitter they had not received any information suggesting the Games would not happen as planned. 
Sebastian Coe, head of World Athletics, also moved to reassure fans and locals that it would go ahead in a secure environment. ""There is an absolute, cast-iron determination,"" Coe told Reuters, saying that the arrival of vaccines and ability of athletes to train meant the situation was far better than when the Games were postponed last year.
CORONAVIRUS FEARS 
Japan has been hit less severely by the pandemic than many other advanced economies but a recent surge in cases has forced it to close its borders to non-resident foreigners and declare a state of emergency in the Tokyo and other cities.
Tokyo reported new daily coronavirus cases of more than 1,000 for nine straight days through Thursday and set a single-day record of more than 2,400 infections earlier this month. The death toll from the respiratory disease stands at nearly 4,900 people in Japan.
There are public fears that an influx of athletes will spread the virus. About 80% of people in Japan do not want the Games to be held this summer, recent polls show.
In an interview ahead of Friday's report, Tokyo 2020 CEO Toshiro Muto said he was cautiously hopeful that successful COVID-19 vaccine campaigns could help ensure the safe staging of the world's largest sporting event.

The Olympic Games represents a major milestone for Japan and its premier, Yoshihide Suga, who has said the event would bring ""hope and courage"" to the world. Suga reiterated on Friday the Games would go ahead as planned.

WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Joe Biden is hiring a group of national security veterans with deep cyber expertise, drawing praise from former defense officials and investigators as the U.S. government works to recover from one of the biggest hacks of its agencies attributed to Russian spies.
""It is great to see the priority that the new administration is giving to cyber,"" said Suzanne Spaulding, director of the Defending Democratic Institutions project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
Cybersecurity was demoted as a policy field under the Trump administration. It discontinued the Cybersecurity Coordinator position at the White House, shrunk the State Department's cyber diplomacy wing, and fired federal cybersecurity leader Chris Krebs in the aftermath of Donald Trump's Nov. 3 election defeat.
Disclosed in December, the hack struck eight federal agencies and numerous companies, including software provider SolarWinds Corp. U.S. intelligence agencies publicly attributed it to Russian state actors. Moscow has denied involvement in the hack.
Under a recent law, Biden must open a cyber-focused office reporting to a new National Cyber Director, who will coordinate the federal government's vast cyber capabilities, said Mark Montgomery, a former congressional staffer who helped design the role. 
The leading candidate for Cyber Director is Jen Easterly, a former high ranking National Security Agency official, according to four people familiar with the selection process. 
Now head of resilience at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), Easterly held several senior intelligence posts in the Obama administration and helped create U.S. Cyber Command, the country's top cyber warfare unit. 
Easterly did not respond to requests for comment.
The Biden administration ""has appointed world-class cybersecurity experts to leadership positions,"" Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) corporate Vice President Tom Burt said in a statement.
Some observers worry, however, that the collective group's experience is almost entirely in the public sector, said one former official and an industry analyst who requested anonymity. The distinction is important because the vast majority of U.S. internet infrastructure is owned and operated by American corporations. 
""Finding a good balance with both government and commercial experience will be critical to success,"" said former DHS Cybersecurity director Amit Yoran, now chief executive of security company Tenable Inc.
To replace Krebs at the Homeland Security Department, Biden plans to nominate Rob Silvers, who also worked in the Obama administration, to become director of the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency, according to four people briefed on the matter. Silvers declined to comment for this article. 
Biden's National Security Council, an arm of the White House that guides an administration's security priorities, includes five experienced cybersecurity officials.
Leading the hires is National Security Agency senior official Anne Neuberger as Deputy National Security Adviser for cyber and emerging technology, a new position designed to elevate the subject internally. 
""The United States remains woefully unprepared for 21st century security threats - the establishment and prioritization of a DNSA for Cyber and Emerging Tech on the NSC indicates the seriousness the Biden Administration will afford to addressing these challenges,"" said Phil Reiner, chief executive of the Institute for Security and Technology. 
Neuberger became one of the most visible figures at NSA in recent years after leading the spy agency's cyber defense wing, drawing praise for quickly alerting companies to hacking techniques in use by other countries.
The other four hires are Michael Sulmeyer as senior director for cyber, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall as Homeland security adviser, Russ Travers as deputy homeland security adviser and Caitlin Durkovich as senior director for resilience and response at the NSC. 

All four previously served in senior national security posts that dealt with cybersecurity.

Long queues formed in some districts in Beijing, where mass testing was launched following several consecutive days of new cases. City officials said there were some ""leaks"" in epidemic control in some rural areas, with inadequate adherance to rules on wearing masks, social distancing and temperature checks.
A queue more than 200 metres long built up outside Dengshikou Elementary School, a testing spot near the city centre. A man surnamed Lin said the supermarket he works at had told him to get a test.
""I'm not that worried though this round of the outbreak is a bit unexpected. I came as my work unit told me to,"" he said.
Shanghai began testing all hospital staff for the disease on Thursday after two such workers tested positive. 
Almost all of the local transmissions and asymptomatic cases in Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province, were linked to a meat processing plant owned by a joint venture between Thailand's top agro-industrial conglomerate, CP Group, and a development zone.
Tens of millions of people have been under some kind of lockdown in northern cities amid worries that undetected infections could spread quickly during the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February.
Hundreds of millions of people usually travel during the holiday, as migrant workers return to their home provinces to see family. Officials expect large numbers of travellers, although many fewer than in normal years.
The northern port city of Tianjin said on Friday that all domestic arrivals would have to present a negative COVID-19 test and be subject to 14 days of home observation. 
Hebei province, next to Beijing, reported 18 new locally transmitted cases. At the high-speed railway station in its largest city, Shijiazhuang, passengers were allowed to get off a train on Friday but none were seen getting on.
""I've never been separated from my daughter over New Year before,"" said a woman surnamed Hao, in Shijiazhuang taking care of her mother. 
She said she had been told by her neighbourhood she was not allowed to return to Beijing, where the rest of her family are. She hoped restrictions would be lifted in time for them to reunite over the festival.
She said she was determined to get back to Beijing to be with her daughter and her father was in a nursing home there that no longer allowed visitors.
The capital's west train station, which normally sees vast numbers of passengers in the run-up to the Lunar New Year, was virtually empty on Friday morning. 
The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 119 from 113 cases a day earlier. 
The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 88,804, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4,635.

HANOI (Reuters) - The European parliament has chastised Vietnam for a government crackdown against activists in the Southeast Asian country and called on EU member states to condemn the campaign ahead of a major ruling Communist Party congress next week.
EU lawmakers voted 592 to 32 with 58 abstentions on Thursday in favour of a resolution which called for a tougher stance against the Vietnamese government and highlighted a link between human rights abuses and an EU-Vietnam trade deal.
In a media release, the European Parliament said lawmakers were ""appalled by and condemn the intensifying crackdown on dissent and the increasing violations of human rights in Vietnam."" 
""Respect for human rights constitutes a key foundation of the bilateral relations between Vietnam and the EU and is an essential element of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement,"" it said. 
Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the resolution. 
The Communist Party of Vietnam is due to hold its 13th National Congress on Monday, a major political meeting to set out policy objectives for the next five years and select a new leadership.
Rights groups have accused the party of presiding over a crackdown on activists that has intensified under its current leadership.
A Reuters tally based on state media reports found 280 people were arrested for ""anti-state"" activities in the five years since the last congress in 2016: 260 were convicted, many being sentenced to more than 10 years in jail.
In the five years leading up to the 2016 congress, there were 68 arrests and 58 convictions.
The European parliament resolution, which is non-binding on member states, said the terms of the trade deal allowed for ""appropriate action to be taken in the event of serious breaches of human rights"".
It also called on EU member states to ""strongly voice their concerns regarding the worsening human rights situation in Vietnam"" ahead of the congress.

BENGALURU (Reuters) - At least five mine workers were killed in southern India when their trucks carrying blasting material exploded, officials said on Friday. Local media said the toll could be higher.
The workers were transporting gelatin sticks used commonly as explosive material in stone mining quarries, a senior police official at the site of the accident, in Shivamogga district of Karnataka state, said.
News18 said that the death toll could be as high as 11.
Karnataka, home to the tech hub of Bengaluru, has vast mineral deposits and stone quarries, but the safety of mine workers has remained a concern.
Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yedyurappa said five people were confirmed dead and three people including the owner of the quarry had been detained and an investigation was ongoing.
""Pained by the loss of lives in Shivamogga ... the state government is providing all possible assistance to the affected,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a Twitter post.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's air accident investigator is probing whether a problem with the autothrottle system, that controls engine power automatically, contributed to the Sriwijaya Air crash on Jan. 9 that killed all 62 people on board, an official said on Friday.
National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) investigator Nurcayho Utomo said a problem with the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-500's autothrottle system was reported after a flight a few days earlier.
""There was a report of malfunction on the autothrottle a couple of days before to the technician in the maintenance log, but we do not know what kind of problem,"" he told Reuters. ""If we find the CVR (cockpit voice recorder) we can hear the discussion between the pilots, what they talked about and we will know what is the problem.""
It remains unclear whether a problem with the autothrottle system contributed to the crash, Utomo said, adding he could not recall any other issues raised in the maintenance log.
It is acceptable for a plane to fly with an autothrottle system that is not working because pilots can control it manually instead, he said.
Sriwijaya said he was unable to comment on technical matters involving the investigation before an official statement was made by KNKT. A preliminary report is expected to be issued within 30 days of the crash, in line with international standards.
The plane's flight data recorder (FDR) has been recovered and read by investigators but an underwater search for the CVR's memory unit at the crash site in the Java Sea is continuing.
Citing sources close to the investigation, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Thursday reported the FDR data showed the autothrottle system was not operating properly on one of the plane's engines as it climbed on departure from Jakarta.

Instead of shutting off the system, the FDR indicated the pilots tried to get the stuck throttle to function, the WSJ said. That could create significant differences in power between engines, making the jet harder to control.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Before he returned to Russia, opposition politician Alexei Navalny and his supporters had anticipated he would be arrested and planned to force the Kremlin to release him by staging repeated protests, a close ally has said.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was detained on Sunday after flying home for the first time since being poisoned with what the West says was a military-grade nerve agent that Navalny says was applied to his underpants by state security agents.
The 44-year-old lawyer, now in a notorious Moscow prison pending the outcome of four legal matters he says are all trumped up, accuses Putin of ordering his attempted murder. Putin has dismissed that, alleging Navalny is part of a U.S.-backed dirty tricks campaign to discredit him. 
Navalny's allies plan nationwide protests on Saturday to try to force the Kremlin to order his release, a high-stakes test of his support in the depths of winter during a pandemic.
Leonid Volkov, a close Navalny ally, told Reuters that the opposition plan also involves releasing video investigations into Putin and his allies, such as one on Tuesday about an opulent palace they alleged belonged to Putin, which the Kremlin denied. It has been watched 53 million times online.
""We know the Kremlin fears mass demonstrations,"" Volkov said. ""We know the Kremlin has never failed in recent years to bend one way or the other if the demonstrations were powerful and strong enough."" 
Two sources close to the Kremlin however believe Navalny is becoming a threat and that he will probably be kept in jail even if there are prolonged protests in his support.
The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Volkov and others are banking on outrage over Navalny's treatment and the palace video. They are also trying to exploit what opinion polls show is public frustration over falling wages and pandemic-fuelled economic pain.
But the government has introduced tougher penalties for protests, while 68-year-old Putin looks unassailable with an approval rating of more than 60%.
UNFAZED
Volkov is unfazed.
In 2013, a court jailed Navalny for five years, but then released him on parole after mass protests near the Kremlin. 
""We managed it then, we should be able to manage it now. Most important is not to be afraid,"" Volkov told supporters on YouTube on Thursday.
Lev Gudkov, head of the Levada pollster, which is not affiliated with the authorities, says Navalny has an approval rating of 15-17%, higher than he is credited with by government-backed pollsters, but is in no position to overthrow the government. 
""But he is in a position to discredit the current authorities,"" said Gudkov. 
Both the sources close to the Kremlin, who spoke anonymously due to the matter's sensitivity, said authorities were unlikely to cave in and release Navalny, and one expected him to remain in prison until after parliamentary elections in September. 
""He's already started to be a threat,"" said the first source. ""But he'll be sitting in jail during the elections to the Duma (parliament).""
""Those kind of things (letting someone go after protests) don't happen. Do it once and everything will be decided on the street after that,"" the second source said. 
The Kremlin has laughed off the idea that Navalny poses a threat to Putin.
It also denies controlling the judiciary or law enforcement, which has said Saturday's protest is illegal, detained several of Navalny's allies and warned social networks to stop helping circulate posts promoting the event.
The two sources however thought the heavy-handed way the state had handled Navalny's homecoming was boosting his support and turning him into a political martyr.
Navalny was right to return despite the risks, the first source said. 
""He's a real man. With balls. There aren't other people like that around at the moment. He follows his intuition, which has been right.""
Though the danger Navalny posed to the Kremlin was growing, both sources thought it would be some time before he represented a serious threat to Putin. A long jail term would be a mistake, said the first source. 
""They (some Kremlin officials and the security services) are such idiots. I think they'll lock him up and turn him into a hero ... Our comrades only think in terms of the present and never about tomorrow,"" the source said.

1390,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2021 02:16AM ET</span>",Swiss court to rule in Steinmetz trial over Guinea mining deal,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GENEVA (Reuters) - A Swiss criminal court will rule on Friday whether Israeli businessman Beny Steinmetz is guilty of corruption and forgery charges in one of the mining world's most high-profile legal disputes.
The battle for control of the world's richest untapped deposits of iron ore, buried in the remote Simandou mountain range of Guinea, has triggered probes and litigation around the world and thwarted efforts to extract the lucrative commodity.
Steinmetz, who made his name in the diamond business before turning to Simandou, was indicted in August 2019 by a Geneva prosecutor.
The prosecutor accused Steinmetz and two aides of paying, or having paid, $10 million in bribes to obtain exploration permits for Simandou and of forging documents to cover it up through a web of shell companies and bank accounts. They deny the charges.
    Yves Bertossa, Geneva's chief prosecutor, is seeking a five-year prison term for Steinmetz and 50 million Swiss francs ($56.33 million) in compensation. The aides, a Frenchman and Belgian woman, face lesser penalties.
    A three-judge tribunal is set to issue its ruling in Geneva after 1400 GMT.
    Swiss prosecutors allege Steinmetz and his aides won the mining rights by bribing Mamadie Touré, who they say was one of the wives of the former Guinean President Lansana Conté, between 2006 and 2010, and that they forged documents to cover it up.
    Steinmetz denies that he ever paid any money to Touré and his lawyer has said she had no real influence in Guinea. 
    Touré, who resides in Florida, could not be reached for comment. She was one of a dozen people called to appear at the trial. None of them attended.
   Central to Steinmetz’s defence is his claim that he was not involved in the day-to-day running of Beny Steinmetz Group Resources (BSGR). He described himself as the owner and company ambassador but not the boss of the group that employs some 100,000.
    ""I am not BSGR,"" the 64-year-old, who lived in Geneva until 2016, told the court. ""I didn't know Guinea and went there for the first time in February/March 2008."" 
    Bertossa rejected the defence argument and said the case represented ""a classic textbook case of corruption"".
""Today we have neither anyone responsible nor guilty, it's the theory of magic corruption. There is no corrupter, no corrupted,” he told the court.
The Geneva trial, held in an 18th-century courtroom stacked with 250 files of relevant documents, is one of many legal cases that have arisen from Simandou. 
In February 2019, BSGR said it would walk away from the project as part of a settlement with the Guinean government, in which both parties agreed to drop outstanding legal action.

Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO), which held the original exploration rights to Simandou, has said it is pressing ahead with the project. In an update this week, it said it was starting work, including on roadworks, and was carrying out technical studies.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The German airline Lufthansa has asked the Argentine government for permission to overfly its country en route to the Falklands, Argentina said on Thursday, adding that the request implies recognition of Falklands ""as part of Argentine territory,"" the Foreign Ministry said.
Lufthansa, separately, said it made the request for two flights supporting a polar research expedition because the normal route via Cape Town has been suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Argentina and Britain have long disputed ownership of the Falklands, with Argentina for decades claiming sovereignty over the British-run islands it calls the Malvinas. The dispute led to a brief war in 1982.
The Argentine government said Lufthansa asked for permission for two flights that are due to carry scientists and logistical support staff from Hamburg to Mount Pleasant in the Falklands, where they will continue onboard the ship ""Polarstern"" to Antarctica to conduct climate change research.
Argentina said the German government also asked for its permission for the Polarstern research ship to dock in Port Stanley, the capital of the British-held territory.
The two, 15-hour flights are scheduled for Feb. 1 and March 30.
Argentina's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Lufthansa had asked its civil aviation authority and regional authorities to fly over Argentina and use the Argentine Patagonian town of Ushuaia as an alternative airport should it be unable to land in the Falklands. 
The Foreign Ministry said the German Embassy also asked for authorization from the Argentine Naval Prefecture for the Polarstern ship to enter ""Puerto Argentino,"" the Argentine name for the Falklands capital Port Stanley.
""The relevance of Lufthansa's request presented to the Argentine authorities is highlighted as it implies the recognition of the Malvinas Islands as part of Argentine territory,"" the Foreign Ministry said. 
In the past year, Argentina has renewed its drive to reclaim the Falklands, appointing a Malvinas minister, saying it will redraw maps to emphasize its claim for use in schools and lobbying at the United Nations. 
The German government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Lufthansa announced the alternate route for the flight via the Falklands in a press release on Wednesday touting ""the longest passenger flight in the history of its company, marking one of the most unique flights the airline has ever carried out."" 
Both passengers and crew at present are in a 14-day quarantine and their luggage sealed and decontaminated in a bid to try to keep COVID cases low in the remote region.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2021 09:05PM ET</span>",New China swine fever strains point to unlicensed vaccines,"By Dominique Patton
BEIJING (Reuters) - A new form of African swine fever identified in Chinese pig farms is most likely caused by illicit vaccines, industry insiders say, a fresh blow to the world's largest pork producer, still recovering from a devastating epidemic of the virus.
Two new strains of African swine fever have infected more than 1,000 sows on several farms owned by New Hope (OTC:NHPEF) Liuhe, China's fourth-largest producer, as well as pigs being fattened for the firm by contract farmers, said Yan Zhichun, the company's chief science officer.
Though the strains, which are missing one or two key genes present in the wild African swine fever virus, don't kill pigs like the disease that ravaged China's farms in 2018 and 2019, they cause a chronic condition that reduces the number of healthy piglets born, Yan told Reuters. At New Hope, and many large producers, infected pigs are culled to prevent the spread, making the disease effectively fatal.
Although the known infections are limited now, if the strains spread widely, they could slash pork output in the world's top consumer and producer; two years ago, swine fever wiped out half of China's 400 million-head pig herd. Pork prices are still at record levels and China is under pressure to strengthen food security amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
""I don't know where they come from, but we find some mild field infections caused by some sort of gene-deleted viruses,"" Yan said.
Wayne Johnson, a Beijing-based veterinarian, said he diagnosed a chronic, or less-lethal, form of the disease in pigs last year. The virus lacked certain genetic components, known as the MGF360 genes. New Hope has found strains of the virus missing both the MGF360 genes and the CD2v genes, Yan said.
Research has shown that deleting some MGF360 genes from African swine fever creates immunity. But the modified virus was not developed into a vaccine because it tended to later mutate back to a harmful state.
""You can sequence these things, these double deletions, and if it's exactly the same as described in the lab, it's too much of a coincidence, because you would never get that exact deletion,"" said Lucilla Steinaa, principal scientist at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in Nairobi. 
There is no approved vaccine for African swine fever, which is not harmful to humans. But many Chinese farmers struggling to protect their pigs have resorted to unapproved products, industry insiders and experts said. They fear illicit vaccines have created accidental infections, which are now spreading.
The new strains could proliferate globally through contaminated meat, infecting pigs that are fed on kitchen waste. The virus is known to survive for months in some pork products.
China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs did not respond to two requests for comment.
But it has issued at least three warnings against use of unauthorised African swine fever vaccines, cautioning that they could have severe side effects and that producers and users could be charged with a criminal offence.
In August, the ministry said it would test pigs for different strains of the virus as part of a nationwide investigation into illegal vaccine use. 
Any strains with gene deletions could indicate a vaccine had been used, it said. No findings have been published so far on the issue, which is highly sensitive for Beijing. Reporting of the recent African swine fever outbreaks was extensively covered up. For a link to the report, click https://www.reuters.com/article/us-swinefever-china-epidemic-specialrepo/special-report-before-coronavirus-china-bungled-swine-epidemic-with-secrecy-idUSKBN20S189
MAN-MADE STRAINS
After decades of research toward producing a vaccine against the huge, complex swine fever virus, researchers around the world are focussing on live-virus vaccines - the only type to have shown any promise.
But such vaccines carry higher risks because even after the virus is weakened so it does not cause serious illness, it can sometimes recover its virulence.
One such vaccine used in Spain in the 1960s caused a chronic disease with swollen joints, skin lesions and respiratory issues in pigs that complicated efforts to eradicate African swine fever over the next three decades. Since then, no nation has approved a vaccine for the disease. 
A vaccine with both MGF360 and CD2v genes deleted is undergoing trials by China's Harbin Veterinary Research Institute after showing promise.
Yan said he believes that people have replicated the sequences of virus strains being studied, which have been published in scientific literature, and that pigs injected with illicit vaccines based on them could be infecting others.
""It's definitely man-made; this is not a natural strain,"" he said.
Neither Johnson nor Yan have fully sequenced the new swine fever strains. Beijing strictly controls who is allowed to work with the virus, which can only be handled in laboratories with high biosecurity designations.
But several private companies have developed test kits that can check for specific genes.
GM Biotech, based in China's central Hunan province, said in an online post last week it had developed a test that identifies whether the pathogen is a virulent strain, a single-gene deleted attenuated strain, or a double-gene deleted attenuated strain.
The test helps pig producers because the new strains are ""very difficult to detect at the initial stage of infection and have a longer incubation period after infection,"" the company said.
The government has not said how widely used illicit vaccines are or who has produced them. But a ""vast amount"" of pigs in China have nonetheless been vaccinated, Johnson said, a sentiment echoed by many other experts. 
In 2004-5, when the H5 bird flu strains were spreading across Asia, Chinese laboratories produced several unauthorised live bird flu vaccines, said Mo Salman, a professor of veterinary medicine at Colorado State University, who has worked on animal health in Asia, raising fears that they could produce dangerous new variants. 

""The current ASF unlawful vaccine(s) in China is repeating history,"" Salman said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Suicides increased in Japan during 2020 after a decade of declines, with the number of women committing suicide surging amid the emotional and financial stress caused by the coronavirus pandemic even as fewer men took their own lives.
Suicide has a long history in Japan as a way of avoiding shame or dishonor, and its suicide rate has long topped the Group of Seven nations, but a concerted national effort brought numbers down by roughly 40 percent over 15 years that included ten straight years of decline from 2009.
But, preliminary police data published on Friday showed suicides totaled 20,919 last year, 750 more than in 2019.
The suicide rate had been trending lower in the first half of 2020, but from July onward the numbers began to rise as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak hit home, activists and researchers say.
By gender, 13,943 men and 6,976 women took their lives - a 1 percent decline on the previous year for men but a 14.5 percent increase for women, who tend to work in service and retail sectors that suffered more job losses during the pandemic.
""The painful trend of rising suicides by women has continued,"" a Health Ministry official told a news briefing.
""Suicides are the result of many different things, but I think one thing we can definitely say is that there was an impact from the coronavirus on economic and lifestyle factors,"" he added.
The worst month was October, when suicides totaled 2,153 for the highest monthly total in over five years. The number of suicides by women, at 851, rose 82.6 percent on the same month in 2019.
For many years in Japan, getting psychological help has been stigmatised, but when suicides hit a peak of 34,427 in 2003, alarmed policymakers drew up a comprehensive prevention programme launched in 2007.
Through a combination of government and corporate efforts that included identifying at-risk groups, capping overtime and making it easier to get counselling, suicides had decreased to just over 20,000 in 2019, before the coronavirus struck.

With 88 legislators in favor, 28 opposed and seven abstentions, the proposal will still need a second vote in the unicameral legislature next year before it is enacted.
Currently, all constitutional changes require a two-thirds majority vote of the 128-member body.
Mario Perez, a lawmaker with the ruling party of President Juan Orlando Hernandez, explained during a virtual floor debate that the change will create a ""constitutional lock"" on any would-be softening of the existing articles.
The country's criminal code sets out three to six-year prison terms for women who abort a fetus as well as anyone else involved.
Abortion-rights proponents accused backers of the proposal of seeking to cement the current bans.
""This legislation permanently condemns pregnant women or pregnant girls who have been raped or risk dying due to health reasons,"" said Merary Mendoza, a researcher with the Honduran women's studies center CEMH.
Kevihn Ramos, the head of a gay rights advocacy group in Honduras, blasted the lawmakers who voted to make it harder to change the two constitutional articles.
""This reform is the product of a state-imposed religion on Honduras,"" he said.

TEGUCIGALPA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Returned Honduran migrants are directing anger against their president this week after their U.S.-bound caravan was blocked by the region's security forces, accusing him of making their county unlivable while thwarting their escape to a better life.
Honduras is reeling from two back-to-back hurricanes that devastated Central America in November, as well as an historic economic contraction on the back of coronavirus pandemic. 
President Juan Orlando Hernandez has also been under fire from U.S. prosecutors that have accused him of having ties to drug cartels, an allegation he has strongly denied.
An estimated 8,000 Hondurans sought to flee this week in a mass caravan hoping to reach the United States. But after regional governments, including Honduras, organized a coordinated military operation to repel the caravan, returned migrants are directing their frustration at their government.
More than 4,500 Hondurans, including more than 600 children, have been returned to the country by Guatemalan authorities over the last week.
Among them was 18-year-old Isaac Portillo, who said he felt so desperate upon his forced return to Honduras that he contemplated suicide.
Like other returned migrants, Portillo's despair quickly turned to anger. He plans to join a march on the capital Tegucigalpa on Friday – only one week after he tried to flee his shattered country.
""We're going to oust this narco-dictator,"" he said. ""I already have my group ready.""
The Honduran government did not respond to requests for comment. Hernandez has said the accusations against him come from traffickers angry at his government's crackdown on criminal networks.
WhatsApp, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Telegram groups with thousands of members are buzzing with angry messages calling for Hernandez's ouster.
Honduras has been rocked by large anti-government mobilizations in recent years, although it is unclear whether a large protest will materialize on Friday. 
Evidence introduced by U.S. prosecutors this month accused Hernandez of taking bribes from drug traffickers and has further stoked ire against the president, whose brother was convicted of drug trafficking in a U.S. court last year.
PRESSURE COOKER
Many Hondurans have been critical of what they say was a lackluster government response to the hurricanes, which caused nearly $2 billion in damages and forced over 90,000 people into emergency storm shelters. Authorities said they provided aid to thousands of families displaced by the storms. 
Portillo said his family received no support from the government in the wake of the hurricanes. His father had already lost his job as a security guard when pandemic-related restrictions devastated the economy and his 14-year-old sister had to abandon her studies as the family sank deeper into poverty.
After being deported by Guatemalan authorities this week, Portillo once again found himself living under the bridge where he and his family sought refuge after their home was destroyed in November's floods. After he said the government threatened to evict them, the family fled again, this time to a relative's home.
""All I wanted to do was find work (abroad) so I could help my family and put my little sister back in school,"" Portillo said. 
North-bound migration has traditionally offered Central American nations an escape to alleviate domestic discontent, but former U.S. President Donald Trump pressured regional governments to crack down on migrant flows.
While President Joe Biden has pledged to ease immigration policies and tackle the roots of the issue, there appeared little prospect of a rapid change how regional governments police migrants, particularly of mass movements like caravans.
Tonatiuh Guillen, former head of Mexico's immigration institute, said ongoing containment meant frustration could boil over.
""It's a pressure cooker,"" said Guillen, who has been critical of the increasing immigration enforcement by the region's militaries.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Governor General Julie Payette, the representative of the country's head of state, Queen Elizabeth, quit on Thursday amid allegations of workplace harassment in an embarrassment for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
The resignation has no immediate implications for the Liberal government. The governor general has a largely ceremonial job such as swearing in governments and formally signing legislation, but can on rare occasions be asked to settle constitutional questions. 
She resigned just hours after senior officials received the results of an independent probe into reports of verbal abuse and bullying by Payette.
""I have come to the conclusion that a new Governor General should be appointed. Canadians deserve stability in these uncertain times,"" Payette said in a statement, adding she was sorry for tensions that had arisen with staff.
She was the first governor general to quit under a cloud. Richard Wagner, chief justice of the Supreme Court, will temporarily take over her duties until she is replaced.
Payette, 57, took office in October 2017 for a five-year term on Trudeau's recommendation. Even after the probe was launched last July, Trudeau defended Payette, saying in September that she was ""an excellent governor general.""
She was formerly the country's chief astronaut and the first Canadian to serve on the International Space Station.
In a brief statement, Trudeau said the resignation meant workplace concerns in the governor general's office could be addressed. He notably did not thank Payette.
Trudeau is an avowed feminist, and Liberal officials said at the time that the appointment would advance the cause of women. Potential candidates for the job are supposed to be vetted by a special committee, a step Trudeau chose to ignore.
""The colossal failure of Ms. Payette's term falls squarely on his shoulders,"" said Don Davies, a legislator for the opposition New Democrats.

""It's not a constitutional crisis. ... There is a system in place to allow for continuity of the role,"" Barbara Messamore, a history professor and constitutional expert at the University of the Fraser Valley, told the CBC.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Police in Moscow on Thursday detained several allies of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, including his spokeswoman, for making calls online to join unauthorised street protests to demand his release.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic, was detained at the weekend and later jailed for alleged parole violations after flying back to Russia for the first time since being poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent. 
He accuses Putin of ordering his murder, which the Kremlin denies. His supporters have called for nationwide protests on Saturday, hoping to press the Kremlin into letting him walk free ahead of parliamentary elections in September.
In Brussels, responding to Navalny's arrest, European Union lawmakers called for the bloc to stop the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to take Russian natural gas to Europe.
Several of Navalny's allies in Russia said police had come to their homes, including that of his spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh, who was later detained for allegedly disobeying police orders and violating protest laws.
""The police have started forcing open the door and are saying: come out, you're coming out on Saturday anyway and we're going to detain you,"" Yarmysh wrote on Twitter before she was detained.
Earlier, Georgy Alburov, another Navalny ally, said he was taken into police custody at a Moscow train station. 
Vladlen Los, a Belarusian lawyer for Navalny's group, said he had been detained, told to leave the country by Monday, and barred from re-entering Russia until November 2023. 
Police also detained Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol, her lawyer said. She had urged people to take part in the protests.
Yarmysh, Alburov and Los said they would be held in custody overnight. Sobol was later released from custody and is set to appear in court on Friday, her lawyer said.
Authorities have said the planned rallies are illegal and that people who make such calls would be held to account. 
Communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said it would seek to fine social media platforms for what it said was illegal content urging minors to take part in illegal protests.
Some prominent Russians - including ice hockey star Artemi Panarin as well as rappers, actors, writers and others - posted messages and videos of support for Navalny on social media. TikTok was flooded with videos promoting the protests.

A student at a Moscow university who asked not to be named told Reuters he and his classmates had been threatened with possible expulsion in a letter if they attend the protests.

Reuters journalists arriving after the blasts saw pools of blood and discarded shoes at the site, a clothing market in Tayaran Square in the centre of the city. Health authorities said at least 110 people had been wounded.
""One (bomber) came, fell to the ground and started complaining 'my stomach is hurting' and he pressed the detonator in his hand. It exploded immediately. People were torn to pieces,"" said a street vendor who did not give his name.
Suicide attacks, once an almost daily occurrence in the Iraqi capital, have halted in recent years since Islamic State fighters were defeated in 2017, part of an overall improvement in security that has brought normal life back to Baghdad.
""Daesh terrorist groups might be standing behind the attacks,"" Civil Defence chief Major General Kadhim Salman told reporters, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State.
A video taken from a rooftop and circulated on social media purported to show the second blast scattering people gathered in the area. Images shared online, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed several dead and wounded.
Thursday's attack took place in the same market that was struck in the last big attack, in January, 2018, when at least 27 people were killed.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi held an urgent meeting with top security commanders to discuss Thursday's attacks, the premier's office said in a brief statement. Iraqi security forces were deployed and key roads blocked to prevent possible further attacks.
Following the urgent meeting, Kadhimi sacked key security and police commanders, deputy interior minister for intelligence affairs, director of counter terrorism and intelligence in the interior ministry and commander of federal police forces, said a military spokesman in a statement. 
Suicide attacks against civilian targets were a near-daily tactic of mainly Sunni Muslim insurgents during the U.S. occupation of Iraq after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, and were later employed by Islamic State, whose fighters swept across a third of the country in 2014.

By 2017 the fighters had been driven from all territory they held, although they have continued to wage a low-level insurgency against Iraqi forces and attack officials mainly in northern areas.

The archipelago nation detained Alex Saab when his plane stopped to refuel in June. He is now fighting extradition to the United States, which says Saab is helping undermine Washington's sanctions on Maduro's government. 
""We look forward to (Saab) now being able to receive the specialist medical attention he needs as well as being able to engage with all his defense, his family as well as access to Venezuela consular officials,"" said Jose-Manuel Monteiro, one of Saab's lawyers, in a statement.
A West African court called the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Court of Justice had granted the house arrest in December.
Venezuela's foreign ministry on Wednesday said the Cape Verde government had not carried out the decision because it refused to recognize ECOWAS' jurisdiction.
At the time of Saab's arrest, Venezuela said he was acting as a special envoy for Maduro's government, whose capacity to import goods has steadily declined as Washington has tightened sanctions meant to force the ruling Socialist Party from office. 
Saab has been repeatedly identified by the State Department as a operator who helps Maduro arrange trade deals of the sort Washington seeks to block through sanctions.
On Tuesday, the Treasury Department sanctioned a group of oil traders and vessels it said had conspired with Saab and others to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in Venezuelan oil.

(Reuters) - A group of prominent attorneys on Thursday asked New York's judiciary to suspend the law license of former President Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani for making false claims in post-election lawsuits and for urging Trump's supporters to engage in ""trial by combat"" shortly before they stormed the U.S. Capitol. 
The letter, spearheaded by the organization Lawyers Defending American Democracy, called for immediate suspension of the license pending an investigation of Giuliani, who served as a federal prosecutor and a New York City mayor before Trump hired him as to be his personal attorney. 
""This complaint is about law, not politics,"" said the letter to the attorney grievance committee of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, First Judicial Department. It was signed by more than 40 lawyers. 
Giuliani did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Attorneys not affiliated with the group, including a lawyer who defends other lawyers from ethics complaints, said the letter could have serious consequences for Giuliani. 
The grievance committee, part of New York state's judiciary, has the power to censure and suspend lawyers and revoke their law licenses.
Giuliani led the legal team that tried to overturn Trump's election defeat but failed to produce any evidence of widespread fraud. The team lost dozens of court cases in battleground states and at the U.S. Supreme Court, and President Joe Biden's victory was confirmed.
Criticisms of Giuliani escalated after the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. Shortly before, Trump told supporters to ""fight like hell,"" and Giuliani urged ""trial by combat.""
The letter to the disciplinary body cited Giuliani's false statements in court and in public about widespread voter fraud, as well as his call for “trial by combat.""
Attorney suspensions and disbarments are very unusual, said Brian Faughnan, a lawyer in Tennessee who defends other lawyers in ethics matters.
But the letter lays out strong evidence against Giuliani, and he may face a public reprimand, said Faughnan.
""If I got a complaint like that on behalf of a client, I would be worried,"" he said.
Attorney disciplinary bodies typically do not publicly announce an investigation, but will reveal any punishments they hand down, Faughnan said.

Libya has been divided since 2014 between rival administrations in the capital Tripoli, in the west, and in the country's east. 
Manoeuvring over the new government has raised fears that powerful figures who stand to lose influence could attempt to sabotage the process. 
The UN in November gathered 75 Libyan participants in a political dialogue in Tunis aimed at setting a roadmap to national elections that they set for late December. 
After weeks of wrangling, the dialogue members this week agreed on rules for selecting a new three-member presidential council and a prime minister to oversee the run-up to the election. 
The UN said on Thursday that dialogue members would vote on candidates for the new government's leadership positions in Switzerland from Feb. 1-5.

U.S. District Judge Judith Levy wrote in the 72-page opinion that the preliminary agreement ""does not resolve all of the Flint water cases"" and that victims are fully able to pursue their own lawsuits and register objections to the settlement. 
The Flint water crisis was one of the country's worst public health crises in recent memory. The case became emblematic of racial inequality in the Unites States as it afflicted a city of about 100,000 people, more than half of whom are African-American.
Flint's troubles began in 2014 after the city switched its water supply to the Flint River from Lake Huron to cut costs. Corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes, contaminating the drinking water and causing an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease.
Former Michigan Governor Rick Snyder, a Republican, was charged last week with two counts of willful neglect in relation to the crisis. Snyder has indicated he plans to fight the charges.
Levy wrote in Thursday's court opinion that she knows many victims are not happy with various aspects of the settlement. She acknowledged that ""there may be no amount of money that would fully recognize the harm the residents of Flint have experienced.""

Levy said victims have until the end of March to register to participate in the settlement.

CIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - Dozens of asylum seekers crowded the U.S. port of entry in the Mexican border city of Ciudad Juarez on Thursday after U.S. President Joe Biden began his term in office by reversing many of former President Trump's hardline immigration policies.
In its first public announcement, Biden's Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday it would end all enrollments in a controversial Trump program - known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) - that since 2019 has forced more than 65,000 asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court hearings, sometimes for months or even years.
The announcement did not specify what will happen to people currently in the program and only said they ""should remain where they are, pending further official information from U.S. government officials.""
Some Cuban and Central American asylum seekers flocked to ports of entry on Thursday morning, many carrying their belongings, hoping to end their waits in dangerous border towns where migrants can face extortion, kidnapping, and rape. 
""I came to the bridge to turn myself in because I'm Cuban and I want to pursue a political asylum case in the United States,"" said Angel Alejandro Segreo, 27.
This time, Segreo and other first-time asylum seekers were turned away because of a public health order implemented in March 2020 at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic that allows U.S. border agents to expel most border crossers for public health reasons. 
Yet, even after being expelled back into Mexico, he and other asylum seekers expressed enthusiasm that their conditions would, sooner or later, improve under the new administration.
    ""I'm happy with the new president of the United States, but I want to see him do what he promised to do,"" Segreo said.
    Gustavo, a Honduran asylum seeker who declined to provide his last name at the advice of his attorney, said he too was ""optimistic.""
    He said he had already spent a year and a half in Tijuana under MPP and that he was willing to keep waiting. 
    ""I'm going to be patient,"" he said. ""It's been very hard to live in Tijuana all this time, but we have a goal and we're not going to give up.""
Mexico's former immigration chief, Tonatiuh Guillen, said in an interview that Biden's steps on his first day in office meant ""the nightmare is over."" 
    More actions that could affect asylum seekers and refugees are due to be announced by the Biden administration on Jan. 29.
Christian Ariel Pereira, a migrant from El Salvador who traveled with his wife and 4-year-old son and has been in Ciudad Juarez four months, said he was hopeful.
""I had faith that he (Biden) was going to win and just as I had faith he was going to win, I also have faith he will fulfill everything he has promised,"" he said.

The driver of the truck was pulled over for not using a seatbelt on a highway in the southern part of Veracruz, the National Guard said in a statement.
After hearing cries for help, officials opened the back of the vehicle to find 128 men, women and children crowded in ""inhuman conditions"" that were inadequate to prevent the spread of COVID-19, according to the statement.
It added that the driver had been arrested. 
The incident occurred days after the latest major U.S.-bound caravan of nearly 8,000 migrants was broken up by officials in Guatemala after it crossed into the country from Honduras.
A Reuters witness who spoke with the migrants traveling on the truck in Veracruz said they were not part of the caravan. 
Thousands of people from Central America have been trying to travel north after back-to-back hurricanes in November displaced more than half a million people in the region, according to data from the International Organization for Migration. 
Many were hoping to reach the U.S. border after Wednesday's inauguration of U.S. President Joe Biden, who acted swiftly on his first day in office to dismantle several of former President Donald Trump's hardline immigration policies. 
Guatemalan security officials, after some clashes with a large group of migrants camped on a highway, returned thousands of people back to Honduras and El Salvador on buses this week.
Some migrants from the caravan said they fled security forces and fanned out into the mountains of Guatemala.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French government is now recommending that people wear surgical masks in public because they offer better protection from COVID-19 transmission than fabric face coverings, Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Thursday.
France already requires masks to be worn in public places, but until now has not made recommendations about the type of masks. French authorities are worried they could be hit by new, more contagious variants of the virus.
""The recommendation that I make to the French people is to no longer use fabric masks,"" Veran told French broadcaster TF1.
Veran also said it was very unlikely that restrictions on ski resorts -- a hotspot for the virus at the start of the pandemic -- would be lifted next month.
That effectively rules out a return to skiing in time for the February school holidays, normally the last peak skiing period of the season.
Veran said that the government could not rule out a tightening of coronavirus restrictions if the situation with virus transmission deteriorates.
""We could be forced to take tougher measures than those that the French people dealt with this autumn... That could go as far as a lockdown if the situation were to require it,"" he said.
France has reported over 71,000 coronavirus-related deaths since the pandemic began. It is now at 35% of its peak infection rate, according to Reuters data, well below its neighbour, Britain, which is at 70%. French schools are still open, and non-essential shops are allowed to trade.

However, French public health officials say they have detected a rise in transmission rates in the past few days and they are also wary of the spread of new, more contagious variants of COVID-19 which are prevalent in other countries.

Meanwhile, the government is under growing pressure over the slow pace of its vaccine rollout. 
In September, Rio's samba schools decided to push back celebrations. Liesa, the independent samba league, did not give a new date for the festival, saying it would depend on a vaccine.

The attack on the trainees from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College on Sept. 26, 2014 sparked widespread protests across the country.
The witness, known as ""Juan,"" said soldiers detained a group of the students, interrogated them at the army base in the town of Iguala and then handed them to a drug gang, according to a copy of his testimony reported by newspaper Reforma. 
Former defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos, recently arrested on U.S. drug charges that were later dropped, long refused to allow investigators access to soldiers at the base over their possible involvement in the massacre.
The witness said members of the Guerreros Unidos gang hacked up some of the students with machetes and took their remains to a crematorium controlled by the gang, while others were dissolved in acid, Reforma reported. 
Evidence was sown at a rubbish dump, the witness said, to support a narrative being pushed by the federal government at the time. 
The witness' testimony is included in the attorney general office's investigation of the case.
Lopez Obrador confirmed Reforma's reporting reflected the testimony in the investigation.
""What Reforma published is in the prosecutor's file. I don't know how they got it, but it's real,"" said Lopez Obrador. He cautioned that the accusations were based on only one witness.

The chief, Omar Garcia Harfuch, at the time worked in Guerrero. On Thursday he ""categorically denied"" the allegations, saying he had nothing to hide.

The CAR army, backed by U.N., Russian and Rwandan troops, has been battling armed groups that are seeking to overturn a Dec. 27 vote in which President Faustin-Archange Touadera was declared the winner.
The country ""is at serious risk of a security and peacebuilding setback,"" envoy Mankeur Ndiaye said in an address to the Security Council.
A substantial increase in the number of peacekeepers would give the mission greater mobility on the ground, Ndiaye said without saying how many more soldiers were needed.
Seven peacekeepers have been killed since the rebels launched their offensive last month. The fighting has forced nearly 60,000 people to flee the country, compounding an already dire refugee crisis. 
Ndiaye said large numbers of CAR troops had deserted due to insufficient training and resources.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A shortage of oxygen tanks in Mexico City and a fourfold rise in prices for the life-saving gas are compounding the coronavirus crisis for the sprawling capital's hard-hit inhabitants.
In the metro area, home to some 22 million people, more than 20 medical oxygen distributors consulted by Reuters this week had no tanks in stock. Lines stretch for hours at the few stores with available inventory.
If buyers do get lucky, the price to refill a 24-hour tank costs around $160, more than 20 times the country's minimum daily wage of about $7 and a four-fold rise since just the end of last year, as demand outstrips supply.
As a result, many people are finding it impossible to buy or rent the vital tanks for relatives suffering from COVID-19.
Eulogio Cruz, a 58-year-old street vendor, often came up empty-handed following frantic searching for oxygen for his sick sister-in-law, who is being treated at home for the highly-contagious respiratory disease.
""We're really worried,"" said an exasperated Cruz, after ticking off a day of long lines, regular disappointment and what he sees as blatant profiteering.
""These prices are outrageous and there's no end in sight.""
Mexico City is the epicenter of a second wave of contagion in the country, with nearly 90% of the capital's COVID-19 hospital beds already full, according to government data. Deaths nationwide have surpassed 1,500 daily, with more than 20,000 new cases registered on Wednesday.
Deaths are expected to reach 150,000 in coming days, behind only the United States, Brazil and India. Those countries have also struggled to maintain sufficient oxygen supply, with Manaus in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) particularly hard hit in recent days.
Cruz ultimately turned to a friend who lent him a tank, but the cost of refilling it forced his sister-in-law to skimp on the amount of oxygen her doctor ordered. And then his friend's brother also came down with COVID-19, and he asked Cruz to return the tank.
Several distributors said that refillable tanks containing 72 hours of oxygen should arrive by the end of the month, but they will cost $990 each to buy.
Ricardo Sheffield, the head of national consumer protection agency PROFECO, said last week that oxygen tanks were available and that prices should be stable.
In December, PROFECO temporarily shuttered 16 oxygen vendors charging prices deemed to be unjustifiably high in a country with the world's fourth-highest coronavirus death toll. 
The capital city's government late last year launched a free refill program for up to 100 of the pressurized cylinders per day in Iztapalapa and Gustavo Madero, both gritty, working-class districts.
""I don't know what we would have done without it,"" said Iztapalapa resident Alejandro Sampedro, whose father came down with COVID-19 a few weeks ago and was unable to find any tanks for sale or rent despite trying 80 medical supply stores.
Without the refill program, ""maybe my dad would already be dead,"" he said, adding that he still has to line up every three days in the cold just before dawn along with dozens of others, or risk losing out.
Elsewhere in the country, the sheer desperation to find scarce oxygen tanks has taken reckless turns.
An armed man in the northwest border state of Sonora stormed a public hospital earlier this week, leaving with seven portable tanks.
No one was hurt, and local security officials later noted that most of the tanks stolen by the man were empty.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. special climate envoy John Kerry and European Union climate policy chief Frans Timmermans on Thursday held their first call under the new U.S. administration, kicking off renewed transatlantic cooperation on tackling global warming. 
After four years without U.S. federal leadership on climate change under former President Donald Trump, the United States and the EU - the world's second and third-largest emitters of greenhouse gases, respectively - are now seeking to combine their diplomatic firepower to convince other big polluters to take urgent action to safeguard the planet.
A European Commission spokesperson said Timmermans had ""discussed our ambitions to work with the U.S. and other partners to raise global ambition at COP26 in Glasgow."" 
The United Nations climate summit in November, known as COP26, serves as a deadline for nearly 200 countries to submit a national plan to curb emissions faster this decade.
The EU is one of only a few large economies to have done so. Globally, countries' current climate pledges would fail to rein in planet-warming emissions fast enough to avert catastrophic temperature increases.
President Joe Biden committed the United States to rejoin the 2015 Paris climate accord on Wednesday - a move that requires the country to this year pledge deeper emissions cuts.
Biden is also expected to convene a summit of leaders from large-emitting countries within the first 100 days of his presidency, as part of a diplomatic push to rally urgent global climate action.

China, the world’s biggest polluter, plans to become carbon neutral by 2060 but has yet to unveil a short-term plan to reduce emissions.

LONDON (Reuters) - The City of London on Thursday approved the removal from its ceremonial Guildhall home of statues of two figures that symbolise the financial sector's historic role in slavery.
The move, voted through by the City's elected representatives, is part of a wider debate over how Britain remembers and represents its history, sparked by the spontaneous toppling of a slave trader's statue in the city of Bristol during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.
Following those protests, the corporation that runs the Square Mile financial district set up a task force on tackling racism, which recommended removing statues of William Beckford and John Cass from the medieval Guildhall.
""The view of members was that removing and re-siting statues linked to slavery is an important milestone in our journey towards a more inclusive and diverse City,"" the City's political leader Catherine McGuinness said.
Cass was a member of parliament and merchant in transatlantic slave trading during the early 1700s. Beckford was two times Lord Mayor of London in the 18th century and had plantations in Jamaica with slaves.
Last summer's turmoil caused the Church of England, the Bank of England, an Oxford University college and other institutions to grapple with what they should do about historical legacies such as monuments to people involved in slavery or colonialism.
That has sparked a backlash from the ruling Conservative Party, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson accusing those wanting to remove statues of engaging in ""a great lie, a distortion of our history"" by seeking to ""photoshop"" the cultural landscape.
On Saturday, the minister for local government, Robert Jenrick, said in a newspaper column he would change the law to require ""proper process"" in order to prevent monuments from being ""removed on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob"".
In London's predominantly white financial sector, the Black Lives Matter protests increased pressure to better reflect the wider population's ethnic diversity.
Britain's financial services and City minister John Glen told a conference on Thursday that the Race at Work Charter launched in 2018 had attracted 50 firms to sign up to commit to tackling barriers.
But Tony Sewell, chair of a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities that is due to report soon, said the focus should be on developing all talent and not on what he described as a ""mini industry"" of diversity and inclusion services.
""I would challenge companies today not to get too worried about this whole idea of doing lots and lots of diversity stuff,"" Sewell said.
""I would ask the harder question. How is their talent being developed? I am fairly cynical about charter sign-ups and tick boxes, which are easy to do,"" Sewell said.

Macron did not say if he was talking about himself, but one of his political opponents said the comments showed the French leader had been stung by criticism of his four years in power.
Addressing a group of students and academics at a Paris university, Macron said in France there was ""an incessant hunt for mistakes. We have become a nation of 66 million prosecutors"".
""That’s not how you face up to crises or move forward. Everyone makes mistakes every day.""
Macron, a 43-year-old former investment banker, came to the presidency in 2017 promising a new way of doing politics. But much of his reform agenda has been bogged down in fights with unions, and dissent has broken out among his own allies.
His handling of the COVID-19 epidemic has divided opinion, with some people saying he has done better than other European leaders, while others in France accuse his administration of incompetence.
According to surveys by pollster Ifop, Macron's approval rating is now at 45%, down from 66% when he took office in May 2017. He faces re-election next year, when his main appointment is likely to be far-right politician Marine le Pen.
Gilbert Collard, a member of Le Pen's party who sits in the European parliament, said Macron had to accept that criticism of the head of state was part of living in a democracy.
""He's been stung,"" by the criticism directed at him, Collard told broadcaster BFMTV. ""I'm worried for the president.""

During five days of fighting, Russia pushed troops into Georgia in support of its allies in the separatist Georgian region of South Ossetia. 
Moscow said it acted to protect civilians from Georgian aggression. Georgia and Western nations said it was an unprovoked land grab.
The Strasbourg-based court ruled that Russia could be held responsible for three episodes that took place after the fighting was largely over.
In one incident, South Ossetian forces allied to Moscow detained 160 civilians, mostly ethnic Georgian women and elderly people, in the basement of the separatist interior ministry for 15 days in indecent conditions, according to the court judgment.
The court also ruled that more than 30 Georgian prisoners of war detained by the separatists were subjected to treatment that amounted to torture, and that Russia and its separatist allies prevented thousands of forcibly displaced ethnic Georgians from returning home.
The ruling opens the way for Russia to be prosecuted in the court over abuses carried out in South Ossetia, and also could establish a legal precedent for Russian accountability in other ex-Soviet breakaway regions where Moscow is the dominant player, including in eastern Ukraine. 
The case was brought by the Georgian government. The deliberations of the court focused on defining the jurisdiction in which the alleged abuses took place. 
The court found that, since Russia was the principal backer of the separatists, the incidents took place in de facto Russian jurisdiction.

Russian government representatives at the court said the Georgian allegations of abuses were false and took place outside Russia's jurisdiction.

KANO, Nigeria (Reuters) - A court in northern Nigeria on Thursday acquitted a minor at an appeal hearing after he had been sentenced to 10 years in prison with menial labour under Islamic law in a conviction that caused a global outcry.
In August, a sharia court in the northern city of Kano handed Omar Farouq the jail term following accusations that he made blasphemous comments in an argument. The judges who acquitted him on Thursday said he was 17 at the time of his sentencing and not 13 as stated in previous hearings.
His initial conviction was condemned by rights groups, the United Nations and the head of Poland's Auschwitz Memorial who said he and others would volunteer to each serve a month of the boy's prison sentence. 
Nigeria is roughly evenly split between a predominantly Muslim north and mainly Christian south. Sharia, or Islamic religious law is applied in 12 of Nigeria's 36 states where sharia courts operate alongside secular ones.
Two judges at the appeal section of the secular high court in Kano on Thursday ruled that Farouq should be acquitted and the case discharged, meaning he cannot be recharged.
They made the ruling, they said, because Farouq was a minor who lacked proper legal representation in the sharia court. 
They also ruled on the appeal lodged against the sharia conviction of Yahaya Aminu Sharif, a man sentenced to death by Kano's Islamic court for allegedly sharing a blasphemous message on WhatsApp. His conviction was quashed but the judges ordered a retrial at the sharia court. 
ALTERED LIVES 
""Their lives will never be the same again,"" said Kola Alapinni, a defence lawyer representing both defendants. He said it would not be safe for Farouq to remain in Kano and Sharif was likely to remain in custody until his retrial was heard.
Protesters in Kano destroyed Sharif's home last year, forcing his family to flee. Farouq's parents disassociated themselves from him due to the shame caused by the case, according to Alapinni, who said the boy's uncle was the only relative to have been in regular contact with the legal team. 
Despite Thursday's rulings by the state court, the cases could be taken to the federal court of appeal if further appeals are lodged. Lawyers for the prosecution declined to comment in response to the rulings. 
The convictions last year sparked a debate about sharia's compatibility with Nigeria's secular constitution.
""It concerns Islamic law and not any other law,"" said businessman Muhammad Salihu, arguing that secular courts should not hear appeals against sharia convictions.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government has cleared commercial exports of COVID-19 vaccines, with the first consignments to be shipped to Brazil and Morocco on Friday, the Indian foreign secretary told Reuters. 
The shots developed by UK-based drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) and Oxford University are being manufactured at the Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest producer of vaccines, which has received orders from countries across the world.
The Indian government had held off exporting doses until it began its own domestic immunisation programme last weekend. Earlier this week, it sent free supplies to neighbouring countries including Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh and Nepal.
Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said commercial supplies of the vaccine would begin from Friday in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment that India's production capacities would be used for all of humanity to fight the pandemic.
""In keeping with this vision, we have responded positively to requests for supply of Indian manufactured vaccines from countries across the globe, starting with our neighbours,"" he said, referring to the free supplies. 
""Supply of commercially contracted quantities will also commence from tomorrow, starting with Brazil and Morocco, followed by South Africa and Saudi Arabia,"" he added. 
Brazil, which has world's second-highest COVID-19 death toll after the United States, has been urging India to send the AstraZeneca vaccine. It has agreed to take 2 million doses from Serum and was ready to send a plane last week to pick them up. 
Morocco, South Africa and Saudi Arabia have also secured supplies from Serum, officials said.

Nearly 43,000 care home residents died of COVID-19 or suspected infection during the March-May first wave of contagion, according to official data. 
At the time, staff reported shortages of basic protective equipment and army units deployed on disinfection missions discovered unattended bodies at several facilities.
The prosecutor's office said nearly half of its investigations related to homicide through a neglect of duty of care, while it was looking into 21 cases of deficiencies in medical treatment.
With Spain reporting record infection numbers on an almost daily basis, it warned that risks still remained across the care home network, despite improvements made in recent months.
""The increase in general contagion is still a risk for residential environments,"" it said in a statement on Thursday, adding that it would continue to closely monitor the situation.
Pre-existing weaknesses, including governance, funding, working conditions, a lack of coordination with primary health care, and a lack of isolation spaces, are still widespread, the report said. 
Prosecutors shelved other cases, most of the time after charges were rolled into other cases or passed to courts, rather than because investigators found no evidence of wrongdoing.
Spain has about 5,500 nursing homes, housing some 400,000 people, according to the European Ageing Network, which represents both individual carers and businesses. 

The heads of both Spain's main care home associations said they needed more information on the investigations before commenting.

BRUSSELS/ANKARA (Reuters) - The European Union and Turkey pressed each other on Thursday to take concrete steps to improve relations long strained by disagreements over energy, migration and Ankara's human rights record.
Turkey, which remains an official candidate for EU membership despite the tensions, is facing the threat of EU economic sanctions over a hydrocarbons dispute with Greece in the eastern Mediterranean, but the mood music between Brussels and Ankara has improved since the new year.
""We have seen an improvement in the overall atmosphere,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said as he welcomed Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu for talks, describing 2020 as complicated.
""Intentions and announcements need to be translated into actions,"" Borrell said.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who will meet Cavusoglu on Friday, also noted ""a more positive atmosphere"", telling reporters by video conference there was ""an opportunity to really make some progress to address the differences"".
The improved tone follows a video conference between Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, on Jan. 9 in which both stressed the importance of the bilateral relationship.
Cavusoglu said he hoped von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the head of the European Council which represents the 27 EU member states, would visit Turkey after an invitation from Erdogan.
""It is of course important for there to be a positive atmosphere in Turkey-EU ties, but in order for this to be sustainable, we must take concrete steps,"" Cavusoglu added.
STRAINED TIES
2020 proved particularly difficult for relations between Turkey and the EU, especially France, with Erdogan expressing publicly his hope that protests in French cities would topple President Emmanuel Macron.
Greece and Cyprus, strongly backed by France, want to punish Turkey for what they see as provocative oil and gas exploration by Turkish vessels in disputed waters, but Germany and Italy are reluctant to go ahead with any sanctions on Ankara.
Turkey has now withdrawn the vessels and is set to restart talks with Greece, although the EU has accused Ankara of playing ""cat and mouse"" in a pattern of provocation and reconciliation. 
EU leaders will decide in March whether to impose sanctions. 
Brussels also accuses Erdogan of undermining the economy, eroding democracy and destroying independent courts and media, leaving Turkey's bid to join the EU further away than ever.
""We remain concerned about the (human rights) situation in Turkey,"" Borrell said on Thursday.
The European Parliament on Thursday backed a resolution calling for the release of Selahattin Demirtas, a leading Kurdish politician jailed in 2016 on terrorism-related charges.
But Turkey remains a big destination for EU trade and investment and also hosts some 4 million Syrian refugees. The EU aims to agree fresh funds for the refugees from 2022 to discourage them from coming into the bloc. 

Ankara wants progress on Turks' right to visa-free travel to the EU, an upgrade of its trade agreement with Europe and recognition of its claims to hydrocarbons off its maritime shelf.

The resolution, which will be voted on at 1530 GMT, is not legally binding but carries political weight.
The European Parliament ""calls on ... the member states to unequivocally recognise the constitutional continuation of the legitimate National Assembly of Venezuela elected in 2015 and the legitimate interim President of Venezuela Juan Guaido"", it says.

The European Parliament is also set to call for further sanctions against the Maduro government, on top of those already imposed, to decry what it views as rights violations and the rupture of democracy.

Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that the bloc still considered Guaido to be opposition leader and a critical figure in the effort to bring about new presidential elections in Venezuela.

TUNIS (Reuters) - The 19-year-old smoking with friends in a poor district of Tunisia's capital had a simple explanation for night-time clashes between youths and police that have shaken the country - he has nothing to lose.
A decade after mass protests toppled Tunisia's long-time president and sparked uprisings across the Middle East, anger is boiling over again amid economic stagnation, the global pandemic and a widening disconnect between people and their leaders.
""There's nothing here ... there's no opportunity. The only government we know is the police car coming to arrest people,"" said Mohammed, surrounded by nodding friends next to walls marked with graffiti.
In the worst political unrest in years, thousands of protesters have marched through cities across the country demanding jobs, dignity and an end to police violence. At night, youths face off with security forces.
Mohammed, who gave only his first name for fear of reprisals, was one of 10 out-of-school and unemployed boys and young men in the alleyway in the Ezzahrouni district, passing around cigarettes, soda bottles and marijuana joints. 
Like the others, his only aspiration was to leave Tunisia to seek his fortune in Europe. Police have said most of the hundreds arrested this week were aged between 15 and 20.
Since Tunisia's 2011 revolution ousted autocratic leader Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, successive governments have struggled with high deficits and demands for state jobs and services.
""If we do not listen to the voice of these angry youths, they will sweep away the whole parliament, government, president - the whole system,"" said Safi Said, an independent lawmaker addressing parliament this week.
The government is one of the weakest since the revolution, backed by a fragile coalition of rival parties after 2019 elections produced a deeply fragmented parliament.
Formed after the COVID-19 pandemic thrust Tunisia's economy further into crisis, it is trying to slow a surge in infections without keeping the working poor from their jobs or widening the yawning fiscal deficit.
CLASHES
Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, speaking on television on Tuesday, said he understood the economic frustration that lay behind the unrest but vowed to confront any street violence.
Mohammed said he had not listened to the prime minister's speech and did not know the difference between Tunisia's prime minister and president.
The longest job he has held since leaving school four years ago was in a cafe for a month. His parents give him 5 dinar ($1.50) most mornings to get by. None of his five older siblings work.
He walks through the neighbourhood with friends, rifling through barrows of second-hand clothing imported from abroad looking for items he might be able to sell on for more money.
""All I hope for every day is to find some pot and some beer and maybe get out of this world for a while,"" he said.
His friends, including an 11-year-old who quit school, all wanted to leave Tunisia.
Omar, a 17-year-old with a diploma as a barber, worked in a hair salon for a while but stopped because he was not paid. His father is disabled and he said the family skipped breakfast for want of money.
He has gone to the port several times to stow away on a ship for Europe, but he has been caught, beaten and detained, he said. He can't afford to pay professional smugglers to take him abroad as a rising number of Tunisians are doing.
Ayman, who said he was 16, scowled and smoked, saying he took part in the clashes because he wanted to hurt the police.
""The police insult us,"" he said, adding that he had been arrested three times for theft and drug possession. ""We insult them by throwing stones.""

Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, leader of the small Italia Viva party that triggered the crisis by quitting the ruling coalition, has said it will vote against the government rather than abstain as it did in the confidence vote. 
Without an outright majority, Conte will be constantly vulnerable and will face a struggle to push through any contentious legislation as he tries to handle the coronavirus pandemic and an economic crisis.
Italy needs to present a convincing policy agenda to the European Commission, the European Union's executive, to receive over 200 billion euros ($242.94 billion) from the bloc's economic Recovery Fund.
""In private conversations, many people say they would like to join us but they need time. We are not going to spend a month negotiating, they have to decide,"" a senator who is involved in talks with the opposition, but asked not to be named, told Reuters.
DESPERATELY SEEKING SENATORS 
Conte won Tuesday's vote in the 321-seat Senate by 156-140, leaving him five short of an outright majority. 
The tally included three unelected life senators who seldom attend sessions, so he needs at least eight more to be able to govern with confidence.
Two Italia Viva senators have suggested they could move back to the majority. There have been few expressions of interest from senators in other centrist and centre-right parties.
The co-ruling Democratic Party believes a group supporting the government must emerge in parliament ""within the next few days"", a party source said, if Conte is to avoid tripping up in parliament and an election being called.
President Sergio Mattarella, the supreme arbiter of Italian politics, told Conte on Wednesday he needs to secure the support of a stable parliamentary group rather than various individual senators, a source familiar with the talks said.
If Conte succeeds, the group could potentially become the embryo of his own party. 
A new political force led by Conte, Italy's most popular politician, could win about 16% of voter support, making it the second largest after the right-wing League, a survey this week by the SWG polling agency showed.

QIXIA, China (Reuters) - Workers trapped in a gold mine in China since Jan. 10 may have to wait another 15 days before they can be rescued because of a blockage on their intended escape route, officials said on Thursday.
A total of 22 workers were trapped underground after an explosion at the Hushan mine in Qixia, a major gold-producing region under the administration of Yantai in Shandong province on the northeast coast. 
One is confirmed to have died, while 11 are known to be alive. The remaining 10 are missing.
Rescuers were drilling new shafts on Thursday to reach 10 of the men in the middle section of the mine, more than 600 metres from the entrance, who have been sent food and medical supplies. Another survivor has been found in a different section.
The shafts include one 711-mm (28-inch) diameter shaft that rescuers hope to use to bring the survivors to safety.
However, at least another 15 days may be needed to clear obstacles, Gong Haitao, deputy head of Yantai's propaganda department, told a news conference at the headquarters of the rescue operation.
A ""severe blockage"" 350 metres down was much worse than feared, officials said, adding that it was about 100 metres thick and weights some 70 tonnes.
Thick smog, reeking of chemicals, hung over the muddy road leading up to the mine site and a row of ambulances on standby in a carpark, reducing visibility to a few hundred metres.
Police have sealed off the road to the mine, cutting through muddy apple orchards and warehouses, to ensure rescue efforts are not hampered. Health workers in white protective gear took temperatures beside mounded earth and tents as part of COVID-19 precautions. 
About 600 people are involved in the rescue, with as many as 25 ambulances waiting at the scene, as well as neurosurgeons, trauma specialists and psychologists.
A Reuters team saw fire trucks and cars coming and going through a checkpoint on an approach road. 
China's mines are among the world's deadliest. It has recorded 573 mine-related deaths in 2020, according to the National Mine Safety Administration.

LISBON (Reuters) - Overwhelmed by record numbers of COVID-19 patients, doctors in Portuguese hospitals say they are exhausted and in despair.
The government was preparing to shut all schools, kindergartens and universities from Friday to try to halt the surge in coronavirus cases, state news agency Lusa reported on Thursday.
""We do not have enough human resources,"" said Guida da Ponte, deputy head of a doctors' union near Lisbon, adding while there was a lack of intensive-care beds, more could be set up ""but we don't have the professionals.""
""Doctors are desperate. The word really is 'despair'.""
Western Europe's poorest country coped well in the first wave of the pandemic last year but has been swamped in recent weeks by a faster-spreading variant of the virus, registering the world's highest infection and death rates.
Ambulances have been queuing outside hospitals, waiting for beds to become available. An elderly man died in an ambulance after waiting inside the vehicle for three hours on Tuesday in the town of Portalegre. 
A government spokeswoman said the cabinet was discussing new measures to tackle the pandemic but declined to give details.
Without waiting for the government announcement, some local officials were urging parents to keep their children at home.
""If you have the chance, don't let your children go to school. Time is essential in controlling the effects of a catastrophe,"" Carlos Carreiras, the mayor of Cascais near Lisbon, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
SCHOOL SHUTDOWN
Ricardo Mexia, head of the association of public healthcare doctors, said authorities had failed to prepare for the new surge in infections after relaxing restrictions for the year-end holidays.
""The decision to close schools is coming too late, but it is important to reduce contagion,"" he said.
""We don't have the means to conduct epidemiological surveys, we haven't recruited enough people, we haven't trained people... I fear the numbers will get even worse.""
Under a lockdown that started last week, all non-essential services are shut and people urged to stay home, but the government has so far kept schools open, despite calls to shut them from parents' groups, students and opposition parties.
""It is not good to come to classes as there are high-risk groups we could infect,"" said Frederico Nunes, 20, a university student. ""I think it's annoying because this could have been avoided if the government had adopted online classes.""
The government has acknowledged that holiday-time contagion played a role, but blamed the increase in cases mostly on the more contagious variant of the virus first detected in Britain, which is spreading rapidly across Portugal.
The daily death toll reached a record high of 221 on Thursday, up from 219 the day before, bringing the total to 9,686 fatalities since the start of the pandemic, health authority DGS said.
The country of 10 million people reported 13,544 infections over the last 24 hours, below Wednesday's record of 14,647.
Portugal has the world's highest rolling average of new cases, at 1,044 per million inhabitants over the last seven days, according to data tracker ourworldindata.org.
Around 20% of new COVID-19 cases being reported are of the more transmissible variant and that number could reach 60% as early as next week, Health Minister Marta Temido told broadcaster RTP on Wednesday.

Rights groups say press freedom has eroded since a November war between federal troops and forces loyal to the former ruling party of Tigray, which lost Mekelle at the end of that month.
Dawit Kebede, who worked for Tigray regional state TV, was shot on Tuesday night while in a car with friends, one aid worker said. ""Both were shot in their head and their bodies were found in a car they were driving,"" said the worker, who asked not to be named.
Their bodies were found on Wednesday by people who were going to church and called the Red Cross. Dawit's friend was identified as Bereket Berhe, whom the Addis Standard newspaper said was the brother of one of Dawit's colleagues.
Tigray is under a state of emergency and in Mekelle there is a nightly curfew from 7 p.m.
Both were killed at around 7.30 p.m., one Mekelle resident told Reuters. ""I attended their funeral, both were buried in Mekelle on Wednesday,"" the resident said.
The motive of the killing was unclear.
Kahsay Biru, director of the Tigray Mass Media Agency which is the umbrella body for the broadcaster where Dawit worked, said police had briefly detained Dawit on Friday and asked him to report to them on Monday. 
The agency is run by the interim administration of Tigray, which was appointed by the federal government. 
""They asked him about our institution, and how they were reporting during the conflict,"" Kahsay told Reuters.
Mekelle mayor Ataklti Haileselassie and Mulu Nega, the new head of Tigray, did not reply to phone calls or texts seeking comments on the killings. 
Media watchdogs have reported the arrest of at least 13 journalists in Ethiopia last year, seven of them in November when fighting erupted in Tigray.
Ethiopian media has a wide spectrum of views, from state-run and affiliated media to independent publications to outlets affiliated with political opposition or even armed groups.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian police arrested 50 people on Thursday and placed a prominent centrist politician under investigation in a crackdown on the 'Ndrangheta mafia that prosecutors say lays bare its efforts to launder cash and buy influence.
The 'Ndrangheta is based in the southern region of Calabria, the toe of Italy's boot, and has surpassed Sicily's more famous Cosa Nostra to become the most powerful mafia group in the country -- and one of the largest crime gangs in the world.
""This investigation makes clear what we have been saying for decades. The 'Ndrangheta shoots less and has more and more ties with business and politics,"" said prosecutor Nicola Gratteri, who last week launched one of Italy's biggest mob trials.
Among those placed under investigation was Lorenzo Cesa, head of the small UDC party, who was in the national spotlight last week after he rejected overtures from Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to join the ruling coalition, which has lost its absolute majority in parliament.
Gratteri said Cesa was suspected of offering to procure contracts for the 'Ndrangheta in return for favours.
Cesa, who is a member of the European Parliament representing southern Italy, denied the accusation, but said he would resign as head of the UDC ""given this particular moment our country is going through"".
It was not immediately clear if his departure would lead to a rethink within the UDC over Conte's request for backing.
The police in Calabria said they carried out more than 250,000 phone taps and secret recordings which helped show how the 'Ndrangheta had used an array of front companies to launder money and generate false invoices for tax scams. 
Warehouses were rented, but left empty, and trucks sent in for simulated offloading and loading operations, the police said.
Gratteri said the lynchpin was a local man who had close ties with police, politicians, businessmen and various 'Ndrangheta clan. He was detained and it was not immediately possible to obtain comment from him.
""During the search of his house, (police) found hundreds of millions in cash which they have not yet finished counting, dozens of Rolexes and luxury cars,"" Gratteri told reporters.
The trial that began last week in Calabria is of 355 suspected 'Ndrangheta gangsters and their white-collar associates. 
The last time Italy tried hundreds of alleged mafiosi simultaneously was in 1986 in Sicily in a case that represented a turning point in the fight against Cosa Nostra, marking the beginning of that group's sharp decline.

LISBON (Reuters) - Ana Gameiro, her husband and son all tested positive for the coronavirus last week amid a surge of infections across Portugal, forcing them to self-quarantine before a presidential election this Sunday that they do not want to miss.
To the family's relief, volunteers from their local council in Cascais near Lisbon stepped in to help, collecting their ballots straight from their doorstep. 
""Even at home voting is a right we all have,"" Gameiro told Reuters after handing in her vote to two volunteers wearing full-body protective suits. ""This way is much easier."" 
Allowing those in quarantine to vote at home was one of the the solutions Portuguese authorities came up with to be able to hold the Jan. 24 election during a lockdown aimed at reining in record daily infections and deaths from the virus.
Still, experts fear the presidential election will have a record low turnout due to the pandemic. President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of the centre-right Social Democratic Party is expected to comfortably win a second term, although the vote is also likely to show a rising far right.
Portugal's president is a largely ceremonial figure but he plays an important role at times of uncertainty.
Some 13,000 people had signed up to vote from home across Portugal. On Tuesday and Wednesday, teams knocked on their doors, verified their identity, provided ballots and gave them privacy to vote. Teams also visited nursing homes to gather votes from elderly residents.
Voters placed their ballots inside an envelope and then the teams put it inside another envelope. They will then be kept in a box for a few days before it is safe to count the ballots.
""Amid this pandemic, this chaos, we wanted to be part of the solution,"" said 46-year-old Miguel Arrobas, a Cascais town hall official and one of the volunteers.
The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, he said. 
""If there are elections, we have to think of people who at this moment cannot go to the polls...I felt like I had to help solve this issue,"" said volunteer Sofia Mascarenhas. 
But many voters have complained they were not able to sign up for the service online, while others said the Jan. 17 registration deadline was too tight. Those who went into quarantine after Jan. 14 were unable to register. 
Opposition party Left Bloc said the issues must be addressed, saying voters do not get to choose the ""day and time when they unfortunately catch the virus"".
Portugal's daily COVID-19 cases rose 40% on Wednesday from the day before to a record 14,647, bringing the total number of infections to 581,605 since the start of the pandemic. The death toll stands at 9,465 as of Thursday.

ZAGREB (Reuters) - Besides fighting COVID-19, Croats learnt last year how nature could show its brutal face as two devastating earthquakes left them struggling to repair their homes and living in fear of further shakes.
In March, one person was killed in a 5.3 magnitude quake that rattled Zagreb. Seven people lost their lives in a 6.4 magnitude quake that hit Croatia in December with the epicentre some 50 km (30 miles) southeast of the capital.
The earthquakes caused huge material damage that is still being assessed. Croats are having to get used to continuing aftershocks and are facing problems in funding the reconstruction of their homes.
Dragica Vrataric had not managed to fully repair her damaged flat in central Zagreb from the first quake when the second one made the situation even more desperate.
The authorities have promised help, but the complex bureaucratic procedures to get financing to repair the roof and chimneys left her building without a gas supply, heating and hot water for almost a year. The cold weather that hit Croatia this month have not helped.
""It is all very stressful. We must participate in financing repair works with 20%, but there is an excessive paperwork to get funds. Now even a smaller earthquake could cause further damage. We cannot wait for so long,"" she said.
As seismologists warn the aftershocks could be felt for months, a key problem is that many houses are too old.
""We must focus on building earthquake-resistant structures as a preventive measure. Most of our cities and villages have buildings whose construction is not like that,"" said Kresimir Kuk from the state seismological institute.
Funding is not the only problem which holds back the pace of reconstruction. Relative poverty in comparison with more affluent European Union peers and lack of knowledge about financial matters mean that too many buildings are not insured against earthquake damage.
About 90% of Croats live in the property they own, but less than 25% have earthquake insurance.
""A demand for such insurance after the March earthquake has risen, but not to an extent we would have expected. Financial and insurance literacy need improving,"" said Lukas Oliver Pavic from Allianz (DE:ALVG), a leading insurer.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A banned Thai opposition politician, who is facing a criminal complaint of defaming the monarchy, defended on Thursday his criticism of the government's coronavirus vaccine strategy that relies on a company owned by King Maha Vajiralongkorn. 
Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit this week accused the government of mishandling the vaccine campaign, saying it was too reliant on Siam Bioscience and will be slow to protect the public because of its failure to negotiate multiple deals.
The Thai company is owned by the Crown Property Bureau, which manages tens of billions of dollars in investment under the king's personal control. 
Siam Bioscience, which received a 600 million baht ($20 million) government subsidy to develop its production capacity, agreed in October to manufacture AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine and supply it domestically and across Southeast Asia. 
Thanathorn had alleged the AstraZeneca deal lacked transparency and Siam Bioscience was given an unfair advantage over other companies. 
On Wednesday, the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha lodged a criminal complaint against Thanathorn for his criticism, accusing him of royal insult that is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
Thanathorn denied making allegations of the king's involvement in the vaccine deal and said the government's complaint was politically motivated to silence him. 
""I questioned whether the scheme benefited one single company or not. It just happened that the shareholder of the company is the king himself,"" he told Reuters in an interview. 
The government has ordered 61 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, and 2 million doses of Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac. Thailand has so far recorded just 12,795 infections and 71 deaths from COVID-19. 
Both AstraZeneca and Siam Bioscience declined to comment on Thanathorn's allegations. 
A government spokeswoman, Ratchada Dhanadirek, has denied the prosecution was politically motivated. 
Thanathorn was banned from politics for 10 years after a court dissolved his Future Forward Party last year over loans deemed illegal. 
The party won support among younger voters in a 2019 election, coming third, with a campaign that focused on opposition to military influence over politics.
The government said the election was free and fair but opposition parties say it was designed to ensure former junta leader Prayuth remained in power.

Britain, an EU member for 46 years, voted to quit in 2016 and completed its tortuous journey out of the bloc on Dec. 31, when Brexit fully took effect.
The BBC reported that the Foreign Office was refusing to grant the same diplomatic status and privileges to EU ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida and his team as it gives to envoys of countries, on the basis that the EU is not a nation state.
The Foreign Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The European Commission, the 27-member bloc's executive body, said the EU's 143 delegations around the world had all been granted a status equivalent to that of diplomatic missions of states, and Britain was well aware of the fact.
""Granting reciprocal treatment based on the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations is standard practice between equal partners and we are confident that we can clear this issue with our friends in London in a satisfactory manner,"" said Peter Stano, the commission's spokesman for foreign affairs.
Stano added that when Britain was still an EU member, it had been supportive of the diplomatic status of EU delegations.
""Nothing has changed since the UK's exit from the European Union to justify any change in stance on the UK's part,"" he said.
The BBC report quoted the Foreign Office in London as saying: ""Engagement continues with the EU on the long-term arrangements for the EU delegation to the UK.""
The report said Britain was reluctant to grant full status to EU diplomats in London because it did not want to set a precedent in the eyes of other international organisations.
The EU argues it is not a typical international organisation.

""It has been conferred substantial competences by its member states, has the power to adopt legislation binding on its member states, has its own decision-making institutions and its own system of judicial control, and has established a common currency,"" Stano said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China struck an optimistic tone toward President Joe Biden's new administration on Thursday, saying ""kind angels can triumph over evil forces"" and playing down early irritants as the result of an atmosphere poisoned by Donald Trump's term in office. 
Bilateral relations worsened dramatically during Trump's tenure. Biden, who took office on Wednesday, is expected to maintain pressure on Beijing but with a more traditional and multilateral approach.
""In the past years, the Trump administration, especially (former Secretary of State Mike) Pompeo, has laid too many mines that need to be removed, burned too many bridges that need to be rebuilt, damaged too many roads that need to be repaired,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said.
""I believe if both countries put in the effort, the kind angels can triumph over evil forces,"" she told a daily briefing on Thursday, using a phrase that was embraced by state media.
Taiwan's de facto ambassador to Washington attended Biden's inauguration with an official invitation, a first that indicated that the new president's administration would continue with Trump's increased support for the democratic island that Beijing claims as part of China.
Also on Wednesday, the new Biden administration criticized China's move to impose sanctions on former Trump administration officials including Pompeo - minutes after Biden was sworn in - as ""unproductive and cynical"".
Asked about both, Hua defended the sanctions and reaffirmed China's opposition to any official contact between the United States and Taiwan. She said China would fight back against any moves that undermine its sovereignty or interests.
But Hua, who said she had watched the inauguration on CNN, also repeatedly urged cooperation and understanding.
""President Biden also mentioned in his inauguration speech that Americans have much to heal, much to restore. This is exactly what China-U.S. relations need,"" she said.
Many commenting on Chinese social media on Thursday said they hoped that Biden's inauguration would signal an improvement in bilateral ties. Others were less optimistic, fearing Trump's tough stance on China would persist into the new administration. 
""No matter how well China does they always look at Chinese people with bias. So even though Biden beat Trump, it will still have the same effect,"" Liu Rui, 32, told Reuters on the streets on Beijing on Thursday.
Some lamented Trump's exit, saying the sparring between the two countries had helped advance China's agenda. 
""I actually wish Trump could continue his presidency,” said a 78-year-old man with the surname Liu. ""Why? So that it will be easier for China to surpass the United States""

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Tokyo court rejected on Thursday a lawsuit by Japanese living in Europe who sought to retain their nationality even after taking foreign citizenship, instead of losing it automatically, as happens now.
Japan has been negative about dual citizenship, requiring citizens with more than a single nationality to choose one, even though more nations in recent decades have allowed dual citizenship, or turned a blind eye to it.
""I had to lose my Japanese citizenship just before I went to study in university in Japan,"" said one of the plaintiffs, Yuki Shiraishi, who had lived in Switzerland, where her parents had migrated.
""I felt a big sense of loss when I saw holes on my Japanese passport,"" added Shiraishi, who joined the suit hoping Japan would grant dual citizenship. 
The lawyers pursuing the case said the plaintiffs plan to appeal against Thursday's decision.
The government has said in the past that dual nationality could complicate matters of taxation and diplomatic protection and is not in line with the concept of a sovereign state. 
But about 900,000 people are estimated to hold dual citizenship in Japan today, including naturalised citizens and the offspring of marriages contracted with foreigners. 
Although required by law to renounce their foreign nationality or declare that they will, Japan has never enforced the rule, and legal ambiguity forces many of them to keep silent.
Conservatives in Japan are largely opposed to dual citizenship, however.
""First of all, why do you even want to have dual nationality?"" asked one Twitter user. Another wrote it was selfish for people to want a foreign passport while holding on to Japanese citizenship. 
Against this backdrop, the plaintiff's lawyers have taken care to target a part of the law that forces Japanese to lose citizenship, rather than directly tackling the issue of dual nationality.
The plaintiffs say the unfair treatment makes the law unconstitutional, by forcing only Japanese nationals gaining foreign citizenship abroad to follow the rule on dual nationality, while ambiguity cloaks those at home. 
Apart from infringing individual rights, they said, the current law hurt the national interest by causing the loss of talented people who live abroad, especially as ageing shrinks the domestic population rapidly.
""It's not reflective of how international the world has become – it’s holding Japan back in a big way,"" said Hannah Ogahara, a British national living in Tokyo, the capital, who gave up Japanese citizenship a few years ago.
She said she believed the government wanted to keep a clear demarcation of those with Japanese nationality, rather than blurring the line by allowing dual citizenship.

People dressed in black and with their faces covered broke windows and the glass door at the Democratic Party of Oregon business office in Portland, spray-painting an anarchist symbol over the party sign, video posted on social media showed.
""We don't want Biden. We want revenge for police murders, imperialist wars, and fascist massacres,"" read a banner they marched under.
The new Democratic president was sworn in on Wednesday, urging unity and restoration after Republican Donald Trump's divisive tenure.
Portland has been the scene of unrest for months, with civil rights, anarchist and anti-fascist protesters scuffling with police and occasionally with right-wing militias and Trump supporters.
The protests began in the summer as part of nationwide demonstrations against racism and police brutality following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in Minneapolis in May after police pinned his neck to the ground for nearly nine minutes.
Eight people were arrested in Portland on suspicion of offenses including rioting and reckless burning, while two people were arrested in Seattle, one for assault and another for property damage, police said.
Before descending on the Democratic Party office, some protesters from a group of about 150 scuffled with police on bicycles, police said in a statement. 

In Seattle, police said multiple sites had been vandalized and posted pictures of the damage, including what appeared to be of an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Go store.

Ramil Shamsutdinov opened fire on servicemen at the base in the far eastern region of Zabaikalsk on Oct. 25 last year. He was detained shortly after the incident and admitted he had killed the eight. 
The defence will decide whether to appeal once it has seen the court's reasoning, the RIA news agency reported.
The case is embarrassing for the military, which has been revamped in recent years at great cost and says it has stamped out the Soviet-era problem of hazing - the bullying of conscripts by older soldiers.
A jury in the Chita region had said Shamsutdinov deserved a relatively lenient sentence, RIA reported. 
His defence team said he was a victim of bullying. Shamsutdinov said in an open letter circulated by his lawyer on social media that he regretted he had been unable to restrain himself but he could not take any more mistreatment after his life was made ""hell"".
In a separate trial in March, a court sentenced one of Shamsutdinov's fellow servicemen to a suspended two-year sentence for beating soldiers, including Shamsutdinov, whom he once kicked, RIA reported.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 11:40PM ET</span>",Wanted: Communist Party leadership to keep Vietnam in sweet spot amid U.S.-China tensions,"By Khanh Vu and Phuong Nguyen
HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gathers for a congress next week that will help shape the country's global role for the next five years, selecting new leaders and setting policy as tensions bubble with Beijing and Joe Biden settles in at the White House.
The Communist Party's 13th Congress, from Jan. 25 to Feb. 2, will cement leadership looking to leverage Vietnam's economic success to bolster legitimacy. Key to that will be the challenge of balancing relations with China and the United States, for which Vietnam has become an important strategic partner, in a world economy that's been dislodged from previous certainties.
Buoyed by the redirection of global trade in its favour because of a U.S.-China row, Vietnam is steadily growing into one of the world's most important tech manufacturing hubs, as well as a centre for garment-making, in an economy on track to recover faster than most after the coronavirus pandemic.
""U.S.-China strategic competition will continue to destabilise the regional geo-strategic and economic environment over the next five years,"" said Le Hong Hiep, of the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.
""This is a major challenge for Vietnam given that the Vietnamese economy is very open and highly dependent on international trade and foreign investment,"" he added.
Vietnam's annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 6.0% over the past five years, and still expanded 2.9% in 2020 despite the pandemic that crushed economies elsewhere: Vietnam has been successful in containing the coronavirus so far with strict quarantine, testing and tracing measures.
With just over 1,500 infections and 35 deaths in total, Vietnam - one of the last five Communist-ruled countries in the world besides China, Cuba, Laos and North Korea - has seen its economy outstrip much of Asia in the past year, and is already eyeing average GDP growth of 7.0% over the next five years.
""Vietnam's leaders will have to learn how to minimise negative impacts and take advantage of the opportunities, especially the trade and investment diversion from China,"" said Hiep.
U.S. TRADE TENSIONS
The main candidates for the new positions to be determined at the congress are all widely known in Hanoi's political circles, but were officially declared top secret in December to discourage potentially critical debate. The Communist Party retains tight control of media and tolerates little criticism.
Vietnam officially has four 'pillars' of leadership: the Party chief; the state president; the prime minister and the National Assembly Chair.
While a 2016 power struggle and subsequent crackdown on corruption in government has deepened factional fault lines across Party ranks, most analysts expect continuity in Vietnam's economic, domestic and foreign policy-making after the congress.
Bitter enemies during the U.S.-Vietnam War, Hanoi and Washington have enjoyed significantly warmer relations in recent years, but there have been trade tensions of late.
While the shift in global supply chains caused by former U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war with China has benefited Vietnamese exporters, the incoming Party leadership must contend with likely increased scrutiny from the United States - and new leadership in the White House.
Its trade deficit with Vietnam widening significantly and rapidly, the United States under the Trump administration labelled Vietnam a currency manipulator late last year, raising the prospect of U.S. tariffs on Vietnamese goods. The trade gap widened to $63 billion in 2020 from $47 billion in 2019.
The U.S. Trade Representative said earlier this month Vietnam's actions to push down the value of its currency were ""unreasonable"" and restricted U.S. commerce, but did not take immediate action to impose punitive tariffs - leaving the decision in the hands of Biden administration.
""Vietnam will need to maintain dialogue with the U.S. for better understanding of the Biden administration, and review sincerely its trade and monetary policies and practices,"" said Ha Hoang Hop, also of the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute. 
TROUBLED WATERS
Domestically, Vietnamese leaders will also have to grapple with one of the most rapidly ageing societies in Asia and the reform of an outdated higher education system that has left local highly-skilled labour in short supply.
The other principal external challenge, observers say, will be finding ways to deal with China's increasing aggressiveness in claiming vast, potentially energy-rich, swathes of the South China Sea which overlap with Vietnam's exclusive economic zone.
""The outlook for the security of the South China Sea would be rather pessimistic this year,"" said Ha Hoang Hop. ""Vietnam will have to take more vigilance and prepare to respond to foreign hostile forces.""
However, fellow observer Hiep said, Vietnamese leaders are also acutely aware of China's importance to Vietnam's security and economic well-being, prompting Vietnam to ""try to maintain its balance between the two great powers"".
Though Vietnam and China have for years been embroiled in a dispute over the South China Sea, China remains the largest source of materials and equipment for Vietnam's thriving manufacturing industry.
Hop said other challenges for the next five-year leadership team include reforms needed to implement newly inked international free trade agreements and a more comprehensive and proactive foreign policy.

Strengthening Vietnam's national defences is also on the agenda, as is tackling issues surrounding the development of the Mekong river - another increasingly tense battleground with Beijing - and keeping the guard up against COVID-19 by vaccinating the population.

1460,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 09:25PM ET</span>",Nepal to turn Everest trash into art to highlight mountain’s garbage blight,"By Gopal Sharma
KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Trash collected from Mount Everest is set to be transformed into art and displayed in a nearby gallery, to highlight the need to save the world's tallest mountain from turning into a dumping site.
Used oxygen bottles, torn tents, ropes, broken ladders, cans and plastic wrappers discarded by climbers and trekkers litter the 8,848.86 metre (29,032 feet) tall peak and the surrounding areas.
Tommy Gustafsson, project director and a co-founder of the Sagarmatha Next Centre - a visitors’ information centre and waste up-cycling facility - said foreign and local artists will be engaged in creating artwork from waste materials and train locals to turn trash into treasures. 
“We want to showcase how you can transform solid waste to precious pieces of art … and generate employment and income,” Gustafsson told Reuters.
“We hope to change the people’s perceptions about the garbage and manage it,” he said.
The Centre is located at an altitude of 3,780 metres at Syangboche on the main trail to Everest base camp, two days' walk from Lukla, the gateway to the mountain.
It is due for “soft opening” to locals in the spring as the number of visitors could be limited this year due to coronavirus pandemic restrictions, Gustafsson said.
Products and artwork will be displayed to raise environmental awareness, or sold as souvenirs with the proceeds going to conservation of the region, he said.
Trash brought down from the mountain or collected from households and tea houses along the trail is handled and segregated by a local environmental group, the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, but the task in a remote region that has no roads is a huge challenge. 
Garbage is dumped or burned in open pits, causing air and water pollution as well as contamination of soil.
Phinjo Sherpa, of the Eco Himal group involved in the scheme, said under a “carry me back” initiative, each returning tourist and guide will be requested to take a bag containing one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of garbage back to Lukla airport, from where the trash will be airlifted to Kathmandu.
In 2019, more than 60,000 trekkers, climbers and guides visited the area.
“We can manage a huge amount of garbage if we involve the visitors,” Sherpa said.
Everest was first climbed by New Zealander Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953. 

Nearly 4,000 people have since made 6,553 ascents from the Nepali side of the mountain, which can also be climbed from the Tibetan side in China, according to the Himalayan Data base.

A total of 22 workers were trapped underground in the Hushan gold mine on the outskirts of Yantai, on China's eastern coast, following the Jan. 10. blast. Rescuers have managed to deliver supplies to 11 workers.
One of the workers, who was in a coma after sustaining a head injury during the explosion, has been declared dead after the miner no longer showed any vital signs, Xinhua reported on Thursday. Medical personnel had sent medicines to the miners and instructed them to offer treatment, but his condition did not improve, it added. 
Eight others are in good health, while two are unwell, Shandong's official Qilu Daily newspaper said, citing the rescue headquarters. One more worker who survived is in another section of the mine and believed to be injured, while the whereabouts of the remaining 10 are unclear, it added.
China has deployed 16 professional rescue teams and dozens of medical personnel to try to save the miners. 
Song Xicheng, the medical rescue team leader, told reporters that more than 80 medical personnel were on standby, including nutritionists, neurosurgeons, trauma specialists and psychologists. 
The operation involves drilling 10 channels, with one 711 mm-(2.33-foot)-wide hole - intended to serve as an escape route - wide enough to lift out the miners, the People's Daily said. Rescuers could not say when that hole would be finished but admitted they were in a race against time.
An air ventilation shaft that rescuers also want to use to pull the miners to safety has been cleared to a depth of 350 metres (1,148 feet), the report said. The miners were working at a depth of more than 600 metres (1,980 feet) at the time of the explosion.

A channel previously used to send down supplies has been replaced because water inside was posing a threat to those underground, while another hole is being drilled to search for more signs of life, Beijing Evening News reported.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 07:55PM ET</span>",U.N. aid coordinator halts Venezuela cash transfer programs,"CARACAS (Reuters) - The United Nations Office for Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs said on Wednesday it has halted programs in Venezuela that provide cash transfers to the poor via local nonprofit organizations. 
The U.N. office known as OCHA is asking the government of President Nicolas Maduro to establish clear rules regarding cash transfers. 
""We're working with pertinent authorities so that the (cash transfer programs) are in line with the country's financial/banking regulatory framework with the aim of reactivating them, guaranteeing the safety of humanitarian workers and continuing to support ... vulnerable people,"" OCHA said in an email.
It added that the suspension does not affect other humanitarian activities in its portfolio, and that it is seeking to provide other types of benefits to those who have been receiving cash transfers.
Venezuela's information ministry did not reply to requests for comment.
The decision follows Venezuela's detention of five members of HIV-prevention organization Blue Positive who now face charges including criminal association and money laundering, according to local media reports.
Blue Positive was not part of the OCHA cash transfer programs, according to the sources. 
But the detentions followed a spate of police raids on nonprofit organizations, which the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights described as ""disconcerting"" in a statement earlier this month that called on Venezuela to stop harassing aid workers.
In its 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan, OCHA said it expected to provide $57.8 million to 32 Venezuelan organizations for distribution via cash transfers, seeking to provide relief for the country's ongoing humanitarian and economic crises.
Relief organizations worldwide are moving toward cash transfers to help poor citizens meet basic needs such as acquiring food while cutting costs associated with delivering supplies themselves.
But Maduro's government has been suspicious of foreign aid. 
Opposition leader Juan Guaido last year created a program that made several monthly deposits of $100 to a group of health workers using funds seized in the United States, angering ruling Socialist Party officials.

Local minimum wage for most of 2020 was around $1 per month.

Former President Donald Trump's administration ramped up support for Taiwan, increasing arms sales and sending senior officials to Taipei, angering China and stirring even greater enmity from Beijing towards Washington.
That had made Trump a popular figure in democratic Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, to be taken by force if needed.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said Hsiao Bi-khim, Taiwan's representative in Washington and who is close to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, attended Wednesday's swearing in.
""The first-ever invitation to Taiwan's representative to the U.S. to attend the Inaugural Ceremonies, the most significant event celebrating U.S. democracy, highlights the close and cordial ties between Taiwan and the United States based on shared values,"" it said.
The United States ended formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979, switching recognition to China, though Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.
In a video message on her Twitter account, Hsiao said she was honoured to be there representing Taiwan's government and people.
""Democracy is our common language and freedom is our common objective. I look forward to working with the next administration in advancing our mutual values and interests,"" she said, speaking in English.
Tsai sent her congratulations too, saying she hoped the two sides could work together to maintain regional democracy, freedom, peace and stability, Taiwan's presidential office said.
Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday he was in favour of greater engagement with Taiwan.

Tsai met Blinken in 2015 at the State Department when he was deputy secretary of state and she was the presidential candidate for Taiwan's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party.

Along with the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, the government has cited widespread testing, including lateral flow tests, as a key part of its plans to re-open the economy. Concerns about the tests' accuracy have led some to question the plan, however.
Some scientists have sounded alarm at Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plans, dubbed ""Operation Moonshot"", saying mass coronavirus testing is likely to be ineffective and expensive.
Lateral flow tests are less sensitive than PCR tests, which are considered the gold standard, but can return results in just half an hour. Lateral flow tests work best among those with higher viral loads - more virus detected in the nose and throat.
Looking at data from more than a quarter of a million people who have taken part in England's test and trace scheme, scientists found that the greater the viral load, the more infectious the person.
Applying previous estimates of the sensitivity of four lateral flow devices to those findings, the researchers found that the tests would detect between 83.7% and 90.5% of cases leading to onward transmission.
""We know that lateral flow tests are not perfect, but that doesn't stop them being a game changer for helping to detect large numbers of infectious cases sufficiently rapidly to prevent further onward spread,"" said Tim Peto, Professor of Medicine at the University of Oxford.

The researchers said they could not ascertain most of those who had been infected asymptomatically, however, ""which may contribute substantially to onward transmission.""

(Reuters) - A massive Antarctic iceberg that last month threatened a penguin-populated island off the southern tip of South America has since lost much of its mass and broken into pieces, scientists say.
The main ice mass, called A68a, and its ""child bergs"" are still on the move, swirling in waters near South Georgia Island, said scientist Ted Scambos at the University of Colorado in Boulder. 
Scambos and other scientists have been tracking the iceberg - one of the largest-ever recorded - since it broke off from Antarctic's Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017 and drifted north through a region known as ""iceberg alley."" 
In the last month, the main berg shed about a third of its size, or more than 1,400 square kilometers (541 square miles), in smaller pieces and ice melt. On Tuesday, the main iceberg covered about 2,450 square kilometers (946 square miles). 
The edges of A68a have ""curled up like a dinner plate,"" causing pieces to break off from its sides as it moves through warmer currents, Scambos said. 
The iceberg could block penguins from foraging grounds if it lodges off the island's coast, or it could grind over the seabed and significantly damage marine life. 
That may already have happened, Scambos said, when the ice over moved some of the southern shelf in December. Scientists have yet to check on the impact up close.
The baby bergs are also still a threat. 
""There's city-block-sized bergs that are drifting around,"" Scambos said. Scientists are tracking six of these smaller chunks, four of which are near the island. 
Pieces began breaking off from A68a as it was approaching the island's western shelf in December. Strong currents caused the berg to pivot nearly 180 degrees. Satellite images suggest an underwater shelf may have clipped the berg, causing the first big break.
More big bits then broke off, including a protruding piece scientists had called the iceberg's ""finger."" 
The bergs ""keep wandering"" around the island, Scambos said. ""They might grind to a halt for a short while... days, maybe weeks."" 

But then they should melt and thin away, he said. ""The bergs are in water that's too warm for them.""

The charges follow a decade-long investigation and mark the first time in the island's modern history that a former leader has been charged with graft. 
Brown, who served as premier of the British territory from 2006 to 2010, faces 13 counts of corruption stemming from a scandal involving a U.S. hospital that provides care for many island residents. 
Brown is alleged to have received more than $4 million in bribes personally or that were funneled to his own local clinic in exchange for government contracts.
Prosecutors also accuse him of benefiting the Progressive Labor Party (PLP) though unlawful donations covering some $350,000 from 2007 to 2010, with part of the funds allegedly reaching a foundation he controls.
The PLP is currently the ruling party in Bermuda, under a different premier.
Brown appeared in court via Zoom. He did not enter a plea but is expected to do so later when the case is heard by the island's Supreme Court.
He has previously denied the charges and accused prosecutors of pursing lies.
The magistrates court judge allowed Brown to remain free after he paid a $250,000 bail bond, and the case is expected to resume at the Supreme Court in April.

The City of London Police said 826 cannabis plants were found in a building near the Bank of England. The police said there were reports of a ""strong smell of cannabis"", which led to the raid.
""This is the first cannabis factory in the City, no doubt being set up in response to fewer people being out and about during the pandemic who might have noticed any unusual activity,"" the police said in a statement.
The City of London, which is home to the world's largest commercial insurance market, banks and fund managers, has been largely deserted since March after most employees were asked to work from home. 
During an online event on Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said people are likely to make jokes about what the central bank's staff have been doing.

""We are now going to be the subject of endless jokes about ‘now we know what the Bank of England has been on,'"" he said. ""I’m sure there will be many other jokes. It is very quiet around the Bank of England, I should say.""

After reports in the local media on Tuesday of his early vaccination prompted calls for his resignation, Manuel Villegas initially refused to step down.
He justified taking the shot early by saying he was a doctor and his job led him to frequently interact with other health workers who had a high risk of infection.
""My papers say I'm a doctor, they don't say I'm a politician,"" he told a news conference earlier on Wednesday, adding that some 400 members of his department had already been inoculated. 
""It was a decision that I believed in and I continue to stand by it,"" he said. 
His remarks sparked more outrage, with politicians from parties on the left and the right calling for him to go. On Wednesday evening, Murcia's regional chief Fernando Lopez Miras confirmed he had reluctantly accepted Villegas' resignation.

""Today it is my turn to say goodbye to an admirable man ... Villegas has been exemplary and his performance has been impeccable,"" he told a news conference.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates has signed an agreement with the United States to purchase 50 F-35 jets and up to 18 armed drones, people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday.
Although the UAE and the United States were working to ink a deal before President Joseph Biden took office on Wednesday, the new president has said he will re-examine the agreements. 
The UAE, one of Washington's closest Middle East allies, has long expressed interest in acquiring the stealthy F-35 jets made by  Lockheed Martin  and was promised a chance to buy them in a side deal when it agreed to normalize relations with Israel last August.
The U.S. State Department and the UAE Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
One of the people said the agreement was signed about an hour before Biden was sworn into office. The document gave the United Arab Emirates the chance to accept the negotiated schedule and configuration of the jets while also making the purchase request official.
The UAE has had the paperwork for more than a week, the people said. The UAE and the United States had once hoped to have a deal in place in December, but the timing of jet deliveries, their cost, the technology packages and training associated with the deal extended negotiations, the people said.
The jets are a major component of a $23 billion sale of high-tech armaments from General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp to the UAE announced this fall.
The UAE government also signed a separate agreement to buy up to 18 drones, the second-largest sale of U.S. drones to a single country, the people said.

The final in-country delivery date for the F-35 jets could not immediately be confirmed, but the initial proposal sent to UAE said 2027, the people said.

MADRID (Reuters) - At least three people died and six were injured on Wednesday when a building in central Madrid belonging to the Catholic Church was blown apart by an explosion, local authorities said.
Initial investigations suggested that the blast in Calle Toledo, a street leading out from the city centre, was caused by a gas leak, Mayor Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida said.
""The most likely hypothesis is a gas leak, there was a person working on the boiler,"" the mayor told reporters as he announced that a body had been discovered under the rubble, raising the death toll to three.
""Firefighters still have to retrieve the corpse,"" he said, without providing further details.
Earlier, a Church official said one church volunteer was missing. One of the casualties was an 85-year-old woman, authorities said.
Two of the injured were transferred to hospital, one in serious condition with a head injury.
Smoke billowed out of the partly collapsed building and rescue workers evacuated elderly people from a nearby nursing home.
The top five floors were totally destroyed, with walls blown out, while the bottom two floors were still mostly intact, but charred in places from the flames. 
The building was a complex that provided residential training for priests and also gave meals to homeless people, a neighbour said.

France has more than 5,100 military personnel based in Mali and the West African Sahel region to help counter militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, an involvement that is facing increased opposition at home and in Mali.
Malian authorities, who have denounced those opposed to the French military presence, deployed police in riot gear to block around 1,000 protesters from gathering in Bamako's Independence Square, said organiser Adama Diarra.
""We demand the departure of French forces. After eight years of intervention it's been a total failure,"" he said by phone.
France deployed troops to Mali in 2013 to help drive out Islamist militants who had occupied the north of the country after hijacking a Tuareg rebellion.
Though the fighters have been pushed from main towns, Mali has failed to stabilise while the militants have regrouped and have carried out attacks in a prolonged insurgency.
The violence has spread to neighbouring states, stoked ethnic and intercommunal tensions, and rendered large swathes of the country's semi-arid north ungovernable. 
On Tuesday, President Emmanuel Macron said France could adjust its military operations in the Sahel region. Diplomatic and military sources expect a partial French withdrawal to be announced by mid-February.

Interim Malian President Bah N'daw on Tuesday thanked foreign militaries, including France's, for continued support.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government on Wednesday offered to suspend implementation of three new farm laws that have triggered the biggest farmers' protests in years, which farm union leaders said they would now consider calling off.
The cornerstone of the reform, introduced in September, allows private buyers to deal directly with farmers.
Angry farmers, who say that will make India's traditional wholesale markets irrelevant and leave them at the mercy of big retailers and food processors, have camped out on major highways outside New Delhi for more than two months.
Agriculture & Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said the government was open to suspending the laws for up to 18 months, during which time representatives of the government and farmers should work to ""provide solutions"" for the industry.
Bilateral talks have so far failed to break the deadlock - landing Prime Minister Narendra Modi with one of his most significant challenges since he was re-elected in 2019.
The next round of talks is due on Friday, and farm leader Dharmendra Malik said the unions would let the government know then if they would accept the offer and call off the protests.
The government was ""sympathetic to farmers' concerns and is trying to end the stalemate,"" it said in a government, thanking them for maintaining ""peace and discipline"" during the protests.

Farmers plan a tractor rally through New Delhi on Jan 26, India's Republic Day, which the Supreme Court on Wednesday declined a government petition to ban.

A piece of software to weed out records from the database that the computer had no legal right to hold went haywire because of faulty coding and began to automatically delete hundreds of thousands of other records, the Home Office said. 
""Of course it is outrageous that any data should have been lost but at the moment ... we're trying to retrieve that data,"" Johnson told parliament, adding that the Home Office (interior ministry) hoped to restore the deleted information.
""We don't know how many cases might be frustrated as a result of what has happened,"" Johnson said.
Johnson said 213,000 offence records, 175,000 arrest records and 15,000 personal records were being investigated as a result of the computer issues.
The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, quoted police chiefs as saying 403,000 records from the Police National Computer might have been deleted, as well as 26,000 DNA records and 30,000 fingerprint records from other databases been deleted.
The data included that from criminals convicted of serious offences while live police investigations had been affected and included DNA marked for indefinite retention following serious offences, Starmer told parliament.
When the Home Office became aware of the incident on Jan. 10, it rushed to stop the automatic deletions. A special command is trying to work out what has been deleted and recover what can be saved.
One issue is that the Police National Computer, which holds 13 million records, sits at the heart of a spider's web of other databases and can cascade down deletions into other directories such as the IDENT fingerprint database or the national DNA database. 

The Police National Computer is used by police and law enforcement agencies across the United Kingdom. It includes data on those convicted, wanted people, missing people, vehicles, stolen goods.

KYIV (Reuters) - More steps are needed to protect a fragile ceasefire in eastern Ukraine as violations are rising, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde (NYSE:LIN) told Reuters during a trip to the region on Wednesday. 
Linde was on her first visit to Ukraine since taking over as the rotating head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which monitors the conflict in the Donbass region between Ukraine and Russian-backed forces. 
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was elected in 2019 on a pledge to end the conflict, which has killed 14,000 people since 2014 and poisoned relations between Kyiv and Moscow. 
Both sides agreed to a ceasefire in July last year, though there are still military and civilian casualties. A Ukrainian soldier was killed during shelling last week. 
""There has been a significant reduction in ceasefire violations since the 27th of July when the ceasefire was agreed upon,"" Linde said by phone.
""The next step is to try to see if we can find more steps of keeping the ceasefire. Right now it's a little bit fragile,"" she added. ""The incidents are going up.""
Linde said work should continue in the so-called 'Normandy' format of talks, between Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany. She met Zelenskiy and Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba this week.
Ukraine suggested in November that the OSCE send 1,500 police to Donbass as a precursor to being able to hold elections in the region. Asked whether the proposal was discussed this week, Linde said: 
""There are several proposals on the table, and we are taking all of them seriously, and hopefully some can go forward.""
After Moscow's annexation of the Crimea peninsula in 2014, pro-Russian separatists rose up across a belt of eastern Ukraine. Kyiv blames Moscow for engineering the uprising, and providing troops and arms that led to its escalation into a full-blown war. Moscow denies the accusation.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The president of the EU executive said on Wednesday she looked forward to having a friend in the White House who could work with Europe on fighting climate change, quashing the COVID-19 pandemic and rebuilding multilateralism.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she hoped incoming U.S. President Joe Biden would join forces with the European Union to impose legal standards and norms on the digital world to rein in hatred, lies and fake news.
""In a few hours Trump will be history, but his supporters are there,"" von der Leyen told a group of reporters in Brussels ahead of Biden's inauguration to succeed Donald Trump.
""I think we all experienced the effect and sometimes the ... heavy negative impact on our democracy if there's hate out there, there's polarisation, fake news. And I'm sure that we will have an ally to work on that.""
Referring to Twitter's decision to ban Trump from the platform after the siege of the Capitol in Washington, von der Leyen said such a decision should not be taken by a company or a chief executive but within a legal framework that digital companies comply with.
She said a joint trade and technical council between the United States and the 27-nation EU should consider such matters.
Relations between the EU and the United States were shaky during the Trump administration, with tensions in particular over trade. Von der Leyen said the EU and Biden knew and liked each other, and she was hopeful they could achieve much together.

""We're both aware that what we have to do now is develop a global agenda - to join forces, and to tackle the big topics that are ahead of us: that's fight climate change together, overcome this pandemic and rebuild multilateralism,"" she said.
Von der Leyen defended the EU's recent investment pact with China as part of its economic partnership and competition with Beijing but said that, like Washington, Brussels saw China as a ""systemic rival"" when it came to democracy and human rights.
Von der Leyen, the first female president of the European Commission, said she welcomed the inauguration of Kamala Harris as the first woman to become vice-president of the United States.

Immigration has become a priority issue for Biden, who is planning to roll back his predecessor's harsh measures and enact sweeping reforms that would put 11 million people living illegally in the U.S on a path to citizenship. 
""I hope that today or in the coming days he presents the migration plan,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""What it is going to consist of, how they are going to respect their right to be recognized, that they get dual nationality.""
He said such a move should complement policies to support poor Central American nations and southern Mexico, areas which send many migrants to the United States.
Earlier this week, soldiers and police wielding batons in Guatemala clashed with members of an immigration caravan bound for the United States after some 8,000 Hondurans crossed into Guatemala, preventing most of them from moving forward. 
More than 36 million Hispanics of Mexican origin live in the United States, according to Pew Research Center. 
Lopez Obrador also said combating the coronavirus pandemic and the economic recovery were key areas for the bilateral relationship, saying U.S. stimulus could eventually help Mexico.
The leftist Mexican leader wished Biden well for his inauguration, saying he hoped the event was peaceful.

MADRID (Reuters) - Fewer Spanish women were killed by their partner or ex-partner in 2020 than in previous years, but that statistic masks a rise in gender-based violence as COVID lockdowns left victims confined with their abusers, rights groups and officials say.
Emails to abuse helplines soared nearly six-fold in April, the first full month of Spain's lockdown.
""Control-based violence - which doesn't murder, but is insidious and devastating - grew, because violent partners already had women under their physical control,"" Victoria Rosell, the ministry's top official on gender abuse issues, told reporters on Wednesday.
In 2020 overall, calls to the government's abuse helpline rose 15% while emails increased more than 230%, but contact with victims was often lost as enforced cohabitation pushed women to seek help silently to avoid partners' reprisals.
""So many called, but we lost the trail of half, because we couldn't call them back. They'd ring saying, 'I can speak now because I've taken the dog out' - then they'd disappear,"" said Carmen Benito, president of the Women's Association Against Abuse.
The combination of curbs on movement and economic hardship also meant fewer women sought to leave, giving rise to fewer violent confrontations - a determining factor in the fall in the number of partner-on-partner killings to 45, the lowest since records began in 2003.
Attempting to leave an abusive partner frequently carries the highest risk of physical violence, said domestic abuse survivor Ana Bella, who heads a network for women victims of gender-based violence that received four times more calls for help once the pandemic began than in 2019. 
""Abuse hasn't decreased: opportunities for the victim's entourage to gain access and help her break the silence have,"" she said.
Non-physical abuse has also increased, with women's associations citing cases of men rationing food, sequestering partners in a single room or depriving them of communication.
""Women were alone with their aggressors, had no contact with neighbours, family, or friends,"" said lawyer Irene Ramirez, who volunteers for the Commission Investigating Mistreatment of Women, an NGO. 
""They endured psychological, emotional and economic violence... and the health system's collapse prevented many who'd been assaulted from reaching medical centres.""

The pattern in Spain has been replicated elsewhere, with the World Health Organization saying hotline calls increased 60% in Europe, and Pope Francis decrying the rise in abuse.

The move follows an agreement between Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt earlier this month to end their boycott of Qatar - which began in 2017 over allegations it supported terrorism, a charge that Doha denies.
""The Arab Republic of Egypt and the State of Qatar exchanged, today, January 20, 2021, two official memoranda, in virtue of which the two countries agreed to resume diplomatic relations,"" a foreign ministry statement said.
While steps have been taken to rebuild the relationships between Qatar and the three Gulf countries, Egypt is the first to make such a move officially.
On Saturday, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said the kingdom expects to reopen its embassy in Qatar within days, and full diplomatic relations between the two would resume.
Egypt reopened its airspace to Qatari flights on Jan. 12 and flights between the two countries have resumed.
The ending of the boycott was one of a series of Middle East deals by the Trump administration aimed at building a united front against Iran.
When the boycott was announced, Egypt and its allies called on Qatar to cut ties with the Muslim Brotherhood, among other demands.
The Islamist group was outlawed in Egypt after then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the overthrow of the Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi from the presidency in 2013, before being elected president himself the following year.
Much of the group's senior leadership was jailed in Egypt but other members took refuge abroad in Qatar or its regional ally Turkey.
Egypt and the UAE have also found themselves at odds with Turkey and Qatar in Libya, where they have backed opposing factions in a civil conflict.
A Qatari foreign ministry official pledged in a meeting with Egyptian and Emirati security officials on Saturday that Qatar would not interfere in Egypt's internal affairs, two Egyptian intelligence sources told Reuters.
He also pledged a change of orientation for Qatar's al-Jazeera television channel and other state-owned media outlets towards Cairo, the sources said.
They also said that the officials agreed on economic cooperation and a series of meetings on outstanding issues such as Libya and the Muslim Brotherhood.
The officials agreed to restore diplomatic relations between Egypt and Qatar ""under probation,"" as one source put it, and the Qatari official expressed his country's desire to restore normal relations between all five nations, the sources said.

1486,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 09:46AM ET</span>",Analysis: What will survive of U.S.-Middle East policy under Biden?,"By Maayan Lubell and Rami Ayyub
TRUMP HEIGHTS, Occupied Golan Heights (Reuters) - Trump Heights, Trump Square, Trump train terminal: Israel isn't shy about honouring Donald Trump, who is widely admired among Israelis for his staunch support of their country.
But in the Palestinian territories, no U.S. president was openly reviled as much as Trump, or depicted in such unflattering terms in portraits and effigies across the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank.
In four years, Trump overturned decades of U.S. policy in the Middle East. Joe Biden will want to undo many of those changes during his presidency, but his freedom for manoeuvre will be limited.
At his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Biden's choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, signalled that countering Iran would be central to Biden's Middle East agenda.
But Blinken said the United States was ""a long way"" from rejoining the 2015 pact with Iran - restraining Tehran's nuclear programme - which the United States quit under Trump.
Biden and his team have said they will restore ties with the Palestinians that were cut by Trump, resume aid and reject unilateral actions, such as construction of Israeli settlements on occupied territory.
But Blinken said the U.S. embassy in Israel would remain in Jerusalem, which Trump recognised as Israel's capital. 
Four Trump-brokered diplomatic deals between Israel and Arab states are also likely to remain - they have bipartisan support in Washington and brought a strategic realignment of Middle East countries against Iran. 
So too is Trump's acceptance of Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in a 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognised internationally.
Biden’s challenge will be how to walk back not just Trump-era policy - and the polarisation triggered by the man who said he had ""done a lot for Israel"" - without being accused of retreating altogether from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
""He will try to project an image of fairness and balance,"" Michele Dunne, Director of the Middle East Program at the U.S. based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Reuters.
""There is no question that Biden’s policies towards the Middle East will be quite different from those of Trump; the question is how different they will be from those of (former President Barack) Obama... I doubt that Biden sees the conflict as ripe for U.S. diplomacy right now.""
TRUMP AND NETANYAHU
Trump was broadly in lockstep on Middle East policy with his closest ally in the region, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
As well as recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, Trump backed Israeli settlements in the West Bank, territory that the Palestinians seek for a state.
Israel’s investment in its West Bank settlements between 2017-2019 increased by almost half against the last three years in office of Obama, according to official Israeli data provided to the U.S. State Department and seen by Reuters.
One day before Biden's inauguration, Israel issued tenders for more than 2,500 settlement homes in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, on top of hundreds more announced by Netanyahu last week.
Relations with the Palestinians reached a new low after Trump cut off $360 million annual funding to UNRWA, the United Nations agency dealing with Palestinian refugees, reduced other aid to the Palestinians and shuttered the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington D.C.
Blinken returned to long-standing, pre-Trump, diplomatic norms at his senate hearing.
""The only way to ensure Israel's future as a Jewish, democratic state and to give the Palestinians a state to which they are entitled is through the so-called two-state solution,"" Blinken said.
But he added: ""Realistically it’s hard to see near-term prospects for moving forward on that."" 
In Gaza, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini was optimistic of change, and that things might ease up for the Palestinian refugees that his agency cares for.
""We indeed have informal contact with the incoming new administration. We heard all the messages we are receiving that there are intentions to resume the partnership,"" he told Reuters.
THE TRUMP BRAND 
For many Israelis, the Trump brand has not been tarnished by the Capitol Hill riot on Jan. 6. 
In Trump Heights, a tiny Golan Heights settlement, work is underway to house 20 new families who will move in by the summer. A giant black and gold sign at the gate has been restored after vandals stole the 'T'.
""We are keeping the name Trump Heights, we are proud of the name. President Trump deserves gratitude for all the good deeds he did for us,"" Golan Regional Council Head Haim Rokach told Reuters. 
An Israeli cabinet minister this week reaffirmed his support for Trump's name to adorn a future train terminus near Jerusalem's Western Wall, and at Trump Square roundabout in Petah Tikva he remains popular. ""We will miss him,"" said Alon Sender. ""He was good for Israel.""
But on the other side of the Israeli military barrier 10km east of Petah Tikva, many Palestinians are glad to see the back of Trump.
""For sure, Trump’s policy is unfair,"" said Sumoud Salah, a teenage refugee in Jericho. 
""I hope that his (Biden) era will be different than Trump's, which was unfair for everyone, not only for the Palestinians.”

Aslan Byutukayev was one of six militants killed during a special operation in the village of Katyr-Yurt, about 1,500 km (930 miles) south of Moscow, Chechen regional leader Ramzan Kadyrov said.
Byutukayev is supected of being behind a bombing that killed nearly 40 people in the arrivals hall of Domodedovo airport in 2011. He is also accused of taking part in other attacks, including on Grozny, the Chechen capital.
The United States added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGT) in 2016. 
""All underground groups in Chechnya have been completely eliminated!"" Kadyrov said on social media.
Those killed were the last militants on a federal wanted list for terrorist activity in the region, he said. 
The National Anti-Terrorism Committee confirmed Byutukayev had been killed in the operation, Russian news agencies reported. 
President Vladimir Putin had congratulated Kadyrov on the operation and said all those involved would receive state awards, the Kremlin spokesman said.
Chechnya, a mainly Muslim region, has been plagued with attacks on security officials and an insurgency since Moscow fought two wars with separatists after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991.

WARSAW (Reuters) - A Polish judge critical of the ruling nationalists' judiciary reforms refused to appear for questioning at a prosecutor's office on Wednesday, the latest twist in a case that has come to symbolise the conflict between the government and some judges.
Poland has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with the European Union over the rule of law, and the removal of Judge Igor Tuleya's immunity from prosecution in November by a disciplinary chamber the bloc says is not independent underlined the rift.
He is facing disciplinary proceedings over allowing media access to a 2017 court hearing at which he ruled on a sensitive case regarding the lawfulness of a parliamentary vote on the budget criticised for not having opposition politicians present.
""I cannot appear voluntarily for questioning because I would be contradicting my own words,"" Tuleya told cheering supporters, some holding banners with slogans such as ""Freedom for Polish judges"".
""The accusation is completely false... if I went into the prosecutor's office I would be assessing the actions of the so-called disciplinary chamber as lawful, but they aren't,"" he added.
Cabinet minister Michal Wojcik, who formerly served as deputy justice minister, criticised Tuleya's refusal to appear before the prosecutor.
""This shows that Judge Tuleya puts himself above society,"" he told Reuters by text message. ""It's a kind of caste thinking that some people aren't bound by the law.""
Tuleya is a well known opponent of judicial reforms carried out by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which critics say aim to increase political control over the courts.
PiS says the reforms are necessary to improve the efficiency of the judiciary and remove a residue of communist influence from the system.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is set to get broad parliamentary backing for 32 billion euros of extra spending for the COVID-hit economy, lawmakers said, after he narrowly survived this week's attempt by a junior coalition partner to unseat him.
The stimulus package approved by the cabinet last week, due to be voted on in both houses of parliament late on Wednesday, will win support from across the political spectrum, government and opposition party sources said.
The money will be used to help the hard-pressed national health service, fund grants to businesses forced to close due to coronavirus lockdowns, finance company furlough schemes and provide cover for a postponement of tax payment deadlines.
It will push the budget deficit to 8.8% of gross domestic product this year, Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said on Wednesday, up from the current official goal of 7% and only marginally below the 10.5-10.8% seen for 2020.
The latest package means Italy will have approved almost 200 billion euros ($242 billion) in a series of stimulus measures since the COVID pandemic hit the country last February. 
In the Senate on Tuesday Conte won his second vote of confidence in two days, allowing him to continue in office after former premier Matteo Renzi withdrew his small Italia Viva party from the coalition, attempting to deprive it of a majority.
Conte won over several opposition and unaligned senators but fell short of an absolute majority, making it hard for him to adopt any contentious legislation in future and leaving him vulnerable to parliamentary ambushes.
Dismissing calls from right-wing League leader Matteo Salvini for him to resign, Conte said after the vote he would now aim ""to make the majority even more solid,"" by luring other opposition lawmakers into the government's ranks.
He is expected to consult on Wednesday with President Sergio Mattarella, the supreme arbiter of Italian politics, to update him on his plans.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny, detained on Sunday after flying back to Russia for the first time after being poisoned with a nerve agent, is spending his days under strict control in a VIP cell inside one of Moscow's most infamous jails.
The prison, called Matrosskaya Tishina or Sailor's Silence, occupies a block in Moscow's north-east and has housed high-ranking prisoners the authorities wanted to cut off from the outside world since the Soviet era.
""I'd read about it (the prison) in books and now I'm here,"" Navalny quipped in an Instagram post. ""Russian life.""
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, who spent four years in the jail as its highest profile prisoner of the Putin era, tweeted that Navalny would find it harsh: ""It's tough in the beginning. And not much easier after. You can be killed at any minute.""
Navalny, held for now on a 30 day pre-trial detention order for failing to check in with parole authorities over a suspended prison sentence in a fraud case he says was trumped up, is occupying a three-person VIP cell.
He will be held alone for at least two weeks due to COVID-19 precautions, said Alexei Melnikov, a member of Moscow's Public Monitoring Commission which observes treatment of prisoners.
Melnikov, who visited Navalny on Monday night, said his cell had a fridge, an electric kettle, TV and hot water.
Marina Litvinovich, another member of the monitoring commission, said the prison was famed for its control of inmates. Navalny was being held on an upper floor in a section informally supervised by Russia's intelligence services.
""The motto of this central Kremlin prison is isolation from information. It's about control and isolation,"" she said. She said lawyers sometimes found it hard to access clients there and that medical attention was sometimes denied to those who refused to cooperate with investigations.
Navalny's mother, Ludmila, complained on Wednesday that prison officials had told her they were unable to accept letters for her son for the time being due to technical problems. 
Olga Romanova, head of Jailed Russia, a prisoners' rights group, said housing Navalny at the jail was proof that he ""is a very serious prisoner.""

Meghan, 39, the wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers after its Mail on Sunday tabloid printed extracts of the handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.
She has asked a judge to rule in her favour without need for a potential embarrassing trial, with her lawyers telling the High Court on Tuesday that publishing the ""intrinsically private, personal and sensitive letter"" was a plain breach of her privacy to which there was no viable defence. 
The paper argues that the duchess intended the letter's contents to become public and it was part of a media strategy, pointing out she had admitted in court papers discussing it with her communications secretary, Jason Knauf.
Antony White, the paper's lawyer, on Wednesday told a second day of remote hearings on Meghan's request for a summary judgment in the case that any involvement of royal aides in drafting the letter ""cries out for investigation"".
""Why was the Kensington Palace communications team involved at all in wording the letter?"" he said.
A lawyer representing four senior former aides, including Knauf, said they would be prepared to give evidence at a trial, and one or more ""would be in a position to shed some light"" on some of the contested issues.
This included the creation of the letter, whether or not Meghan anticipated it would become public, and whether she was directly or indirectly involved in providing private information to authors of a recent biography, their lawyer said in a legal letter that was made public on Wednesday.
None ""wished to take sides in the dispute"", the letter said, adding: ""Our clients are all strictly neutral.""

The trial was due to start last week but was delayed until late 2021 at Meghan's request last year because of a confidential reason, when her lawyers also said they would seek a summary judgment.

May, who said she ""never knew what to expect"" from U.S. President Donald Trump, described the inauguration of Joe Biden in an article in the Daily Mail newspaper as a chance for both countries to better promote democratic values.
Britain's former leader was herself criticised by some opposition lawmakers for being too close to Trump after he held her hand on a visit to Washington. But she has been outspoken in her criticism of Johnson since he replaced her in 2019.
""The arrival of President Biden provides Britain with a golden opportunity,"" she said in the article. 
""But to lead we must live up to our values,"" she said, adding that threatening to break international law in talks with the European Union on a trade deal and moving away from defence and aid spending targets were ""not actions which, in my view, raised our credibility in the eyes of the world"".
Biden will be sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday and the government hopes to reinvigorate ties with Washington, especially as Britain hosts a summit of the Group of Seven nations and the United Nations COP26 climate change conference this year.
Asked in parliament about May's article, Johnson said Britain had a ""phenomenal year"" ahead when it could show leadership, and that he would work closely with Biden.
But Britain's threat in last year's EU talks to break international law in a post-Brexit arrangement for Northern Ireland was criticised by Biden at the time. 
He warned that a future U.S. trade deal would be in jeopardy if Britain failed to honour the 1998 Good Friday peace deal, which effectively ended 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland and was brokered with support from Washington.
Johnson dropped the threat after agreeing alternative arrangements with the EU.
""With Brexit now achieved but the pandemic still raging and the long-term economic and social impact of COVID to be addressed, it is now even more important that we work together with our allies,"" May wrote.

About 120 people joined the march in central Tokyo, with participants waving American and Japanese flags and holding banners claiming Trump was ""the true winner"" of the Nov. 3 election.
Democrat Biden won the election with 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232. 
    ""We wanted to show that many people in Japan are supporting President Trump,"" rally organiser Naota Kobayashi told Reuters. ""We all chanted together so that our voice can fly over the Pacific Ocean and reach the U.S."" 
Some Trump fans in Japan are drawn to his hard-line stance against regional rival China. Others like Kobayashi are part of conservative Christian sects, while still others are adherents to QAnon - a conspiracy theory that posits that Trump is secretly fighting a global cabal of child-sex predators that includes prominent Democrats, Hollywood elites and ""deep state"" allies. 
Tokyo has seen a series of pro-Trump demonstrations since the election, with participants waving his campaign banners and wearing his signature red caps. Wednesday's march was smaller than some previous events.
Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who resigned last August, forged close ties with Trump, playing golf and engaging in frequent phone calls and meetings.
Biden will become the 46th U.S. president at a ceremony in Washington that has been greatly scaled back due to both coronavirus precautions and security concerns following the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Trump.

THULASENDRAPURAM, India (Reuters) - Residents of the ancestral Indian village of Kamala Harris celebrated her inauguration as U.S. vice president on Wednesday by setting off firecrackers and distributing food. 
Thulasendrapuram, a leafy village about 320 km (200 miles) south of the city of Chennai, is where Harris’s maternal grandfather was born more than a century ago.
Calendars featuring the faces of Biden and Harris have been distributed throughout the village by a co-operative.

The scenes were in contrast to the sombre mood in Washington - locked down due to security concerns and the threat of the novel coronavirus - where Biden and Harris are due to be sworn in later on Wednesday.
Harris, who was born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, both of whom immigrated to the United States to study, visited Thulasendrapuram when she was five and has recalled walks with her grandfather on the beach at Chennai.

""If nothing is done soon, we won't have only 535,000 displaced people. We won't have only 2,000 people killed by the conflict, but tens of thousands,"" said Valentin Tapsoba, regional director for the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR).
The displaced people were in a dire situation, with overcrowding, malnutrition and a lack of essentials including food and water, the officials said in an online news briefing.
Insurgents staged their first attack in Cabo Delgado province - where oil giants such as Total are involved in big gas projects - in 2017 and pledged allegiance to Islamic State two years later.
The conflict has escalated since, with attacks growing in scale and frequency and the militants regularly taking and holding entire towns. Mozambique is predominantly Christian but has a Muslim minority, mostly living in the north.
The insecurity has left aid agencies unable to access a huge swathe of the coastal province. 
At the beginning of 2020, about 18,000 people had been displaced by the conflict, Lola Castro, World Food Programme (WFP) regional director said. In the second half of the year a rise in people fleeing the violence pushed that number up to more than half a million.
Now, some households in the provincial capital Pemba are hosting many other families. One had opened its home to 66 other people who all slept in one room and shared one latrine, Tapsoba said.
""The situation in Cabo Delgado is appalling,"" Castro said.
The briefing followed a visit to Pemba by the U.N. officials.
Despite its natural resources, Mozambique remains one of the poorest countries in the world. It was locked in a civil war following independence from Portugal in 1975 that lasted until 1992.
Although it has had democratic rule since then, elections have often been challenged and RENAMO guerrillas fought a low-level insurgency against their longtime adversary, the ruling FRELIMO, from 2013 to 2019.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's government on Wednesday filed a criminal complaint of defaming the monarchy against a banned opposition politician after he criticised the country's COVID-19 vaccine strategy. 
The move could mark the highest-profile lese majeste case since a wave of anti-government protests emerged last year and extended to criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn over accusations of meddling in politics and taking too much power.
The complaint against Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit under Article 112 of the criminal code came two days after he said the government was too reliant on a company owned by the Crown Property Bureau, which is under the king's personal control, to produce vaccines for Thais. 
Lese majeste in Thailand punishes defaming or insulting the king by up to 15 years in prison. 
Government officials who filed the complaint told reporters Thanathorn had defamed the monarchy by linking it to the vaccine strategy. 
""Thanathorn distorted facts and caused misunderstanding among people,"" Suporn Atthawong, a minister in the prime minister's office, told reporters. 
""He violated the monarchy, which upset Thai people who love and protect the monarchy.""
The complaint, which also included a cyber crime accusation of uploading false information, came after Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who took power in a 2014 military coup, vowed on Tuesday to prosecute ""distorted"" information about the vaccine strategy. 
""The more you discredit or harass me with legal cases, the clearer my suspicions become,"" Thanathorn, who was banned from politics for 10 years by a court last year, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post following the government's complaint. 
 The Progressive  (NYSE:PGR) Movement, headed by Thanathorn, said earlier there was no insult in his comments at the group's event titled ""Royal Vaccine: Who Benefits and Who Doesn't?"", broadcast on Facebook Live on Monday. 
""It's obvious that 112 is being used again as a political tool,"" Pannika Wanich, Thanathorn's colleague and one of the group's leaders, told Reuters, referring to the law. 
Charles Santiago, a Malaysian lawmaker who chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' Parliamentarians for Human Rights, called the move ""yet another illustration of the cynical weaponisation of the lese majeste law to stifle any form of criticism"". 
Government spokeswoman Ratchada Dhanadirek said prosecutions were not politically motivated. 
""The government doesn't need to use the law as a political tool to deal with anyone,"" she told Reuters. ""We're focused on urgent economic problems and long-term national recovery."" 
The Progressive Movement was formed after a court last year ruled to dissolve Thanathorn's Future Forward Party, which came in third in 2019 elections held five years after Prayuth's coup.

Opposition parties accused Prayuth's junta of designing the elections to ensure he remained in power. Prayuth's pro-military party has said the elections were free and fair.

The ""Thai Pakdee"" (Loyal Thai) party is an offshoot of a royalist group of the same name formed last August to counter street demonstrations with rallies in support of the king.
Veteran politician Warong Dechgitvigrom will lead the new party, which he said will fight political groups whose true intention was to topple the monarchy. 
""Before we defend ... today we declare war, we will fight to protect the monarchy,"" Warong told a news conference.
Leaders of the protest movement have rejected allegations that toppling the monarchy is their goal and have repeatedly said they want to make the institution more compatible with democracy. 
Warong said the prominent opposition party, Move Forward, and its associated Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Movement group would be his party's political rivals, as well as the youth-led groups that he called ""the three-fingers mob"", referring to the ""Hunger Games"" salute they use in their campaign. 
In a statement Warong said his party did not have support of any particular groups or businesses and would belong to the people.
He did not name any other members, but said the election commission had been notified of its formation and executives would be selected soon. 
Progressive politician Piyabutr Saengkanokkul warned, however, that the new party risked associating the monarchy with domestic politics. 

""The formation of a party that advocates the protection of the monarchy, whether by good intention or for destroying others, could only bring the monarchy into the political sphere,"" Piyabutr said on his official Twitter account.

Mongkol declined the opportunity to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Thai activists have accused the military-backed government of using illegal tactics to intimidate critics, on top of legal cases filed against them for offences like sedition and insulting the monarchy, which carry long jail terms.
Ampon said allegations of abductions were designed to create mistrust of state officials.

Mitsotakis was speaking ahead of a parliamentary vote on a bill extending Greece's western territorial waters to 12 nautical miles from six currently, days before NATO allies Greece and Turkey resume exploratory talks over contested maritime claims in the Aegean. 
The talks are set to begin in Istanbul on Jan. 25, after a four-year pause.
""We will attend with optimism, self-confidence,"" Mitsotakis said, but there would be ""zero naivety"" from Athens about the talks, which were unofficial and non-binding.
""There will be no discussion on national sovereignty,"" he added.
He said the discussions were expected to resume at the point where they were interrupted in 2016.
Ankara and Athens held 60 rounds of talks from 2002 to 2016, but plans last year for a resumption foundered over a survey vessel that Turkey sent into disputed waters and disagreements over topics to be covered.
The latter issue remains unresolved, as Greece only wants to discuss the demarcation of maritime zones in the Aegean and the Mediterranean. Turkey says all issues should be discussed, including air space and the status of some Aegean islands.
The bill under vote does not affect waters off Greece's southern and eastern coasts, where Turkey has warned that any such move by Athens would be a ""casus belli"", or cause for war.

But Greece says that under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea it retains the right to exercise its rights in other parts of its territory.

The curfew would allow only people with pressing needs to leave their homes between 8:30 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. local time as of Friday night, RTL said, citing government sources. 
Schools and non-essential shops have already been closed since mid-December, following the shutdown of bars and restaurants two months earlier.
This lockdown will remain in place until at least Feb. 9, Prime Minister Mark Rutte said last week.
The introduction of the first night curfew since that imposed on the Dutch by German occupiers in World War II is highly contentious, and various political parties have already said they will never back it.
The government is discussing the curfew and other possible measures on Wednesday morning, and has said it will announce its decisions early in the afternoon.
It will then seek the backing of parliament for its measures in a debate expected to start around 1500 GMT. The curfew however can be imposed without the backing of opposition parties.
The government is also considering whether to ban travel to and from Britain and South Africa, RTL said, to limit the spread of the highly contagious variants of the virus which were first discovered there.
Infections in the Netherlands have decreased steadily in the past three weeks, but health authorities say the new variants will lead to a new surge by next month if social distancing measures are not tightened.
The Dutch government currently has a caretaker status, as Rutte last Friday handed his resignation to King Willem-Alexander following a damning report on his cabinet's handling of childcare subsidies.
Rutte has said he will remain able to take decisions on COVID-19 policies until a new government is formed after the March 17 elections, seeking broad support for measures from both coalition and opposition parties.

Until the pandemic closed Japan off to most foreign visitors last year, the retail complex, which opened in 2017 with around 240 stores, was a symbol of Ginza's revival as a popular destination for tourists, especially those from China descending on stores by the busload. 
Ginza Six said on Wednesday that around 15 stores, including Italian fashion house Moschino, cosmetics brands Shiseido and Shu Uemura, as well as Salon des Parfums selling Annick Goutal and other fragrance brands, have shut in the past few days.
While Japan has not seen COVID-19 outbreaks on the scale of some other major economies such as the United States and Britain, infections have been rising steadily and the government declared a second state of emergency earlier this month. 
The continued travel ban, particularly the absence of Chinese tourists during next month's Lunar New Year holiday for a second year running, is also expected to deal a blow to Tokyo retailers, said Atsumi Gamou, head of Japan Tourism Agency.
""Retailers which were mainly focused on duty-free and other products popular with inbound tourists are struggling hard,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. ""It's extremely difficult, to have an entry ban on tourists at a time when Chinese visitors would ordinarily be coming for Lunar New Year holidays.""
END OF THE BOOM
The number of Chinese visitors had risen more than six-fold in the seven years to 2019. They also spent more than others, accounting for 30% of tourists but 37% of tourist spending even after a Chinese government crackdown on import and re-sale of luxury goods dampened their frantic shopping sprees for Japanese electronics and cosmetics dubbed ""bakugai"", or ""explosive buying"", by Japan's media. 
Ginza Six has catered heavily to foreign visitors, with a large service centre offering tax refund processing and luggage storage in addition to a dedicated bus bay. 
Global travel bans have kept foreign visitor numbers at 1-2% of year-ago levels since last April, according to data from JTB Tourism & Consulting.
Department stores in central Tokyo, heavily dependent on tourists in the past several years, have been hit particularly hard. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings' same-store sales fell more than 30% in 2020, with sales for its Mitsukoshi Ginza store down over 50%. 
Investors in Ginza Six included Japanese department store operator J.Front Retailing, trading house Sumitomo Corp and the real estate arm of U.S. private equity firm L Catterton.

The New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) accord, which was signed in 2010 and expires in February, limits the numbers of strategic nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers that Russia and the United States can deploy.
""Russia and its president are in favour of preserving this agreement,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call. ""If our American colleagues will in fact demonstrate a political will to preserve this pact by extending it, this can only be welcomed.""
Biden's choice for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday that the incoming U.S. administration would seek to extend the pact and decide how long an extension to pursue.
Russian President Vladimir Putin last year called on Washington to extend the last major nuclear arms pact between the two countries for a year without any conditions.
A failure to extend New START could fuel a potential arms race and tensions between Moscow and Washington.

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons goes into effect on Friday and has been signed by 86 states, according to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017.
""I strongly encourage all states and all people to work with determination to promote the conditions necessary for a world without nuclear weapons, thus contributing to the advancement of peace and multilateral cooperation, which humanity needs so very much today,"" Francis said, mentioning the treaty during his weekly general audience.
The United States, Britain, France and other nuclear powers have not signed the treaty and boycotted talks that led to it.

During a visit in 2019 to Nagasaki, one of the only two cities hit by atomic bombs in history, Francis said the mere possession of nuclear weapons, even for the purpose of deterrence, was ""perverse"" and indefensible.

BEIJING (Reuters) - With hours left in Donald Trump's presidency, China's foreign ministry took aim at its chief U.S. antagonist, ""lying and cheating"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and said it would seek cooperation with the incoming administration of Joe Biden.
Pompeo, who has unleashed a barrage of measures against China in his final weeks in office, delivered his own parting shot on Tuesday when he announced that the Trump administration had determined that China has committed “genocide and crimes against humanity” by repressing Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang.
""Pompeo has made so many lies in recent years, and this is just another bold-faced lie,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular media briefing on Wednesday.
""This so-called determination by Pompeo is nothing but paper. This U.S. politician is notorious for lying and cheating, is making himself a laughing stock and a clown,"" she said.
China has repeatedly rejected accusations of abuse of the Uighur population in its western Xinjiang region, where a United Nations panel has said that at least 1 million Uighurs and other Muslims had been detained in camps.
However, Biden's secretary of state appointee, Antony Blinken, said on Tuesday that he agreed with Pompeo's genocide assessment.
""The forcing of men, women and children into concentration camps; trying to, in effect, re-educate them to be adherents to the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party, all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide,"" he said.
Asked about Blinken's remarks, Hua gave the incoming administration the benefit of the doubt, along with a warning that China would not accept criticism of its Xinjiang policy going forward.
""We hope the new U.S. administration can have their own reasonable and cool-minded judgment on Xinjiang issues, among other issues,"" she said.
""We hope the new administration will work together with China in the spirit of mutual respect, properly handle differences and conduct more win-win cooperation in more sectors,"" she said.
Beijing's ire has often been directed at Pompeo, and Hua was asked whether she will miss him.

""Of course, we are enjoying a free-of-charge show every day,"" she said. ""But I think the harm he incurred to the U.S. image and reputation is irreversible and hard to heal.""

""We congratulate again the incoming president and we look forward to having close and friendly relations with the Biden administration,"" presidential spokesman Harry Roque told CNN Philippines ahead of Biden's inauguration.
Ties have been tested since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte took office in 2016 and embarked on months of expletive-laden tirades against the United States and threatened repeatedly to scrap their bilateral military agreements.
Duterte has sought warmer ties with China and Russia, and took particular aim at former counterpart Barack Obama, to whom Biden was vice president. He once said he would not visit the United States, calling it a ""lousy"" country. 
Though Duterte has spoken positively about U.S. President Donald Trump, he has remained critical of American foreign policy. 

Philippine political analysts expect the Biden administration to be more vocal than its predecessor about human rights issues in the Philippines, including Duterte's signature war on drugs, during which thousands of people have been killed.

""It is difficult to provide citizens with clean water,"" the Ethiopian Press Agency quoted the Tigray Water Resource Management Bureau's deputy Gidena Medhin as saying.
Ethiopian federal forces ousted the former local ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), from the regional capital Mekelle in a war from November that killed thousands and sent tens of thousands fleeing from homes.
The United Nations says 2.3 million people - nearly half of Tigray's population - need aid amid food shortages, lootings and inadequate healthcare facilities. 
The water bureau's Gidena said its properties had been ""mercilessly"" ransacked with offices almost empty of equipment, money taken from safes, and vehicles, drilling machines and generators lost. He did not say who the perpetrators were. 
""The Gereb Geba clean water dam project has stopped operating as workers left the project area following the unrest created in the state,"" he said, adding that there would be recognition of workers who had sought to protect offices. 
With access and communications to Tigray still difficult, Reuters was unable to independently verify the report. Representatives for the TPLF, who have said weeks ago they were will still fighting from the hills, could not be reached. 

The government began distributing aid last weekend after struggling to find cars to transport supplies from Mekelle throughout the rural mountainous terrain, Mulu Nega, the region's interim leader, told Reuters on Monday.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union hailed Joe Biden's inauguration later on Wednesday as U.S. president as a ""new dawn"" for Europe and the United States, while insisting U.S. technology companies should be regulated to stop the ""dark forces"" of hate speech online.
The EU and the United States are the world's top trading powers, along with China, and have close cultural, historical, business and defence ties, but Donald Trump sought to sideline the EU, championing Britain's departure from the bloc.
Expressing relief at the end of four years of Trump's ""America First"" policy, the EU's chief executive and chairman told the European Parliament that shaping new global digital regulation together was paramount.
""This new dawn in America is the moment we've been waiting for,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. But she also cautioned: ""This sense of relief ... should not lead us to making any illusions. Trump may be consigned to history in a few hours, but his followers remain."" 
Von der Leyen said that while it might not be possible ""to completely eliminate any of these dark forces"" of the kind of incitement that led to the storming of the U.S. Capital on Jan. 6, hate speech and fake news must not be allowed to circulate freely on the internet.
""This political power, unbridled power held by the big internet giants must be reined in,"" Von der Leyen said.
EU lawmakers are debating new digital policy that would have implications for Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but without major technology companies of its own, the European Union's digital privacy and antitrust regulation can only go so far.
Von der Leyen proposed in her speech setting up a EU-U.S. Common Technology Council as a first step to draw up a template for global digital regulation that others around the world could follow. 
From regulating artificial intelligence to complex algorithms based on vast amounts of data, the EU wants restrictions that would not at the same time limit the benefits of technology, such as self-driving cars or sharing data to fight diseases.
European Council President Charles Michel, who chairs EU summits in Brussels, said transatlantic priorities should also include combating COVID-19 and climate change.

""Together, we must stand as the bedrock of the rules-based international order, working for peace, security, prosperity, freedom, human rights and gender equity,"" Michel said. ""Let's build a new founding pact for a stronger Europe, for a stronger America and for a better world,"" he told EU lawmakers.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani urged the incoming U.S. administration on Wednesday to return to a 2015 nuclear agreement and lift sanctions on Tehran, while welcoming the end of ""tyrant"" President Donald Trump's era. 
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Wednesday, has said the United States will rejoin the pact, which includes restrictions on Iran's nuclear work, if Tehran resumes strict compliance.
""The ball is in the U.S. court now. If Washington returns to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal, we will also fully respect our commitments under the pact,"" Rouhani said in a televised cabinet meeting.
""Today, we expect the incoming U.S. administration to return to the rule of law and commit themselves, and if they can, in the next four years, to remove all the black spots of the previous four years,"" he said.
Tensions have grown between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when Trump quit the deal between Iran and six world powers that sought to limit Tehran's nuclear programme and to prevent it developing atomic weapons. Washington reimposed sanctions that have badly hit Iran's economy.
Iran, which denies ever seeking nuclear arms, retaliated to Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy by gradually breaching the accord. Tehran has repeatedly said it can quickly reverse those violations if U.S. sanctions are removed. 
Antony Blinken, Biden's choice for secretary of state, said on Tuesday the United States would not take a quick decision on whether to rejoin the pact.
""Tyrant Trump's political career and his ominous reign are over today and his 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran has completely failed,"" Rouhani said. ""Trump is dead but the nuclear deal is still alive.""
Biden appears to see a return to the deal as a prelude to wider talks on Iran’s nuclear work, its ballistic missiles and regional activities. But Tehran has ruled out halting its missile programme or changing its regional policy.
Biden’s choice to lead the Pentagon, retired Army General Lloyd Austin, said on Tuesday that Iran posed a threat to American allies in the region and forces stationed in the Middle East.

""The United States and other Western countries have turned our region to a powder keg, not Iran,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told state TV.

David Perry, a Queen's Counsel, was due to lead the case against tabloid media magnate Jimmy Lai and several others, including veteran democracy activists Martin Lee and Margaret Ng. 
But Hong Kong's Department of Justice noted ""growing pressure and criticism"" of Perry in Britain for taking the case, adding in a statement that he had ""concerns about such pressures and the exemption of quarantine"" and ""indicated that the trial should proceed without him"".
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky TV in an interview on Sunday that Perry had handed the Chinese government a ""PR coup"" and had behaved in a ""pretty mercenary way"".
Confirming the details, Hong Kong's Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng objected to such comments being aimed at a ""very formidable"" barrister.
""The fact that such a very high-ranking official has uttered words such as 'mercenary' is, with respect, disgraceful to such a reputable counsel,"" Cheng said.
Perry could not immediately be reached for comment. A Hong Kong barrister has been hired in his place, Cheng said. 
Under Hong Kong's independent Common Law-based legal system, foreign lawyers are sometimes used by both the defence and prosecution sides in cases.
Lai, 73, owns the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily - which has a reputation of being fiercely critical of the city government.
The case that Perry was due to lead relates to protests in August 2019, according to broadcaster RTHK, but Lai has also been charged with offences under the city's sweeping new national security law, which has sparked foreign condemnation.
He is the highest profile figure to be charged under the law that Beijing imposed on the city on June 30 last year after months of pro-democracy protests in the global financial hub.
The law sets out tough punishment for terrorism, subversion and colluding with foreign forces while allowing some suspects to be taken to mainland China for trial in complex cases.

Critics say the law threatens the vaunted judicial independence in the former British colony.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>",American 'digital nomad' to be deported from Bali after LGBT and lifestyle tweets,"DENPASAR, Indonesia (Reuters) - An American woman and self-described digital nomad will be deported from Indonesia after posting tweets that sparked a social media backlash over perceived western privilege and lack of cultural awareness, after she said Bali was ""LGBT friendly"".
Indonesia is the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation and its LGBT community has for years faced discrimination and sometimes violent attacks. Only 9% of Indonesians agreed that homosexuality is acceptable, according to a survey by the Pew research centre last June.
In a series of tweets at the weekend, Kristen Gray wrote about the perks of her decision to move to the tropical island of Bali with her girlfriend, describing it as the ""perfect medicine"", a place that was LGBT friendly, and where the low cost of living afforded her a luxurious lifestyle.
""The island has been amazing because of our elevated lifestyle at a much lower cost of living. I was paying $1,300 for my LA studio. Now I have a treehouse for $400,"" she posted, with a picture of her new, light-filled Balinese abode.
""Being a digital nomad is everything,"" she added, referring to individuals who often work remotely and in multiple countries.
With its laidback lifestyle, unique culture and relatively low cost of living, Bali has been an attractive destination for those hoping to avoid the slog of working in congested and expensive cities in Western countries.
Gray's tweets were slammed by many Indonesians on social media for various reasons, including allegations she may have cheated the system by dodging taxes, exploited Western privilege, and for an apparent lack of awareness about Indonesian society.
After Gray was summoned for questioning on Tuesday, I Putu Surya Dharma, a spokesman for Bali's Law and Human Rights agency, told Reuters the U.S. citizen would be deported as soon as a flight was available, and was currently being held at an immigration detention facility.
In a statement on its website, the immigration office said Gray may have violated several immigration laws, including by spreading information that could disturb the public, such as suggesting that Bali was ""queer friendly"" and easily accessible to foreigners amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Hi everyone, first of all I'm not guilty, I have not overstayed my visa, I have not made money in Indonesian rupiah in Indonesia. I put out a statement about LGBT, and I've been deported because I'm LGBT,"" Gray told reporters. 
Promoting her lifestyle upgrade in an e-book entitled, ""Our Bali Life Is Yours"", Gray had also posted about how foreign nationals could enter Indonesia during the pandemic. 
Her lawyer Erwin Siregar told Reuters that Gray had a social cultural visa that was valid until Jan. 24 this year.
Indonesia last month tightened border restrictions to stop the entry of all foreigners, with the exception of diplomats and those with existing work or residency permits, in a bid to stem the spread of more contagious variants of the novel coronavirus.
Officials said they were also looking into the possibility that Gray had violated Indonesian law by carrying out business activities through the sale of her e-book.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's president on Wednesday nominated a former national security adviser who was partly blamed for a failed summit between North Korea and the United States in 2019 as the country's next foreign minister.
The nomination of Chung Eui-yong, 74, to replace Kang Kyung-wha as foreign minister was seen as a bid to help revive stalled denuclearisation talks with North Korea, just hours before Joe Biden takes office as the U.S. president. 
Chung had sought to mediate between the two countries as President Moon Jae-in's top security adviser, making a surprise announcement on the White House lawn in March 2018 that U.S. President Donald Trump would hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
But Chung was accused of misleading both sides about the potential for agreement after their second summit in 2019 in Vietnam failed to produce a deal. 
The reshuffle came two days after Moon called for Biden to hold dialogue with North Korea to build on progress made by Kim and Trump at their first meeting in Singapore.
Chung's nomination is to ""breathe new life into the lineup of diplomats and regroup their forces in time for the inauguration of the Biden administration,"" a presidential official told reporters. 
Kim and Trump agreed in Singapore to foster new relations and work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. 
But their Vietnam summit collapsed when Trump rejected Kim's offer to abandon North Korea's main nuclear facility in return for lifting some sanctions, an idea that Moon had trumpeted on hopes for a restart of inter-Korean economic projects. 
Former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton, in his memoir released last June, said Moon had raised unrealistic expectations for his own ""unification"" agenda without reflecting on either side's position. 
Bolton also cited Chung as sharing Moon's ""schizophrenic"" comment that Trump had rightly refused Kim's proposal but on the other hand, Kim's willingness to dismantle the Yongbyon facility was a ""very meaningful first step"" toward ""irreversible"" denuclearisation.
Chung has said Bolton's accounts were ""inaccurate"" and ""distorted,"" without elaborating. 
After the North blew up a joint liaison office in June, Kim's sister said she had rejected a previously unknown proposal from Moon to send Chung as a special envoy, calling the offer ""sinister"" and blaming Seoul's ""incompetence and irresponsibility"" for worsened ties.
South Korea's main opposition party criticised Chung's nomination, saying it reflected Moon's unwillingness to take a new approach to prevent another mediation failure. 
A trade expert, Chung spent three years as Moon's security adviser until he retired last July.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea is imposing stiff fines or prison for anyone caught enjoying South Korean entertainment or copying the way South Koreans speak as leader Kim Jong Un steps up a war on outside influences and calls for better homegrown entertainment. 
A sweeping new ""anti-reactionary thought"" law was imposed late last year, and this week new details were reported by Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports from sources inside North Korea.
Measures include fines for parents whose children violate the bans, up to 15 years in a prison camp for those caught with media from South Korea, and punishments for the production or distribution of pornography, the use of unregistered televisions, radios, computers, foreign cellphones or other electronic devices, Daily NK reported on Monday, citing explanatory material for the law, which it had obtained.
Rimjin-gang, a Japan-based magazine that also cultivates sources in North Korea, reported this month that the new law bans speaking or writing in South Korean styles.
In what it said were written remarks by Kim, the leader has criticised the common practice in the South of using terms such as ""oppa"" (older brother) and ""dong-saeng"" (younger sister, brother) to refer to non-relatives, the site reported.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the reports.
Anyone caught importing banned material from South Korea faces a life sentence, while those caught importing large amounts of content from the United States or Japan could face death, Daily NK said.
The new law appeared to increase some penalties while tightening restrictions in the government's long-running war on outside information, said Sokeel Park, of Liberty in North Korea, which supports defectors.
The emphasis on South Korean material and the intangible elements like accents highlights how worried the government is about the creeping influence of the wealthier, democratic South, he said.
""It all plays into this very longstanding sensitivity to young people especially being led astray and detaching from the glorious socialist revolution by being distracted with this very fancy but corrupt influence,"" Park said.
The limited yet expanding access to information, including via border trade with China, has hastened subtle change in a country that only allows state media focused on building the prestige of leader Kim, said Tae Yong-ho, the first North Korean defector to be elected as a South Korean lawmaker.
""In daytime, the population is shouting ‘long live Kim Jong Un’, but at night they all watch South Korean dramas and movies,” Tae said in an interview at the Reuters Next conference on Jan. 11.
At the same time, Kim vowed at a recent congress of the ruling party to expand wireless networks - which are heavily walled off from the outside - and to upgrade broadcasting to better serve viewers.
""It is needed to readjust the wire broadcasting and TV broadcasting systems, put the relevant technology on a higher level and provide full conditions for the people in all parts of the country from cities to remote mountain villages to enjoy better cultural and emotional life,"" Kim said in remarks to the gathering.

China’s most recognizable entrepreneur addressed scores of teachers on an online conference Wednesday, part of an annual event the billionaire hosts to recognize the achievements of rural educators. His appearance, first reported in a local blog, was confirmed by people familiar with the matter.
Ma’s re-emergence may help quell persistent rumors about his fate while Beijing pursues investigations into online finance titan Ant Group Co. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The executive had kept out of public view since early November, when Chinese regulators torpedoed Ant’s $35 billion IPO, tightened fintech regulations, then ordered an overhaul of Ant and launched a separate antitrust probe into Alibaba -- all in a span of days.
The assault on Ma’s trillion-dollar corporate empire encapsulates a broader campaign to rein in a generation of Chinese tech giants that Beijing now views as wielding too much control over the world’s No. 2 economy. The flurry of actions against his twin companies drove home how Beijing has lost patience with the outsize power of its technology moguls, perceived now as a threat to the political and financial stability President Xi Jinping prizes most.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Scientists in Beijing have developed a new gene therapy which can reverse some of the effects of ageing in mice and extend their lifespans, findings which may one day contribute to similar treatment for humans.
The method, detailed in a paper in the Science Translational Medicine journal earlier this month, involves inactivating a gene called kat7 which the scientists found to be a key contributor to cellular ageing.
    The specific therapy they used and the results were a world first, said co-supervisor of the project Professor Qu Jing, 40, a specialist in ageing and regenerative medicine from the Institute of Zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). 
    ""These mice show after 6-8 months overall improved appearance and grip strength and most importantly they have extended lifespan for about 25%,"" Qu said.
The team of biologists from different CAS departments used the CRISPR/Cas9 method to screen thousands of genes for those which were particularly strong drivers of cellular senescence, the term used to describe cellular ageing.
They identified 100 genes out of around 10,000, and kat7 was the most efficient at contributing to senescence in cells, Qu said.
Kat7 is one of tens of thousands of genes found in the cells of mammals. The researchers inactivated it in the livers of the mice using a method called a lentiviral vector.
""We just tested the function of the gene in different kinds of cell types, in the human stem cell, the mesenchymal progenitor cells, in the human liver cell and the mouse liver cell and for all of these cells we didn't see any detectable cellular toxicity. And for the mice, we also didn't see any side effect yet.""
Despite this, the method is a long way from being ready for human trials, Qu said.
    ""It's still definitely necessary to test the function of kat7 in other cell types of humans and other organs of mice and in the other pre-clinical animals before we use the strategy for human ageing or other health conditions,"" she said.
Qu said she hopes to be able to test the method on primates next, but it would require a lot of funding and much more research first.

    ""In the end, we hope that we can find a way to delay ageing even by a very minor percentage...in the future.""

Gertz said the U.S. Department of Justice had effectively declared ex-defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos innocent when it sent him back to Mexico and dropped U.S. charges against him after he was arrested in California last year.
He defended his own decision to close a Mexican probe into whether Cienfuegos had colluded with a drug cartel, saying the U.S. evidence was inconsistent, included questionable physical descriptions of the retired general, and used testimony from two dead witnesses.
The spat, one of several serious hiccups during the Trump administration, risks souring Mexico's most important bilateral relationship as the two countries seek to turn over a new leaf with the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden this week.
In an interview on Mexican radio, Gertz said he was being accused of bias in favor of Cienfuegos, something he described as ""a lynching,"" and that he was exploring his legal options at the level of ""all"" courts to which he had access.
He did not specify to which international tribunal he could go, but said he would consult with a Mexican judge who served at the International Court of Justice at The Hague.
The Justice Department last week said it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Mexico had decided to close the investigation, saying it fully stood by its own evidence and charges in the matter. 
It also said Mexico's decision to publish the evidence from the investigation violated a treaty of mutual legal assistance, and called into question future information sharing.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday exempted aid groups, the United Nations, the Red Cross and the export of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices from its designation of Yemen's Houthi movement as a foreign terrorist organization. 
The carve-outs are not enough to allay U.N. fears that Washington's move would push Yemen into a large-scale famine. The United Nations describes Yemen as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of its people in need.
""Our concern from the beginning ... is the impact on the commercial sector and that the vast majority of food and other basic supplies that come into Yemen comes in through the commercial sector,"" said U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
U.N. officials and aid groups said the designation will scare off commercial trade in Yemen, which relies almost solely on imports, creating a gap the humanitarian operation cannot fill regardless of U.S. humanitarian exemptions.
The United States has exempted the export to Yemen of agricultural commodities. Its description of that includes food for people, including raw, processed, and packaged foods, live animals, vitamins and minerals, and bottled drinking water.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the move against the Iran-aligned Houthis last week and it took effect on Tuesday, one day before Democratic President-elect Joe Biden succeeds Republican President Donald Trump.
Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a confirmation hearing on Tuesday: ""We would propose to review that immediately to make sure that what we are doing is not impeding the provision of humanitarian assistance.""
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis in a war widely seen as a proxy conflict between U.S. ally Saudi Arabia and Iran. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as Yemen's suffering is also worsened by an economic collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The designation freezes any U.S.-related assets of the Houthis, bans Americans from doing business with them and makes it a crime to provide support or resources to the movement.

EL FLORIDO, Guatemala (Reuters) - Guatemala on Tuesday pressed on with transporting migrants back to the border with Honduras, further thinning out a U.S.-bound caravan that was halted by security forces at the weekend.
Nearly 8,000 people entered Guatemala from Honduras last week, local authorities said. A Reuters witness estimated around a quarter of them, many with children, ended up stuck in the village of Vado Hondo when Guatemalan forces barred passage.
Security forces wielding batons cleared them from an impromptu camp on Monday, and buses provided by the government ferried them back to the El Florido border crossing with Honduras.
Returns of migrants by bus were ongoing on Tuesday, the government said, adding that the trips were voluntary.
Migrants also face major challenges if they make it to Mexico. Those who reach the Mexican border must present recent negative COVID-19 tests to legally enter, Maximiliano Reyes, a Mexican deputy foreign minister said on Tuesday.
Reyes told news network Milenio that 4,500-5,000 of the migrants had been sent back from Guatemala, with others still weighing their options. He estimated around 1,000 migrants had fanned out inside Guatemala.
Some migrants said they were injured as security officials forced them from the road in Vado Hondo.
""It's not fair that they treat us like dogs, like animals,"" said Andy Osorio from Honduras. 
Guatemala's human rights ombudsman, Jordan Rodas, called on the military and police to avoid the use of force. The Guatemalan army said some migrants had thrown stones at soldiers, who used ""minimal and proportionate force.""
Some in the caravan fled into the mountains during the road clearance, saying they did not want to board the buses. 

""We're running,"" said Rosa Alvarez, a Honduran mother traveling with children, who said they had been affected by teargas used by Guatemalan authorities. ""We have no money or food.""

SAG-AFTRA, which represents some 160,000 actors, journalists and other media professionals, said in a statement that it had ordered a meeting of its disciplinary committee regarding Trump's role in the Jan. 6 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol.
“Donald Trump attacked the values that this union holds most sacred – democracy, truth, respect for our fellow Americans of all races and faiths, and the sanctity of the free press,” said Gabrielle Carteris, president of SAG-AFTRA.
""There's a straight line from his wanton disregard for the truth to the attacks on journalists perpetrated by his followers,” she added in a statement.
Trump earned his SAG membership from his appearances as himself in a slew of Hollywood films and TV shows ranging from ""Home Alone 2"" to ""Sex and the City"" in the early 1990s.
He cemented his celebrity status as host and producer of the TV reality series ""The Apprentice"" and spinoff ""Celebrity Apprentice"" from 2004-2015.
The union cited what it said was Trump's role inciting the attack by his supporters on the Capitol and said he had kept up ""a reckless campaign of misinformation aimed at discrediting and ultimately threatening the safety of journalists"".
It did not say when the disciplinary meeting would be held. The disciplinary committee can impose measure ranging from fines to expulsion from the union.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted last week to impeach Trump on charges of incitement over the attack which followed the president urging his supporters to fight the election victory of Democrat Joe Biden. 

The Senate has yet to schedule a trial to determine Trump's guilt or innocence. Trump, who leaves office on Wednesday, falsely claims he lost the November election due to widespread voting fraud.

An explosion had earlier hit a government-owned crude oil transportation company in the city and oil tankers loading crude oil from the installation then caught fire, state media reported.
The governor of Homs, Bassam Barsik, was quoted on state media as saying civil defence teams were working on extinguishing the fire that erupted during ""the loading of crude oil"".
""There are no human casualties and we are working on containing the spread of the fire,"" Barsik said.
It was not clear if the explosions were an accident or the result of sabotage in a war-torn country where violence has subsided but insurgents and rebels still wage attacks in government-held areas.
There have been hit-and-run attacks on government forces in the central province of Homs in recent months by remnants of Islamic State militants who take shelter in outlying, sparsely populated areas. 
The Russian air force has also been active in recent weeks in helping the Syrian army bomb suspected hideouts of militants in the Homs area.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Alexei Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most prominent critic who was jailed at the weekend, on Tuesday released a video in which he and his allies alleged that an opulent palace belonged to the Russian leader, a claim the Kremlin denied.
The allegations, which first surfaced in 2010 when a businessman wrote about them to then-President Dmitry Medvedev complaining of official graft, come as Navalny's supporters urge people to join nationwide protests on Saturday.
Reuters reported in 2014 that the estate in southern Russia had been partly funded by taxpayer money from a $1 billion hospital project. A spokesman for Putin at the time did not respond to questions about Reuters' findings.
Navalny and his anti-corruption foundation published what they said were previously unseen photographs and detailed 3-D visualisations based on floor plans of the lavish interior along with a paper trail they said proved the 100 billion-rouble ($1.36 billion) Black Sea palace ultimately belonged to Putin.
Reuters could not independently verify their authenticity.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the palace allegations were old and untrue.
""I'm not familiar with this investigation,"" Peskov was cited as saying by the Interfax News Agency. ""However, I can immediately say that this is an old record. We explained many years ago that Putin does not have any palace in Gelendzhik (in southern Russia).""
The video, which has attracted more than 3 million views on YouTube, showed the palace contained a casino, theatre, ornate Tsarist-style interiors and an underground ice rink.
Navalny and his allies have released several investigations into alleged official corruption, using them to try to increase support for the opposition politician and his movement.
Navalny is being held in pre-trial detention for alleged parole violations after returning from Russia on Sunday for the first time since being poisoned last summer.
A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) events page for the planned protest in Moscow suggested around 2,000 people planned to go.
Navalny said in the video that it was time for Russians to force a change in leadership.
""Stop waiting and spending our lives and our taxes on the enrichment of these people,"" he said. ""Don't be silent!"" 
Navalny faces four legal cases, all of which he says are politically motivated, that could see him jailed for years if found guilty.
A court in Moscow is due to hear one of them on Wednesday - allegations that he defamed a World War Two veteran, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.
Peskov told reporters earlier on Tuesday that the Kremlin regarded Navalny's protest calls as alarming, but said it did not fear mass demonstrations. Mass gatherings are banned in Moscow during the coronavirus pandemic.
Peskov said the authorities would not be influenced by foreign countries calling for sanctions against Russia over its treatment of Navalny.
""This is an absolutely domestic matter and we will not allow anyone to interfere in it,"" he said.

GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic could be the catalyst for much-needed reform of the World Health Organization just as the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986 forced urgent changes at the U.N. nuclear agency, an independent review panel said on Tuesday.
The panel, set up to investigate the global response to the coronavirus, said the WHO is underpowered, underfunded and required fundamental reform to give it the resources it needs to respond more effectively to deadly disease outbreaks.
""We are not here to assign blame, but to make concrete recommendations to help the world respond faster and better in future,"" the panel's co-chair, former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, told a news briefing.
The panel's report said earlier that Chinese officials should have applied public health measures more forcefully in January to curb the initial COVID-19 outbreak, and criticised the WHO for not declaring an international emergency until Jan. 30.
At the WHO's Executive Board on Tuesday, China defended its early actions to fight the outbreak in the city of Wuhan and rejected some paragraphs of the panel report as being ""inconsistent with the facts"".
""While the pathogen was still unknown, the public was advised to avoid enclosed, unventilated and crowded places. Wearing masks was also recommended for going out. Wuhan closed the Huanan seafood wholesale market on the first of January 2020,"" said Sun Yang of China's National Health Commission. 
Such ""extraordinary public health measures"" were taken while virulence and transmissibility were still unclear, but they ""won precious time for China and the world to fight the virus"", Sun said. 
REFORMS
The United States and European Union backed drawing up reform proposals for a ministerial meeting in May.
""We must rise to this occasion even as we combat the pandemic and resurrect our economies,"" said Garrett Grigsby, head of the U.S. delegation.
The U.N. agency was rocked by a decision last year by the United States to halt its funding, and has been accused of being too close to China early in the pandemic, which the WHO denies.
Germany's Bjoern Kuemmel called for ""common responsibility and investment in global health preparedness. To defend the status quo or to only implement the so-called low-hanging fruit cannot be an option"".
Johnson Sirleaf said she believed the WHO ""is reformable"".
WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the board that the WHO was ""committed to accountability"" and change.
Johnson Sirleaf and her co-chair, former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, noted repeatedly that the WHO's ability to enforce its advice, or enter countries to investigate the source of disease outbreaks, is severely curtailed. 
They said the pandemic had shown that the WHO's 194 member states must act swiftly to reform the agency, boost its funding, and give it powers to enforce international health regulations.
""Is that this (Chernobyl) moment for WHO and the global health system?,"" Clark asked, adding that WHO member states ""are going to have to face up to this"".

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's government, which has made hostility to LGBT people a central part of its right-wing agenda, ordered a publisher on Tuesday to print disclaimers identifying books containing ""behaviour inconsistent with traditional gender roles"".
The government said the action was needed to protect consumers from being misled, after Labrisz, a Lesbian group, published a fairytale anthology, ""Wonderland Is For Everyone"", which included some stories with gay themes.
The book, whose authors say it is intended to teach children to be respectful of people of all backgrounds, features a tale of a doe who is granted a wish to become a buck, and a poem about a prince who marries another prince.
Other stories depict minorities in a positive light, including Roma and disabled people. The character Snow White, renamed Leaf Brown, has dark skin.
""The book is sold as a fairytale, called so on its cover and designed accordingly, but it hides the fact that it depicts behaviour inconsistent with traditional gender roles,"" the Government Office in Budapest said in a statement.
The order requires Labrisz to put disclaimers on all its books with such content, including ""Wonderland Is For Everyone"".
Labrisz and an allied gay rights group called Hatter said they would sue the government over the disclaimer requirement, which they called discriminatory and unconstitutional.
As in nearby Poland, Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has adopted increasingly hostile rhetoric and policies towards LGBT groups in the past year.
Last year Hungary banned recognising transgender identities in official documents, and amended the constitution to declare that in a family ""the father is a man and the mother is a woman"".
Orban's homophobic politics suffered a setback in December when a senior European Parliament lawmaker from his Fidesz party was caught fleeing a gay orgy in Brussels, in violation of pandemic restrictions and in possession of drugs.

Neither of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, detailed any conclusions of the vetting and it was unclear what information led the Guard members to be pulled. One of the officials said possibly more than two Guard members could be removed following vetting.
On Sunday, acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller said that the FBI was assisting the U.S. military in vetting more than 25,000 National Guard troops being deployed to assist in protecting the U.S. Capitol for potential security concerns.
The vetting has been going on since last week, and the FBI is also working to see if any attackers from the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol were current service members.
Last week, the Virginia National Guard said that Jacob Fracker, an off-duty police officer charged in connection with the violent riots at the Capitol, was a corporal in the state's Guard and serves as an infantryman.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Virginia man with an apparent leadership role in the far-right militia group known as the ""Oath Keepers"" was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly ""planning and coordinating"" the Jan. 6 breach of the U.S. Capitol, the Justice Department said.
Thomas Edward Caldwell, 65, of Clarke County, Virginia is one of several members of the Oath Keepers named in a criminal complaint as having participated in the Capitol riots by President Donald Trump's supporters.
He faces charges of conspiring to commit an offense, obstructing an official government proceeding, unlawful entry and disorderly conduct.
Other members of the Oath Keepers who were also charged include Jessica Watkins, 38, of Champaign County, Ohio, who in the criminal complaint referred to herself on her Parler account as the ""C.O. (commanding officer) of the Ohio State Regular Militia,"" as well as Donovan Ray Crowl, also of Ohio.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, describes the Oath Keepers as ""one of the largest radical anti-government groups in the U.S.,"" which believes in ""baseless conspiracy theories about the federal government working to destroy the liberties of Americans.""
In a criminal complaint, investigators said Caldwell used Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to communicate with fellow members of the Oath Keepers and helped make hotel arrangements for their stay in the Washington, D.C. area.
He later posted photos from the siege, saying ""Us storming the castle. Please share... I am such an instigator!""
Caldwell then urged members to storm state capitols. ""Let's storm the capitol in Ohio! Tell me when!"" he wrote.
The FBI has been combing through well over 140,000 videos and photos to track down suspects who participated in the assault on the U.S. Capitol, in which supporters of President Trump forced their way into the building, ransacked offices and documented much of the attack on social media.
Michael Sherwin, the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., has said he suspects hundreds will face charges in the investigation, which is unprecedented in size and scope.
As the arrests have mounted, many of the suspects are accused of having ties to far-right fringe groups such as the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, another right-wing group, or they are characterized as white supremacists or Nazi sympathizers.

One such person who will make his initial appearance in a federal court in New Jersey on Tuesday is Timothy Hale-Cusanelli. Investigators said he is a U.S. Army reservist with a security clearance whom they described as ""an avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer who posts video opinion statements on YouTube proffering extreme political opinions and viewpoints.""

BREST, France (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron opened the door on Tuesday to withdrawing some troops from Africa's Sahel region, saying France could ""adjust"" its operations after successes against Islamist militants and the arrival of more European forces.
France, the former colonial power, has the West's largest military presence waging counter-insurgency operations in Mali and the wider Sahel, an arid region of west Africa just below the Sahara desert.
Last year, Paris boosted its troop numbers for its Barkhane counter-terrorism operations by 600 to 5,100 soldiers.
""The temporary reinforcements that I decided to deploy have enabled the Barkhane force to put in great difficulty terrorist groups, which find themselves cornered and reduced to cowardly acts,"" Macron said in his annual New Year's wishes to the military.
""The results obtained by our forces in the Sahel, combined with the greater intervention of our European partners, will allow us to adjust our effort,"" he said, referring to the arrival of special forces from various European Union countries in recent months. 
Though Macron hailed successes against militants, the situation remains fragile. Five French soldiers have been killed in Mali this year and four U.N. peacekeepers were killed there last week.
Militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have strengthened their foothold across the region, making large swathes of territory ungovernable and stoking ethnic violence, especially in Mali and Burkina Faso.
Diplomatic and military sources have said France is expected to announce a partial withdrawal by mid-February. Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly has said Macron and regional heads of state will discuss the situation at a summit in Chad next month.

An opinion poll published last week showed for the first time that the majority of French people oppose the operation in the Sahel. That has put pressure on Macron to consider a bigger withdrawal before a 2022 presidential election.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on a ship involved in building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to take Russian natural gas to Europe, as the Trump administration sought to raise pressure on the project on its last full day in office. 
The U.S. Treasury Department said it imposed the sanctions on the Russian pipe-laying ship ""Fortuna"" and its owner, KVT-RUS, under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).
Nord Stream 2, designed to double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream undersea gas pipeline, would take gas to Europe via Germany, bypassing Ukraine, which would deprive Kiev of lucrative transit fees.
The project is a rising point of contention between Moscow and Washington. The United States, eager to sell Europe more exports of liquefied natural gas, says Nord Stream 2 would increase Russia's economic and political leverage over Europe. Moscow and Germany say it is a commercial project. 
""The United States is not afraid to hold accountable those who continue to aid and abet this tool of Russian coercion,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
The State Department said it would consider further actions in the near term, under CAATSA and under new sanctions expanded in the annual defense policy bill.
Hours before the official announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the project was under ""unlawful"" U.S. pressure and that the Kremlin was closely watching developments in order to ensure the pipeline's completion.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who will replace President Donald Trump on Wednesday, has opposed Nord Stream 2 in the past, but it is unclear whether he could compromise on the issue after taking office on Wednesday.
Germany, which wants gas as it weans itself off nuclear and coal-fired power plants, was disappointed by the move. ""We're taking note of the announcement with regret,"" the Economy Ministry spokesman said in Berlin on Monday, after Washington gave Berlin early word of the sanctions. 
RISKS OF BEING SCRAPPED
Russia's state-owned gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) leads the $11 billion project with Western partners Uniper, Wintershall, Engie, OMV and Shell (LON:RDSa).
Gazprom acknowledged in a Eurobond prospectus seen by Reuters on Tuesday that there are risks the project may be suspended or scrapped amid political pressure.
Gazprom suspended work on the pipeline in late 2019 after the main pipe-laying company, Allseas, dropped out after Trump signed other sanctions.
Work resumed last month when a small 1.6 mile (2.6 km) stretch of the pipeline was built in German waters.
More than 90% of the project has been completed, but more than 62 miles (100 km) of pipeline must still be laid in deep waters off Denmark in an area that requires highly-specialized construction equipment.
According to Refinitiv ship-tracking data, the Fortuna is still anchored in the Baltic Sea near Rostock in northern Germany.

The ceremony will be the first federal event memorializing the country's COVID-19 victims and will occur on the last day of Donald Trump's presidency, after the Trump administration's pandemic response has been blamed for the United States having the highest COVID-19 death toll of any country in the world. 
The United States was on track to reach two grim COVID-19 milestones on Tuesday - 24 million infections and 400,000 lives lost during the pandemic, according to a Reuters tally. The country has recorded more than 200,000 new cases and 3,220 deaths on average over the last seven days. (Graphic: https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/)
The memorial planned by the incoming White House leadership was scheduled to take place at 5:15 p.m. ET (2215 GMT) at the Reflecting Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) at the Lincoln Memorial, followed by a moment of silence and 400 bell tolls in Georgetown to symbolically honor the COVID-19 dead.
""The memorial will feature the lighting around the reflecting pool at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, and hundreds of towns, cities, tribes, landmarks, and communities all across the country have committed to joining the tribute in a national moment of unity,"" Biden's inaugural committee said in a statement.
The inaugural committee said it was encouraging Americans to light candles in their windows in a show of unity, and that national landmarks including the Empire State building in New York City and the Space Needle in Seattle would be lit simultaneously.
Biden plans to make coronavirus relief a top priority when he takes office on Wednesday under unprecedented security measures in the nation's capital. 
Many of Biden's policy plans fly in the face of the Trump administration's approach to combating the pandemic. They include a federal mask mandate that would apply to federal properties, planes and buses and an immediate recommitment to the World Health Organization after Trump's withdrawal from the agency.
While outgoing President Donald Trump had no public events set for Tuesday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to convene the White House Coronavirus Task Force for its last meeting under his watch.

Tehran's move, announced on the last full day of the Trump administration, allows the seizure of any assets in Iran of sanctioned individuals. There have been no reports of any such assets, so the move is unlikely to have financial impact on the outgoing U.S. president or officials. 
The Trump administration rained sanctions down on Iranian officials, politicians and companies after withdrawing the United States in 2018 from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.
Among officials sanctioned by Iran were Secretary of State Mike Pompeo; ex-Defense Secretary Mark Esper; Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, the Foreign ministry said in a statement carried by state media.
Other blacklisted individuals included Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel; former National Security Adviser John Bolton; former U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook; Elliott Abrams, Washington's special representative on Iran and Venezuela; and Treasury Department sanctions official Andrea Gacki, it said.
The officials were blacklisted ""for their role in terrorist and anti-human rights activities against Iran and its citizens"", Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said.

Lothar Wieler, chair of the independent panel, told the WHO's Executive Board: ""There is a growing belief in the Committee that most improvements can be achieved through a more effective implementation of the existing mechanism of IHR and do not require at this point changes to the IHR.""
The rules, which went into force in 2007, require WHO's 194 member states to advise WHO within 24 hours about health emergencies. They lay down provisions for taking measures on international travel and trade if justified on health grounds.
""Countries may be reluctant to report on events if they perceive consequences, mainly related to travel and trade, deriving from early notification.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Talks aimed at overcoming a years-long deadlock over disarmament at the United Nations began in acrimony on Tuesday with two countries blocking rivals from taking part in widely criticised manoeuvres that sparked concern about the forum's future.
Iran blocked Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates from joining as observers, lashing out at the former's military record, while Turkey blocked Cyprus in a trend that marks a significant departure from normal U.N. protocol and might set a precedent for other bodies that operate on a consensus basis.
Iran's delegate said that Saudi Arabia had used the forum as a platform for a ""distraction and disinformation campaign"" and called Riyadh ""the largest military offender in the region"".
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a close ally, intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to fight the Iran-backed Houthi movement, while Turkey and Cyprus have long been at odds over the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the island's north.
Saudi Arabia's mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cyprus expressed ""deep regret"" at Turkey's decision.
""It is a sign that the Conference on Disarmament is at a crossroads and if it wants to remain relevant and useful it has to do some soul-searching,"" said Marc Finaud, former diplomat and security expert at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy.
Another diplomat called it a ""new low"" for the body while the Secretary-General of the Conference on Disarmament, Tatiana Valovaya, said she was ""disappointed"" with the way it had opened. ""As a general principle, exclusion undermines the fundamental concept of multilateralism,"" Valovaya said.
The blockages drew criticism from other members including Britain, the United States, European Union and India.
""If we are going to start picking and choosing then I think this will be the beginning of the end of multilateralism,"" British Ambassador Aidan Liddle told the virtual meeting. He urged Iran and Turkey to reverse their positions.
The two-month-long talks that began on Monday form part of the world's only multilateral forum for disarmament.
Diplomats' expectations for new deals in the 65-member forum are very low, with agreements often stymied by arms producers in a forum that makes decisions by consensus.
Its last major agreement was the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
Still, the conference's current president Belgium said on its Twitter feed on Monday that it hoped to set out a work programme ""after too many years of deadlock"". 

It is not unheard of to block other U.N. members from observing U.N. forums although in the past these have pertained to decades-old sovereignty disputes.

Russian state television broadcast footage of Putin, with the air temperature at minus 14 Celsius (6.8 Fahrenheit), removing a sheepskin coat to enter the icy waters and submerging himself three times beneath the surface, in front of an ice-sculpted cross. 
Putin, 68, grew up under Communist rule where open shows of religion were frowned upon. As president, he has become a frequent attender of Russian Orthodox ceremonies, and has given the church a major voice in society.
Each year on Epiphany, Orthodox believers immerse themselves in rivers and lakes to commemorate the baptism of Jesus Christ in the River Jordan.

Daytime protests in Tunis and some other cities demanding jobs, dignity and the release of detainees have followed clashes over recent nights between security forces and youths, as COVID-19 restrictions add to wider economic malaise. 
""The whole system must go... We will return to the streets and we will regain our rights and our dignity that a corrupt elite seized after the revolution,"" said Maher Abid, an unemployed protester. 
Shortly before last week's 10th anniversary of the revolution, Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi's government ordered a four-day lockdown, a tighter night-time curfew and a ban on protests. 
However, in cities across the country youths have thrown stones and petrol bombs, burnt tyres and looted shops, while police have deployed tear gas and batons, arresting hundreds. 
Up to 250 people gathered in central Tunis' Bourguiba Avenue on Tuesday while other demonstrations took place in towns near Sidi Bouzid, where the 2011 revolution began. The toppling then of Tunisia's long-serving ruler inspired similar uprisings across the region dubbed the ""Arab Spring"". 
Protesters in all three rallies chanted ""the people want the fall of the regime"", as well as demands for jobs. Tunisia was suffering economically even before the COVID-19 crisis, with high unemployment and declining state services. 

Earlier on Tuesday, the powerful labour union and other rights groups voiced support for peaceful protests against ""policies of marginalisation, impoverishment and starvation"", accusing the state of squandering the revolution's hopes.

A total of 22 workers were left trapped in the Hushan mine, in Shandong province, after an explosion on Jan. 10. A week later, it emerged that at least 12 of them were still alive as a note retrieved from the mine said: ""We hope the rescue won't stop."" 
A drilled channel on Sunday located 11 of the miners, who were working more than 600 metres underground, and rescuers were subsequently able to speak to them via wired telephone.
The official Xinhua news agency said the miners had requested on Monday evening sausage and pickles as well as porridge but medical experts decided they should not eat hard food having only just regained their strength. 
Fortified by the food and medical supplies - the fourth consignment to reach the group - two workers who had previously been very weak were able to walk again on Tuesday, Xinhua reported, citing a member of the rescue team.
However, the People's Daily said one worker was in a coma, in a critical condition, after sustaining a head injury in the blast, while two were ""mildly unwell"" and eight in good health.
One more worker has been located in another section of the mine, while the whereabouts of the other 10 remain unknown. 
News that some of the miners are still alive has boosted Chinese netizens' hopes for a miraculous escape, with thousands leaving prayer messages on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) platform and calling on the authorities to ""please speed up the rescue"".
China's National Mine Safety Administration has ordered a comprehensive inspection of the country's non-coal mines, which will run until the end of March, the People's Daily reported.
There are 32,000 non-coal mines in China, most of which are small, use outdated technology and equipment, and have poor safety management, it said, citing an administration official.

Vaccination campaigns are conducted by the 27 EU governments who decide their pace and priority groups. The Commission did not clarify how it intended to boost production capacity of vaccine makers to reach its bold vaccination goal.
The Brussels-based EU executive commission said EU states should have vaccinated 70% of all adult people by the summer, a feat that could involve inoculation of more than 200 million people, most likely with two doses each.
By March at least 80% of people over the age of 80, and 80% of healthcare workers should also be vaccinated in each EU states, the Commission recommended.
Key to reach these targets is the availability of large amounts of vaccines.
The EU has booked nearly 2.3 billion doses of COVID-19 shots and candidates, but only two have so far received regulatory approval in the EU. 
The EU has secured a total of 600 million doses of the vaccine developed by  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) and its German partner BioNTech, and expects them to be delivered by the end of the year despite early snags in deliveries.
The Commission is also urging EU states to boost their capacity to sequence the coronavirus in order to detect new variants.
It called on EU governments to sequence at least 5% of all positive tests whereas at the moment many states test less than 1% of samples. 

It also said it was working with EU states to adopt by the end of the month a common approach on vaccination certificates to facilitate travel.

NEW DELHI/BHUBANESWAR, India (Reuters) - India appealed to frontline workers on Tuesday not to refuse vaccines for COVID-19, after almost all states failed to meet their targets in the first few days of one of the world's biggest immunisation campaigns.
The country has so far vaccinated 631,417 frontline workers with two shots manufactured locally, one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), and another developed at home by Bharat Biotech in partnership with the state-run India Council of Medical Research.
The programme started on Saturday, with 30 million healthcare and other front-line workers first in the queue.
The health ministry said India inoculated more people on its first day than the United States, Britain and France did. But it said it expected a greater number of volunteers to come forward, especially in major states like Tamil Nadu and Punjab that are lagging behind other states.
Vinod K. Paul, who heads a government committee on vaccine strategy, told a news conference that health workers who failed to take vaccine doses that had been set aside for them were not fulfilling their ""societal responsibility"".
""Please understand the whole world is clamouring for vaccines,"" he said. ""If our healthcare workers, our doctors and nurses, if they are declining to take it, I feel sorry,"" he said. ""I plead with them, on behalf of the government, because we don't know what shape this pandemic will take going forward.""
Some doctors have expressed doubt about the Bharat Biotech vaccine, which was given approval for emergency use without efficacy data from late-stage clinical trials. The government says it is safe and effective. Paul said he had received his own shot of it on the first day.
India, the world's biggest vaccine maker, plans to start exporting shots as early as Wednesday.
Cases have come down in recent months. On Tuesday India reported 10,064 infections, the lowest in seven months, taking the total to 10.58 million. Deaths rose by an eight-month low figure of 137, taking the overall tally to 152,556.

It follows weeks of negotiation after a political dialogue in Tunis in November among 75 Libyans, selected by the U.N. Libya mission, charted a roadmap towards elections but failed to agree on how to form an interim government. 
Libya has known little peace since Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011, in an uprising backed by NATO, and has been split since 2014 between warring factions that have set up rival administrations in the west and east.
The mechanism to choose a transitional government was proposed on Saturday by a smaller committee, drawn from the political dialogue members, that met in Geneva last week. It was voted on by the full body on Monday and Tuesday. 
It means the group will soon turn to the nomination and choice of a unified government to prepare for the Dec. 24 presidential and parliamentary elections - a process that is no less fraught with potential for bitter disputes. 
Both the main coalitions in western and eastern Libya are honeycombed with rivalries, and any move that cuts out powerful figures could unleash a new bout of the fighting that has already sucked in other powers.

In Tripoli in the west, the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) is backed by Turkey. In the east, Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's military located the body of American mountaineer Alex Goldfarb-Rumyantzev on Monday in the Karakoram mountains in northern Pakistan, the second death of a foreign climber in the area in less than a week.
A helicopter team spotted Goldfarb's remains during a search and rescue operation that began on Sunday, according to the Alpine Club of Pakistan. 
He appeared to have fallen off the mountain, Hungarian expedition company Magyar Expedicios, which was supporting the climbers, said in a statement.
Goldfarb and Hungarian Zoltan Szlanko were planning to climb the 8,047 metre (26,400 feet) high Broad Peak, which has yet to be ascended in winter, without the use of oxygen or any porters for help, according to Magyar Expedicios.
To acclimate for that climb, the pair set out to climb nearby Pastore Peak, 6,209 metres )high, but were met with harsh winter conditions and Szlanko decided to turn back, while Goldfarb continued alone.
Szlanko joined the search for his partner after he failed to return as planned on Saturday.
Goldfarb, a medical doctor and a lecturer at Harvard University in Boston, had volunteered to treat COVID-19 patients since the outset of the pandemic, his son Levi Goldfarb told Reuters.
“He thought (mountain climbing) was beautiful,"" Levi said.
""He thought it was liberating, because up in the mountains it didn’t really matter who you were at sea level -- a doctor, a lawyer, or even a thief, all of those labels were stripped away and you were playing by a different set of rules. He made great friends in the mountains, he saved lives and was saved [by others] himself, and he travelled the world doing it.”
Spanish climber Sergio Mingote also died in the Karakoram mountains on Saturday, after he fell down a crevasse while attempting to make his way down to Base Camp on K2, the world's second-highest mountain. 
Travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic dampened the traditionally active summer months of mountaineering in the region last year.

The migrants, all from sub-Saharan Africa and nine of whom sustained injuries that required hospital treatment, were among around 150 who tried to climb over the six-metre (20-ft) fence.
Melilla and Ceuta - a second Spanish enclave also on Africa's northern coast - are popular crossing points for illegal African migrants trying to get into Europe.
Spain sends many who make it across the fences back to Morocco, and most of those who crossed on Tuesday were sent to a local migrant centre where they will be identified and their situation assessed, authorities said.

Fewer migrants crossed the land border into Ceuta and Melilla last year than in 2019, though overall numbers intercepted crossing into Spain rose 29% to almost 42,000, mainly because of a steep increase in arrivals by sea on the Canary Islands.

1552,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2021 09:26AM ET</span>","Analysis: Saudi overtures to wary Biden team driven by worries over Iran, economy","By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Marwa Rashad
RIYADH/LONDON (Reuters) - After months out of the spotlight, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has returned centre stage with diplomatic and economic moves which diplomats say are aimed at showing the new U.S. president he is a valuable partner who can get things done.
Within the span of a few weeks, the kingdom announced an Arab deal to reconcile with Qatar, voluntary cuts to Saudi crude output to help stabilise markets and new momentum on an economic diversification plan that stumbled due to political controversy, low oil prices and COVID-19.
Whether behind the scenes or front and centre chairing a Gulf summit for the first time, the young prince, known as MbS, is moving to present an image as a reliable statesman and set a pragmatic tone with a less accommodating Biden administration, especially on foe Iran, three foreign diplomats said.
The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Prince Mohammed's initial image as a bold reformer was battered by the 2018 murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents seen as close to MbS, and moves to crush dissent and sideline royal rivals. He denies ordering Khashoggi's killing while saying he ultimately bore responsibility as it happened under his watch.
The kingdom's de facto ruler knows ""a new era has started"" without the buffer granted by President Donald Trump and that Riyadh needs to make some concessions on contentious issues like human rights in order to push for priorities like the Iran nuclear accord (JCPOA), a Western diplomat in the region said.
President-elect Joe Biden, who is expected to re-engage with Iran, has said he would take a firmer stand on Saudi's human rights record and the Yemen war.
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan told CNBC in November that Riyadh wants to partner with the Biden administration on a potential new nuclear pact which he said could be labeled ""JCPOA++"", to include Iran's ballistic missiles and ""malign activity"". 
Saudi Arabia does not want the 2015 deal back on the table, the diplomat said, adding that recent positive gestures by Riyadh appeared to be related to the change of administration in Washington.
He said that included recent sentences handed by Saudi courts for a prominent women's rights activist and a U.S.-Saudi physician, with the convictions signalling Riyadh would brook no dissent while reduced jail terms served as a nod to Washington.
RULES OF THE GAME
Another foreign diplomat said Riyadh's nervousness over Biden's Iran policy was one reason it lobbied the Trump administration to blacklist Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group, which has launched cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia.
Prince Mohammed was keen to impose some rules for addressing the Iran question and Yemen while also presenting Saudi Arabia as a high profile member of the global community that should be defended, the diplomat said.
Riyadh welcomed the Houthi designation as a foreign terrorist group, saying this would ""neutralise"" a threat posed by the Houthis by depriving them of arms and funds and bringing them back to the negotiating table.
U.N. officials warned that the designation, which takes effect on Jan. 19, may push Yemen into a large-scale famine and urged Biden to revoke it.
Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies, concerned about Iran's missiles and regional proxies, supported Trump's maximum pressure campaign on Tehran and hailed his decision in 2018 to quit ""a flawed"" international nuclear deal. They have stressed that this time, they should be part of any talks.
The Sunni Muslim kingdom has been locked in a decades long rivalry with Shi'ite Iran for regional influence that has shaped conflicts in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. 
A major U.S. arms buyer, Saudi Arabia was shaken by attacks on its energy installations in 2019, and in the aftermath received stepped up defence support from Trump.
CURRYING FAVOUR
Security, vital for regional economic prospects, is also a key consideration for other Gulf leaders who have been preparing for a Biden presidency by positioning themselves as a moderating force in a turbulent region and hedging their bets.
The United Arab Emirates, wary of Iran and the perceived threat posed by Islamist movements, struck a U.S.-brokered deal to establish ties with Israel that created a new anti-Iran dynamic and opened the door for Abu Dhabi to new U.S. arms and bipartisan goodwill. Bahrain followed suit.
Although the UAE's divisions with Qatar run deep, it fell in line with a U.S. and Saudi push to end a more than three-year row and restore ties severed over issues including Qatar's ties with Iran and Turkey and its support of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Efforts to resolve the rift had been going on for over a year but gained momentum in recent months.
""The Qatar deal is a way to have the Gulf states aligned with Israel to oppose the nuclear deal in particular and Iran in general,"" the Western diplomat said.
Qatar's foreign minister recently said it was the right time for talks with Iran and that Doha could facilitate discussions.
DISTRACTIONS
Saudi Arabia also wants to make up for lost time, and money, a fourth diplomat said, as coronavirus frustrated plans in 2020 to refocus attention on MbS' ambitious diversification drive after some foreign investors were spooked by the Khashoggi murder and a secretive anti-corruption purge.
MbS made a rare TV appearance on Jan 13. to unveil a zero-carbon city as the first major construction project for NEOM, the $500 billion flagship business zone that has seen little progress since it was announced to fanfare in 2017.
A few days later he was shown alone in his private desert camp announcing investment opportunities worth $6 trillion in a virtual speech at the World Economic Forum.

""Saudi Arabia faces an enormous challenge in transforming its domestic economy and after COVID-19 the path is much more perilous. They need money and partners and they need global engagement,"" said Kristin Smith Diwan, senior resident scholar at the Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute.

AL-QAIM, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq is tightening security along its 600 km (400 mile) border with Syria to curb the movement of Islamic State militants, drug smuggling and other illegal activities.
Iraqi commanders on Monday toured the remote desert frontier controlled by various different forces, including the Iraqi military, Iran-aligned militias, the Syrian army, anti-Damascus rebels, and U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.
The border is a flashpont for tension between Iran-backed groups and the United States, and is also tense because of Islamic State incursions and Turkish pressure on Kurdish rebel groups.
At an outpost facing into Syria, Lieutenant-General Abdul Amir al-Shammari said the Iraqi side was under the control of state forces and was being more tightly secured, but that the main challenges came from inside Syria.
""One of the biggest challenges is there's no one single or unified security partner on the Syrian side,"" he said. 
""In this area, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are across the border - whom we coordinate with via the (U.S.) coalition,"" he said, referring to U.S.-backed, Kurdish-dominated paramilitaries battling Islamic State remnants and also opposed to Turkey.
""Further south, there's the Syrian army, and in some areas beyond that, control by Syrian opposition groups,"" Shammari said.
Iraq was stepping up use of high-tech thermal cameras and observation balloons, he said.
Reuters reporters touring the border by air with the military saw diggers making deeper trenches along large sections of the Iraqi side of the frontier, which is sparsely peppered with border guard towers, earth berms and metal fences.
Shammari said some families of IS fighters had recently been detained after crossing from Al-Hol, a displacement camp on the Syrian side housing tens of thousands of people who fled IS's final enclaves.
Officials worry Al-Hol is a breeding ground for extremism and fear the return of thousands of Iraqis with ties to IS.
The border has recently also seen Israeli air strikes against Iranian-linked targets including Revolutionary Guards commanders as Israel increases pressure on allies of Iran and of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
The Iraqi military is in the difficult position of coordinating with state paramilitaries that include the Iran-aligned groups which are facing off with Israel and the United States and transfer weapons and personnel across the frontier.

Iraq also navigates a growing relationship with Turkey which wants Baghdad to help clamp down on activities of the Kurdish PKK insurgent group, which has bases in northern Iraq and allies in the SDF.

""We have rescued 11 men, 15 women and a child. They're all in good health,"" a coastguard official said, adding that the migrants are believed to be from Somalia. 
Greece was on the front line of a migration crisis in 2015-2016 when hundreds of thousands of people used Lesbos, a few miles from the Turkish coast, and nearby islands in the northern Aegean Sea as the main entry point to Europe.
The influx of refugees and migrants to Greece fell by 80% last year compared to 2019. But more than 15,000 arrived by sea and land, data from the United Nations refugees agency UNHCR showed, and even in winter some are still attempting the risky sea passage on dinghies from Turkey.
Turkey hosts more than three million refugees and migrants and more than 90,000 are also in Greece, mostly housed in overcrowded camps while waiting for their applications for asylum to be processed.
The issue came to the forefront again in September after a camp on Lesbos was razed by a fire, leaving tens of thousands of asylum-seekers without shelter.

Athens has promised to build new, better-equipped reception centres on the islands of Lesbos, Samos, Chios, Leros and Kos by autumn and cut the maximum stay in camps on its islands to no more than six months.

LONDON (Reuters) - Lawyers for Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, asked a London judge on Tuesday to rule in her favour in a privacy case against a tabloid newspaper without a trial, arguing the publication has no prospect of winning.
Meghan, 39, the wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing Associated Newspapers after its Mail on Sunday printed extracts of a handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.
She is seeking aggravated damages, saying the publication of the letter was a misuse of private information and breached her copyright.
The paper has said the duchess was willing for other private matters to become public if it suited her interests, and it was justified in publishing parts of the letter in response to interviews her anonymous friends had given to the U.S. magazine People, and because of her royal status.
At the start of a two-day hearing at London's High Court, Meghan's lawyer, Justin Rushbrooke, said judge Mark Warby should give a summary judgment in favour of the former U.S. actress as the paper's arguments had ""no reasonable grounds"" of success and did not stand up to scrutiny.
He said the Mail on Sunday had broken the code of conduct that British newspapers worked by, and the case raised ""a disturbing question"" about who controlled the contents of a private letter.
""Is it the writer of the letter or the editor of the Mail on Sunday?"" Rushbrooke said.
""There can only be one answer to that question and the answer would be the same irrespective of whether the write was a duchess or any other citizen. And the answer is it is not the editor of the Mail on Sunday.""
He said the decision to publish the letter was an assault on ""her private life, her family life and her correspondence"". In documents submitted to the court, her legal team described the paper's defence as ""a case of smoke and mirrors"".
In its written argument submitted to the court, the Mail on Sunday said Meghan had expected the letter's contents to become public, and, even if she had a privacy right, it was outweighed by the paper's freedom of expression rights.
""This case is wholly unsuitable for summary judgment. There is uncertainty as to a number of significant factual matters which can, and should, be investigated at trial when the court will have the full picture in terms of disclosure and evidence,"" the paper's legal team said.

The trial was due to start last week but was delayed until late 2021 because of a ""confidential"" reason.

Troops prevented pop star-turned-legislator Bobi Wine from leaving his house shortly after he returned from voting in Thursday's presidential election, in which he ran against incumbent Yoweri Museveni.
Museveni, 76, who has been in power since 1986, was declared winner of the poll with 59% of the vote against 35% for Wine, who became famous after years of singing about government corruption and nepotism, charges the government denies.
The U.S. embassy said late on Monday that Ambassador Natalie E. Brown had been stopped from visiting Wine, who it referred to by his real name, Robert Kyagulanyi, at his residence in a suburb in the northern outskirts of the capital.
The mission said Brown wanted to check on his health and safety given that he was effectively unable to leave his home.
Government spokesman Ofwono Opondo said Brown had no business visiting Wine, who the army says is being held to prevent potential unrest breaking out in the wake of the result.
""What she has been trying to do blatantly is to meddle in Uganda's internal politics, particularly elections, to subvert our elections and the will of the people,"" he said. ""She shouldn't do anything outside the diplomatic norms.""
There was no immediate comment from Brown or the embassy.
The public rebuke to the United States from the Ugandan government is relatively unusual as the two nations are allies.
Washington supports Ugandan soldiers serving in an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia and has donated about $1.5 billion to Uganda's health sector in the past three years.
GOVERNMENT ""WATCHING"" AMBASSADOR 
Opondo said, without providing any evidence, that Brown had a track record of causing trouble in countries where she has worked in the past. The government was watching her, he said.
The U.S. embassy has said last week's vote was tainted by harassment of opposition candidates, suppression of media and rights advocates and a nationwide internet shutdown.
""These unlawful actions and the effective house arrest of a presidential candidate continue a worrying trend on the course of Uganda's democracy,"" it said in the statement on Monday.
The United States and the European Union did not deploy observer missions for the polls. Washington said Ugandan authorities had denied accreditation while Brussels said they had not implemented the recommendations of previous missions.
On Tuesday, Wine's lawyers filed a petition in the high court challenging the legality of detaining Wine and his wife without charge. The court has not yet said when the petition will be heard, lawyer Benjamin Katana told Reuters.
During the campaign, security forces routinely broke up Wine's rallies with teargas, bullets, beatings and detentions, citing violations of laws meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
In November, 54 people were killed as security forces quelled a protest that erupted after Wine was detained for alleged violation of the anti-coronavirus measures.
Wine and his National Unity Platform (NUP) have rejected the results and said they were planning a court challenge.

On Monday, security forces cordoned off the party's offices in the capital. The party said that was aimed at complicating their efforts to collect evidence of irregularities committed during the election.

World Food Programme (WFP) said on Tuesday.
""What is happening is nothing short of a food security and nutritional crisis,"" WFP spokesman Tomson Phiri told a U.N. briefing. ""This is a humanitarian disaster.""
The attacks have forced 570,000 people to flee, Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi said last month, saying he would defeat insurgents who stepped up attacks since pledging loyalty to Islamic State last year.
Speaking ahead of a joint briefing by U.N. agencies on Wednesday, Phiri said there were limited supplies so the cost of food had soared, while access to water and sanitation was also impacted, as was education.
The insurgent group, Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama, staged its first attack in 2017. Known at first mainly for beheadings, the fighters declared allegiance to Islamic State in June 2019 and since then have increased attacks in scale and frequency.

The leader of the Anglican Communion, which includes 85 million people in about 165 countries, tweeted a picture of himself receiving the shot and described the rapid development of vaccines against the new coronavirus as an answer to prayer.
""Jesus Christ calls us to love our neighbour as ourselves. Getting the vaccine is part of that commandment: we can show our love for each other by keeping each other safe from this terrible disease,"" he said in a statement.
""To everyone in this country and across the world, I want to say please, please accept the invitation to get the jab when it comes -- and encourage everyone around you to do the same.""
Welby, 65, received the vaccine as part of the priority group of frontline healthcare workers, because he volunteers at St Thomas' Hospital, across the road from his London residence at Lambeth Palace, as part of the hospital's chaplaincy team.
He said that healthcare workers in Britain's National Health Service and across the world were under immense pressure on the front lines of the pandemic, and getting the vaccine was something people could do to help relieve the burden on them.
Reluctance by a proportion of the population to get vaccinated is seen by public health experts as a major problem, and the archbishop was one of a number of public figures in Britain who have sought to persuade people to accept the jab.
Queen Elizabeth, 94, and her husband Prince Philip, 99, both received their vaccinations on Jan. 9. They made no comment, but the decision by Buckingham Palace to make the news public was widely seen as a way to emphasise the safety and importance of vaccination.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Avril Haines, a former White House and CIA official whom President-elect Joe Biden chose for the top U.S. intelligence job, will tell Congress on Tuesday that she will continue tough U.S. scrutiny of China and press spy agencies to help resolve the COVID-19 crisis, a Biden transition official said.
In testimony before a Senate Intelligence Committee confirmation hearing, Haines, Biden's nominee for Director of National Intelligence, will declare that U.S. agencies must continue to collect intelligence to ""support long-term bipartisan efforts to out-compete China — gaining and sharing insight into China’s intentions and capabilities, while also supporting more immediate efforts to counter Beijing’s unfair, illegal, aggressive and coercive actions, as well as its human rights violations,"" the transition official said.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Haines also will tell senators that one of her missions would be to ensure that spy agencies' ""unique capabilities"" are used to counter the worldwide COVID-19 crisis, ""while also addressing the long-term challenge of future biological crises ... positioning us to detect future outbreaks before they become pandemics.""
She is also going to say that the United States must strengthen cybersecurity, protect critical American infrastructure and use technology to improve intelligence, the official familiar with her testimony said. 
Haines will also indirectly distance Biden's incoming administration from some intelligence agency pronouncements by the outgoing Trump administration, telling senators, ""To safeguard the integrity of our Intelligence Community, the DNI must insist, that, when it comes to intelligence, there is simply no place for politics - ever."" 
A Democratic congressional official said that Haines' confirmation process was expected to move rapidly, though some Democratic activists have raised questions about her role helping to manage the CIA's response to investigations into the agency's use of harsh interrogation techniques.

On Monday, Hong Kong reported 107 new cases of coronavirus, the highest number in nearly a month, fuelling concern over a new wave of infections in the densely populated city where businesses are already reeling from restrictions.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said at a press briefing on Tuesday that social distancing measures due to expire this week would be extended in a bid to contain the outbreak. 
The COVID-19 restrictions come ahead of Lunar New Year festivities which have been curtailed for a second consecutive year and are expected to keep any protests or other opposition activities figures at bay.
Hong Kong, a former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, was rocked by months of often violent anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019. China cracked down on dissent with a sweeping national security law last year.
The COVID restrictions include a ban on in-house dining after 6 p.m. and the closure of facilities such as gyms, sports venues, beauty salons and cinemas.
Hong Kong, with around 7.5 million people, has one of the highest population densities in the world. 
Health Secretary Sophia Chan told reporters that the popular Lunar New Year flower markets, which involve thousands of florists and many more customers, would be allowed to open at 50% capacity.
The government will regulate the crowd via technology with attendants updated in real time online. All people entering flower markets would need to have their temperature taken, while stall workers need to take a COVID-19 test before the markets open.

Her sentence comes at a time of unprecedented youth-led demonstrations in which protest leaders have openly criticised the monarchy, risking prosecution under Thailand's strict law known as lese majeste, which carries a 15-year penalty for each violation.
Anchan Preelert pled guilty to 29 separate violations of sharing and posting clips on YouTube and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) between 2014 and 2015, her lawyer, Pawinee Chumsri, told Reuters.
Anchan was initially sentenced to 87 years but because she had acknowledged her violations the court halved this, the lawyer said.
""This is the highest prison sentence ever in a lese majeste case,"" said Pawinee, who is from the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group.
Anchan, who could not be reached for comment, can appeal the sentence at two higher courts, Pawinee said.
Amnesty International expressed dismay over what two Thai rights groups also said was the longest ever sentence in Thailand for insulting the monarchy.
Security officials raided Anchan's house in January 2015, months after a civilian government was overthrown in a military coup.
Her case, which was initially brought before a military court, was transferred to a civilian court after a 2019 general election, which saw former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha stay on as prime minister.
At least 169 people were charged with lese majeste in the aftermath of the 2014 coup, according to the lawyers' rights group, with some cases taking years to process.
Authorities briefly stopped using the lese majeste law in 2018 but police started to invoke it again late last year after leaders of the protests, which drew tens of thousands of people, began openly criticising the monarchy.
Since November, more than 40 youth activists have been charged under the law. None of those cases has been brought to trial.
On Monday, another man arrested in 2014 was sentenced to more than four years in jail after publishing articles and poems online that the court said contained falsehoods about the monarchy.

State television showed paratroopers landing behind mock enemy lines near the port of Jask on the Gulf of Oman and preparing attacks with missile launchers. 
""The recent war games show to enemies the Iranian nation's will to defend its independence and territorial integrity,"" Revolutionary Guards commander General Hossein Salami told state TV. ""Our fingers are on the trigger on behalf of the nation."" 
Last week, the Revolutionary Guards fired long-range ballistic missiles at mock enemy warships in the Indian Ocean and tested domestically manufactured drones in Iran's central desert region.
Last Wednesday, Iran tested short-range naval missiles in the Gulf, and exercises earlier this month featured a wide array of domestically produced drones.
Iran has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, regarding them as a deterrent and retaliatory force against the United States and other adversaries in the event of war.
Periodic confrontations have taken place between Iran's military and U.S. forces in the Gulf since 2018, when Trump abandoned Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and reinstated harsh sanctions against Tehran.

Navalny, who has urged Russians to take to the streets in protest, was detained on Sunday after he flew back to Russia for the first time since he was poisoned with a nerve agent last summer and taken into pre-trial detention for 30 days.
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have said they want European Union foreign ministers to discuss sanctions against Russia over its handling of the case.
Speaking to reporters on a conference call, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Navalny's calls for Russians to take to the streets over his detention were alarming, but said the Kremlin did not fear mass protests. 

Peskov also said that Navalny had genuine questions to answer about violating his parole conditions for a suspended prison sentence and dismissed as nonsense the notion that President Vladimir Putin fears him.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is using localised tactics to battle a wave of COVID-19 outbreaks, an approach that avoids the sort of widespread shutdowns that devastated the economy last year but is also sowing uncertainty ahead of the Lunar New Year travel season. 
In the province of Hebei, which surrounds Beijing and has seen hundreds of infections in the last two weeks, officials were told in a Monday meeting to adhere to the principle of ""one village, one policy"" and draw up individual plans for each community.
After keeping confirmed new COVID-19 infections to just a handful a day for months, China has seen a spike in cases since the beginning of the year, with more than 100 a day recently, raising fears of a large-scale outbreak.
Addressing new clusters in Hebei and elsewhere, the National Health Commission (NHC) said last week that local officials needed to be on their guard and avoid ""one size fits all"" solutions. 
Beijing, for example, has left it to provincial authorities and employers to urge or incentivise people not to travel during the upcoming holiday, which begins on Feb. 12 and is usually the busiest travel time of the year. 
More than 20 provincial-level regions have asked people to stay put during the holiday but stopped short of bans, to the frustration of would-be travellers.
""I originally wanted to book my ticket on Jan. 25 but I was informed by my hometown community that they didn't know what will happen several days later and they couldn't 100% guarantee that I could go back without the need of quarantine,"" said a user of the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media platform who goes by the name Yijin Jiajin.
Rules and guidelines vary and frequently shift, even within cities, creating uncertainty.
Though they have been urged not to act excessively, local governments in the worst-hit regions have introduced often draconian measures to shut COVID-19 transmission routes.
""The specifics of restrictions are left to the local officials to flesh out, which means that if anything goes wrong, they will bear the brunt of the people's and the central government's wrath,"" said Yifei Li, a professor at New York University Shanghai who studies China's environmental and public health policies.
DON'T CALL IT A LOCKDOWN
On Tuesday, Qiqihar in northeastern Heilongjiang province became the latest city to order some residents to stay indoors.
In Beijing, some residential compounds were also sealed off. 
About 30 million people in the north and northeast are now under various types of curfew, though cities appear to be avoiding the word ""lockdown"", or ""fengcheng"" in Chinese, which was widely used to describe measures to respond to the outbreak last year in Wuhan and its surroundings, where the virus emerged in late 2019.
In the absence of central directives, cities and local government bureaus have published dozens of rules in recent days on controlling the outbreak over the holiday. 
Though there have been no new recent local cases in Shanghai, many residential buildings have tightened entry restrictions for couriers and rebuilt the control stations that were in place outside every compound early last year. 
Hebei has introduced the toughest measures, including bans on weddings and funerals, but it also ordered grassroots officials to refrain from the sorts of crude village blockades seen last year. Any attempt to seal off national roads, erect barricades or dig trenches would be punished, the provincial government said on Tuesday.
""I am not sure we can fault local officials for being overly cautious. The real problem seems to be that they're being unpredictable,"" said Li.

The officer could face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty of abuse of power. He was detained last month and is currently under house arrest, a court in the city of Samara told RBC. 
Authorities accuse the officer of leaking confidential information from a database containing information about people's travel across the country to a third party, RBC reported, citing a source close to the investigation. 
The information leaked, according to RBC, is thought to relate to flights taken by agents from the FSB security service with specialised knowledge on chemical weapons identified in an investigation as having secretly followed Navalny for several years. 
Investigative website Bellingcat and Russian media outlet The Insider published the investigation last month in cooperation with Der Spiegel and CNN.
""Investigators are not looking for or imprisoning Navalny's poisoners, but those who disclosed their data,"" Georgy Alburov, an ally of Navalny, wrote on Twitter.

The operation, covering 60 provinces, was part of a four-year-old crackdown against the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. He denies involvement in the July 2016 putsch attempt, in which more than 250 people were killed.
Anadolu said 160 people had been detained in the latest police raids, ordered by prosecutors in Izmir. It said suspects were also targeted in northern Cyprus, where the Turkish military is deployed. 
Among the suspects were 218 serving military personnel, including six colonels, three lieutenant colonels and nine majors, Anadolu said.

Since the coup attempt, about 80,000 people have been held pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended. More than 20,000 people had been expelled from the Turkish military.

ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte addressed the Italian Senate on Tuesday, hoping to win over enough opposition and unaligned lawmakers to keep him in office after a junior partner quit his coalition.
Conte gave almost the same speech to the upper house as he had delivered on Monday to the Chamber of Deputies, where he won by a wider than expected margin of 321 votes to 259, securing an absolute majority.
In the Senate, where the situation is much tighter, he added a comment about former premier Matteo Renzi's frequent quarrels with his coalition partners before he walked out. 
""I assure you it's very hard to govern in these conditions, with people who continuously place mines in our path and try to undermine the political balance patiently reached by the coalition,"" he said.
Conte had only a slim majority in the 321-seat Senate even before Renzi withdrew his small centrist party Italia Viva from the government's ranks last week.
The result of the confidence vote, at the end of what promises to be a fiery debate, is due some time after 7 pm (1800 GMT).
If the prime minister loses he will be forced to resign, putting an end to his 17-month government led by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).
The most optimistic recent tally by political analysts has put Conte on 157 votes, four short of an absolute majority, though Monday's wider than expected victory margin in the Chamber of Deputies may buoy the premier's hopes.
He does not need an absolute majority to remain in office, he merely needs to win the vote, but leading a minority government would put him in an extremely precarious position if and when he tries to push through any contested legislation.
Italian benchmark bond yields edged lower on Tuesday ahead of Conte's speech which began at 9.40 am (0840 GMT). 
The country's borrowing costs have increased since Renzi's walk-out but a major sell-off has been averted by the European Central Bank's purchases of Italian assets and market confidence the crisis can be resolved without fresh elections. 
Looking to entice centrist and liberal lawmakers, Conte has promised to revamp his policy agenda and shake up his cabinet, saying he wanted to modernise Italy and speed up implementation of a recovery plan for the recession-stricken economy.
Renzi, who withdrew his party from the cabinet due to disagreement over the prime minister's handling of the twin coronavirus and economic crises, has said Italia Viva will ""probably"" abstain in Tuesday's vote as it did in the Chamber.

If its senators should decide to vote against Conte, they will significantly reduce his chances of survival.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government recommended on Tuesday that voters reject a proposal in a planned March 7 referendum to ban full facial coverings such as burqas and niqabs worn by some Muslim women, saying the move would hurt tourism.
Under Switzerland's system of direct democracy, any proposal to change the constitution goes to a popular vote if supporters raise more than 100,000 signatures. In 2009 Swiss voters backed a proposal to ban the construction of new minarets. 
The Swiss cantons of St. Gallen and Ticino have already banned full face coverings in regional votes, but the Swiss government said following through with a nationwide constitutional ban was a bad idea.
""Very few people in Switzerland wear a full facial covering,"" the government said in a statement.
""A nationwide ban would undermine the sovereignty of the cantons, damage tourism and be unhelpful for certain groups of women,"" it said.
Most women who wear full facial coverings are tourists and only spend a brief time in the country, the statement added.
Montreux and other destinations around Lake Geneva as well as Interlaken in central Switzerland traditionally attract some Muslim tourists, mainly from the wealthy Gulf Arab states.
France and Denmark have also banned facial coverings, citing efforts to uphold secular values and combat discrimination against women.
Switzerland's proposal also forbids forcing somebody to wear a facial covering based on their gender. 
The grouping behind the burqa ban proposal - the ""Egerkinger Komitee"" that includes members of the right-wing Swiss People's Party (SVP) - was also behind the 2009 move to ban minarets, which was approved by nearly 60% of voters.
Supporters of the 2009 proposal saw the minarets as alien to Swiss traditions and values at a time of growing unease over the activities of Islamist militants in Europe and the Middle East.
Muslims make up only about 5% of Switzerland's 8.6 million people, official statistics show.

The Swiss government has made a counter-proposal to the facial covering ban that would come into force if voters reject the initial proposal on March 7. This would require women wearing a facial covering to reveal their face if necessary for identification at administrative offices or on public transport.

HANOI (Reuters) - As Vietnam's ruling Communist Party gears up for its most important meeting in years, its leadership has presided over an intensified crackdown on dissent, according to rights groups, activists and data collated by Reuters.
A record number of political prisoners, longer jail terms, and increased harassment of activists in recent years have contributed to the crackdown ahead of this week's Communist Party congress, a gathering to determine national leadership and policy that takes place once every five years.
The crackdown has left some international human rights groups and lawmakers questioning whether Vietnam has breached the spirit of trade agreements with Western countries - accords that have helped propel the country to a position of economic strength in Southeast Asia.
""I have been summoned by the police several times since December 9, 2020,"" said Nguyen Quang A, a veteran activist in Hanoi, declining to detail the circumstances saying he was subject to an ongoing investigation. He told Reuters Vietnam's security ministry had in recent weeks rounded up other government critics without saying why, citing his contacts with activists.
""They (the police) summon them and find reasons to convict them under those very fuzzy articles of criminal law. It completely violates the law but they use it very regularly,"" said Quang A. ""I've told them they can't shut me up.""
Vietnam's foreign ministry, which handles inquiries from foreign media, did not respond to Reuters' request for comment on activist detentions.
'ANTI-STATE'
Despite reforms and increasing openness to social change, the Communist Party of Vietnam, led by 76-year-old Nguyen Phu Trong, tolerates little criticism and controls domestic media tightly.
Vietnam drew international condemnation this month when it sentenced three freelance journalists known for criticism of government to between 11 and 15 years in prison, finding them guilty of spreading anti-state propaganda.
The country's constitution says it protects ""freedom of opinion and speech, freedom of the press, access to information, to assemble, form associations and hold demonstrations"".
In reality, public criticism of the Party is not tolerated, and groups which promote democratisation are targeted by the authorities in a battle playing out online on platforms like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Vietnam's premier platform for both e-commerce and dissent.
A Reuters tally based on state media reports found 280 people were arrested for ""anti-state"" activities over the five years since the last Party congress: 260 were convicted, many being sentenced to more than 10 years in jail. In the five years leading up to the 2016 congress, there were 68 arrests and 58 convictions.
'FORCE 47'
Last year, Amnesty International said it had recorded the most ""prisoners of conscience"" in Vietnam since it began publishing figures in 1996 - 170, close to double the 97 recorded in 2018. Of the 170, some 70 were detained for online activism, Amnesty said.
In late 2017, Vietnam unveiled a 10,000-strong military cyber unit, Force 47, to counter what it said were ""wrong"" views on the internet. According to rights groups, the unit also recruits volunteers online to target dissidents and activists.
Reuters reviewed dozens of posts across multiple Facebook groups and pages from December and January that claimed links with Force 47. Many attacked prominent activists, including Nguyen Quang A, accused by one group of creating anti-state propaganda.
Some group moderators were dressed in military uniform in their profile photos while others ran pages for official local branches of Communist Party organisations.
Last November, Vietnam threatened to shut Facebook down if it didn't toughen rules on local political content on the platform.
Facebook's local servers had been taken offline by the government earlier last year until it agreed to significantly increase policing of ""anti-state"" posts by local users, a request with which Facebook previously said it complied.
A Facebook spokesman said the company faced ""additional pressure"" from Vietnam to restrict content last year.
'DRIVER'S SEAT'
For some, the crackdown has a connection with fluctuations in global trade ties with Vietnam. 
""During the (former U.S. President Barack) Obama administration, pressure on rights connected with TPP (trade) negotiations helped the cause of human rights activists and political dissidents,"" said Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch.
""The early visit of Prime Minister (Nguyen Xuan) Phuc in 2017 to the Trump White House saw human rights completely dropped from the agenda,"" he said.
Robertson said trade tensions with China have also left Vietnam ""in the driver's seat"" as U.S. and European Union companies look for alternative supply chains, helping the Vietnamese economy thrive. 
""The EU had an important opportunity to make real changes through the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement,"" said Robertson, referring to a pact that has been a boon for Vietnam. Instead, he said, the EU ""fell short, settling for vague promises ... instead of substantive changes.""
EU officials didn't immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. 
After the jailing of the three journalists earlier this month, the U.N. human rights office said, ""Coming just weeks ahead (of the Party congress), the convictions and long sentences are not only a blatant suppression of independent journalism but also a clear attempt to create a chilling effect among those willing to criticise the government.""
The United States described the sentences as the ""latest in a troubling and accelerating trend of arrests and convictions of Vietnamese citizens exercising rights enshrined in Vietnam's constitution"".

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order directing U.S agencies to assess any security risks from Chinese-made drones in American government fleets and to prioritize removing them.
Trump directed all U.S. agencies to outline the security risks posed to the existing government drone fleet from drones built by Chinese companies or by other countries deemed foreign adversaries, including Russia, Iran and North Korea.
Trump's order also directs agencies to outline ""potential steps that could be taken to mitigate these risks, including, if warranted, discontinuing all federal use of covered (drones) and the expeditious removal of (drones) from federal service.""
Last month, the U.S. Commerce Department added China's SZ DJI Technology Co, the world's largest drone maker, to the U.S. government’s economic blacklist, along with dozens of other Chinese companies. A DJI spokesman declined immediate comment on Monday.
In January 2020, the U.S. Interior Department grounded its fleet of about 800 Chinese-made drones but said it would allow their use for emergency situations.
U.S. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt in October ordered a halt to additional purchases of Chinese-made drones by the department.
In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned U.S. firms of the risks to company data from Chinese-made drones. In a notice, DHS said U.S. officials have ""strong concerns about any technology product that takes American data into the territory of an authoritarian state that permits its intelligence services to have unfettered access to that data or otherwise abuses that access.""

DJI said last month it was disappointed by the Commerce Department decision but noted that ""customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally.""

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil kicked off a nationwide COVID-19 immunization program on Monday by distributing doses of a vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech following an emergency use authorization, although the pace of vaccination will depend on delayed imports.
After weeks of setbacks, many Brazilians cheered the first wave of inoculations, from bustling clinics in Sao Paulo to a spectacular shot planned at the foot of the Christ Redeemer statue overlooking Rio de Janeiro.
The Health Ministry gave states the green light to start immunizing at 5 p.m. (2000 GMT). Although some began administering shots before that, the majority of Brazil's 26 states had yet to receive vaccine shipments as of Monday evening, delaying the start of vaccinations for the elderly and frontline health workers. 
Minutes after federal health agency Anvisa approved the Sinovac vaccine on Sunday, Monica Calazans, a 54-year-old nurse in Sao Paulo, became the first person to be inoculated in the country, as Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria looked on.
President Jair Bolsonaro, a COVID-19 skeptic who has refused to take a vaccine himself, had faced fierce criticism for the lack of immunization in Brazil, which has lost more than 200,000 lives to COVID-19 – the pandemic's worst death toll outside the United States.
On Sunday, Anvisa approved emergency use of the Sinovac vaccine and one from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc, although a plan to get 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine was hamstrung by a lack of export approval from India.
That was one of several hurdles threatening to slow Brazil's already lagging immunization efforts, as local manufacturing partners for both vaccine makers wait on active ingredients from abroad in order to fill and finish doses for distribution.
The Butantan Institute run by Sao Paulo state needs another shipment of Sinovac's ingredients by the end of the month in order to hit its target of 46 million doses by April, the head of the institute told a news conference.
The federally-funded Fiocruz biomedical center in Rio de Janeiro is still awaiting its first shipment of ingredients for AstraZeneca's vaccine, pending Chinese export approval.
Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello scolded Doria on Sunday for what he called an illegal ""marketing ploy"" for allowing vaccinations to begin in Sao Paulo prior to the official rollout. 
Bolsonaro, who had taunted Doria over the disappointing 50% efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine in Brazilian trials, added an indirect criticism on Monday.

""So it's been approved for use in Brazil. It is Brazil's vaccine. It doesn't belong to any governor,"" he told supporters outside the presidential palace.

LONDON (Reuters) - Mikhail Khodorkovsky, a former oil tycoon who fell foul of the Kremlin, said on Monday the arrest of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was an attempt by President Vladimir Putin to show he is still ""top dog"" in Russia.
Khodorkovsky said the West should act rather than talk if it wanted to have any influence on the 68-year-old president after Navalny's arrest and that Navalny could face a decade in prison, as Khodorkovsky did after challenging the Kremlin. 
Navalny was remanded in pre-trial detention for 30 days on Monday for violating the terms of a suspended jail sentence, one day after returning from Germany where he was treated for what German military tests showed was poisoning by a deadly nerve agent, a version of events rejected by the Kremlin. 
The Kremlin has said Navalny must face justice like any other citizen if he has done anything wrong, and that the West should keep out of the case.
""Putin feels he has to show he is the main animal in the herd or ... people will believe that he is no longer the top dog,"" Khodorkovsky, 57, told Reuters in London when asked about Navalny's arrest.
""The only thing that defends Putin is the perception ... that he is the top dog - that has been placed yet again in doubt.""
The Kremlin declined to comment immediately in response to Reuters' questions. 
Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, was arrested on a plane in Siberia in 2003 and jailed for tax evasion and fraud. His once mighty oil company, Yukos, was split apart. 
The Kremlin cast him as a common criminal. Khodorkovsky denied the charges and was released in 2013 after spending 10 years in custody.
Khodorkovsky said he had to make a decision to return to Russia in 2003 even though he could face arrest.
""My situation was absolutely analogous,"" he said. ""There was no other variant: either you surrender or you go back to fight - so Navalny did absolutely the right thing.""
After Yukos was brought to its knees by vast back tax claims by the state, it was carved up and ultimately its assets were snapped up by state-run oil companies.
Khodorkovsky said the West should prioritise sanctions on individuals involved in Russian corruption abroad over sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, which is being built between Russia and Germany and is seen in the West as a possible sanctions target. 
He said he wanted to believe that Navalny would be released but he believed the reality was that he would face growing pressure from the Russian authorities.

""He could be given 10 years (in jail) - that in summary is what we could see at this stage,"" he said. ""Much will depend on how Russian society reacts.""

Up to 300 young men clashed with police in the capital's Ettadamon district, Reuters journalists there said, while residents of Kasserine, Gafsa, Sousse and Monastir described street violence in those cities. 
Rioting and protests have followed the 10th anniversary of a revolution that brought democracy but few material gains for most Tunisians, with anger growing at chronic joblessness and poor state services. 
However, with no clear agenda, political leadership or backing from major parties, it is not clear whether the demonstrations will gain momentum or die down, as many previous rounds of protests have since 2011. 
The crowd in Ettadamon on Monday chanted no slogans during their clashes with police who wore body armour and carried batons. Security forces patrolled the area in military-style vehicles. 
London-based Amnesty International called for restraint. It cited footage showing officers beating and dragging people they had detained and said authorities should immediately release Hamza Nassri Jeridi, a rights activist arrested on Monday. 
A decade after throwing off the shackles of autocratic rule, Tunisia was heading towards an economic crisis even before the global coronavirus pandemic struck last year, wrecking the tourism industry and locking down other businesses. 
An Interior Ministry spokesman said on Monday that police had detained 632 people on Sunday alone after what it called rioting across the country that included looting and attacks on property. Most of the detainees were aged 15-20, it said. 
In Tunis' central Bourguiba Avenue, a tree-lined boulevard flanked by government offices and colonial-era buildings where the biggest protests in 2011 took place, demonstrators on Monday said they wanted people arrested in recent days to be released.
""They call everyone who protests against the system a thief...We have come with exposed faces by day and not by night to say we want jobs...We want dignity,"" said Sonia, an unemployed graduate who did not want to give her family name. 
Demonstrators with her chanted ""no fear, no fear! The street belongs to the people!""

In his home Mnihla district of Tunis, President Kais Saied addressed a crowd of dozens of people affirming their right to ""jobs, freedom and dignity"". He warned that some political forces sought to manipulate the protesters to ""sow chaos"".

Had he lost the vote, Conte would have been forced to resign.
After his appeal to opposition and non-aligned parliamentarians to back him following the walk-out by former premier Matteo Renzi's Italia Viva party, Conte's government won the lower-house vote by 321 to 259.
The margin was wider than expected and secured Conte an absolute majority in the 629-seat chamber. 

Conte will face a tougher test on Tuesday in the upper house Senate, where the government had only a slim majority even when Renzi's lawmakers were still part of the coalition.

1585,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 02:41PM ET</span>",Ugandan opposition says troops raid its offices amid election challenge,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Bobi Wine, leader of Uganda's main opposition party, said troops raided its headquarters on Monday as staff tried to prepare a legal challenge to President Yoweri Museveni's declared victory in an election last week.
Wine, himself under house arrest, said party leaders were now on the run. ""Our party office has been raided by the military and been cordoned off,"" Wine told Reuters. ""Everybody is being pursued.""
Police spokesman Patrick Onyango said the National Unity Platform (NUP) office had been cordoned off for security reasons, but he gave no more details and did not say if troops had entered the premises.
Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said later on Twitter that the U.S. ambassador to Uganda was sent away from his gate after she tried to visit him. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. Embassy on the planned visit.
The electoral commission declared incumbent Museveni the winner of the Jan. 14 election on Saturday, triggering protests in two areas. Wine, a former pop star-turned-legislator, came second and accused Museveni of winning by fraud.. 
In the election, where voters were also choosing members of parliament, Wine's NUP won 61 seats. Five other opposition parties won 48 seats, giving opposition lawmakers in the next House 109 in total, a government statement said on Monday. The ruling party won 316 seats. 
Wine had appealed to youth to vote out Museveni, a 76-year-old in power since 1986. Wine's songs have frequently criticised Museveni for corruption and nepotism, accusations he denies. 
Museveni, one of Africa’s longest-ruling leaders, has dismissed the allegations of fraud and said the election may turn out to be the ""most cheating-free"" in Ugandan history.
The government wanted to disrupt documentation of voting fraud, NUP spokesman Joel Ssenyonyi said.
""They don't want work to continue at our offices because they know that we are putting together evidence to show the world how much of a fraudster Museveni is.""
The campaign and election were marked by a deadly crackdown by security forces on opposition supporters and an internet shutdown. In one week of protests in November, at least 54 people died.
The government said opposition members and their supporters had been breaking public order laws and COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings. On Monday the government started to partially restore internet access. 
The United States and Britain have called for investigations into reports of fraud and other election issues.
INCIDENT
Wine called for the military to release him from house arrest, saying his home was not a legally recognised detention centre. He accused soldiers of assaulting his wife when she went into their garden.
""The soldiers were pulling her by the breasts,"" he said, adding that the incident was filmed on video and she would share it when social media services were restored. 
Military spokeswoman Brigadier Flavia Byekwaso said she was unaware of the incident. 
The law gives petitioners 20 days after results are declared to challenge them in the Supreme Court. Wine said he wanted to meet with his party to decide on a strategy that could include peaceful protests. 
But the military has surrounded Wine's home in Kampala since Thursday, saying it is for his own safety.
Wine's lawyers were denied access on Monday. One legislator for Wine's party said he was beaten up by security forces when he tried to enter this weekend. 
The NUP's Ssenyonyi said such attacks, including on the party's polling agents, were being carried out to cripple the court challenge.

At least 110 polling agents from Wine's party have been arrested since the eve of the election. Some 223 suspects have been arrested during the election on offences that include assault, intimidation and voter bribery, police said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - An independent panel said on Monday that Chinese officials could have applied public health measures more forcefully in January to curb the initial COVID-19 outbreak, and criticised the World Health Organization (WHO) for not declaring an international emergency until Jan. 30.
The experts reviewing the global handling of the pandemic, led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, called for reforms to the Geneva-based United Nations agency.Their interim report was published hours after the WHO's top emergency expert, Mike Ryan, said that global deaths from COVID-19 were expected to top 100,000 per week ""very soon"".
""What is clear to the Panel is that public health measures could have been applied more forcefully by local and national health authorities in China in January,"" the report said, referring to the initial outbreak of the new disease in the central city of Wuhan, in Hubei province. 
As evidence emerged of human-to-human transmission, ""in far too many countries, this signal was ignored"", it added.
Specifically, it questioned why the WHO's Emergency Committee did not meet until the third week of January and did not declare an international emergency until its second meeting on Jan. 30.
""Although the term pandemic is neither used nor defined in the International Health Regulations (2005), its use does serve to focus attention on the gravity of a health event. It was not until 11 March that WHO used the term,"" the report said.
""The global pandemic alert system is not fit for purpose"", it said. ""The World Health Organization has been underpowered to do the job.""
Under President Donald Trump, the United States has accused the WHO of being ""China-centric"", which the agency denies. European countries led by France and Germany have pushed for addressing the WHO's shortcomings on funding, governance and legal powers.
The panel called for a ""global reset"" and said that it would make recommendations in a final report to health ministers from the WHO's 194 member states in May.

1587,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 02:15PM ET</span>",Bolsonaro allies set to win control of Brazil's Congress,"By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Despite a deep recession and the world's second-deadliest COVID-19 outbreak, candidates backed by Brazil's right-wing president Jair Bolsonaro are expected to win control of Congress next month, politicians and analysts said on Monday.
Bolsonaro is openly supporting center-right Congressman Arthur Lira for speaker of the lower chamber against centrist Baleia Rossi, who has the backing of current Speaker Rodrigo Maia and lawmakers keeping their distance from the president.
Lira, who cast himself as fiscally conservative in a written exchange with Reuters, has more than the 257-vote majority needed, according to risk consultancy Arko. That means an uphill battle for Rossi and the left-wing parties he is courting, which favor more help for low-income Brazilians hurt by the pandemic.
With more than 8.5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 209,000 deaths - second only to the United States - the second wave of Brazil's outbreak is likely to raise pressure on the government to spend more, widening its huge budget deficit.
Hospitals in the jungle city of Manaus are overwhelmed again, prompting pot-banging protests in Brazil's largest cities over the handling of the pandemic by Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly denied the gravity of the virus.
On the economic front, Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co announced last week it was shutting production in Brazil and cutting about 5,000 jobs, in a symbolic blow for a country that likely suffered its worst recession on record in 2020.
Yet polls show Bolsonaro has retained public support in the crisis, with 37% of those polled calling him a ""good"" or ""great"" president in both August and December surveys by pollster Datafolha. That solid support, along with a growing willingness to discuss traditional horse-trading in Congress, have helped him secure a political base of center-right lawmakers.
His favored candidate in the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco of the Democrats party, has a clear lead to become president of the Senate, by 46 senators to 33 for his rival Simone Tebet, according to Arko. 
Pacheco even has the backing of the leftist Workers Party (PT) that see him opposing Bolsonaro's more controversial views such as easing gun ownership rules and denying climate change.
""Pacheco is not an extreme free-market exponent and would not agree to the blanket privatization of state companies,"" PT Senator Jean Paul Prates said in a telephone interview.
Lira has said his priority if elected speaker of the lower house on Feb. 1 was an emergency bill that would give the federal and local governments more room to handle spending but avoid then breaching Brazil's legally mandated spending cap.
He told Reuters, however, that Congress had to find an alternative to extending last year's emergency transfers to low-income Brazilians that cost 322 billion reais ($61 billion) and blew a record hole in the government's finances.

The bodies were found with their feet and hands bound, according to local media citing a police report on the incident in the volatile Las Choapas municipality. 
The area is about 363 kilometers (225.5 miles) south of the port city of Veracruz, the state capital.
The Veracruz security ministry said in a statement the victims were ""executed"" and early reporting indicated they were members of ""self-defense groups,"" which have sprung up in Mexican regions riddled with drug cartel violence.
Cuitlahuac Garcia, the Governor of Veracruz, said initial reports indicate a split in one such self-defense group led to the violence.
""The abuses and threats between them caused a confrontation between them and had this unfortunate outcome,"" Garcia said.
Self-defense groups are common in some parts of Mexico, where authorities have struggled to bring about law and order amid internecine cartel violence.
These vigilante forces have helped contain violence in some crime-stricken areas or shielded the local population. But some of them have also struck alliances with criminal gangs in exchange for weapons and protection, analysts say.
Authorities often accuse self-defense groups of being criminal organizations, or having deep ties with certain cartels.
In the first 11 months of last year, Veracruz was the eighth most violent state in Mexico, with 1,320 homicides recorded, according to federal authorities.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian judge remanded Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny in pre-trial detention for 30 days on Monday for violating the terms of a suspended jail sentence, ignoring calls from Western countries to free the opposition politician immediately. 
The ruling, a day after police detained him at the airport when he returned to Russia for the first time since being poisoned by a military-grade nerve agent last August, could be the prelude to him being jailed for years.
Moscow's prison service has applied to convert a suspended three-and-a-half year embezzlement sentence in the same case, which he says was trumped up, into real jail time early next month.
He faces three other separate criminal cases too. 
The United Nations and Western countries told Moscow before the ruling to let Navalny go, and some countries have called for new sanctions after earlier penalties from the EU over his poisoning. Moscow told them to mind their own business. 
Navalny, in a video released on Twitter after the ruling, urged Russians to protest.
""Don't be afraid, take to the streets. Don't go out for me, go out for yourself and your future,"" Navalny said.
Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, wrote on Twitter that supporters would hold rallies nationwide on Saturday.
Navalny, 44, called his treatment illegal under Russian law and accused President Vladimir Putin of throwing the criminal code out of the window in fear. 
The Kremlin did not respond, but has previously said Navalny must face justice if he has done anything wrong.
About 200 Navalny supporters had gathered outside the police station in freezing temperatures and demanded he be set free, a Reuters witness said.
Four masked police officers detained Navalny at passport control on Sunday evening as he returned to Russia after being treated in Germany for what German military tests showed was poisoning by a Novichok nerve agent, a version of events the Kremlin rejects. 
The rouble weakened as investors weighed the risk of new sanctions against Moscow.
CALLS FOR SANCTIONS
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia said they wanted European Union foreign ministers to discuss further sanctions against Russia on Monday for detaining Navalny, whose foundation specialises in investigations into alleged official corruption.
Some of the foundation's targets have taken legal action and some critics have upbraided Navalny in the past for espousing overly nationalist views, something he rejects.
A possible target of any new penalties would be Nord Stream 2, a $11.6 billion project to build a natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. Germany has supported the project, saying it is a commercial venture, and government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Monday that had not changed.
The foreign ministers of Germany, Britain, France and Italy had earlier called for Navalny's release and Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek had said he wanted the EU to discuss possible sanctions. 
The U.N. human rights office called for Navalny's immediate release and demanded due process in line with the rule of law. Jake Sullivan, one of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's top aides, and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have criticised the arrest.
The Russian Foreign Ministry brushed off the criticism.
""Respect international law, do not encroach on national legislation of sovereign states and address problems in your own country,"" Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Western countries' expressions of outrage were designed to distract their citizens' attention from domestic problems and that Moscow was unfazed by potential damage to its image.
""We should probably think about our image, but we're not young ladies going to a ball,"" Lavrov told reporters.
Moscow residents interviewed by Reuters TV were divided on Navalny's detention.

""He probably did the right thing and acted like a real man (by returning),"" said one Muscovite, Yuri Elizarov. ""But from a political viewpoint he didn't, because nothing is probably going to change here in the coming years.""

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday it was in advanced talks with Pfizer about including its vaccine in the agency's portfolio of shots to be shared with poorer countries.
Mexico had been expecting weekly deliveries of some 400,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine developed with Germany's BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX). As a result of the U.S. drugmaker's WHO agreements, Mexico would for now only be receiving half that total, Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference.
It was not clear how long the reduction would last. Pfizer did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is currently the only one being administered in Mexico, which has reported the fourth-highest death toll from the pandemic worldwide.
Mexico has also signed deals to acquire vaccines from Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) Plc and China's CanSino Biologics. Mexico has approved the AstraZeneca shot and expects to have it by March. It is still reviewing the CanSino vaccine.
Lopez Obrador also noted Mexico was about to complete its review of a Russian vaccine, and would soon have it available, an apparent reference to the Sputnik V product.
Mexico suffered a setback to its drive to inoculate the public with the news over the weekend that the official in charge of the program, Miriam Veras Godoy, had stepped down for personal reasons, according to the health ministry.

""Almost everybody that I know (is) scrambling to buy this Pfizer (vaccine). To me I think it's a good one,"" he said in a late-night televised address. ""If you want to follow the experience of Norway, go ahead. Nobody would stop you.""
Norway said on Monday it was not changing its policy on the use of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine following reports of deaths among very frail recipients after the inoculation was given.
In his address, Duterte also reiterated his defense of the government's supply deals involving CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.
The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised the emergency use of Pfizer's vaccine, the first to be approved in the Southeast Asian country, which has one of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in Asia.
The government aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of its population, this year.
Duterte said Sinovac's vaccine is now being used in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, and Brazil, and there have been no deaths reported so far.
The Philippines has also firmed up supply deals with  Novavax  (NASDAQ:NVAX),  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Russia's Gamaleya Institute, according to Carlito Galvez, a former military chief who handles the government's vaccine procurement.
Duterte assured the public of corruption-free vaccine supply deals, after the Senate launched an inquiry into government transactions amid questions about pricing transparency and efficacy.

""I'm telling now General Galvez to proceed with his game plan, with or without the investigation"", which he said could derail the government's vaccination plan.

BioNTech had earlier say that ""Norwegian Health Authorities have now changed (their) recommendation in relation to vaccination of the terminally ill"". But the company later retracted the statement following clarification from Norway. 
The Nordic country is currently vaccinating residents of care homes, including those with serious underlying diseases.
As of Jan. 14, 23 reports of suspected deaths associated with COVID-19 vaccines have been submitted to the Norwegian health registry. 
Of these 23 reports, 13 have been looked into by Norwegian health authorities. These concerned individuals who were described as old, frail and with serious diseases. 
But the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) said its guidelines remained the same. 
""The FHI has specified the advice that has been valid all the time, that one should have an assessment of each and every one before offering the vaccine,"" Camilla Stoltenberg, the head of the agency, told a news conference.
""These are people who are very old, are frail and have serious diseases,"" she said ""When it comes to the cause (of death), no analysis has been done."" 
""It is not a given that this represents an overmortality or a causality,"" she said.
In Norway, an average of 400 people die each week in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.
Pfizer did not have any immediate comment.
Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said at a news briefing on Monday that the country's vaccine regulator also saw no need to revise guidelines and that it was in contact with Norwegian counterparts.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Shops in Greece reopened for the first time in two months on Monday as the government took its first steps towards easing coronavirus restrictions to try to breathe life into the retail sector.
Retailers selling non-essential items were allowed to serve customers under heavy restrictions, with shoppers required to register by instant message and book appointments with hair salons. But businesses welcomed the first sign of a return to normality.
""It's a very positive development,"" said Giannis Chatzitheodosiou, president of the Athens trade chamber, adding that both businesses and shoppers were being asked to stick to strict safety guidelines.
""One in four businesses will never open again, we are fighting for the remaining 75% to survive.""
While Greece has succeeded better than many other European countries in limiting the spread of the virus, it has suffered more than 5,000 dead and its health system, badly weakened after years of financial crisis, has been under severe strain.
Its economy is expected to have shrunk by more than 10% last year after two lockdowns and a disrupted summer tourist season, and the government spent some 24 billion euros ($29 billion) to support businesses and employees hit by the restrictions.
In Ermou, one of Athens' main shopping streets, people formed long queues outside stores and boutiques that imposed strict social-distancing limits inside. But businesses were also worried about the long-term economic fallout from the crisis.
""There is joy (of course) but the thing is for everything to go well, and not to close down again, because it's not the easiest environment to survive in right now,"" said Kostas Apostolopoulos, who owns a hat shop in central Athens.
While stores were allowed to re-open and authorities have begun rolling out vaccinations, other restrictions remained in place, with a ban on public gatherings and compulsory mask-wearing in public.
On Monday, health authorities reported 320 new cases and 19 related deaths, bringing COVID-19 infections since the first case was detected in February to 148,925 and deaths to 5,488.

The guide, widely acknowledged as the bible of gastronomy, published its annual French edition on Monday.
Prepping a starter of cauliflower in cream and vanilla dressing in his empty restaurant, the Fleur de Pave, Sendra said the guide offered much-needed recognition for a trade that has been hit hard by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
With restaurants ordered shut to try to contain the spread of the virus, Sendra's only revenue is from private dinners he prepares for some loyal customers.
""For people who get their first star, in the period that we're suffering through, this will be at least a comfort for them,"" said the chef.
This year, just finishing the guide was a logistical headache. There were only a few weeks when restaurants were open in between COVID-19 lockdowns.
Whenever lockdown restrictions eased, the inspectors cancelled their vacations so they could squeeze in as many visits as possible before the restaurants were forced to close again, said Gwendal Poullennec, the guide's international director.
""They were able - while sticking to our time-honoured methodology and making as many visits as usual - to establish a selection of restaurants as credible and trustworthy as in previous years,"" Poullennec said.
In this year's guide, one new restaurant was elevated to the most coveted ranking of three Michelin stars.
The AM par Alexandre Mazzia in the southern city of Marseille joined the other 29 restaurants in France that already hold the distinction.

Two restaurants were given two stars for the first time, and 54 establishments received one star for the first time.

Speaking at a news conference, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Washington understood that Mexico had to defend its authority and prestige in the matter of Cienfuegos, whom U.S. prosecutors had accused of working with drug traffickers.
Cienfuegos has denied any wrongdoing.
The Mexican attorney general's office said last week the U.S. case was not strong enough to warrant charges against Cienfuegos, who was defence minister in the previous government, and was initially arrested by U.S. officials in October.
Citing diplomatic considerations, U.S. authorities released Cienfuegos in November, and Mexico initially said it would take up the case against the retired general before dismissing it.
Lopez Obrador said the case against Cienfuegos was full of errors and contradictions, and last week he ordered the U.S. files on the investigation to be made public.
The U.S. Justice Department expressed dismay at the publication of those files and the decision not to charge Cienfuegos, sparking concern that bilateral relations and security cooperation could suffer as a result.
Lopez Obrador said relations would be ""very good"" with President-elect Joe Biden after he takes office this week.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori plans to pardon her father, Alberto Fujimori, a controversial former leader who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for abuse of human rights, if she is elected the country's leader in an April vote.
""After what we have had to live through, I'm in favor of a pardon for my father and I prefer to say it like that, openly,"" she told América Televisión late on Sunday, adding even if her bid failed she would still seek a pardon for her 82-year-old father.
Keiko Fujimori, 45, currently sits second in election polls ahead of the April 11 vote, with 8% of the voting intention. Former soccer goalkeeper George Forsyth, 38, leads with 17% support, according to a recent poll.
Alberto Fujimori, who ruled for two consecutive terms between 1990 and 2000, was convicted in 2009 of ordering the murder of 25 people, including a minor, committed by a paramilitary group in the early 1990s in the midst of a war between the state and the rebel group Sendero Luminoso.
He received a humanitarian pardon in 2017 from then president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, but that was later annulled by the Supreme Court over irregularities.
""After everything we have seen and what we have been through, I believe that what my father has experienced is enough and that has made me change my mind,"" said Keiko Fujimori, who leads the right-wing Popular Force party.
The younger Fujimori has herself twice been held under pretrial detention amid a tax investigation for money laundering and allegedly receiving money from the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht for her 2011 election campaign.
She denies the accusations.

The surge in violence will add to concerns about the departure of an international peacekeeping force that stopped patrolling in Darfur on Jan. 1 ahead of its full withdrawal and replacement by a Sudanese force. 
The latest attack took place close to the town of Gereida, where two residents said an Arab militia had attacked members of the Fallata tribe. One resident, Mohamed Salih, told Reuters that 47 dead had been counted. The reason for the attack was unclear, he said. 
Gereida had also seen deadly clashes in late December involving the Masalit and Fallata tribes.
On Saturday and Sunday, attacks took place in and around El Geneina in West Darfur following a reported fight in which a member of the Masalit killed a man from an Arab tribe.
A doctors' union in West Darfur said on Monday that the toll had risen to 129 dead and 198 wounded, including children. Thousands had been displaced by the violence and were in dire need of humanitarian aid, the group said.
Conflict in Darfur escalated from 2003, when government forces and mainly Arab militia were accused of widespread atrocities as they fought to suppress mostly non-Arab rebels. An estimated 300,000 were killed and some 1.5 million remain displaced within Darfur.
UNAMID, a joint United Nations-African Union peacekeeping mission established in 2007, is due to be replaced by a national force that should include Darfuri former rebels who signed a peace agreement last October. 
Sudanese officials say the first members of the force are deploying, but residents and some diplomats fear UNAMID's withdrawal will leave civilians more vulnerable. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed deep concern on Sunday over the violence in Darfur. His spokesman said it had led to the displacement of nearly 50,000 people.
""The Secretary-General calls on the Sudanese authorities to expend all efforts to de-escalate the situation and bring an end to the fighting, restore law and order and ensure the protection of civilians,"" spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 09:36AM ET</span>",Trump sought the world's attention and got it. Now the White House reality show ends,"By Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A red tie, often tied too long. A raised fist, often held high to a supportive crowd. A scowling face. A raised voice.
President Donald Trump never hid how he felt. His words and body language made his thoughts clear.
For more than four years, Trump, a Republican, cultivated a political base by sharing his thoughts and emotions - pride, happiness, indignation, rage - on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis, creating an omnipresence of sorts that completely dominated the news cycle.
Like no U.S. president has done before, he made himself the center of attention, the star of a literal reality show that was his administration, always with an eye for the camera, a flair for the dramatic, an instinct for the outrageous.
His supporters loved it. His opponents hated it. Regardless, nearly everyone tuned in. The country and the world watched, and were consumed.
The show may have had deadly consequences. Hundreds of thousands of people in the United States died of the disease associated with the coronavirus while Trump played down the danger of the pandemic and did not model wearing a mask.
U.S. racial and political divides widened under Trump and migrant children were separated from their parents. 
The president used the power of his words and his office to attend to his political base, with which he kept a direct line of communication via his now-suspended Twitter feed.
He remembered what he had promised them as a presidential candidate and sought with some success to deliver on those pledges to build a border wall, upend immigration and cut taxes.
He threatened and irritated world leaders during trips abroad, complicating relationships with U.S. allies who he felt were not carrying their financial weight in global alliances. 
He criticized and vilified the press, while craving journalists' attention and respect. The base enjoyed his demonization of the media and rewarded him with applause and cheering for the pejorative monikers he assigned. 
Trump gave his all to his supporters. He fired them up at regular rallies and drew energy from their adulation and enthusiasm for his unconventional - critics said unpresidential - style.
""I see Trump as a fighter for the people that actually work and put the backbone into this country,"" said Will Williams (NYSE:WMB), who attended Trump's June campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, as the coronavirus pandemic raged. ""I will remember him as (a) hero.""
History may not. 
With the riot on Jan. 6 at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters who believed his false assertions of election fraud, the legacy of a second impeachment for spurring a deadly uprising will almost certainly overshadow any accomplishments, real or perceived.
""When a president incites an insurrection that could have killed his vice president, could have killed the speaker of the House and other members of Congress, could have destroyed a free presidential election and might have permanently impaired our democracy, there is very little good you can find that's going to outshine that,"" said historian Michael Beschloss.
On Wednesday, Trump will leave the White House for the final time as the 45th president of the United States, taking his final flight on the Marine One helicopter to Joint Base Andrews, where he will board Air Force One for Florida.
The trappings of the presidency will be taken away afterward and he will watch his successor, Democrat Joe Biden, seek to undo much of what Trump did during his term in office.
The reality show from the White House will be over. But his base, at least in part, will remain, still hanging on his statements, in whatever medium he finds to get them out.

""I think he does understand the power of his words. I think he relishes in it,"" said one senior administration official who considered resigning in the aftermath of the riot. ""And I think he will continue to do so.""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga on Monday raised the prospect of sanctioning social media firms over what she called ""systematic abuses"" of free speech.
The minister said she would meet the Hungarian competition watchdog this week to discuss possible penalties for what she described as unfair commercial practices as well as convening a meeting of the country's digital freedom committee.
In a growing wave of criticism, some government officials are complaining about what they have described as efforts by social media companies, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), to limit conservative views on their platforms.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has turned Hungary's public media into an obedient mouthpiece and allies control large parts of the private media, allowing his agenda to be aired prominently.
But the right-wing premier faces the toughest challenge to his decade-long rule at a parliamentary election next year, as he tackles a protracted recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and a united opposition, with polls showing a neck-and-neck race.
""'Shadowban' means the act of social media providers secretly, for political purposes, restricting the visibility and access of our user profile without our knowledge about it,"" Varga said in a Facebook post.
""To reduce their reach, Facebook also limits the visibility of Christian, conservative, right-wing opinions. I also have personal experience of that,"" Varga said without elaborating.
Facebook did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Varga has nearly 120,000 Facebook followers, while Orban has over 1 million, representing more than 10% of the Hungarian population. The prime minister frequently uses Facebook to announce government decisions about COVID-19 or economic policy.
A spokesman for Varga did not immediately reply to emailed questions seeking further detail about the minister's accusation of Facebook restricting the visibility of her posts.
Varga said in her post the matter should be regulated at European Union level, but said swifter action may be needed: ""Due to the systematic abuses, however, we may need to step up sooner,"" she said.
Her comments come days after ally Poland also flagged possible action against big tech companies, with the justice minister saying companies that remove posts they deem offensive could face fines.

Orban's Polish ally, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has a conservative Catholic social agenda, argues that big tech companies exercise a dangerous level of control over public debate, censoring opinions out of line with their own liberal world view.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian opposition parties called on Monday for an investigation into chat messages from a top TV anchor that they said showed prior knowledge of air strikes carried out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government against Pakistan in 2019.
Arnab Goswami, editor-in-chief of Republic TV network, told the head of a TV ratings agency that India would launch a ""bigger than a normal strike"" on its arch-rival - three days before Indian combat jets struck alleged militant targets on Pakistani soil. 
The raid brought the two nations to the brink of war. 
""On Pakistan, the government is confident of striking in a way that people will be elated,"" a transcript of the messages sent by Goswami said. ""Exact words used.""
The messages, reported by Indian media and seen by Reuters, are part of a charge-sheet filed by police in Mumbai investigating alleged fixing of ratings by Republic - charges the network denies. 
Goswami denied prior knowledge of the air strikes, that were carried out weeks after an attack by Pakistan-based Islamist militants on an Indian paramilitary convoy in the Pulwama district of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.
""India's intention to hit back at Pakistan after the Pulwama attack was an officially-stated position,"" he said in a statement released by Republic. 
""There was no doubt in any nationalist Indian's mind that we would hit back,"" he added, accusing opposition parties of acting as a ""mouthpiece"" for Pakistan. 
Spokesmen for India's defence and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the transcripts. 
Republic has often adopted positions supportive of the Modi government and Goswami is known for his aggressive attacks on the opposition in his prime-time nightly programme, one of the country's most watched. 
India's main opposition Congress party, as well as Shiv Sena, a regional party that governs Maharashtra state where the TV channel is based, have both called for a government inquiry into the messages.
Shashi Tharoor, a Congress lawmaker, said the messages required ""serious inquiry"" by the Modi government, which has made national security a top priority. 

The messages have reignited tensions with Pakistan, with Islamabad's foreign ministry saying the transcripts showed the strikes were engineered to coincide with a general election that Modi won by a landslide a few months later.

VADO HONDO, Guatemala (Reuters) - Hundreds of mostly Honduran migrants huddled overnight on a highway in eastern Guatemala after domestic security forces used sticks and tear gas to halt the passage of a U.S.-bound caravan just days before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
As many as 8,000 migrants, including families with young children, have entered Guatemala since Friday, authorities say, fleeing poverty and lawlessness in a region rocked by the coronavirus pandemic and back-to-back hurricanes in November.
""There's no food or water, and there are thousands of children, pregnant women, babies, and they don't want to let us pass,"" said a Honduran stuck at the blockade who gave his name only as Pedro.
Guatemalan authorities said late on Sunday they have sent 1,568 migrants back home since Friday, the vast majority to Honduras. Nearly 100 were returned to El Salvador.
A Reuters witness said about 2,000 migrants were still camped out on the highway near the village of Vado Hondo, about 55 km (34 miles) from the borders of Honduras and El Salvador, after clashing with Guatemalan security forces on Sunday.
""We're starving,"" said one Honduran mother, stuck behind the cordon with her 15-year-old son, her daughter, 9, and her 4-year-old niece.
""All we have is water and a few cookies,"" said the woman, who declined to give her name, but added that she and other travelers had formed a prayer circle as they camped out.
Other migrants evaded the gridlock by fleeing into the hills to continue onward to the border of Mexico, where the government has deployed police and National Guard troopers.
""We ran into the mountains because I'm traveling with my one-year-old,"" said Diany Deras, another Honduran.
Mexico's border with Guatemala was quiet. 
""All is calm here,"" said a National Guardsman in charge of a border crossing directly opposite Tecun Uman, Guatemala, where caravan leaders hope to cross into Mexico. He sought anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media.

""I hope Guatemala contains them,"" he added.

MEISSEN, Germany (Reuters) - For some in Meissen the caskets piling up in the eastern German city's sole crematorium are a tragic reminder of what happens when the coronavirus is not taken seriously. For others it is simply nature's way.
Meissen, along with other places across old East Germany that are generally poorer, older and more supportive of a far-right opposed to lockdown, are the worst hit by the pandemic in the country, complicating Chancellor Angela Merkel's efforts to bring it under control.
""It's heartbreaking,"" said manager Joerg Schaldach, whose furnaces cremated 1,400 bodies last month, double the figure from December last year. More than half had died of COVID-19 and Schaldach expects some 1,700 cremations in total this month.
""People are dying alone in hospital without a loved one holding their hand,"" added Schaldach, standing in the main hall cleared of chairs used for funeral services to make way for caskets. ""People get just a phone call: 'deceased'. A farewell at the coffin is not possible, all they get is an urn.""
Like many east German regions that had a relatively mild first wave, Saxony, home to Meissen and a stronghold of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, has the second highest 7-day incidence rate in Germany, almost double the national average of 136 per 100,000 people.
The neighbouring eastern state of Thuringia, where the AfD is also popular, is now Germany's worst hot spot, taking over from Saxony last week.
""If the Saxony government had acted earlier, we would have had the pandemic under control. But now we are a national problem,"" said Frank Richter, a lawmaker in the Saxony parliament for the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD).
""The pile of bodies in Meissen is bitter medicine against ignorance.""
Detlev Spangenberg, an AfD lawmaker in the national parliament from Saxony, said the party should not be blamed.
""We've had a lockdown since November and the numbers are not going down. It's nothing to do with the AfD,"" he said late last week. ""We are just saying that the collateral damage of lockdowns outweighs the benefits.""
MISTAKES MADE
The governors of both Saxony and Thuringia had in September opposed efforts by Merkel to introduce restrictions after the summer in anticipation of a second wave of COVID-19, only to acknowledge recently that they had made an error in judgment.
On the deserted streets of Meissen, a city of 28,000 famed for it porcelain industry, people had different explanations for the dramatic surge in infections, ranging from naive complacency to scepticism partly promoted by the AfD.
""It sounds strange, but I noticed that young people follow rules like wearing a mask and keeping distance more than old people,"" said Jenna Schmidt, a 27-year-old waitress at a local restaurant shuttered since November.
""When numbers started to rise in October, you'd hear old people say, 'oh I'm too old, I'll die soon anyway',"" said Schmidt, walking with her toddler in the snow in the main square that is usually bustling with tourists.
""It's attitudes like this that got us here.""
At the crematorium, men working around the clock unloaded caskets marked with pieces of paper stating the deceased's name, date of birth and death and address. Almost all were in their late 60s or older. Some had lived in care homes.
""There is a lot of panic and hysteria,"" said Roswitha Zeidler, a 60-year-old who works as a cleaning lady in a hotel. ""Old people die all the time. I'm sick and tired of all the restrictions and predictions. I just want my life back.""
Merkel and state leaders will hold talks on Tuesday on whether more restrictions are needed when a hard lockdown expires on Jan. 31.
Germany, which imposed a lockdown in November that was tightened early last month, recorded just over 7,000 confirmed new infections on Monday and 214 deaths, roughly half the figures from a day earlier.
'OWN GOAL'
While limited testing and lower death reports at the weekend may have played a role, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the trend was downward but the numbers remained far too high.
Ute Czeschka, an independent member of the Meissen city council, said another factor that contributed to infections exploding in eastern German states like Saxony was their proximity to the Czech Republic and Poland, two hot spots on Germany's eastern border.
""Many of our health care workers and doctors come from hot spots like the Czech Republic,"" said Czeschka. ""So this didn't help. But the main reason we got here is that, until recently, many people did not believe in the virus. Now they do.""
SPD lawmaker Richter said that the scepticism of the coronavirus promoted by local AfD leaders, who during the summer showed up at anti-lockdown protests not wearing masks, had encouraged people to flout hygiene and distancing rules.
""Fighting a pandemic is like a team trying to win a soccer match,"" said Richter. ""You can't win if some players are trying to score an own goal.""
A study by the Forsa research institute found that only 19% of AfD supporters believed the federal government's information about the pandemic was credible and less than 30% of men who support the party followed distancing and hygiene rules.

This compared with 75% and 65% respectively for the whole population.

The helium-filled balloon, originally paid for through crowdfunding, first took to the skies over London during protests against Trump's visit in 2018 and has flown in other locations including France, Argentina, Ireland and Denmark.
Gladly accepting the donation, the Museum of London said the blimp would join its protest collection, which includes artefacts from the Suffragette movement as well as climate change and peace rallies.
""By collecting the baby blimp, we can mark the wave of feeling that washed over the city that day and capture a particular moment of resistance,"" said Sharon Ament, the museum's director.
""From the Suffragettes of the early 20th century to the anti-austerity marches, free speech and Black Lives Matter most recently – the capital has always been the place to have your say.""
The creators of the blimp said they hoped it served as a reminder of the fight against the ""politics of hate"".
""While we’re pleased that the Trump Baby can now be consigned to history along with the man himself, we’re under no illusions that this is the end of the story,"" said the organisers, who include Leo Murray, a climate change activist. 
""We hope the baby’s place in the museum will stand as a reminder of when London stood against Trump - but will prompt those who see it to examine how they can continue the fight.""
Trump steps down as president this week, leaving the United States profoundly divided after a tumultuous four years in which he took the country out of a global climate change accord, imposed harsh immigration policies, launched a trade war with China and played down the devastating COVID-19 pandemic.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Five people who committed crimes in Saudi Arabia as minors have yet to have their death sentences revoked, according to two rights groups, nine months after the kingdom's Human Rights Commission (HRC) announced an end to capital punishment for juvenile offenders.
The state-backed HRC in April cited a March royal decree by King Salman stipulating that individuals sentenced to death for crimes committed while minors will no longer face execution and would instead serve prison terms of up to 10 years in juvenile detention centers.
The statement did not specify a timeline, but in October, in response to a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW), it said the decree had come into force immediately upon announcement.
    The decree was never carried on state media nor published in the official gazette as would be normal practice.
In December, state news agency SPA published a list of prominent ""events"" of 2020 featuring several royal decrees, but the death penalty order was not included.
Organisations including anti-death penalty group Reprieve, HRW and the European-Saudi Organization for Human Rights (ESOHR) as well as a group of U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns that loopholes in Saudi law could still allow judges to impose the death sentence on juvenile offenders.
One of the five has appealed and eight face charges that could result in execution, said the groups, who follow the cases closely.
Reuters established the status of three of the five individuals through HRC statements but could not independently verify the other two.
The government's Center for International Communications (CIC) dismissed the concerns, telling Reuters that the royal decree would be applied retroactively to all cases where an individual was sentenced to death for offenses committed under the age of 18.
""The Royal Order issued in March 2020 was put into effect immediately upon its issuance and was circulated to the relevant authorities for instant implementation,"" the CIC said in an emailed statement.
ALL EYES ON RIYADH
Saudi Arabia, whose human rights record came under global scrutiny after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents, is one of the world's top executioners after Iran and China, rights groups say.
Its de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known internationally as MbS, enjoyed strong support from U.S. President Donald Trump.
But President-elect Joe Biden, who takes over in the White House later this week, has described the kingdom as a ""pariah"" for its rights record and said he would take a tougher line.
Six U.S. lawmakers wrote to the Saudi embassy in the United States in October urging the kingdom to review all ongoing death penalty cases to identify individuals convicted for crimes committed when they were children, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.
One of the signatories, Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski, told Reuters in December that if the kingdom were to follow through on the execution of juvenile offenders, ""it would make it even harder for Saudi Arabia to return to the kind of relationships that it wants with the United States.""
    He added that Biden would be looking at the kingdom's human rights policies ""very differently to Trump"".
    Biden officials declined to comment for this article, but referred Reuters to an earlier statement saying the new administration would reassess U.S. ties with Saudi Arabia.

The three, who are among the five juvenile offenders whose death penalties have yet to be revoked, were sentenced to death by the Specialized Criminal Court and faced beheading, although the public prosecutor ordered a review of their sentences in August.
The CIC said the royal decree would be applied to their cases.
Their lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.
In 2018, after assuming his post in a palace coup that ousted the previous crown prince, MbS pledged to minimise the use of the death penalty as part of sweeping social reforms.
    But in 2019, a record number of about 185 people were executed, according to the rights groups.
Reuters could not independently confirm the figures. The CIC did not comment when asked whether this figure was accurate.
In a press release on Monday, the HRC said Saudi Arabia had reduced the number of executions by 85% in 2020 compared with the previous year, noting it had documented 27.
TEST CASE?
In an article published last April, state-linked newspaper Okaz confirmed the existence of the royal decree, but said that the abolishment only applied to a lesser category of offence under Islamic law known as ""ta'zeer"".
These crimes are not clearly defined in the Koran or accompanying Hadiths and so punishments are left to judges' discretion, and can amount to death.
Saudi Arabia has no civil penal code that sets out sentencing rules, and no system of judicial precedent that would make the outcome of cases more predictable based on past practice.
    Judges could still sentence child offenders to death under the other two categories, according to Saudi Arabia's interpretation of sharia: ""houdoud"", or serious crimes which carry a prescribed punishment, including terrorism, and ""qisas"", or retribution, usually for murder, two lawyers and the rights groups said.
Asked why the royal decree was never published and whether it only applies to the ""ta'zeer"" category of offense, the CIC declined to comment.
Some defendants in protest cases have been prosecuted on terror charges.
    In a case watched closely by the rights groups, 18-year-old Mohammad al-Faraj was facing the death penalty even though he was 15 at the time of his arrest in 2017 for charges including participating in protests and attending related funerals, one when he was aged nine.
Ahead of his next hearing scheduled for Jan. 18, a source close to one of the defendants in Faraj's case said the demand for a ""houdoud"" death sentence had recently been withdrawn and prosecutors were instead seeking the harshest punishment under ""ta'zeer"".
The CIC said the royal decree would apply retroactively to Faraj's case, a point the HRC echoed in its press release.
ESOHR expressed concern that without a published decree, the risk of capital punishment cannot be ruled out.
ESOHR said Faraj was only granted a state-appointed lawyer in October, was not brought to court and was tortured in detention, allegations the CIC denied.
    Since the start of the pandemic, Faraj has been allowed one weekly 15-minute call to his parents, with in-person visits cancelled, a source close to the family said.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm the specifics of his case.

Centrist Laschet positioned himself on Saturday as the man to heal divisions among Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) after party delegates chose him to lead the party, putting him in pole position to succeed her as chancellor.
However, 36% of voters would still prefer Soeder to be chancellor candidate for Merkel's conservative alliance, a survey of 2,000 voters by pollster Forsa for broadcaster RTL/ntv conducted after Saturday's vote showed. Laschet followed on 21%.
Soeder leads the Christian Social Union (CSU), Bavarian sister party to the CDU. Together they form the conservative ""Union"". Usually - but not always - their candidate for chancellor comes from the CDU. 
The Union has twice fielded a CSU candidate. Both lost. But the narrow 521-466 margin of Laschet's runoff victory for the CDU leadership over arch-conservative Friedrich Merz highlights the challenge Laschet faces in uniting the alliance.
Despite Merkel's four successive federal election victories, the Union has never been entirely comfortable with her centrist course. 
""For the CDU, the close vote means that tensions within the party about its fundamental direction will continue,"" JP Morgan analyst Greg Fuzesi said. ""A large section of the party clearly wanted to shift in a conservative direction.""
Soeder, 54, has shifted from the right towards the moderate centre of late. He plays coy about his ambitions - ""My place is in Bavaria"" has been his repeated refrain. 
However, Soeder has also said the CDU and CSU will decide together who should run for chancellor, and called on the Union to decide on its candidate only after state elections in mid-March.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Amina Mohamed Abdi was just 24 when she first stood for Somalia's parliament in 2012, defeating two other candidates to win a seat reserved for women and defying elders from her Hawiye clan, some of whom denounced her as immodest.
""I was asked 'you want to be a prostitute? How can a woman represent a clan?'"" she told Reuters. ""I insisted and said a clan is not composed only of men.""
Four years later, she won an open seat in Hiran, a region north of the capital Mogadishu. 
Now 32, and having carved herself a reputation as one of the government's most vocal and visible critics, she will vie for a third term in an overdue election - the only woman in a field of six contesting the same seat.
She said growing up during a civil war that began in 1992 made her want to enter politics to help rebuild her country. 
She remembers returning from school in Mogadishu as an eight-year-old to find her house empty and her family gone after fighting broke out. ""Everywhere there were gunshots and mortar shells were landing,"" she said. 
A member of the opposition Union and Peace for Development party and now one of 81 women lawmakers in the 275-seat legislative chamber, she later lived with her uncle, himself a parliamentarian, who inspired her further. 
""I was ... brought up ... in a country when there was no government,"" she said. ""It is necessary for our children to have a government in order to get the basic rights: security, clean water, and quality education.""
Abdi has translated those wishes into fiery speeches that have resonated beyond parliament, labelling the government corrupt and incapable of protecting Somalia's 15 million people, accusations that it denies.
""Lawmaker Amina is not from my state but I love her,"" Canab Hussein, a Mogadishu shopkeeper and mother of six, told Reuters.
""I learnt (about her) over the radio and on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and YouTube. She is a role model, a smart female politician. She bravely speaks the truth."" 
Initially due in December, parliamentary elections have been repeatedly delayed after the opposition accused President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed of packing the electoral board with his allies. 
The postponement sparked protests in Mogadishu and the opposition has threatened a boycott of the rescheduled vote - a process to elect first senators and then legislators that could get under way this month - if the electoral board is not disbanded. Talks are ongoing. 
Winners of the two-stage ballot will select Somalia's next president. That vote is scheduled for Feb. 8 but is almost certain to be delayed. 
President Mohamed is seeking a second term. He was elected in 2017 after promising to ensure the military was paid regularly, but the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency, which was driven out of Mogadishu by African Union troops in 2011, still mounts frequent attacks.

Sino-U.S. ties have worsened as China has already condemned this month's easing, announced by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the waning days of President Donald Trump's presidency.
Further adding to China's anger, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Kelly Craft, spoke last week to Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, after a planned trip to Taipei was called off.
Asked at a daily news briefing how China would follow through on its pledge to make the United States ""pay a heavy price"" for its engagements with Taiwan, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said some U.S. officials would face sanctions.
""Owing to the wrong actions of the United States, China has decided to impose sanctions on responsible U.S. officials who have engaged in nasty behaviour on the Taiwan issue,"" she said, without elaborating.
When asked about U.S. sanctions on six mainland and Hong Kong officials announced last Friday over the mass arrests in Hong Kong, Hua said that China has decided to impose sanctions on U.S. officials, members of Congress, personnel at non-governmental organisations and their family members over their ""nasty behaviour"" on the Hong Kong issue.
China said last month it would sanction U.S. individuals as a reciprocal response to the U.S. sanctions on more than a dozen Chinese officials. It was unclear from Hua's reply on Monday whether the Hong Kong-related sanctions were new.
Hua also did not specify the names of the U.S. officials under sanction and the nature of the sanctions.
Democrat Joe Biden will be sworn in as president on Wednesday, and a new team will take over at the State Department, including a new secretary of state.
China says Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in its relationship with the United States, and has previously announced sanctions on U.S. companies selling weapons to Taiwan, though it has not been clear how, or if, they were enforced.
Beijing has responded to increased U.S. support for Taiwan, including arms sales and visits by senior U.S. officials, by stepping up military activity near the island, including flying its air force aircraft nearby.
Relations between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies, have plunged to their lowest level in decades, with disagreements on issues including Taiwan, Hong Kong, human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, the South China Sea, trade and espionage.
China last year unveiled sanctions on 11 U.S. citizens, including lawmakers from Trump's Republican Party, in response to Washington's sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials accused of curtailing political freedom in the former British colony.

The 6.2-magnitude quake, part of a string of disasters to hit the Southeast Asian archipelago in recent weeks, struck West Sulawesi in the early hours of Friday morning, sending thousands fleeing from their beds.
Disaster mitigation spokesman Raditya Jati said in a statement on Monday that 81 people were confirmed to have died, while more than 250 had been seriously injured.
There was also significant damage to hundreds of homes, a mall, a hospital and several hotels. 
With thousands displaced, authorities were also working to stem the spread of the coronavirus among evacuees, including by conducting rapid antigen tests, the official said.
Aside from the earthquake, the world’s fourth-most populous country also suffered a plane crash on Jan. 9 that killed 62 people as well as a deadly landslide in Java and the eruption of the Merapi and Semeru volcanoes.
And President Joko Widodo was due to fly to the province of South Kalimantan on Borneo island on Monday to view flood damage after at least 15 people had died following weeks of torrential rains.
Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2018, a devastating 7.5-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.

The country’s meteorology agency has warned of aftershocks in Sulawesi, along with the risk of extreme weather and other flood dangers in the coming weeks.

A preliminary meeting to discuss defence and security issues ahead of the summit started on Monday, with local delegates meeting at a downtown hotel and other joining virtually.

Singapore is also aiming to host the World Economic Forum's annual summit in late May after it was moved from its usual home in the Swiss ski resort of Davos over virus safety fears.

1612,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2021 01:55AM ET</span>","""Are you detaining me?"" Navalny flies home, and straight into trouble","By Polina Ivanova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pobeda flight DP936 was a few minutes into its descent towards Moscow's Vnukovo airport, where thousands of supporters of poisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny were waiting to meet him on his return to Russia, when the flight captain said he could not land as planned.
There were ""technical difficulties"", he said, before adding, audibly amused: ""Instead we will calmly make our way to Sheremetyevo airport ... where the weather is great!""
It was the first sign to those on board that Navalny's return from Berlin, where he had been treated since August after being attacked in Russia with the military-grade nerve agent Novichok, was not going smoothly.
After landing, he sat in the plane, looking out of the window onto a dark, snow-covered runaway and a handful of airport workers in fluorescent vests, holding his wife Yulia's hand in silence.
His lawyer, also on board, had said she did not know whether the Kremlin's most vocal and effective critic would be arrested.
The 44-year-old is accused of flouting the terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement in a case that he says was trumped up but could see him jailed for 3-1/2 years.
He entered Terminal D with an energetic step. Stopping in front of a glowing, wall-sized panel showing the Kremlin and the Russian flag, he said he had never considered not returning.
Speaking to reporters, including a Reuters correspondent who took the flight, he thanked the nurses and doctors in Germany who had treated him for the effects of the toxin, from a family originally developed by the Soviet military.
But he said that this was, nevertheless, his best day of the past five months. 
""This is my home,"" he said. ""I'm not afraid.""
'YOU'RE DETAINING ME'
Then, at border control, things took a turn for the worse. 
Standing in the narrow corridor of the glass-panelled passport control booth, Navalny was approached by an official who asked him to step away to ""clarify the circumstances"" of his entry.
His wife and lawyer stood right by, but were already separated from him by the metal passport control gate. His lawyer asked on what grounds he was being prevented from entering, but did not receive a clear response. 
Four police officers in black face masks came up to the booth and also demanded Navalny come with them.
""Are you detaining me?"" Navalny asked. ""You're detaining me,"" he said, repeatedly. In that case, he said, he would like his lawyer to join him.
The back-and-forth continued for around three minutes, until Navalny turned back to his wife. 
Standing either side of the passport gate, the couple embraced, before Navalny turned around to head away with the police. 
His wife, his lawyer and his press secretary headed towards baggage reclaim and sat down, Yulia looking calm. She asked the journalists present to give her time to gather her thoughts. 
Then she walked out into the arrivals hall to be met by a rush of supporters who applauded and chanted: ""Yulia! Yulia!"" and ""Russia will be free!"". Some stood on the balconies above. One gave her a bouquet.
She was then met by Navalny's brother, Oleg, who spent three-and-a-half years in jail for the same crime that Alexei was convicted of.
Standing outside in the icy evening air, Yulia Navalnaya addressed the crowd: ""Alexei said today that he is not afraid. I am not afraid either. And I call upon you all not to be afraid.""
Then she left, and the crowd gradually dispersed. 

Navalny himself, as far as anyone knew, remained in the airport's transit zone. Moscow's prison service said that Navalny had been detained for alleged violations of his suspended prison sentence and would be held in custody until a court hearing later this month.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Monday his government will take all possible measures to protect the country's medical system, as hospitals creak under the strain of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Suga this month issued a state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures in a bid to stem a resurgence of infections. He expanded it to seven more prefectures, including Osaka and Kyoto in western Japan. 
""What is important is to provide necessary medical services to people in need. We will exhaust all measures to safeguard the medical system,"" Suga said in his policy speech at the start of a regular session of parliament.
""We are all ready to deploy the Self-Defence Forces' medical team if requested by governors.""
Japan, though less seriously hit by the pandemic than many other advanced economies, has seen infections spike in recent weeks, prompting Japan Medical Association president Toshio Nakagawa to say the nation's medical system is collapsing.
The outbreak has forced Japan to largely shut its doors to foreigners and limit large-scale events. Administrative reform minister Taro Kono told Reuters on Thursday the once-delayed Tokyo Olympics may not go ahead as planned.
But Suga reiterated his resolve to host the Games this summer.
""We will press ahead with preparations, with determination of building watertight anti-infection measures and holding an event that can bring hope and courage to the world,"" he said. 
Total coronavirus cases in Japan have doubled over the past six weeks to about 330,000, according to public broacaster NHK, with 4,525 fatalities. 
On diplomacy, Suga called South Korea an important neighbour but said bilateral ties were in a very severe situation. 
A Seoul court this month ordered Japan to compensate 12 women who had been forced to work in its wartime brothels. Japan says the issue of ""comfort women,"" as the women are euphemistically known, was settled under a 1965 treaty, and the two countries agreed to ""irreversibly"" end the dispute in a 2015 deal.

""To bring relations back to an even keel, we strongly demand the South Korean side take appropriate steps,"" he said.

VADO HONDO, Guatemala (Reuters) - Guatemalan security forces on Sunday used sticks and tear gas to beat back a large migrant caravan bound for the United States, just days before the advent of a new U.S. administration, which urged travelers to abandon the journey.
Between 7,000 and 8,000 migrants, including families with young children, have entered Guatemala since Friday, authorities say, fleeing poverty and violence in a region hammered by the coronavirus pandemic and back-to-back hurricanes in November.
""Guatemala's message is loud and clear: These types of illegal mass movements (of people) will not be accepted, that's why we are working together with the neighboring nations to address this as a regional issue,"" the Guatemalan president's office said in emailed comments.
A large section of the caravan clashed early on Sunday with Guatemalan security officials, some 3,000 of whom had mustered by the village of Vado Hondo, about 55 km (34 miles) from the borders of Honduras and El Salvador.
""We want the Guatemalans to let us past,"" said Joaquin Ortiz, a Honduran in the caravan. ""Because we're not leaving here. We're going to carry on. I want to get through because it's horrible in our country. There's nothing in Honduras.""
The coronavirus pandemic has battered Honduras' economy, which last year suffered its worst contraction on record.
The large contingent of Guatemalan security officers managed to stop the migrants from advancing beyond Vado Hondo, with perhaps as many as half of the people in the caravan dispersing into the nearby hills or heading back the way they came, according to a Reuters witness.
Elmer Espinal is traveling with his months-old daughter. He said they were tear gassed by the Guatemalan security forces.
""My daughter almost choked,"" said Espinal, a Honduran native. ""I want a future for my girls ... there's no work over there in Honduras.""
Authorities sent buses and trucks for migrants who wanted to voluntarily return home.
""They keep trying to pass, but we're not allowing them to,"" said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's immigration agency.
Even if the migrants do get past, Mexico is preparing to stop them at its southern border with hundreds of security forces, arguing it must contain the spread of the virus.
Guatemalan authorities said that after administering coronavirus tests, 12 men and 9 women tested positive for COVID-19.
The Honduran foreign ministry in a statement said it ""urges Guatemala to investigate and clarify the actions carried out by Guatemalan security forces and once again, reiterates that only united as a region, work should continue to confront illegal migration.""
The robust response suggests that Democratic President-elect Joe Biden may initially benefit from the hard-line policies of outgoing Republican President Donald Trump, who made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority of his administration.
Video footage shared by the Guatemalan government showed hundreds of migrants, bounded by a hillside, pressing into a wall of security forces, which used sticks to repel the surge. An unspecified number of people were injured, authorities said.
During the chaotic melee, security forces fired off a tear gas canister and used a stun grenade to disperse the crowd, a Reuters photographer said. 
Between Friday and Saturday, Guatemala had sent back almost 1,000 migrants entering from Honduras, the Guatemalan government said, as the caravan tried to advance toward Mexico.
On Saturday evening, the Mexican foreign ministry pressed Central American authorities to halt the caravan's progress, pointing to the need to contain the spread of COVID-19.
Mexico, it said, was committed to orderly and regulated migration and would oppose any form of unauthorized entry.
The first migrant caravan of the year comes less than a week before Biden takes office on Wednesday promising to adopt a more humane approach to migration than Trump.
Still, a Biden transition official, speaking on background, advised people not to make for the United States.
""Overcoming the challenges created by the chaotic and cruel policies of the last four years, and those presented by COVID-19, will take time,"" said the official.
""In the meantime, the journey to the United States remains extraordinarily dangerous, and those in the region should not believe anyone peddling the lie that our border will be open to everyone next month,"" the official added.
The incoming administration will work to address the root causes of migration, expand lawful pathways and rethink asylum processing, the official said.

Mexican and Central American authorities have coordinated security and public health measures in a bid to deter mass movement of people across the region.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2021 11:36PM ET</span>",Big Oil’s flagship plastic waste project sinks on the Ganges,"By Joe Brock, John Geddie and Saurabh Sharma
SINGAPORE/VARANASI, India (Reuters) - A wheelbarrow and a handful of metal grids for capturing litter, emblazoned with the words “Renew Oceans,” sit rusting outside an empty, padlocked office in the Indian city of Varanasi, a short walk from the Ganges.
It is all that is left of a programme, funded by some of the world’s biggest oil and chemical companies, that they said could solve a runaway ocean plastic waste crisis which is killing marine life - from plankton to whales - and clogging tropical beaches and coral reefs.
The closure of Renew Oceans, which has not previously been reported, is a sign that an industry whose financial future is tied to the growth of plastic production is falling short of its targets to curb the resulting increase in waste, according to two environmental groups.   
The Alliance to End Plastic Waste, a Singapore-based nonprofit group set up two years ago by big oil and chemical companies, said on its website in November 2019 that its partnership with Renew Oceans would be expanded to the world’s most-polluted rivers and “ultimately could stop the flow of plastic into the planet’s ocean.”
 Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc, Dow Inc,  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Phillips Chemical Co and about 50 other companies committed to spend $1.5 billion over five years on the Alliance and its projects. The Alliance has not said publicly how much money it has raised from its members or what it has spent overall. 
The Alliance confirmed to Reuters that Renew Oceans had stopped operating, partly due to the new coronavirus, which had halted some work.  
“Without any foreseeable time frame for restarting, combined with other implementation challenges, the Alliance and Renew Oceans jointly decided to a mutual termination agreement in October 2020,” Alliance spokeswoman Jessica Lee told Reuters.
Anne Rosenthal, counsel at U.S. law firm Hurwit & Associates, representing Renew Oceans, also said it expects the project to fold. “While it has made important progress in tackling the problem of plastic waste, the organization has come to the conclusion that it simply does not have the capacity to work at the scale this problem deserves,” she said.
The Alliance, with a staff of about 50, mostly based in Singapore, has other projects in the pipeline, but they are small, community-based endeavours or have not yet come to fruition. “It is important to note that the full impact of projects will be realised when their operations are at full scale,” said Lee. 
Renew Oceans published targets on its website to collect 45 tonnes of plastic trash from the Ganges in 2019 and 450 tonnes in 2020. Neither the Alliance nor Renew Oceans has published any information on their progress in reaching those targets. Four people involved in the project told Reuters it collected less than one tonne of waste from the Ganges before it closed in March last year after less than six months in operation.
The Alliance and Renew Oceans declined comment on the amount of waste the project collected. Scientists estimate more than half a million tonnes of plastic trash enters the Ganges every year. There is no government data on how much of that is collected. 
‘ONE OF THE  BEST  (NYSE:BEST) PROJECTS’ 
At the launch event for the Alliance in January 2019, live-streamed by National Geographic, Dow Chief Executive Jim Fitterling said Renew Oceans was “one of the best projects we’ve got.” 
The Alliance and Renew Oceans said they would deploy state-of-the-art technology to collect and recycle plastic waste, including “reverse vending machines” that take in plastic litter and give out vouchers for money off taxi rides and groceries, and pyrolysis devices to turn plastic trash into diesel. 
Prototypes of those devices were deployed in Varanasi but regularly malfunctioned, the four people involved in the project told Reuters. The Alliance and Renew Oceans declined comment on the performance of the technology. 
Renew Oceans has not expanded operations beyond the pilot project in Varanasi, the Alliance said, in response to Reuters’ questions. Renew Oceans declined comment. 
The Alliance said it invested $5 million in Renew Oceans over a two-year period. It said some of that had been returned to the Alliance and more was expected to be returned once Renew Oceans wound down its operations. 
Exxon and Shell directed Reuters’ questions to the Alliance. Dow and Chevron Phillips did not respond to requests for comment. 
The Alliance set a goal “to divert millions of tons of plastic waste in more than 100 at-risk cities across the globe” over five years. So far the group has announced more than a dozen programmes, including Renew Oceans, but is far short of that goal.
In two years, only three small-scale projects funded by the Alliance, including Renew Oceans, have collected any waste, according to information published by the Alliance and its partners. A clean-up effort in Ghana has collected 300 tonnes of plastic waste, the Alliance said. Another Alliance project in the Philippines said on its website it had recycled 21 tonnes of plastic waste. 
There is no centralized source for data on plastic waste pollution across the globe. But the data that is available suggests that even at full scale, those projects would only address a fraction of the problem and still fall well short of the Alliance's own targets of keeping millions of tonnes of plastic garbage out of the ocean. 
For instance, Indonesia and India both produce more than 3 million tonnes of plastic waste a year that is not collected or recycled, according to United Nations and national figures. 
“AEPW’s programs are trivial in scale and not replicable to make a real reduction in the massive amount of global plastic pollution,” said Jan Dell, an independent chemical engineer, using the Alliance’s acronym.
The plastics industry has been publicising its efforts to recycle and manage plastic waste, but it is spending vastly more on expanding production than recycling, which has been rendered uneconomic by the proliferation of cheap new plastic, Reuters reported in October.
Chevron Phillips used footage of Renew Oceans’ workers collecting plastic on the Ganges in a video promoting its sustainability efforts in July, even though the project had stopped operations in March. 
“These are some of the richest and most powerful companies on the planet, and what they've come up with are some small, community litter picking projects that make for nice photo opportunities,” said John Hocevar, Ocean Campaigns Director, Greenpeace USA. “There is no way to reduce plastic waste without reducing plastic production.” 
Chevron Phillips did not respond to a request for comment.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Monday that U.S. President-elect Joe Biden should hold talks with North Korea to build on progress that President Donald Trump had made with leader Kim Jong Un. 
Biden takes office on Wednesday amid a prolonged stalemate in negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for U.S. sanctions relief. 
Moon, who had offered to be a mediator between Pyongyang and Washington, said he will seek an early chance to promote North Korea as Biden's foreign policy priority so that he will follow through on an agreement reached by Trump and Kim at their first summit in Singapore. 
The two leaders vowed to establish new relations and work toward complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in that joint statement, but their second summit and ensuing working-level talks fell apart. 
""The inauguration of the Biden administration would provide a turning point to newly start U.S.-North Korea dialogue, South-North dialogue, to inherit the achievements that were made under the Trump administration,"" Moon told a New Year news conference. 
""The dialogues can pick up the pace if we restart from the Singapore declaration and seek concrete measures in the negotiations."" 
Kim vowed to beef up nuclear capabilities at the ruling Workers' Party's rare congress last week, and that pledge highlighted the need to reopen negotiations for a peace deal, Moon said.
Moon said the issue of joint South Korea-U.S. military drills, which Pyongyang has long condemned as a rehearsal for war, can be discussed by reviving an inter-Korean military panel. 
Moon also called for a diplomatic solution with Japan to prevent the planned sale of Japanese corporate assets to compensate victims of forced labour, saying it would be ""undesirable"" for bilateral relations. 
The two countries are at odds over legacies from Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule, and some former labourers have secured a court order to seize domestic properties of Japanese firms.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - As top tennis stars descended on Melbourne for the upcoming tennis grand slam, many Australians questioned the decision to host the tournament when thousands of citizens are stranded overseas due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Australia has halved the number of people who can return to the country each week as positive coronavirus cases in hotel quarantine rise, prompting airline Emirates to indefinitely suspend flights to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. 
Australians criticised the government on social media, questioning how it could make room for 1,200 tennis players and their entourages for next month's Australian Open, but not its own citizens.

Others said the funds used to host the tournament could have been diverted to boost hotel quarantine facilities and healthcare systems to help bring back stranded Aussies. 
Officials in Victoria state, home to the Open, said hosting the tournament did not come at the cost of about 40,000 stranded Australians.
""No-one has been set aside coming from other jurisdictions into Victoria by virtue of the Australian Open going ahead,"" said Brett Sutton, Victoria chief medical officer. ""They are separate decisions that are made upon their own merits.""
Australia, which has managed the coronavirus better than many other nations through targeted lockdowns and high rates of testing and contact tracing, reported zero local COVID-19 cases on Monday.
But adding to the frustration for stranded Australians, the head of health department on Monday warned Australia may not fully reopen its international borders this year.
""Even if we have a lot of the population vaccinated, we don't know whether that will prevent transmission of the virus,"" Brendan Murphy told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.

Australia has reported nine positive COVID-19 results associated with tennis, prompting authorities to send three Australian Open charter flights into hard quarantine and forcing more than 70 players into 14-day hotel room isolation.

Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg reiterated on Monday the government was committed to bringing back its citizens.
""When it comes to Australian who are stranded...we, as the federal government, are working to help more Australians get back home,"" Frydenberg told reporters in Melbourne, adding 446,000 Australians have returned since the pandemic began in March.

The government on Saturday announced additional 20 repatriation flights to bring back stranded Aussies, saying they would not be counted within the existing traveller caps.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian police are investigating whether a shipment of guns and magazines originating from the United States that was seized by authorities late on Saturday was destined for Venezuela, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Colombia's tax and customs police (POLFA) said in a statement they seized six Anderson AM-15 rifles and seven magazines of 5.56 caliber ammunition after a truck was stopped at a police checkpoint in Magdalena province, which lies on the Caribbean coast. 
The arms were found at the back of the truck's container, hidden among used and dirty clothing, POLFA said. 
The vehicle had set off from Colombia's capital Bogota high in the Andes and was en route to Riohacha, the regional capital of the northeastern department of La Guajira, which borders Venezuela. 
A male suspect is thought to have been waiting to receive the arms and police are investigating if the weaponry's planned destination was Venezuela, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
POLFA will work with Homeland Security Investigations, an arm of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to determine which organization is responsible for the arms shipment, the statement said.
POLFA has seized eight firearms so far this year and, in addition to the rifle magazines, 260 rounds of 0.30 caliber ammunition, it said. In 2020, it seized 11 firearms, as well as 300 weapon parts and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition.
Colombia's tax and customs police have stepped up operations in 2021 to prevent arms trafficking, POLFA director Brigadier General Gustavo Franco said. 
""We are taking a robust stand against criminality,"" Franco said.

While Ottawa has been quick to embrace of Biden in an effort to turn the page on the Donald Trump era, the incoming U.S. administration's ""buy America"" policy is worrying to Canada. 
""I do think that he's been pretty clear around some of the aspects of his economic policy that are a little more protectionist than we would want to see,"" Ambassador Kirsten Hillman told Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
Biden's economic program promises a $400 billion investment in U.S.-made goods and says ""when we spend taxpayer money, we should buy American products"".
This could harm Canada because its economy is highly dependent on United States, which takes 75% of all Canadian goods exports. 
Other than that, the two countries have common agenda on many other policies, Hillman said.
""We are both focusing on, first and foremost, combating COVID, ensuring the safety and health of our citizens, respecting science...There's a lot of alignment on climate policy...So, I mean, the list is long of policy coordination,"" she added.
Mired in a long-running diplomatic dispute with China and weighing a possible snap election this year, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has much riding on his ties with Biden.

Hillman said Trudeau and Biden have a very warm and good relationship. ""So that is definitely going to be an asset.""

Support for Suga's Cabinet fell to 39% from 45% last month, with the disapproval rating rising 6 points to 49%, the poll showed.
Critics say Suga acted too slowly after coronavirus cases began surging late last year with his decisions to pause a domestic tourism campaign and declare a state of emergency for Tokyo and major cities coming too late.
The Yomiuri poll showed 78% of the public in favour of expanding the state of emergency beyond the current 11 prefectures, of which 42% say it should be declared for the entire country.

ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte faces two days of parliamentary votes that will decide if his fragile coalition can cling to power or has lost its majority, pushing Italy into deeper political turmoil.
Conte will address the lower house on Monday and the upper house, the Senate, on Tuesday about the future of his government after a junior partner quit the cabinet in a row over his handling of the twin coronavirus and economic crises.
Votes will be held in both chambers, with Conte struggling to fill the hole left by the defection of former premier Matteo Renzi and his small Italia Viva party.
Attention is especially focused on the 321-seat Senate, where Conte could be 10 votes short of an absolute majority after his efforts to persuade centrists in opposition ranks to rally to his side looked to have failed.
Renzi has said his 18 senators will probably abstain on Tuesday. If they do, the coalition will likely win the ballot, but without an absolute majority, the government will be inherently instable and it is not clear if President Sergio Mattarella would let Conte limp on in such a scenario.
Further muddying the waters, the co-ruling Democratic Party (PD), will want a cabinet reshuffle and a renegotiation of the coalition pact should the prime minister overcome the challenge in parliament, said a PD official who declined to be named.
Italia Viva has said it would return to the coalition if its policy demands are met. ""Our problems can be sorted out in two hours,"" party lawmaker Ettore Rosato told Sky Italia TV.
However, both the centre-left PD and its coalition ally, the 5-Star Movement, have said they want nothing more to do with Renzi, accusing him of betrayal. 
There also seems little chance that 5-Star will accept a key Renzi demand - that Italy apply for a loan from the euro zone's bailout fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) - to help its health service deal with COVID-19. The pandemic has killed almost 82,000 Italians, the sixth highest toll in the world.
""I will never vote for a government that considers itself the best in the world, that has seen 82,000 deaths and has not taken the ESM,"" Renzi told state broadcaster RAI on Sunday.

Critics of the loan scheme say it could come with unwelcome conditions and note that no other EU state has tapped the fund.

Since Jan. 5, the number of active cases has risen to 1,924 from about 900, Akufo-Addo said in a speech. There are now 120 severe cases, up from 18 a week ago. 
Ghana is not yet close to a peak seen during the first wave of infections in the middle of last year, but could quickly reach that level if cases keep rising at the current rate.
If they do, the president said he would impose another partial lockdown, despite worries about what that would do to one of West Africa's largest economies.
""Our COVID-19 treatment centres have gone from having zero patients to now being full because of the upsurge in infections,"" the president said. ""At this current rate ... our healthcare infrastructure will be overwhelmed.""
Across Africa, a second coronavirus wave is infecting twice as many people per day than at the height of last year’s first wave and has yet to peak, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
The rise has raised concern across the continent where, unlike in Europe and the United States, cash-strapped governments have been unable to secure supply deals with vaccine manufacturers, putting the onus for now on containment. 
Akufo-Addo said details about access to vaccines and a rollout plan would be announced ""very soon"".
He said that some people arriving from abroad had tested positive for ""new variants"" of the virus, without giving details. 
Last week, Gambia recorded its first two cases of the highly infectious coronavirus variant first found in Britain, in what appears to be the first confirmation of its presence in Africa.
""Work is ongoing to determine the presence and extent of spread of the new variants in the general population,"" Akufo-Addo said.

BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian health regulator Anvisa on Sunday approved emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines from China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd and Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), clearing the way for immunizations as the pandemic enters a deadly second wave.
Minutes after Anvisa's board voted unanimously to approve both vaccines, Monica Calazans, a 54-year-old nurse in Sao Paulo, became the first person to be inoculated in the country, receiving the Chinese vaccine known as CoronaVac.
President Jair Bolsonaro, a coronavirus skeptic who has refused to take a vaccine himself, is under growing pressure to start inoculations in Brazil, which has lost more than 200,000 to COVID-19 – the worst death toll outside the United States. 
(Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi) 
Delays with vaccine shipments and testing results have held up vaccinations in the country, once a global leader in mass immunizations and now a regional laggard after countries such as Chile and Mexico started giving shots last month. 
Bolsonaro's government aims to kick off a national immunization program this week but is waiting on shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine at the center of its plans. That has added to public frustration and offered a political rival the chance to upstage the right-wing president.
Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria, who oversees the Butantan biomedical center that is partnered with Sinovac in Brazil, said Anvisa's decision was a triumph for science as he gave the go-ahead for the first vaccination in his state.
""A victory for science. A victory for life. A victory for Brazil,"" Doria tweeted. 
Bolsonaro, for whom Doria is a potential center-right rival to his 2022 re-election efforts, has taunted the governor over CoronaVac's disappointing 50% efficacy in Brazilian trials. But the federal Health Ministry has agreed to acquire and distribute the shot for the national immunization drive.
Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello told a news conference that the rush to start vaccinating immediately was an illegal ""marketing ploy"" and the government would start distributing the vaccines to states on Monday, with the nationwide immunization plan beginning on Wednesday. 
Brazil could eventually vaccinate 1 million people a day, he said.
Adding to the urgency for vaccinations, a second wave of the outbreak in Brazil is snowballing as the country confronts a new, potentially more contagious variant of the coronavirus that originated in Amazonas state and prompted Britain and Italy to bar entry to Brazilians. 
Butantan, which is set up to fill and finish CoronaVac doses on its production line, plans to supply 46 million doses of the two-dose shot by April, the institute said in a statement. Some 6 million of those are ready to go.
The federally funded Fiocruz institute is still waiting for a delayed shipment of the active ingredient in the AstraZeneca vaccine for finishing on a Rio de Janeiro assembly line.

The Health Ministry has scrambled to line up 2 million ready doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India, but officials there have suggested it may take weeks to approve exports. Pazuello said on Sunday he expected the doses from India this week.

The planned construction, on land captured by Israel in the 1967 war that Palestinians seek as part of a future state, was announced on Monday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Netanyahu ordered the plans advanced and on Sunday, a government committee gave final ratification for 365 homes and preliminary approval for another 415, said the Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now, which monitored the session.
A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the construction as illegal, accusing Israel of making a ""pre-emptive attempt ... to undermine any effort by (incoming) U.S. President Joe Biden to relaunch the stalled peace process"".
In a statement, the European Union said Israel's latest decision to advance the plans ""is contrary to international law and further undermines the prospects of a viable two-state solution"".
The government committee's website was not immediately updated with details of Sunday's moves, which were also reported by Israel's main media outlets.
Settler leaders have voiced concern that once he takes office as president on Wednesday, Biden, a Democrat who has been critical of Israeli settlement activity in the past, will try to slow housing construction.
Peace Now said approval of the new settler housing ""needlessly sets Israel on a collision course with the incoming Biden administration"". 
Most countries view Israeli settlements as violating international law. Israel disputes this, citing historical, political and biblical links to the West Bank, where more than 440,000 Israeli settlers now live among 3 million Palestinians.
President Donald Trump has effectively backed Israel's right to build West Bank settlements by abandoning a long-held U.S. position that they break international law.

He also has won Israeli praise and drawn Palestinian anger by recognising contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there. U.S.-backed peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014.

RIYADH (Reuters) - A Saudi appeals court has nearly halved a six-year jail sentence handed to a U.S.-Saudi physician whose case has been closely followed by Washington and suspended the rest of his term, court documents showed, meaning he will not have to serve any more time in prison.
Prominent physician Walid al-Fitaihi was detained in 2017 under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's anti-corruption campaign, and was sentenced last month to six years in prison. U.S. senators condemned the sentencing.
Fitaihi, who was also given a six-year travel ban last month, had not yet begun his sentence as he awaited the outcome of his appeal.
The appeals court's verdict cut his jail sentence to 3.2 years and reduced the travel ban to 38 months, according to the documents dated Jan. 14 and seen by Reuters.
The court decision comes ahead of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden taking office this week. Biden has said he will take a firmer line regarding the kingdom's human rights record.
Fitaihi will not have to serve any more jail time as the appeals court took into account time served and suspended the remainder, the documents showed.
Fitaihi, who was temporarily released in July 2019 pending trial, was convicted on charges that include obtaining U.S. citizenship without permission, supporting a ""terrorist organisation"" calling for ""disobedience against the state's rulers"", and criticising other Arab nations.
The appeals court upheld the conviction on those charges which were listed in the documents. The terrorist organisation is understood to be a reference to the Muslim Brotherhood, activists and his family have said. 
The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Prince Mohammed, the kingdom's de facto ruler, had enjoyed a strong relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump, who had provided a buffer against international criticism sparked by the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the detention of women's rights activists.
Last month, a Saudi court sentenced prominent women's rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul to nearly six years in prison. The court suspended two years and 10 months of her jail term, most already served since her arrest in May 2018, meaning she could be released by March 2021.
Foreign diplomats said at the time that the December trials aimed to send a message that Riyadh would not yield to pressure on human rights issues, but that Saudi Arabia could also use the sentences as leverage with the Biden administration.
The U.S.-trained Fitaihi ran a private hospital in the Red Sea city of Jeddah at the time of his detention and had gained prominence as a motivational religious speaker. He advised the kingdom's health ministry on the pandemic in between hearings.
His wife and six of his children, all U.S. citizens, were also barred from travel and the family had its assets frozen, his son has said.

Protests broke out on Saturday after results from Thursday's election were announced in two areas, Luwero district north of Kampala and Masaka to the southwest, and security forces killed two people and arrested 23 in total, NTV Uganda reported on Sunday, citing local police. 
No other details were immediately available about the protests.
A nationwide internet blackout since the day before the vote has slowed the flow of information about the process.
""We have evidence of ballot stuffing and other forms of election malpractice and after putting it together we are going to take all measures that the law permits to challenge this fraud,"" Maathias Mpuuga of Wine's National Unity Party (NUP) told a news conference.
On Saturday the electoral commission declared Museveni the winner of Thursday's vote, with final counts showing the president won 59% of votes to Wine's 35%. Announcing the results, the commission congratulated Ugandans on a peaceful and successful process. 
The United States and Britain issued statements on Saturday calling for investigations into fraud reports and other concerns over the electoral process. The campaign and election were marked by a deadly crackdown by security forces on opposition candidates and their supporters and an internet shutdown.
The African Union sent an observer tean but it did not arrive in Uganda until the day before the vote due to COVID-19 related issues, and observed polling only in the capital and its immediate environs, it said in a statement, describing its work as ""more of a solidarity mission"" than an ""classical election observer mission."" An African election monitoring group that deployed 2,000 Ugandan observers reported irregularities.
Museveni, 76, in power since 1986 and one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, said after he was declared winner that the election may turn out to be the ""most cheating free"" in Uganda's history.
In his victory speech, Museveni he said he was in politics to address historical challenges and reiterated a pre-election message that his government would deal decisively with anyone who disrupted peace in the country.
Wine's party said at the news conference that the opposition leader and his wife are unable to leave their home, which it said is surrounded by soldiers and police who are blocking members of his party and journalists from entering.
Wine, a 38-year-old musician-turned-lawmaker whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was not reachable on Sunday. 
On Friday and Saturday Wine told Reuters that he believed his life was in danger, that he was being silenced by Museveni's government, and that he urged Ugandans to reject the election results. 
He also called on Western governments who have provided billions of dollars in aid to Uganda to hold the government accountable for what he called ""mockery of democracy.""
Wine's party also said that one of its MPs, Francis Zaake, was arrested on Friday while trying to access their leader's compound. After being beaten by security forces, he was hospitalized for treatment of injuries, party spokesman Joel Seenyonye said at the news conference.
Police, military and government spokespeople did not immediately respond on Sunday to requests for comment on the scene at Wine's house, or on Zaake.
The government said during pre-election campaigning that it arrested opposition members and their supporters for breaking laws governing public order and COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings. 
On Saturday, a military spokesman told Reuters that security officers at Wine's house were assessing threats he could face and might be preventing him from leaving for his own safety.

With results still coming in, Wine's NUP won 56 seats in the new parliament, local media reported, up from zero in the previous parliament. Many ruling party lawmakers, including Vice President Edward Ssekandi, lost their races.

French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian, in an interview with the Journal du Dimanche published on Saturday, said Iran was building up its nuclear weapons' capacity and it was urgent that Tehran and Washington return to a 2015 nuclear agreement.
""Dear colleague: You kick-started your cabinet career with arms sales to Saudi war criminals. Avoid absurd nonsense about Iran,"" Zarif said in a Twitter post, in which he tagged his French counterpart @JY_LeDrian. 
French President Emmanuel Macron's government has drawn criticism from some countries and rights groups over its support of Saudi Arabia's actions and allowing weapons it has sold to Riyadh potentially to be used in its Yemen operations. 
""Reality check: YOU are destabilising OUR region. Stop protecting criminals who chainsaw their critics and use YOUR arms to slaughter children in Yemen,"" Zarif tweeted, referring to Le Drian's previous post as French defence minister. 
Iran, which denies seeking to make nuclear bombs, rejected a statement on Saturday by three European powers party that warned the Islamic Republic against starting work on uranium metal-based fuel for a research reactor, saying it violated the nuclear pact and had serious military implications.
Zarif criticised France, Germany and Britain - which remain in the deal with China and Russia - for failing to enforce the agreement since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned the deal and restored harsh economic sanctions on Iran. 
""E3 leaders — who rely on (the) signature of OFAC functionaries to carry out their obligations under JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) — have done ZILCH to maintain JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). Remember @EmmanuelMacron's stillborn initiative or UK non-payment of court-ordered debt? JCPOA is alive because of Iran and not E3,"" Zarif tweeted. 
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, has pledged to return the United States to the deal ""if Iran resumes strict compliance"" with the agreement that imposed strict curbs on its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions.

In reaction to Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy, Iran has gradually breached many of the deal’s restrictions. But Tehran says it could quickly reverse those steps if Washington first lifts its sanctions.

ROME (Reuters) - Efforts by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to build a new majority in parliament after a junior partner quit his coalition floundered at the weekend as several centrist lawmakers rejected his overtures.
Conte is due to address the lower house on Monday and the upper house, the Senate, on Tuesday about the political chaos, which was triggered by former premier Matteo Renzi, who objected to the government's handling of the economic and coronavirus crises. 
By pulling his small Italia Viva party from the government, Renzi effectively stripped Conte of his majority in the Senate, leaving him scrabbling to fill the hole by trying to persuade centrists in opposition ranks to join him.
He was dealt a blow on Saturday when three senators from the tiny UDC party said they had decided to remain within the centre-right bloc, which has called for Conte's resignation and a snap election.
Complicating the situation, Renzi has said his 18 senators will probably abstain on Tuesday when the 321-seat upper house gets to vote on Conte's future. If they do, the coalition will likely win the vote, but fall short of an absolute majority.
Previous governments have managed to limp on in similar circumstances, but it is not clear if President Sergio Mattarella, the key decision-maker in political crises, will give his blessing to such a scenario.
Further muddying the waters, the co-ruling Democratic Party (PD) is likely to push for a cabinet reshuffle and a renegotiation of the coalition pact, regardless of what happens on Tuesday, according to a PD official who declined to be named.
Italia Viva has said it will to return to the coalition if it wins concessions. ""If he wants to, Conte can resolve this crisis this afternoon. He doesn't even have to go to parliament,"" party lawmaker Ettore Rosato told Sky Italia TV.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government hopes to ease some lockdown restrictions in March as it presses ahead with Europe's fastest rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Sunday.
The country, which also has Europe's highest COVID-19 death toll, has been under national lockdown since Jan. 5, with schools closed for most pupils, non-essential businesses shut and people ordered to work from home where possible. 
""What we want to do is get out of this national lockdown as soon as possible,"" Raab told Sky News television. 
""By early spring, hopefully by March, we'll be in a position to make those decisions. I think it's right to say we won't do it all in one big bang. As we phase out the national lockdown, I think we'll end up phasing through a (regional) tiered approach.""
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set a target of vaccinating the oldest age groups, the clinically vulnerable and frontline workers - roughly 14 million people - by the middle of February. 
He has said that England can consider easing lockdown restrictions from that time if all goes smoothly. 
The Sunday Times said that British ministers had settled their differences to back a three-point plan that could lead to some lockdown restrictions being lifted as soon as early March.
Areas will have restrictions eased once their death rate has fallen, the number of hospital admissions drops and some people aged between 50 and 70 are vaccinated, the newspaper said.
It quoted ministers as saying they were prepared to resist pressure from health advisers to delay the changes until most people are vaccinated, a process that could take until the autumn.
A spokesman in Johnson's office declined to comment on the report. 
The head of England's public health service said the vaccination programme had made ""a very strong start"" but a quarter of people hospitalised were aged under 55, younger than the priority target groups.
""It's not going to be the case that on Valentine's Day or the 15th of February, with one bound we are free. But, equally, I don't think we will be having to wait until the autumn,"" Simon Stevens told BBC television, referring to the easing of restrictions.

Savaro Ltd, the trading firm which procured the chemicals in 2013, shared a London address with companies linked to George Haswani and Imad Khoury, according to the report by documentary film-maker Firas Hatoum, which aired on Lebanon's al-Jadeed TV station this week.
Haswani, Khoury and his brother Mudalal Khoury have all been sanctioned by Washington for supporting Assad's war effort. All three are joint Syrian-Russian nationals, according to the U.S. sanctions list and a database that gathers data from official Russian institutions.
The U.S. Treasury accused Mudalal Khoury in 2015 of ""an attempted procurement of ammonium nitrate in late 2013"". It sanctioned his brother Imad a year later for engaging in business activities with Mudalal. Haswani was sanctioned in 2015 on charges of helping Assad's government to buy oil from Islamic State militants, which he has denied. 
In reviewing filings with Companies House, the UK's companies registry, Reuters found that Savaro and Hesco Engineering and Construction Company Ltd, a firm subject to U.S. sanctions for its links to Haswani, both moved their corporate registers -- official company records -- to the same London address on June 25, 2011.
That address was also the registered office for IK Petroleum Industrial Company Ltd, in which Imad Khoury was a director, the filings show.
Dozens of companies can share listed addresses and such links do not necessarily prove company owners are connected. But it is rare for firms to move their registers, particularly to the same address on the same day, according to a Reuters review of filings by hundreds of companies. 
Reuters located the agent which had helped register Hesco, but it did not respond to attempts to seek comment about Hesco's relationship with Savaro. Reuters could not determine if Haswani controlled Savaro, which might have provided a possible indication of his involvement in the procurement of the ammonium nitrate which exploded in Beirut.
Imad Khoury denied links to Savaro. ""There is a registrar in London, many companies are registered by it, not just mine,"" he told Reuters. ""I don't know this Savaro.""
Mudalal Khoury said there was ""no logic"" behind laying blame for the Beirut explosion on a company registered at a London address where many others are also registered.
Reuters could not reach Haswani for comment. His son told Reuters in Moscow that his father was unlikely to comment on allegations of links to the chemicals because they are ""total nonsense"". 
CALL FOR INVESTIGATION
The findings about the possible links between Savaro and the Syrian businessmen have raised questions among some in Beirut over whether the ammonium nitrate, which is used for fertilizer but also explosives, may have been destined for Syria.
""We want this to be investigated,"" Youssef Lahoud, a lawyer who represents around 1,400 victims of the blast, told Reuters.
""It may lead us nowhere or it may be the thread that unravels but we must follow up."" 
Lebanese Justice Minister Marie Claude Najm told Reuters the report should be investigated, as with any other allegations related to the ongoing probe into the blast, which is in the hands of the investigating judge and is confidential.
The Companies House register identifies a Cypriot national, Marina Psyllou, as director and majority owner of Savaro since 2016. Psyllou told Reuters in an email on Friday that she does not manage or own Savaro. She did not respond to questions about Haswani.
The Beirut blast killed 200 people, injured thousands and destroyed entire neighbourhoods. Officials have said the chemicals went up in flames after being stored at the port in poor conditions for years.
The ammonium nitrate was loaded onto a ship called the Rhosus in Georgia, shipping records show, before making an unscheduled stop in Lebanon in late 2013. It never left, becoming tangled in a legal dispute. The Mozambican firm that ordered the nitrate, FEM, has said it ordered the shipment through Savaro Ltd.

The country's fractious politicians have been unable to agree on a new administration since the last one quit in the aftermath of the Aug. 4 Beirut port explosion, leaving Lebanon rudderless as it sinks deeper into economic crisis.
Tensions between Aoun and Hariri, who publicly traded blame in December after failing to agree a cabinet, came to a head last week when a leaked video showed Aoun apparently calling Hariri a liar. 
Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai said at his Sunday sermon that the situation in Lebanon was now ""tragic"" and there was no excuse to further delay forming a government. 
""We wish that his excellency the president take the initiative and invite the prime minister-designate to a meeting."" 
Veteran Sunni politician Hariri was named premier for a fourth time in October, promising to form a cabinet of specialists to enact reforms necessary to unlock foreign aid, but political wrangling has delayed the process since.
The leaked video that circulated on social media last week showed Aoun talking to caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab about Hariri. 
""There is no government formation, he (Hariri) is saying he gave me a paper, he is lying,"" Aoun is heard saying. 
Sources in the president's office said the dialogue had been taken out of context and was not complete. 
After the video circulated, Hariri tweeted biblical verses referring to wisdom not residing in bodies that were amenable to sin. 
The souring of the relationship between Aoun and Hariri comes as the country continues to struggle with an acute financial crisis that has seen the currency sink by about 80%. 

Lebanon's healthcare system is also buckling under the pressure of a severe spike in COVID-19 infections. Medical supplies have dwindled as dollars have grown scarce.

KABUL (Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen killed two female judges from Afghanistan's Supreme Court on Sunday morning, police said, adding to a wave of assassinations in Kabul and other cities while government and Taliban representatives have been holding peace talks in Qatar. 
The two judges, who have not yet been named, were killed and their driver wounded, in an attack at around 8:30 am, police said, adding the case was being investigated by security forces. 
A spokesman for the Taliban said its fighters were not involved.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani issued a statement condemning attacks on civilians by the Taliban and other militant groups.
Ghani said ""terror, horror and crime"" was not a solution to Afghanistan's problem and beseeched the Taliban to accept ""a permanent ceasefire"". 
Government officials, journalists, and activists have been targeted in recent months, stoking fear particularly in the capital Kabul.
The Taliban has denied involvement in some of the attacks, but has said its fighters would continue to ""eliminate"" important government figures, though not journalists or civil society members.
Rising violence has complicated U.S.-brokered peace talks taking place in Doha as Washington withdraws troops.
Sources on both sides say negotiations are only likely to make substantive progress once U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office and makes his Afghan policy known.

The number of U.S troops in Afghanistan has been reduced to 2,500, the lowest level of American forces there since 2001, according to the Pentagon on Friday.

Documents supporting drugmaker Uniao Quimica's application for emergency use of the vaccine have been returned to the company because they did not meet its minimum criteria, the watchdog said on Saturday. 
In a statement on the Health Ministry's website, regulator Anvisa said the request failed to provide adequate assurances on Phase III clinical trials and issues related to the manufacture of the vaccine.
Uniao Quimica is seeking approval for the use of 10 million doses of Sputnik V in Brazil in the first quarter of this year. 
Russia's RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which is promoting Sputnik globally, on Sunday said that Anvisa had requested additional information that would be provided shortly. 
Its statement said that such requests from regulators were standard procedure and do not mean the registration bid has been rejected. It also said that legislation going through the Brazilian Senate, if approved, would allow use of vaccines approved by other countries. 
Moscow has approved Sputnik for Russian domestic use, though clinical trials there have not yet been completed. 
Anvisa officials had previously said that the Sputnik V vaccine would have to be submitted to Phase III clinical trials in Brazil before its use could be authorised. 
Anvisa said on Saturday that any applicant requesting emergency use authorisation must show that the vaccine would deliver long-term safety and effectiveness.
The regulator is expected to make a decision on Sunday about authorising emergency use of vaccines developed by China's Sinovac and Britain's AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).
RDIF said that Sputnik had already been registered in Serbia, Belarus, Argentina, Bolivia, Algeria, Venezuela, Paraguay and by the Palestinian authorities. 
Registrations in two more countries are expected next week, it said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - At least 73 people have been killed after an earthquake struck Indonesia's West Sulawesi province on Friday, the disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said on Sunday, the latest in a string of disasters to hit the Southeast Asian country. 
More than 820 people were injured and over 27,800 left their homes after the 6.2 magnitude quake, BNPB spokesman Raditya Jati said. Some sought refuge in the mountains, while others went to cramped evacuation centres, witnesses said.
Police and military officers have been deployed to crack down on looting in several parts of the region, Jati added.
An emergency response status, intended to help rescue efforts, has also been put in place for two weeks, he said. 
Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia's meteorological, climatology and geophysical agency (BMKG), has said that another quake in the region could potentially trigger a tsunami.
Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2018, a devastating 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.
Just two weeks into the new year, the world's fourth-most populous country is battling several disasters.
Floods in North Sulawesi and South Kalimantan province each have killed at least five this month, while landslides in West Java province have killed at least 29, authorities said. 
On Jan. 9, a Sriwijaya Air jet crashed into the Java Sea with 62 onboard.
East Java's Semeru mountain erupted late on Saturday, but there have been no reports of casualties or evacuations. 

Dwikorita said extreme weather and other ""multi-dangers"" of hydrometeorology are forecast in the coming weeks.

TOKYO (Reuters) - For Yuuki Hamazono, it was a relief to find bars and restaurants in Tokyo flouting the Japanese government's request to close by 8 p.m. 
The 30-year-old financial trader was one of many people out in the Shimbashi nightlife district during the first weekend of an expanded state of emergency, with the government pleading for residents to stay home to contain the coronavirus.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared a state of emergency for Tokyo and surrounding prefectures this month. He expanded it to 11 prefectures accounting for 55% of the population on Wednesday. Unlike in many other countries with mandatory lockdowns, Japanese authorities legally can only urge people to stay at home and businesses to close.
While compliance has been high - most of Shimbashi's karaoke bars and izakaya taverns were closed on Friday night - more people appear to be ignoring the state of emergency this time than one last year.
""There are people who can't have dinner until after 8 p.m., including me,"" Hamazono said, citing his working hours. He and a friend were looking for a place to duck into among a jumble of izakayas on Shimbashi's narrow streets.
Nearby, touts called out on the street, advertising places that were still open.
Authorities have worried about the potential spread of infection at bars and restaurants. In Shimbashi, many drinking spots are cramped and with poor ventilation.
The government has offered subsidies to establishments that close on time, but some say it's not enough, and worry about losing customers. 
""Though there are subsidies, for restaurants and bars the relations of trust are important,"" said Yuji Tobe, a 34-year-old barman in a standing-only drinking spot, where wooden tabletops rest on stacks of plastic crates.
""We have a bond with our customers.""
Tobe's bar was nominally closed, although two regulars were still being served.
Some criticise what they call a half-hearted government response. Suga has been accused of being slow to act out of fear of damaging the economy. His support has plunged.
""It's unclear whether getting the economy going or stopping corona comes first,"" said a man who gave his name only as Kazumasa. He was queuing for one the restaurants under the train tracks serving yakitori, skewers of grilled chicken.
The government is considering an amendment to give authorities more power to enforce a lockdown, the minister in charge of administrative and regulatory reform, Taro Kono, told Reuters on Thursday.
Until then, it seems likely that many will keep drinking.
""There are many times we need to talk business over drinks. That kind of communication is necessary to do business,"" said 48-year-old Motoki Mori, the owner of an event production company who was headed to a bar with his business partner.
""I don't think you can put a cut-off time on that.""

The 37-year-old climber, whose car accident 10 years ago left him paralyzed from waist down, could not make it to the top of the 300 metre-tall Nina Tower on the Kowloon peninsula.
""I was quite scared,"" Lai said. ""Climbing up a mountain, I can hold onto rocks or little holes, but with glass, all I can really rely on is the rope that I'm hanging off.""
The event raised HK$5.2 million ($670,639) in donations.
Lai, prior to 2011, was crowned Asia champion four times for rock climbing and at one point ranked eighth globally. 
After his accident, he resumed climbing by attaching his wheelchair to a pulley system. Five years ago he ascended the 495-metre high Lion Rock mountain, a local folk culture symbol of Hong Kong's strength and grit. 
    ""Apart from just living, I wondered what drives me? So I began to chase that, knowing that there was a possibility I could climb mountains, even in a wheelchair,"" Lai said.
    ""In a way, I forgot that I was a disabled person, I could still dream and I could still do what I liked doing.""
Although he did not make it to the top of the skyscraper, due to safety concerns, Lai hoped to send a message.
    ""Some people don't understand the difficulties of disabled people, some people think that we are always weak, we need help, we need assistance, we need people's pity,"" Lai said.
""But, I want to tell everyone, it doesn't have to be like that. If a disabled person can shine, they can at the same time bring about opportunity, hope, bring about light, they don't have to be viewed as weak.""

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said it is ""deeply disappointed"" by Mexico's decision to close its investigation of ex-Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos, after the Mexican attorney general decided not to press charges.
The decision, which Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador publicly backed on Friday, and a document dump by Mexico's government of U.S. evidence against Cienfuegos, threatens to strain strategic U.S.-Mexico security ties.
On Friday, on Lopez Obrador's instructions, the foreign ministry tweeted the link to a 751-page document that included detailed logs of alleged Blackberry (TSX:BB) communications.
A DOJ spokesperson late Friday called the decision to publicize information shared with Mexico in confidence deeply disappointing.
""Publicizing such information violates the Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance between Mexico and the United States, and calls into question whether the United States can continue to share information to support Mexico's own criminal investigations,"" the DOJ said.
Mexico's foreign ministry declined to comment on the DOJ's statement.
Lopez Obrador said he ordered the whole archive of documents released to the public because he wanted ""complete transparency.""
Late on Saturday, Mexico released another massive cache of documents online relating to the case. The files comprised thousands of pages, though many of them were heavily redacted.
Friday's released document includes text messages, often misspelled, between ""Thor"", ""Superman"", ""Spartacus"", ""Samantha"", and ""Iron Man,"" suspects being tracked by U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents in 2015 and 2016 whose chatter apparently identified Cienfuegos as an ally of drug cartels during the previous government.
It was not immediately clear what evidence was in the communications to show wrongdoing by Cienfuegos, however.
""Those conversations are not a smoking gun against Cienfuegos. But are they completely exculpatory? I don't think so either,"" said Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope.
Hope said there was likely more evidence that was not included in the data dump.
John Ackerman, a doctor in constitutional law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and vocal supporter of Lopez Obrador, was more critical.
""I will never defend Cienfuegos. The army committed all kinds of atrocities during the administration of Enrique Pena Nieto, but the DEA's 'evidence' is frankly a joke,"" Ackerman said on Twitter, suggesting the Blackberry messages were ""written by a third- or fourth-rate narco or soldier.""
The situation could put other probes and court cases in which Mexico needs U.S. collaboration at risk.
""Now they have created a major, major source of friction with the U.S., and that could really hobble not only this investigation but other investigations that President (Lopez Obrador) is really keen on,"" said Hope.
Cienfuegos, who was minister from 2012 to 2018 during the government of former President Pena Nieto, was arrested in October at Los Angeles airport on charges he worked with a powerful drug cartel.
U.S. prosecutors later dropped the case and returned him to Mexico to be prosecuted, with Lopez Obrador's administration vowing a thorough investigation of the case. 
On Thursday, less than two months after Cienfuegos' return from the United States, Mexico's attorney general office concluded that he had no contact with members of the criminal organization and said it will not pursue criminal charges.
The DOJ spokesperson said the department ""fully stands by its investigation and charges in this matter,"" that the documents show the case against Cienfuegos was not fabricated, and the information was lawfully gathered in the United States through a proper U.S. court order, in full respect of Mexico's sovereignty.

""A U.S. federal grand jury analyzed that material and other evidence and concluded that criminal charges against Cienfuegos were supported by the evidence.""

1641,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2021 11:05PM ET</span>",Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny due to fly back to Russia despite arrest threat,"By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is due to fly back to Russia on Sunday for the first time since he was poisoned last summer, despite the authorities' stated desire to arrest him and potentially jail him for years.
Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin's most prominent domestic critics, announced his decision to return from Germany on Wednesday, saying he missed Moscow and was not interested in what he called new fabricated criminal cases against him.
A day later, the Russian capital's prison service said it would do everything to arrest him once he returned, accusing him of flouting the terms of a suspended prison sentence for embezzlement, a 2014 case he says was trumped up.
Navalny, who is hoping for success in parliamentary elections in September, faces potential trouble in three other criminal cases too, all of which he says are politically motivated.
His return poses a conundrum for the Kremlin: jail him and risk protests and punitive Western action by turning him into a political martyr. Or do nothing and risk looking weak in the eyes of Kremlin hardliners.
Navalny, 44, is expected to fly from Berlin, where he was flown in August for emergency medical treatment after being poisoned with what German tests showed was a Novichok nerve agent, and to arrive in Moscow on Sunday at 1620 GMT. 
The opposition politician, who says he has nearly fully recovered, says Putin was behind his poisoning. The Kremlin denies involvement, says it has seen no evidence that he was poisoned, and that he is free to return to Russia.
Navalny says the Kremlin is afraid of him. The Kremlin, which only refers to him as the ""Berlin patient,"" laughs that off. Putin allies point to opinion polls that show the Russian leader is far more popular than Navalny, whom they call a blogger rather than a politician.
SUPPORTERS PLAN TO GREET NAVALNY 
Navalny has said he will take a flight operated by Russian airline Pobeda, owned by state-controlled Aeroflot.
His supporters plan to meet him at Moscow's Vnukovo airport despite a forecast of bitterly cold minus 17 Celsius (1 Fahrenheit) weather and over 4,500 new coronavirus cases a day in the Russian capital. 
So far, at least 2,000 people have used a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page to say they plan to be there, with another 6,000 expressing an interest. Pro-Kremlin activists are also expected to turn up.
The Moscow prosecutor's office, which says it has officially warned 15 pro-Navalny organisers, has said the event is illegal because it is not sanctioned by the authorities. That means that people who turn up could be detained, fined or jailed.
Citing COVID-19 restrictions, the airport has said it will not allow media inside.
A Moscow court on Saturday ordered a Navalny ally, Pavel Zelensky, to be held in pre-trial detention on extremism charges which he denies. 
On the eve of his return, Navalny took to Facebook to thank Germans for what he described as their stereotype-breaking friendly hospitality in the last five months.
""Thank you friends!"", he wrote in German.

PARIS (Reuters) - Iran is in the process of building up its nuclear weapons capacity and it is urgent that Tehran and Washington return to a 2015 nuclear agreement, France's foreign minister was quoted as saying in an interview published on Saturday.
Iran has been accelerating its breaches of the nuclear deal and earlier this month started pressing ahead with plans to enrich uranium to 20% fissile strength at its underground Fordow nuclear plant. That is the level Tehran achieved before striking the deal with world powers to contain its disputed nuclear ambitions.
The Islamic Republic's breaches of the nuclear agreement since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018 and subsequently imposed sanctions on Tehran may complicate efforts by President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20, to rejoin the pact.
""The Trump administration chose what it called the maximum pressure campaign on Iran. The result was that this strategy only increased the risk and the threat,"" Le Drian told the Journal du Dimanche newspaper.
""This has to stop because Iran and - I say this clearly - is in the process of acquiring nuclear (weapons) capacity.""
The agreement's main aim was to extend the time Iran would need to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb, if it so chose, to at least a year from roughly two to three months. It also lifted international sanctions against Tehran.
Western diplomats have said Iran's repeated breaches have already reduced the ""breakout time"" to well below a year.
Iran denies any intent to weaponise its nuclear programme. 
With presidential elections in Iran due in June, Le Drian said it was urgent to ""tell the Iranians that this is enough"" and to bring Iran and the United States back into the accord.
Biden has said he will return the United States to the deal if Iran resumes strict compliance with it. Iran says sanctions must be lifted before it reverses its nuclear breaches.
However, Le Drian said that even if both sides were to return to the deal, it would not be enough.
""Tough discussions will be needed over ballistic proliferation and Iran's destabilisation of its neighbours in the region,"" Le Drian said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain announced plans to hold the first in-person meeting of the G7 for nearly two years in June, inviting the leaders of major developed economies to a picturesque seaside village to discuss rebuilding from the pandemic and climate change.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to use Britain's presidency of the G7 to forge a consensus that the global economy must recover from the COVID-19 crisis in a pro-free trade and sustainable way.
""Coronavirus is doubtless the most destructive force we have seen for generations and the greatest test of the modern world order we have experienced,"" he said in a statement. ""It is only right that we approach the challenge of building back better by uniting with a spirit of openness to create a better future.""
Britain has suffered badly during the health crisis, with the highest death toll in Europe of more than 88,000 people. 
But, while a third wave of the virus causes more than 1,000 deaths per day, the country is leading the way on vaccinations having been the first in the world to authorise their use, and hopes to have much of the population protected within months.
Last year's G7 meeting, due to be hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump, was cancelled due to the pandemic, meaning the leaders of Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Italy, Japan, the European Union and Canada have not met in person since the 2019 meeting in Biarritz, France.
The Sunday Telegraph newspaper said the British government hoped the event would be the occasion for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's first trip to Europe after he becomes president on Jan. 20.
""I don't think he will visit anywhere else before the G7, except possibly Canada,"" the newspaper quoted an unnamed British government source as saying. 
Johnson has also invited Australia, India and South Korea to attend.
The summit will take place in the tiny resort of Carbis Bay in Cornwall, southwest England - an area now most famous for its beaches and surfing but also home to fishing fleets and once an important mining area.

""Two hundred years ago Cornwall's tin and copper mines were at the heart of the UK's industrial revolution and this summer Cornwall will again be the nucleus of great global change and advancement,"" Johnson said.

Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, moved to Los Angeles with baby son Archie last year after they gave up their official royal roles following disagreements with other family members and in the face of huge media attention.
""I think he is heartbroken by the situation with his family,"" Bradby said in an interview for  ITV  (LON:ITV)'s ""Love Your Weekend with Alan Titchmarsh"" show.
""But are they unhappy out there? No, I don’t think that’s right, I think they are pretty happy actually, but I think they wrestle with their position in life, I think they all do.""
Bradby's interviews with the couple during a 2019 tour of Africa provided insight into growing tensions within the royal family since their 2018 wedding and the birth of their son, with a tearful Meghan describing the difficulty of being a new mother and dealing with incessant scrutiny. 
Harry also admitted to disagreements with elder brother Prince William, who is second in line to the throne. 
""Well, just the situation with the family clearly isn’t ideal and it has been a very difficult year for them all,"" Bradby said. 
""There are still a lot of hurt feelings on all sides and it’s very difficult,"" he added.
Bradby's documentary on the couple presaged their decision to step back from all official royal duties in 2020.

Participants at talks in Geneva agreed on a mechanism for choosing the new government, whose formation has been the subject of wrangling among the main factions in a country that is a major oil producer. 
Acting U.N. Libya envoy Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) said the agreement represented the ""best possible compromise"" on the issue and could lead to the selection of a transitional government ""in several weeks"". 
However, she also warned that there would still be ""people seeking to obstruct"" peacemaking efforts.
The talks are part of a wider peace process, after years of chaos and warfare, which also involves a military ceasefire and an economic track. 
Libya has been split since 2014 between rival factions in Tripoli, in the west, and Benghazi in the east.
The internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli is backed by Turkey, while Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt. 
However, both sides themselves represent sometimes unstable coalitions of different political, regional and armed factions. 
The latest push towards peace began after the GNA turned back a 14-month LNA assault on Tripoli in June. A ceasefire was agreed in Geneva in October. 
In November, the United Nations invited 75 Libyans to join a political dialogue in Tunis, which set a date of Dec. 24 this year for presidential and parliamentary elections and agreed on the need for a new, unified transitional government.
The transitional government will be responsible for preparing for the elections, combating corruption and restoring public services across Libya, Williams said. 
However, November's Tunis meeting stalled when the delegates started discussing the make-up of the new government. Saturday's agreement was made by a smaller committee drawn from the participants. 

All 75 members of the dialogue will vote next week on the mechanism the Geneva committee agreed on Saturday.

TUNIS, (Reuters) - Tunisian Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi named 12 new ministers on Saturday in a cabinet reshuffle he hopes will inject new blood into his government amid rising political tensions and an unprecedented economic crisis.
    Mechichi named Walid Dhabi as the new interior minister, having this month sacked Taoufik Charfeddine, who is close to President Kais Saied, a move underscoring tensions between the country's two most powerful leaders
Saied and Mechichi are at odds over their respective powers and political alliances, jeopardising the stability required to push through much-needed reforms.
Hedi Khairi was named health minister following criticism over the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with the official date for the start of vaccinations in Tunisia still unknown.
    Disputes have also shaken the ranks of coalition partners supporting the government, with the Karama party refusing to vote on the reshuffle and threatening to leave the coalition.
    Mechichi named Youssef Zouaghi as justice minister, Sofien Ben Touns as minister of energy and Oussama Kheriji as minister of agriculture.
""The next stage is full of challenges, including the necessary reforms for the economy, which require increased efficiency and harmony"", Mechichi said.
    Although Tunisia became a democracy after its 2011 uprising, its economy has deteriorated, the country verges on bankruptcy and political leaders appear paralysed.

The ministry said Russia now had all the information needed to carry out a criminal investigation into Navalny's poisoning in August last year, including blood and tissue samples.
""The German government assumes that the Russian government will now immediately take all necessary steps to clarify the crime against Mr. Navalny,"" the spokesman said.
""This crime must be solved in Russia. This requires investigations commensurate with the seriousness of this crime,"" the spokesman added.
Navalny, who has been receiving treatment in Germany, plans to fly back to Russia on Sunday for the first time since he was poisoned, despite the risk of being jailed on his return.
He accuses Putin of ordering his poisoning with the deadly nerve agent Novichok, and some supporters have urged him to stay abroad for his own safety.
Putin has denied the authorities tried to poison Navalny and said Russian agents would have finished the job if they had wanted him dead.
The German Justice Ministry said Navalny was interviewed by Berlin prosecutors and provided ""extensive answers"" to questions submitted by Russia's general prosecutor's office.
These transcripts have now been made available to Russia as allowed by the European Mutual Legal Assistance Convention, the spokesman said.

Some 300,000 doses of the vaccine arrived from Moscow on a special flight of flag carrier Aerolineas Argentinas.
They will be used to complete the Sputnik treatment program that began in late December. More doses are expected to arrive in Argentina later this month and in February.
Paraguay this week became the eighth country outside Russia to approve the Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute. Other countries to approve emergency use of the vaccine include Bolivia, Venezuela, Algeria and Serbia.

Argentina's Minister of Science Roberto Salvarezza wrote on Twitter on Saturday that the highly contagious variant of SARS-CoV-2 from the United Kingdom had been detected in a traveler who arrived in Argentina from abroad.

MANILA (Reuters) - China promised on Saturday to donate 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Philippines as the two countries signed infrastructure deals aimed at boosting post-pandemic recovery efforts, officials said.
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte imposed one of the world's longest and strictest lockdowns to contain the virus in March last year - bringing one of Asia's fastest-growing economies to a standstill.
""As a friend of the Philippines and your closest neighbour, we will firmly stand with the people of the Philippines until the defeat of this virus,"" senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi said during a meeting with the Philippines' foreign minister.
Wang's talks in Manila wrapped up a week-long visit to four Southeast Asian nations.
Duterte has sought warmer ties with Beijing since taking office in 2016, setting aside a territorial spat in exchange for pledges of aid, loans and grants.
""China plays a very key role in reviving our region's economy,"" he said on Saturday. ""Let us do all we can to revive economic activities between the Philippines and China.""
China said it would donate 500,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Philippines, without saying which vaccines would be offered, the presidential palace said in a statement.
With nearly 499,000 coronavirus cases and almost 9,900 deaths, the Philippines has the region's second-highest number of infections and fatalities after Indonesia, but Manila has trailed neighbouring countries in securing vaccine doses.
Duterte has said he prefers to source COVID-19 vaccines from either China or Russia, and the country is buying 25 million doses of the experimental vaccine developed by Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech, with the first 50,000 expected to arrive in February.
On Saturday, officials from the two countries signed a deal for a 500 million yuan ($77 million) grant from China to fund infrastructure, livelihood and other projects in the Philippines. 

They also signed the commercial contract for a $940 million, 71-kilometre (44-mile) railway scheme north of the capital, Beijing's ambassador to Manila said in a statement.

1650,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2021 10:30AM ET</span>",Ally of poisoned Kremlin critic Navalny jailed in Moscow for extremism,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Pavel Zelensky, a member of the Anti-Corruption Foundation team of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, was jailed by a Moscow court on Saturday until Feb. 28 on charges of inciting extremism on the internet, according to a court statement.
His detention by the Presnensky District Court comes a day before Navalny's planned return to Russia since being poisoned in August and evacuated to Germany where he has been recuperating. 
Zelensky is a camera operator for the opposition leader's Anti-Corruption Foundation, which specialises in publishing high-impact investigations into what it says is official graft. Some of those targeted have disputed its findings and taken successful legal action.
He was detained on Friday, the head of Agora, a Moscow-based human rights group, said on social media, and will now spend over a month in pre-trial detention. 
Zelensky's case revolves around a tweet posted last October, Agora cited the camera operator's lawyer as saying. 
The tweet contained a photo of Irina Slavina, a Russian journalist who died after setting herself on fire in front of a branch of the Interior Ministry a day after her apartment was searched by police.
The social media post expressed anger at the government and called for people to take any feelings of protest offline. 
""(We) will not give up and will help Pasha Zelensky's family in every way possible,"" Ivan Zhdanov, director of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, said on Twitter after the court hearing. 
Navalny last week announced his plan to return to Russia on Jan. 17, signalling his intention to continue his political struggle against Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he accuses of ordering his poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent.
His return poses a conundrum for the Kremlin: jail him and risk protests, punitive Western action and creating a political martyr; or do nothing and risk looking weak.

Putin has denied the authorities tried to poison Navalny and said Russian agents would have finished the job if they had wanted him dead. The Kremlin has said it has seen no evidence Navalny was poisoned and that he is free to return to Russia at any time.

1651,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2021 09:10AM ET</span>","Distrust, division and doubt cloud Palestinian election call","By Nidal al-Mughrabi and Ali Sawafta
GAZA/RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Beset by political infighting, split between three territories and distrustful of their institutions, many Palestinians are sceptical that their first national elections in 15 years will bring change - or even happen at all.
President Mahmoud Abbas said on Friday that parliamentary and presidential elections would be held later this year in a bid to heal long-standing divisions. His main rival, the militant Islamist group Hamas, welcomed the move. 
The announcement is widely seen as a gesture aimed at pleasing U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, with whom the Palestinians want to reset relations after they reached a low under Donald Trump.
But a December poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research found 52% of Palestinians think elections held under present conditions would not be fair and free.
If Hamas won, 76% thought Fatah - the party led by Abbas - would not accept the result and 58% believed Hamas would reject a Fatah victory.
""We have taken an important step but we still have a long way to go,"" said veteran West Bank political analyst Hani al-Masri. ""Great obstacles remain and without overcoming these obstacles the whole operation will be doomed to fail."" 
Palestinian observers said those hurdles include disagreements within Hamas and Fatah - long the dominant faction in the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organization.
It is unclear what mechanism would be put in place to ensure a free election, whether international observers would take part and whether Abbas, aged 85 and in poor health, would run.
The United States, Israel and European Union would likely refuse dealings with any Palestinian government that included Hamas, which is designated by the West as a terrorist group.
POWER STRUGGLE
Israeli officials did not immediately comment and it was unclear whether Israel would permit election activity to take place in East Jerusalem, as it did previously. Palestinians want to hold the elections there, as well as the West Bank and Gaza.
""We have other alternatives, and what is important is that people from Jerusalem can take part in the election,"" Hanna Nasir, chairman of the Palestinian Central Election Committee, said on Saturday.
The last parliamentary ballot, in 2006, ended in a surprise win by Hamas in their first-ever national elections, creating a rift with Fatah that plunged into civil war when Hamas seized control of Gaza the following year.
Gaza is now a Hamas stronghold, while Abbas's power base is in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The two groups have failed to achieve lasting reconciliation, and previous pledges to hold elections went unfulfilled. Rights groups have accused both of suppressing political opposition.
Abbas said the parliamentary election will be held on May 22 and the presidential vote on July 31. He won in 2005 but his term was only meant to last four years.
Many ordinary Palestinians are sceptical.
""They will find a thousand reasons to call it off; Israel, the resistance, power-sharing, anything. I don't have any hopes,"" said one Gaza man, who asked not to be named because he was breaking a coronavirus lockdown.
Zuheir al-Khatib, a 57-year-old doctor from Bethlehem, was more optimistic.

""This is a 100% good decision, merited for over 15 years, if not more, we are supposed to be initiating a state and thus should have democracy,"" he said.

1652,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2021 08:40AM ET</span>",Major European powers rebuke Iran over uranium metal plans,"PARIS (Reuters) - Three European powers on Saturday warned Iran against starting work on uranium metal-based fuel for a research reactor, saying it contravened the 2015 nuclear deal and stressing that it had no civilian use but serious military implications. 
The U.N. nuclear watchdog and Tehran said on Wednesday that Iran had started the work, in the latest breach of its nuclear deal with six major powers as the country presses for a lifting of U.S. sanctions.
""We strongly encourage Iran to end this activity, and return to full compliance with its commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran nuclear deal) without delay, if it is serious about preserving this agreement,"" France, Britain and Germany said in a joint statement.
Iran has been accelerating its breaches of the deal in the past two months. Some of those steps were triggered by a law passed in response to the killing of its top nuclear scientist in November, which Tehran has blamed on its arch-foe Israel.
They are also part of a process of retaliation Tehran started in 2019 in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the deal and his reimposition of U.S. sanctions that the deal lifted in exchange for restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities.
The three powers, who remain in the deal with China and Russia, said they were ""deeply concerned"" and that Iran's production of uranium metal had no civilian credibility and had potentially serious military implications. 
The nuclear deal imposes a 15-year ban on Iran producing or acquiring uranium metal, a sensitive material that can be used in the core of a nuclear bomb.

The Iranian breaches raise pressure on U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next week and has pledged to return the United States to the deal if Iran first resumes full compliance. Iran wants Washington to lift sanctions first.

1653,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2021 08:25AM ET</span>",Newsmaker: Rocky road beckons as new CDU chair Laschet seeks to fill Merkel's shoes,"By John Stonestreet
(Reuters) - As premier of the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous, Armin Laschet has a background in executive leadership lacked by the rivals he defeated on Saturday to become chairman of the Christian Democrats (CDU).
A centrist, he had presented himself as the man with the best credentials to plough the same political furrow as the party's long-time leader Angela Merkel - and to run as its candidate for chancellor in federal elections in September.
But Laschet lacks her popular support and, after Saturday's narrow run-off victory, he must move swiftly and convincingly to unite a divided party or risk leaving it in a weaker position as it transitions towards the post-Merkel era.
The chancellor, Europe's predominant politician and a consistent winner with German voters since taking office in 2005, has said she will not run again, and will step down after September's ballot.
Laschet is the person she has come closest to endorsing as her successor as national leader, saying he has ""the tools"" to run for that job too.
He has polished his international profile, courting French President Emmanuel Macron and complaining last year that Berlin had taken ""too long to react"" to French calls for European Union reform. 
CDU sources say Laschet would be well suited to negotiating a possible coalition government with the Greens after September's ballot - a credible scenario with the CDU and its Bavarian sister party CSU standing at around 36% in opinion polls and the Greens at around 20%.
LITTLE POPULAR SUPPORT 
On paper, majority support in Saturday's vote of 1,001 party delegates represents a clear endorsement for Laschet to run for chancellor, and he said in his victory speech that he would do everything he could to ensure the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), could ""stick together through this year.""
However, the closeness of his 521 to 466-vote runoff win against arch-conservative rival Friedrich Merz points to continuing deep divisions within the party - and in the country as a whole Laschet has little popular support.
A survey by pollster Civey for newsmagazine Der Spiegel last month showed that if all Germans could vote for the CDU leadership, just 11.8% would support Laschet.
Merz, meanwhile, scored 28.8% and Norbert Roettgen, the chairman of parliament's foreign affairs committee and the third candidate in Saturday's party vote, 31.7%.
By tradition, the CDU chairman is usually - though not always - the chancellor candidate for the CDU and CSU, and the conservative bloc is on course to win September's federal ballot.
However, polls show the conservative most favoured by voters is a fourth man, CSU leader Markus Soeder. 
Soeder was one of the first to congratulate Laschet on Saturday, writing on Twitter that he was looking forward to their working together to ""continue the Union's success story,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Soeder aims to play a pivotal role in determining the conservative candidate to succeed Merkel as chancellor - but if Laschet flops, the Bavarian and may even take on that role himself, according to sources inside the governing conservative alliance who Reuters spoke to before Saturday's vote.

Cavusoglu made the comments to reporters on a flight home from Pakistan on Friday. Biden takes over from President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
""We will show sincere efforts to improve our ties. We expect the same approach from the Biden administration,"" Cavusoglu was cited as saying by broadcaster NTV. ""I think it will be a more predictable period in our ties, but we are ready.""
Last month, Washington imposed long-anticipated sanctions on Ankara over its acquisition the S-400 defence systems, in a move Turkey called a ""grave mistake"". It also removed Turkey, a NATO ally, from its F-35 fighter jet programme over the move.
Washington says the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 fighter jets and to NATO's broader defence systems. Turkey rejects this, saying S-400s will not be integrated into NATO, and has offered to form a joint working group to examine the conflicting claims.
Ankara says its purchase of the S-400s was not a choice, but rather a necessity as it was unable to procure missile defences from other NATO allies with satisfactory conditions.
President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday he hoped positive steps will be taken on Turkey's role in the F-35 jet programme once Biden takes office.

With ballots from 91% of polling stations counted following Thursday's election, Museveni had won 5.6 million, or 58.9%, while main opposition candidate Wine had 3.3 million votes (34.6%), the Electoral Commission said just after 12 p.m. (0900 GMT). Final results were expected at 3 p.m (1200 GMT), it said.
In a phone interview with Reuters, Wine accused Museveni of fabricating the results and called the poll ""the most fraudulent election in the history of Uganda"". He urged citizens to reject the results.
He also said his home in the capital, Kampala, was surrounded by hundreds of soldiers and that the military was not allowing him to leave.
Government and police spokespeople were not immediately available for comment.
Soldiers and police were out in force patrolling Kampala on Saturday. 
Museveni, 76 and in power for 35 years, campaigned for another term arguing his long experience in office makes him a good leader and promising to keep delivering stability and progress. 
Wine, 38, galvanised young Ugandans with his calls for political change and pledged to end what he calls dictatorship and widespread corruption.
Wine, a singer-turned-lawmaker whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said on Friday he had video proof of voting fraud, and would share the videos as soon as internet connections were restored. The government ordered the internet shut down the day before the election, and the blackout was still in place. 
Electoral Commission Chairman Simon Byabakama said on Friday that under Ugandan law, the burden of proof rested with Wine.
Reuters has not independently verified Wine's claims.
The United States and the European Union did not deploy observer teams, but the U.S. State Department’s top diplomat for Africa, Tibor Nagy, said in a tweet early on Saturday that the ""electoral process has been fundamentally flawed"".
He cited fraud reports, denial of accreditation to observers, violence and harassment of opposition members, and the arrest of civil society activists.
The African Union and East African Community sent observer teams to the election, but neither group of officials responded to requests for comment about possible irregularities.
Police recorded 42 election-related offences nationwide during voting and tallying so far, police spokesman Fred Enanga said on Friday night on local NBS TV. Offences included assaults, voter bribery, and theft and damage of electoral materials, he said.
The run-up to Thursday's election was more violent than in previous polls. Security forces cracked down on opposition candidates and their supporters during the campaign, and more than 50 people died in protests in November on one of the multiple occasions when Wine was arrested. 
PARLIAMENTARY WINS
In addition to the internet blackout, the government on Tuesday banned all social media and messaging apps. Wine and his supporters often used Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to relay live coverage of his campaign.
In the parliamentary election, where candidates were vying for 529 seats, results were still coming in but Ugandan media reported that at least 19 candidate from Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) had won their races, while the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), previously the largest opposition party, has so far won 17 seats

The FDC won 35 seats in the 2016 election, but the NUP had no seats in the previous parliament - Wine was elected as an independent and joined the party last year.

The drill, which comes in the waning days of high tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, was conducted in the country's central desert region.
It followed Friday's testing of surface-to-surface ballistic missiles and locally manufactured new drones in the same area. 
""One of our most important defence policy goals is to use long-range ballistic missiles against enemy warships, including aircraft carriers and warships,"" state media quoted Guards commander Major General Hossein Salami as saying.

Saturday's drill targets were in the Gulf of Oman and the northern Indian Ocean.
Chief of Staff General Mohammad Baqeri said while Iran had ""no offensive intentions"", it would now be able to ""respond to any hostile and malicious act in the shortest time"".
On Wednesday, Iran tested short-range naval missile in the Gulf and there were exercises earlier this month that featured a wide array of domestically produced drones.
Iran has one of the biggest missile programmes in the Middle East, regarding them as a deterrent and retaliatory force against the United States and other adversaries in the event of war.
There have been periodic confrontations between Iran's military and U.S. forces in the Gulf since 2018, when Trump abandoned Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and reinstated harsh sanctions against Tehran.

The Central African army has been battling groups backed by former president Francois Bozize that are seeking to overturn a Dec. 27 vote in which President Faustin-Archange Touadera was declared victor despite fraud claims.
Russia and Rwanda have sent troops to back the government. A separate U.N. peacekeeping mission also operates in the country, but France, which until 2016 had some 2,000 troops in the country, has remained largely in the background during the latest fighting.
France, the former colonial power, sent troops in December 2013 to try to end a cycle of tit-for-tat killing that began when mainly Muslim Seleka fighters toppled Bozize, prompting reprisals by Christian anti-Balaka militias.
""We are not in the same situation as 2013.

""Mr Bozize's adventure has no future,"" he told reporters.
Paris still has about 300 soldiers working in CAR as part of a European military training mission and last week carried out fighter jet flyovers to warn rebels advancing on the capital.

1663,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2021 05:20AM ET</span>",U.S. carries out 13th and final execution under Trump administration,"By Jonathan Allen and Bhargav Acharya
TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (Reuters) - The U.S. government carried out the 13th and final federal execution under President Donald Trump's administration early on Saturday, days before his successor Joe Biden takes office with a promise to try to end the death penalty.
Dustin Higgs, 48, was pronounced dead at 1:23 a.m. EST (0623 GMT), the federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement, after a late-night Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for the execution to proceed.
Since resuming federal executions last year after a 17-year hiatus, Trump, a long-time proponent of capital punishment, has overseen more executions than any U.S. president since the 19th century, including three this week.
Higgs was convicted and sentenced to death in 2001 for his role in the kidnapping and murder of three women on a federal wildlife reserve in Maryland in 1996: Tanji Jackson, Tamika Black and Mishann Chinn.
His accomplice, Willis Haynes, who confessed to shooting the women, was sentenced to life in prison in a separate trial. 
In his final words, Higgs sounded calm and defiant at the Justice Department's death chamber in its prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, a reporter who served as a media witness said. 
""I'd like to say I am an innocent man,"" he said before lethal injections were administered, mentioning the three women by name. ""I did not order the murders."" 
Some of his victims' relatives attended, and a sister of Jackson released a statement, although the Bureau of Prisons did not share the sister's name.
""When the day is over, your death will not bring my sister and the other victims back,"" the statement said. ""This is not closure, this is the consequence of your actions.""
Higgs' older sister, Alexa Cave, could be heard sobbing uncontrollably from a separate witness room as Higgs died.
""THIS IS NOT JUSTICE""
""The government completed its unprecedented slaughter of 13 human beings tonight by killing Dustin Higgs, a Black man who never killed anyone, on Martin Luther King's birthday,"" Shawn Nolan, one of Higgs' lawyers, said in a statement. 
""Dustin spent decades on death row in solitary confinement helping others around him, while working tirelessly to fight his unjust convictions.""
The majority conservative Supreme Court's ruling was consistent with earlier decisions: it had dismissed all orders by lower courts delaying federal executions since they were resumed last year.
""This is not justice,"" one of its members, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, wrote in dissent. 
""After waiting almost two decades to resume federal executions, the Government should have proceeded with some measure of restraint to ensure it did so lawfully. When it did not, this Court should have. It has not.""
The federal government executed 10 people last year, more than three times as many as in the previous six decades, marking the first time that it had conducted more executions than all U.S. states combined, according to a database compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center. 
A minority of the country's 50 states still carry out executions. 
Before Trump became president, only three people had been executed by the federal government since 1963.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) called the execution of Higgs the end of a ""cruel, inhumane and lawless"" spree by the federal government. 
""President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to end the federal death penalty. He must honor that commitment,"" Cassandra Stubbs, director of ACLU's Capital Punishment Project said.
After a failed triple date with the three women, Higgs and Haynes offered to drive them home but instead took them to the Patuxent Research Refuge. Prosecutors said Higgs gave Haynes a gun and told him to shoot the three women.
The disparity in their sentences was grounds for clemency, Higgs's lawyers had said.
Higgs and another death row inmate, Corey Johnson, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in December, but on Wednesday the Supreme Court rejected an order by a federal judge in Washington delaying their executions for several weeks to allow their lungs to heal. 
The Justice Department executed Johnson on Thursday night.
Cave, Higgs' sister, said she believed life in prison would have been a more just punishment.

""They don't have freedom at all in any sense of the word,"" she said in an interview on Friday, before Higgs was executed. ""What purpose does it serve to kill you? It brings nothing back.""

""Safeguarding national security through legislation is in line with international practice,"" the government of the financial hub said in a statement late on Friday. 
The annual report from the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China this week said that the ""one country, two systems"" framework in Hong Kong has been ""dismantled"", severely undermining the rule of law and respect for human rights that the city has long enjoyed.
The report says a national security law that Beijing imposed over the summer on the former British colony directly threatens Hong Kong residents' right to due process and their freedoms of expression and association. ""The legislation is clearly meant to target, intimidate, and silence Hong Kong's robust civil society,"" it says.
Hong Kong countered that contrary to the erroneous allegations that the law undermines the ""one country, two systems"" framework, China ""has the right to legislate for this matter"" under the framework.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An aftershock hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Saturday as rescue workers searched for people trapped under rubble after an earthquake killed at least 45 people, injured hundreds and sent thousands fleeing in terror.
Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said no damage or casualties were reported from the Magnitude 5.0 aftershock in the West Sulawesi districts of Mamuju and Majene a day after the Magnitude 6.2 earthquake.
Agency head Doni Monardo told Kompas TV the search continued for victims who could still be trapped under rubble.
More than 820 people were injured and about 15,000 people have been evacuated, the agency said. Some have sought refuge in the mountains, while others went to cramped evacuation centres, witnesses said.
Friday's quake and its aftershocks damaged more than 300 homes and two hotels, as well as flattening a hospital and the office of a regional governor, where authorities told Reuters several people had been trapped.
Access to the neighbouring city of Makassar remains cut off, Arianto Ardi of the search and rescue agency in Mamuju told Reuters, adding that the search will focus on the hotels.
Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency, told Metro TV on Saturday that another quake was possible and could reach a magnitude of 7.0, urging residents to keep out of the water because of the tsunami risk.
The earthquake magnitude scale is logarithmic; a one-point increase means it is 10 times bigger. The difference in energy released is even greater. Straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, Indonesia is regularly hit by earthquakes.
In 2018, a devastating 6.2-magnitude quake and subsequent tsunami struck the city of Palu, in Sulawesi, killing thousands.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Small skirmishes broke out between Honduran security forces and migrants trying to cross the border into Guatemala on Friday night, with Guatemalan officials estimating around 6,500 people to be heading north to the United States.
Groups of Hondurans continued to trickle past the border, even as the Guatemalan military detained hundreds of migrants, including many families with young children.
The spokeswoman for Guatemala's immigration authority, Alejandra Mena, estimated that there were some 6,500 Hondurans making their way north, with 3,000 to 3,500 of them already in Guatemalan territory. A Honduran police officer told local television that ""more or less 5,000 people"" had walked past a checkpoint along a highway as they formed a caravan.
Honduras' Security Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
A video seen by Reuters showed hundreds of Hondurans, chanting and holding up the Honduran flag, crossing the border at El Florido into Guatemalan territory.
The first migrant caravan of the year comes less than a week before U.S. President-elect Joe Biden takes office.
While Biden has promised a more humane approach to migration, in contrast to outgoing President Donald Trump's hardline policies, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico are coordinating security and public health measures to contain unauthorized crossings across the region.
That will likely provide some relief for Biden, whose aides have privately expressed concerns about the prospect of growing numbers of migrants seeking to enter the United States in the early days of his administration.

1667,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 11:40PM ET</span>",U.S. to carry out 13th and final execution under Trump administration,"By Jonathan Allen
TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (Reuters) - The U.S. government was set to carry out the 13th and final federal execution under President Donald Trump's administration on Friday evening, just five days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office with a promise to try to end the death penalty.
Five hours after Dustin Higgs, 48, was set to be executed, the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority cleared the way for lethal injections to proceed by overturning a stay ordered by a federal appeals court.
Higgs was convicted and sentenced to death in 2001 for overseeing the kidnapping and murder of three women on a federal wildlife reserve in Maryland in 1996: Tanji Jackson, Tamika Black and Mishann Chinn. 
The U.S. Department of Justice plans to execute him with lethal injections of pentobarbital, a powerful barbiturate, at its death chamber in its prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.
The Supreme Court's ruling on Friday was consistent with its earlier decisions: it had also dismissed any orders by lower courts delaying federal executions since they were resumed last year.
Last year the federal government executed 10 people last year, more than three times as many people as in the previous six decades, marking the first time that it had conducted more executions than all U.S. states combined, according to a database compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center. A minority of the country's 50 states still carry out executions. 
Higgs is set to be the 13th person executed by the U.S. government in an extraordinary spree begun last summer by Trump, a Republican and avowed advocate of capital punishment, after a 17-year hiatus at the federal level. Prior to Trump, the federal government had executed only three people since 1963.
After a failed triple date with the three women, Higgs and his accomplice, Willis Haynes, offered to drive them home but instead took them to the Patuxent Research Refuge. Prosecutors said Higgs gave Haynes a gun and told him to shoot the three women. Haynes, who confessed to being the shooter, was sentenced to life in prison, while Higgs was sentenced to death in a separate trial, a disparity that his lawyers say is grounds for clemency.
The Supreme Court agreed to the Justice Department's request to overturn an order by a lower court delaying the execution while a legal question is resolved: federal law requires that an execution be carried out in the manner of the state in which the condemned was sentenced, but Maryland has since abolished the death penalty. 
The Justice Department had unsuccessfully sought a new sentencing order from a federal judge in Maryland to allow them to execute Higgs following the procedures used in Indiana, a state that still allows lethal injections and that is home to the department's execution chamber.
The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scheduled a hearing on the matter for Jan. 27, nearly two weeks after Higgs' scheduled execution, which the Justice Department said left it hamstrung unless the Supreme Court overturned the delay.
Higgs and another death row inmate, Corey Johnson, were diagnosed with COVID-19 in December, but on Wednesday the Supreme Court rejected an order by a federal judge in Washington delaying their executions for several weeks to allow their lungs to heal. The Justice Department executed Johnson on Thursday night. 
After the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued on behalf of other inmates at the prison complex, a federal judge in Indiana ruled that the executions of Johnson and Higgs could only proceed if the U.S. Bureau of Prisons enforced several measures to stem the spread of COVID-19. 
One measure ordered by Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson was that prison and execution officials observe ""mask requirements,"" but media witnesses and Johnson's spiritual adviser, Rev. Bill Breeden, who was at Johnson's side, said at least one of two U.S. officials in the room did not have a mask on for many minutes.
The ACLU unsuccessfully asked the judge the find the Bureau of Prisons in contempt of court and order Higgs' execution be halted. Asked why it should not be found in contempt, the Bureau of Prisons responded on Thursday evening by saying ""mask requirements"" was not clearly defined, and that it was necessary for officials to remove or not wear their mask for ""clear communication."" 
Alexa Cave, Higgs' sister, traveled to Terre Haute with her adult son to be a witness if the execution proceeds, and said she was praying for something to delay it. Life in prison would be a more just punishment, she said, adding that she speaks with him by telephone multiple times a week.

""They don't have freedom at all in any sense of the word,"" she said in an interview. ""What purpose does it serve to kill you? It brings nothing back.""

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 09:21PM ET</span>","U.S. closing landmarks, announces vehicle checks in Washington for inauguration","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The nation's capital on Friday continued to boost security by shutting down access to iconic landmarks and erecting vehicle checkpoints at a security perimeter surrounding central Washington ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's Jan. 20. inauguration.
Presidential inaugurations are always tightly secure events with operations led by the U.S. Secret Service, but this year's measures have been amped up after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 in a bid to prevent the final certification of Biden's victory. Law enforcement officials have warned of threats and armed groups in all 50 states.
The National Park Service said Friday it was immediately closing the National Mall and iconic U.S. landmarks in Washington to visitors through at least Jan. 21.
The Mall includes landmarks like the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument. The area around the White House has also been closed, as has a key bridge over the Potomac River that connects Virginia to Washington, as well as East and West Potomac Parks, including Hains Point, which are near the Mall.
""We cannot allow a recurrence of the chaos and illegal activity that the United States and the world witnessed last week,"" Matthew Miller, the head of the Secret Service's Washington field office, told reporters.
Virginia later announced it would close several other bridges connecting the state with the federal district from Jan. 19 to Jan. 21, as part of its agreement with the U.S. Secret Service. 
Maryland, the other state bordering the nation's capital, declared a state of emergency related to the inauguration.
Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, told CNN that Biden's team had decided to delay the inauguration rehearsal by one day due to ""some of the online chatter talks about Sunday the 17th.""
Still, Biden's chief of staff Ron Klain said in an interview with the Washington Post he was confident that law enforcement officials would be able to secure the inauguration.
U.S. officials said they expect the number of National Guard troops to rise to 25,000 in Washington D.C., a number that could still increase even further.
In downtown D.C., Metropolitan AME Church, a historic Black church that has hosted historical Black luminaries like educator Booker T. Washington and journalist Ida B. Wells, said it has security plans in place but declined to provide details. 
""We recognize that some people may be emboldened to focus on communities which have always prioritized justice, so we are cautious of that,"" a church official said. 
In the Capitol Hill area, streets that are usually busy and traffic-clogged were largely empty on Friday. Residents were warned that cars within the exclusion zone would have to stay there until after the inauguration.
Even before the Jan. 6 siege, the inauguration was expected to be significantly different than previous swearing-in of presidents due to coronavirus concerns. Many of the events that accompany the ceremony will be virtual.
""This is not a concession to the terrorists. It is a recognition of the danger of COVID,"" U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters on Friday.
Washington's Mayor Muriel Bowser suggested to reporters on Friday that, due to the storming of the Capitol by groups of ""white extremists,"" heightened security measures in the district could remain in effect until well after Inauguration Day.

""We are going to go back to a new normal,"" Bowser said. ""We certainly have to think about a new posture in the city. So while we are focused on January the 20th, we are also focused on January the 21st and every day thereafter in the nation's capital.""

Modi will address healthcare workers through video conferencing but will not immediately take the vaccine himself as India is initially prioritising nurses, doctors and others on the front line.
On the first day, around 100 people will be voluntarily vaccinated in each of the 3,006 centres in the country, the government said this week, calling it the start of the biggest such campaign in the world.
""This will be the world’s largest vaccination programme covering the entire length and breadth of the country,"" Modi's office said in a statement this week.
India, the world's most populous country after China, has said it may not need to vaccinate all of its 1.35 billion people to create herd immunity. Still, covering even half its population will make it one of the largest immunisation programmes in the world, even if countries like the United States were to vaccinate every resident.
Beneficiaries, however, will not be able to choose between the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine and a government-backed, homegrown one from Bharat Biotech whose efficacy is not known. Both are being produced locally.
India, which has reported the highest number of coronavirus infections after the United States, wants to vaccinate around 300 million people with two doses in the first six to eight months of the year.
Some 10.5 million people in India have been infected with the coronavirus, more than 151,000 of whom have died, though the rate of cases has come down since a mid-September peak.
First to get the vaccine will be 30 million health and other frontline workers, such as those in sanitation and security, followed by about 270 million people older than 50 or deemed high-risk because of pre-existing medical conditions.
Modi, 70, has said politicians will not be considered frontline workers.
On Saturday, he is also expected to formally inaugurate the government's online platform Co-WIN that will provide information on vaccine stocks, storage temperature and keep track of beneficiaries.
The government has already bought 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) COVISHIELD shot, produced by the Serum Institute of India, and 5.5 million of Bharat Biotech's COVAXIN.

COVISHIELD is 72% effective, according to the Indian drug regulator, while Bharat Biotech says COVAXIN's last-stage trial results are expected by March.

The boys, aged between 14 and 16, were killed on Feb. 8, 2019, when a nightime blaze swept through the Flamengo training centre on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Three others were seriously injured.
The boys were either training with the club or undergoing trials and were staying in ship containers that had been turned into accommodation when the fire started. It was believed to have been caused by a short-circuit in an air conditioning unit.
The prosecutors’ report charged the 11, some of whom worked for the club and others who provided, installed and maintained the accommodation, with negligence leading to death and describes a series of “irregularities and illegalities.” 
It said Flamengo officials hid from regulatory authorities the real conditions in which the youngsters were housed, failed to follow the correct standards for the housing, did not properly maintain the facilities, and provided no evacuation plans in case of fire.
Flamengo had been told to close the facility but ignored the orders, the report stated. It said the club’s president, Eduardo Carvalho Bandeira de Mello, “decided not to make a monitor available for each group of 10 youths resident there and did not furnish the space set aside for them to the minimum standards.”
In a statement, Flamengo said it was ready to cooperate with authorities but had no comment on Friday’s charges.
The club, Brazilian champions and Copa Libertadores winners last season, has faced criticism for drawn-out negotiations over how the boys' families will be compensated. 
In December, the club announced it had reached agreements with all but two of the 10 families.

Libya envoy, diplomats said, nearly a year after the last mediator stepped down. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had proposed that Kubis succeed Ghassan Salame, who quit the role in March last year due to stress. Salame's deputy Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) has been acting Libya envoy.
Kubis, a former Slovakian foreign minister, is currently the U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon. He has also served as the U.N. special envoy in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
The appointment of Kubis comes after the Security Council approved in December a plan by Guterres' to name Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov to the Libya role. But a week later Mladenov said he could not take up the position due to ""personal and family reasons.""
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. In October, the two major sides in the country's war - the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) and Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) - agreed a ceasefire. 
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Friday said President Donald Trump should not be forced to defend against a defamation lawsuit by the author E. Jean Carroll, who accused him of raping her a quarter-century ago, and that it should be substituted as the defendant.
In a filing with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan, the Department of Justice said Trump qualified as a typical ""employee of the government"" entitled to immunity under federal law from Carroll's claims, and was also shielded because he spoke about her in his capacity as president.
The law ""provides a broad grant of immunity"" to Trump, the Justice Department said, echoing arguments the president has made in other litigation.
Carroll, a former Elle magazine columnist, sued Trump in November 2019 after he denied having raped her in a Manhattan department store in mid-1990s. Trump said Carroll made up the story to sell a new book, and added: ""She's not my type.""
A lawyer for Carroll had no immediate comment, having yet to review the filing.
Trump is appealing U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan's Oct. 27 refusal to drop Trump from the case. A reversal would likely doom Carroll's defamation claim.
It is unclear whether the Justice Department will pursue the case on Trump's behalf after the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, the Democrat who defeated Republican Trump in the November election.
Trump also faces other legal threats after leaving office, including criminal and civil probes in New York into his business dealings.
Carroll has said she would wait until after the appeal to depose Trump, and to collect a DNA sample to compare against a dress she said she wore when Trump allegedly assaulted her.

Trump has denied claims of several women who accused him of sexual misconduct.

Hundreds of protesters burned wheels, blocked roads, and threw stones at the police, who followed the protesters and fired gas, witnesses added.
In the coastal city of Sousse, night clashes took place between police and youths who threw stones at the security forces, who fired tear gas. 
Local media said small protest also took place in Karm area in the capital Tunis and that police arrested some protesters.
A decade ago, massive protests against corruption, injustice and the repressive regime toppled the late President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali,‮ ‬after a fruit seller set himself ablaze in the central town of Sidi Bouzid after an altercation with a policewoman. 
The Tunisian revolution in 2011 inspired a wave of revolt in Arab countries as people rose up to demand democracy. 
A video posted on social media showed a policeman scolding and pushing a shepherd whose sheep had entered the governerate headquarter. 
The video caused a wave of anger on social media. Activists said that it is unacceptable to harm the dignity of any citizen, a decade after Tunisians revolted against injustice and oppression.
The Public Prosecution office opened an investigation into the incident.
Despite the incident, Tunisia is an example of peaceful transition in a region struggling elsewhere with violence and upheaval, its economic and social situation worsened and the country became on the verge of bankruptcy and the protests increased.

At stake is the leadership of Europe's biggest economy in the era after Merkel, who has vowed not to run again after becoming Europe's predominant leader since taking office in 2005 and proving a winner with German voters.
The new CDU leader will be elected by 1,001 delegates at a digital congress. By tradition, the leader is usually - though not always - the chancellor candidate for the CDU's ""Union"" with its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU).
Centrist Armin Laschet, arch-conservative Friedrich Merz and foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen are vying for the CDU leadership.
However, polls show Markus Soeder, the CSU leader, is voters' choice conservative. Some CDU lawmakers want dynamic Health Minister Jens Spahn to run for chancellor, though he has backed Laschet for the party leadership.
The three declared CDU candidates all contrast with Merkel.
Roettgen, 55, the eloquent chairman of parliament's foreign affairs committee, wants Germany to take a firmer stance with Russia and China. Merz, 65, has targeted European Central Bank policy and is less diplomatic. Laschet, 59, who has polished his international profile, complains Berlin has taken ""too long to react"" to French calls for European Union reform.
Roettgen has suggested that, if elected CDU leader, he could support Soeder, Bavaria's premier, to run as chancellor candidate for their alliance.
Soeder, 54, has shifted from the right towards the moderate centre of late. He plays coy about his ambitions - ""My place is in Bavaria"" has been his repeated refrain.
Carsten Nickel at Teneo, a political risk consultancy, said Soeder's deft move towards the centre ground could make him the ideal candidate to lead a coalition with the ecologist Greens.

""But of course, the true challenges will arise when liberal and conservative demands clash,"" Nickel added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations is concerned that a U.S. plan to blacklist Yemen's Houthi movement on Tuesday will hinder its efforts to assess a decaying oil tanker that is threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil off the war-torn country's coast.
The tanker Safer has been stranded off Yemen's Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for more than five years, and U.N. officials have warned it could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez disaster off Alaska. 
Houthi authorities gave long-awaited approval in November for a visit to assess the tanker. A U.N. team, which includes a private company contracted by the world body to do the work, aims to travel to the tanker early next month. 
""We are continuing to prepare for the Safer tanker assessment and are broadly on track with this work,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Friday. 
""However we have to look at potential impact of the (U.S. designation) on the Safer mission – there are questions about potential legal jeopardy for the people who are going to do the mission, which of course we all want to avoid,"" he said. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the move against the Iran-aligned Houthis on Sunday. It will come into effect next Tuesday, the last full day in office of Republican President Donald Trump's administration.
Democratic President-elect Joe Biden takes office next Wednesday. The designation could be revoked by Biden's administration. 
The Houthis control the area where the tanker is moored and the national oil firm that owns it. 
The designation freezes any U.S.-related assets of the Houthis, bans Americans from doing business with them and makes it a crime to provide support or resources to the movement. U.N. officials are worried the designation will scare private-sector companies away from any business related to Yemen. 
When asked about the U.N. concerns about the tanker mission, a State Department spokesperson said: ""We have expressed our readiness to work with relevant officials at the United Nations, with international and nongovernmental organizations, and other international donors to address sanction implications.""
Washington has said it will issue licenses and exemptions to allow the United Nations and aid groups to continue working in Yemen, which the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the people in need.
But top U.N. officials have said little is known about possible exemptions and warned that the U.S. move would push Yemen, which relies almost solely on imports, into a large-scale famine and chill peace efforts.
A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting the Houthis. U.N. officials are trying to revive peace talks to end the war as the country's suffering is also worsened by an economic crisis, currency collapse and the COVID-19 pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shortly after rampaging Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, a fan of the president posted a message on the pro-Donald Trump website TheDonald.win. Inspired by the mob's attempt to stop lawmakers from confirming President-elect Joe Biden's electoral win, user CONN_WYNN said in an all-caps message, replete with an expletive, that it was ""TIME TO LEAVE THE KEYBOARD"" and ""FIGHT FOR MY...COUNTRY."" 
Two days later, agents from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation’s San Francisco field office came calling, according to another post by CONN_WYNN on the same website. 
“PRO TIP: Think before you post. They are watching. I learned the hard way,” wrote the user on Sunday alongside a photograph of a business card from the agents.
A spokesman for the FBI's San Francisco office said he could not provide any details about the reported interaction or confirm whether agents actually paid a visit to the person who posted that message. But ""if he has our business card and said he was visited, I’m pretty sure we visited him,"" the spokesman said.
Before the Capitol attack, such a post may not have elicited a follow-up visit. But in the aftermath of the riot, which left five people dead, federal law enforcement agencies have intensified their scrutiny of extremist chatter online, activity that officials warn could be early warning signals of planned attacks around Biden's inauguration in Washington on Jan. 20.
“You don't want to be the ones to have FBI agents knocking on your door at 6 a.m.,"" Director Christopher Wray said on Thursday during a televised briefing with Vice President Mike Pence. ""Anybody who plots or attempts violence in the coming week should count on a visit.""
For months, far-right extremists have been openly posting their threats on public sites. Now, wary of surveillance and amid a crackdown by social media, some are shifting their online communications to private chats or lesser known platforms that could make those threats harder to find.
Several social media websites that are popular havens for far-right views have closed, crashed or cracked down on violent rhetoric over the past week. For example, Apple (AAPL.O) and Amazon (AMZN.O) suspended the social media site Parler from their respective App Store and web hosting service, saying it had not taken adequate measures to prevent the spread of posts inciting violence.
That has pushed some users to more private platforms such as Telegram, the Dubai-based messaging app, and lesser-known social media sites like MeWe.
U.S. downloads of Telegram from Apple's App Store and from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play rose to 1.2 million in the week after the Capitol assault, a 259% increase over the previous week, according to Sensor Tower, a data analytics firm. Roughly 829,000 U.S. users downloaded MeWe in the week after the attack, a 697% increase, the firm found. 
David Westreich, a MeWe spokesman, said the company has frequent membership spikes and that ""only a small fraction"" of the hundreds of thousands of public groups on the platform dealt with politics. Westreich said MeWe's terms of service were ""designed to keep out lawbreakers, haters, bullies, harassment (and) violence inciters.""
Telegram did not respond to a request for comment.
The FBI received nearly 100,000 “digital media tips” about potential unrest related to the election and Biden’s inauguration, an official told reporters on Tuesday, and has pleaded for more information from the American public.
Jared Maples, director of the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness, told Reuters his office was ""doubling down"" on its work to track possible domestic extremist threats and “making sure we’re aware of what the chatter is online.”
The FBI warned this week in bulletins and a call with law enforcement agencies nationwide of possible armed protests in Washington and at state capitols in the days leading up to Biden’s inauguration.
Extremists seeking a politically motivated civil war and those seeking a race war “may exploit the aftermath of the Capitol breach by conducting attacks to destabilize and force a climactic conflict in the United States,” officials wrote in a joint bulletin issued on Wednesday by the National Counterterrorism Center and the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security and seen by Reuters.
Wray said at the briefing on Thursday that his agency was tracking calls for potential armed protest in the lead-up to Wednesday's inauguration, adding that ""one of the real challenges in this space is trying to distinguish what's aspirational versus what's intentional."" 
MONITORING MORE DIFFICULT
The crackdown on public-facing extremist content is not necessarily all good news for law enforcement trying to combat threats, said Mike Sena, director of the Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, a “fusion center” staffed by federal, state and local public safety personnel who monitor threats and facilitate information sharing.
“When you shut down a platform that has public access, you drive people out of the light,” Sena said in an interview.
“Oftentimes that's our only way to find them because they’re having conversation and making statements that are open to see.”
The upside of driving extremists underground, Sena said, is that it is harder for them to radicalize others when they do not have access to more mainstream platforms.
Law enforcement is also in the difficult position of determining whether people saying ""despicable"" things online intend harm or are ""just practicing keyboard bravado,"" Steven D'Antuono, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office, told reporters on Tuesday.
In the United States, freedom of speech is strongly protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution.
In Queens, New York, on Tuesday, federal agents arrested Eduard Florea at his home on a weapons charge after he posted violent threats to Parler on Jan. 5-6, prior to its suspension by its web host Amazon. 
Florea posted that he had “a bunch of guys all armed and ready to deploy” to Washington, D.C., and threatened the life of Democratic U.S. Senator-elect Raphael Warnock of Georgia, who is Black, according to a complaint filed in federal court. In court, his lawyer called the posts ""blather on the internet."" 
MIGRATION TO NEW PLATFORMS
Days after the Capitol attack, Facebook (FB.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) purged some accounts that violated their policies around violence and hate speech, and other companies followed suit.
Chris Hill, leader of the III% Security Force, a Georgia-based militia group, said his organization’s website had been taken offline on Jan. 8 by its hosting service GoDaddy (GDDY.N) for violating its terms of service. A GoDaddy spokesman said the site had been removed due to content that ""both promoted and encouraged violence,"" a claim Hill called ""laughable.""
The moves sent users scrambling to other platforms.
On Telegram, Enrique Tarrio, leader of the right-wing Proud Boys, welcomed new users “to the darkest part of the web” with posts that made light of the Capitol siege and linked to other Proud Boys channels on the service.
Gab.com, a social media platform popular with right-wing users, said in a Twitter post on Thursday that it had drawn 2.3 million new users in the past week. 
Amid the online reshuffling, conflicting messages have surfaced in far-right chat rooms and forums about possible protest actions around the inauguration.
Digital flyers have circulated in those spaces for weeks advertising armed marches in Washington and state capitals around the inauguration, posts that prompted recent warnings from federal law enforcement about potential violence.
But some far-right groups on public platforms have cautioned supporters to avoid such demonstrations, saying, without evidence, that they are traps set by law enforcement to crack down on gun rights.
Devin Burghart, executive director of the Institute for Research and Education on Human Rights, which monitors extremists, said that nearly all of the planned protests his group had been tracking around the inauguration had been canceled or gone underground.
“That said, we're still receiving lots of anecdotal reports of individuals who were involved in the January 6 insurrection returning to DC on January 20,” he said in an email.
MISSED SIGNS
A Jan. 5 memo from an FBI office in Virginia underscores the difficulties facing law enforcement agencies now in trying to determine which threats around the inauguration are real and which are bluster.
The memo described possible violence by Trump supporters at the Capitol last week. It was downplayed by many law enforcement agencies, partly because the FBI labeled the material unconfirmed “open source reporting,” according to a law enforcement source familiar with the memo.
Extremism experts had also noticed violent rhetoric lighting up online forums including Facebook, Gab and Parler in the days before the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.
""It was frightening how open folks were being about the violence they wanted to commit,"" said Melissa Ryan, CEO of Card Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation.
Posters on TheDonald.win, for example, had fantasized about murdering members of Congress and even shared tips on how to tie nooses, Ryan said.
Such posts became unusually frequent in the lead-up to Wednesday, according to Ryan. ""We had definitely seen threats on these threads before, but it was just the overall volume - you were seeing it take over the conversation,"" she said. 
With many users now having migrated to harder-to-monitor communication channels like Telegram since last week, those kinds of threats are more difficult to spot now.
Frank Figliuzzi, a former assistant FBI director for counterintelligence, said law enforcement officials will be more active in letting some right-wing online users fomenting violence know they are being watched.

""You bet they're going to be knocking on more doors, letting people know, ‘We're here',"" he said.

In a private Oval Office ceremony, Princess Lalla Joumala Alaoui, who is Morocco's ambassador to the United States, gave Trump the Order of Muhammad, an award given only to heads of state. It was a gift from Morocco's King Mohammed VI.
White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz received other awards for their work on the Israel-Morocco deal, which was reached in December.
The United States in the last five months helped broker deals between Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco. The agreements are aimed at normalizing relations and opening economic ties.
Trump, who leaves office on Wednesday, has drawn some criticism over the Morocco agreement because to seal the deal, he agreed that the United States would recognize Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara.
Western Sahara has been the site of a decades-old territorial dispute between Morocco and the Algeria-backed Polisario Front, a breakaway movement that seeks to establish an independent state in the territory.
The Kushner team had been working on reaching more agreements between Israel and the Arab world. But time has run out and no more are expected before Trump's departure.
Media were not allowed to witness the award ceremony. Trump has been limiting his public appearances since losing the election on Nov. 3.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States announced sanctions on Friday against six Hong Kong or Chinese officials it blamed for implementing a new security law in Hong Kong, following the mass arrests of pro-democracy activists this month.
Hong Kong police arrested 53 people on Jan. 5 in the biggest crackdown on the democracy movement since China last year imposed a security law which opponents say is aimed at quashing dissent in the former British colony.
""This action by Hong Kong authorities is yet another stark example of Hong Kong's freedoms and democratic processes being fundamentally undermined,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
Pompeo said 13 former Legislative Council members, an American lawyer and a former law professor were among those reportedly detained before being released on bail. He called for the freeing of all those held under the security law.
Pompeo said those targeted with sanctions included You Quan, vice chairman of Beijing's Central Leading Group on Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, and Sun Qingye, deputy director of Hong Kong's national security office.
Three officers of the National Security Division of the Hong Kong police were named - Frederic Choi Chin-Pang, Kelvin Kong Hok Lai, and Andrew Kan Kai Yan.
Tam Yiu-Chung, a Hong Kong delegate to China's National People’s Congress Standing Committee, was also designated. Pompeo said all were associated with ""developing, adopting, or implementing the National Security Law.""
The sanctions require the freezing of U.S.-linked assets of those targeted. China's Washington embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Pompeo warned last week of fresh sanctions in response to the arrests. That warning came a day after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed Congress in a bid to overturn his November election defeat, prompting China's state media to accuse U.S. politicians of ""double standards.""
Pompeo also said last week that Washington would explore restrictions against the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in the United States, but Friday's announcement made no mention of this.
Friday's action comes less than a week before Trump leaves office to be succeeded by Democrat Joe Biden. It was the latest in a series of steps targeting China, which analysts see as a bid driven by Pompeo to lock in a tough approach to Beijing.
Trump has pursued hard-line policies toward China on issues ranging from trade to espionage and the coronavirus. Relations plummeted to their worst level in decades when he ramped up rhetoric in his unsuccessful re-election campaign.
Trump's administration has already imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over the crackdown in Hong Kong and last July declared an end to the territory's privileged economic status under U.S. law.
It took another swipe at China on Thursday, imposing sanctions on officials and big Chinese companies for alleged misdeeds in the South China Sea and imposing an investment ban on nine more firms.

Last Saturday, Pompeo said he was lifting restrictions on contacts between U.S. officials and counterparts in Taiwan. The move greatly angered Beijing, which considers the island a renegade province.

BRUSSELS/VILNIUS (Reuters) - Some EU nations are receiving fewer than expected doses of coronavirus vaccines as U.S. pharmaceutical firm  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) slows shipments, while Turkey and China race ahead with inoculations to stem surging worldwide infections. 
Six EU countries described the delay as unacceptable and said it impacted the credibility of the whole vaccination process.
Spooked by a fast-spreading variant first detected in Britain, governments in Europe have imposed tighter and longer lockdowns and curbs. They are pinning hopes on vaccines being rolled out across the continent.
But even when inoculations start en masse, pressure on health systems is not expected to lift for months, or until most people within a population get the shot.
The vaccine developed by Pfizer with German partner BioNTech started being delivered in the EU at the end of December. U.S. biotech firm  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) began delivering its shot this week.
Yet about one third of the 27 EU governments cited ""insufficient"" doses at a video conference of health ministers on Wednesday, a person who attended the virtual meeting told Reuters.
In a letter sent on Friday, six EU governments asked the European Commission to pressure Pfizer-BioNTech ""to ensure stability and transparency of timely (vaccine) deliveries"".
""This situation is unacceptable,"" said the letter, seen by Reuters, signed by the health ministers of Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
""Not only does it impact the planned vaccination schedules, it also decreases the credibility of the vaccination process.""
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had spoken to Pfizer and been reassured that scheduled deliveries will be made in the first quarter of 2021.
Pfizer said there would be a temporary impact on shipments in late January to early February caused by changes to manufacturing processes to boost production.
""Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,"" Pfizer said in a statement.
TURKEY PUSHES AHEAD
The German health ministry said Pfizer has informed the European Union that it would temporarily reduce deliveries due to construction work at its plant in the Belgian town of Puurs.
Belgium said it expected to receive only around half of the planned doses of the Pfizer vaccine in January. Lithuania said it was told this week its supplies would be halved until mid-February.
Pfizer and BioNTech have two contracts with the EU for the supply of up to 600 million doses this year. They have agreed to deliver 75 million doses in the second quarter and more later in the year.
Moderna has committed to delivering 10 million doses by the end of March and 35 million each in the second and third quarter. Another 80 million doses are also to be delivered this year but without a clear timetable yet.
Turkey, not an EU member, said it had vaccinated more than 600,000 people in the first two days of administering shots developed by China's Sinovac Biotech, among the fastest rollouts in the world.
""We are an experienced country in implementing nationwide inoculation programmes ... We will win the battle with the pandemic together,"" Health Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted.
Turkey vaccinated more people on the first day of its programme on Thursday than France had in nearly its first three weeks. 
Rising infections are turning up the heat on China to strengthen its own pace of vaccination at home, even as it has been exporting millions of doses of vaccines to countries including Turkey, Indonesia and Brazil.
In the first nine days of January, about 4.5 million doses were given nationwide in China, triple the number given from July to November, Reuters calculations based on official data show. By Jan. 13, more than 10 million doses were given.
Two Chinese firms, Sinovac and Sinopharm, have developed vaccines. Sinopharm shipped more than 10 million doses domestically by Jan 4, while Sinovac delivered more than 7 million doses by Jan 10.
U.S. President-elect Joe Biden will on Friday outline his plan to ramp up vaccinations after an early rollout by the Trump administration which he called ""a dismal failure"".

Biden has promised to get 100 million vaccine shots into the arms of Americans during his first 100 days in office.

International air travel, which resumed in September, will not be affected by the decision to close the mentioned borders, agency director Juan Francisco Espinosa said in a video message. 
""We know this is a sacrifice for everyone but right now we need to keep taking care of ourselves,"" Espinosa said. 
The Andean country, which closed its borders in March last year, was due to open its borders on Saturday. It is the top destination for Venezuelan migrants fleeing the long-running social and economic crisis at home.
More than 1.7 million Venezuelans are currently in Colombia, according to figures from the agency. 
Humanitarian corridors on the border will remain open, and border crossings of goods will continue, Espinosa said. 
On Wednesday Colombia took the decision to extend a so-called selective quarantine until the end of February, in line with its health state of emergency.
The country has reported over 1.8 million coronavirus infections, as well as more than 47,000 deaths.

With 49.1% of votes from Thursday's ballot counted, Museveni had won 3.9 million, or 62.7%, while main opposition candidate Wine had 1.4 million votes (29.3%), the electoral commission said just after 5 p.m. (1400 GMT). 
The next batch of results was due to be released at 9 p.m. when a nationwide curfew in place since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic kicks in.
The election campaign was marred by deadly crackdowns by security forces on opposition candidates and their supporters.
The normally bustling capital Kampala was quiet on Friday with many shops closed for a public holiday following Thursday's poll. Soldiers patrolled on foot in the rain in a suburb visited by Reuters in the morning.
There was a heavy security presence around Wine's sprawling compound on Friday. The singer-turned-lawmaker said he was under siege and his life was in danger. 
""We have simply boosted our deployment in the neighbourhood for his own security. We are not there to arrest him and he is not under arrest,"" Luke Owoyesigyire, deputy spokesman for Kampala's metropolitan police said.
The deputy spokesman for Uganda's armed forces, Deo Akiiki, said security officers intervened on Friday to arrest three intruders who had jumped over the fence into Wine's compound.
Wine has galvanized young Ugandans with calls for political change and he told a news conference on Friday that he had video proof of voting fraud. ""I am very confident that we defeated the dictator by far,"" he said.
""We are putting every legal, every constitutional and every non-violent option on the table,"" Wine told Reuters. ""I will be happy to share the videos of all the fraud and irregularities as soon as the internet is restored.""
BURDEN OF PROOF
Electoral Commission Chairman Simon Byabakama told a news conference that under Ugandan law, the burden of proof rested with Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi.
""The onus is upon candidate Kyagulanyi to show or to prove in what context and how the results are rigged,"" he said.
Wine's claims have not been independently verified by Reuters. The United States and European Union did not deploy teams of observers for this election, though the African Union and East African Community did.
Neither the AU or EAC observer teams responded to requests for comment about possible irregularities.
Museveni, who has led the East African country with a population of nearly 46 million for 34 years, was expected to hold a news conference at 8 p.m., according to NTV Uganda.
More than a dozen East African non-governmental organisations called for the release of 26 Ugandan election observers arrested on Thursday over allegations they were creating an illegal parallel tallying centre.
They said those arrested were civil society members carrying out the legitimate duty of collecting information at a time when the authorities had shut down many forms of communications.
On Wednesday, the government ordered an internet blackout until further notice, a day after banning all social media and messaging apps. 
Wine and his supporters used Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to relay live coverage of his campaigns and news conferences after he said many media outlets had declined to host him. 
The electoral commission's Byabakama assured Ugandans on Thursday that results were arriving at the national tallying centre, despite the internet blackout. 

""We are not using local internet to transmit our results, we are using our own system,"" he said, without giving details. ""Don't worry, results will come.""

Palestinians' last parliamentary ballot in 2006 resulted in a surprise win by Hamas, widening an internal political rift that led to the group's seizure of the Gaza Strip in 2007 and contributed to the long delay in setting further elections.
The PA, which has limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, will hold legislative elections on May 22 and a presidential vote on June 31, a decree from Abbas's office said.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 01:25PM ET</span>",Exclusive: India's friction with U.S. rises over planned purchase of Russian S-400 defence systems,"By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The United States has told India it is unlikely to get a waiver on its planned acquisition of Russian S-400 air defence systems, raising the risk of sanctions similar to those imposed on Turkey for buying that equipment, people aware of the matter said.
The Trump administration has been telling the Indians to drop the $5.5 billion deal for five missile systems and avoid a diplomatic crisis, saying New Delhi did not have a wide waiver from a 2017 U.S. law aimed at deterring countries from buying Russian military hardware.
That position is unlikely to change under the Biden administration that takes over next week and that has promised an even tougher U.S. approach towards Russia, the people aware of the discussions told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
India says it needs the long-range surface-to-air missiles to counter the threat from China. India and China have been locked in a face-off on the disputed Himalayan border since April, the most serious in decades.
New Delhi has also affirmed its right to choose its defence supplies, potentially setting up an early point of friction with the new U.S. administration.
""India and the U.S. have a comprehensive global strategic partnership. India has a special and privileged strategic partnership with Russia,"" foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said about the proposed S-400 purchase. 
""India has always pursued an independent foreign policy. This also applies to our defence acquisitions and supplies which are guided by our national security interests.""
The United States imposed sanctions on Turkey last month for its acquisition of the Russian air defence systems under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) 
A U.S. embassy spokesperson in Delhi said the United States was aware of reports of India's planned purchase of the S-400s, but noted there had been no deliveries yet.
""We urge all of our allies and partners to forgo transactions with Russia that risk triggering sanctions under the CAATSA. CAATSA does not have any blanket or country-specific waiver provision.""
""We have not made any waiver determinations with respect to Indian transactions with Russia,"" the spokesperson told Reuters.
There was no immediate comment from Russian officials. Moscow has previously said that the sanctions imposed on Turkey were illegitimate and showed arrogance toward international law. 
INITIAL PAYMENT IN 2019
India made an initial payment of $800 million in 2019 toward the Russian deal and the first set of missile batteries are expected towards the end of this year. 
Russia has traditionally been India's main weapons supplier but in recent decades the Indian government has turned to the United States and Israel for new planes and drones.
U.S. officials believe there is still time for Delhi to reconsider, and that the punitive measures would only kick in if the deal with the Russians was ""consummated.""
Washington has told New Delhi that if India acquires the S-400 it would affect how its systems interact with U.S. military equipment that India now has and would jeopardise future arms transfers such as high-end fighter planes and armed drones, according to the people aware of the matter.
""There is a narrow chance India can avoid sanctions, presuming the S-400 purchase is completed. At the moment, it's a good bet that sanctions will be applied against India,” Richard Rossow, a specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said. 
But the outcome could depend on how India-U.S. defence cooperation progresses, he said, adding that India had been working with Washington on security in Asia more than ever before and this could be a mitigating factor.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Prime Minister Mark Rutte's government resigned on Friday, accepting responsibility for wrongful accusations of fraud by the tax authorities that drove thousands of families to financial ruin, often on the basis of ethnicity.
The cabinet would remain in place for now in a caretaker capacity to manage the coronavirus crisis, Rutte said. He then rode his bike to King Willem-Alexander's 17th century baroque Huis Ten Bosch palace in The Hague to discuss his resignation.
An election has already been scheduled for March 17 at the end of Rutte's third term.
""This is about tens of thousands of parents who were crushed under the wheels of the state,"" Rutte told journalists. ""There can be no doubt, this is a colossal stain.""
A parliamentary inquiry found last month that officials at the tax service had wrongly accused families of fraud over childcare subsidies, causing an ""unprecedented injustice"".
Around 10,000 families had been forced to repay tens of thousands of euros each, in some cases leading to unemployment, bankruptcies and divorces. Many of the families were targeted based on their ethnic origin or dual nationalities, the tax office said last year.
""It is never acceptable for someone to feel they are being discriminated against based on nationality, race, gender, or sexual (orientation),"" Rutte said. ""It is absolutely unacceptable in a law-based state.""
Orlando Kadir, an attorney representing around 600 families in a lawsuit against politicians, said people had been targeted ""as a result of ethnic profiling by bureaucrats who picked out their foreign-looking names"".
The crisis comes with the Netherlands in the midst of the toughest lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Rutte considering even more curbs as infections surge.
Even though public support for the government's COVID-19 measures has dipped sharply in recent weeks, Rutte's People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is still riding high in public opinion polls ahead of the March election.

Rutte, in power since 2010, has been on course for a fourth term, with his party projected to take just under 30% of the vote, more than twice that seen going to the second placed PVV, the anti-Islam party of Geert Wilders.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States slapped sanctions on Cuba's interior ministry on Friday, accusing it of serious human rights abuses as Washington kept up a barrage of sanctions even in the final days of President Donald Trump's administration.
In a statement, the U.S. Treasury Department mentioned Cuban dissident Jose Daniel Ferrer who it said was in a prison controlled by the ministry and was reported to have been beaten and tortured.
""The United States will continue to use all the tools at its disposal to address the dire human rights situation in Cuba and elsewhere around the world,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.
Washington also blacklisted Cuban Interior Minister Lazaro Alberto Álvarez Casas.
Reversing a diplomatic opening to Havana under his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump has tightened restrictions on U.S. travel and remittances to Cuba and imposed sanctions on shipments of Venezuelan oil to the Caribbean island.
Trump's policy was popular among the large Cuban-American population in South Florida, helping him win the state in the November election though he lost the national vote to Joe Biden, who was Obama's vice president.
Biden, who will take office on Jan. 20, said during the election campaign he would promptly reverse Trump policies on Cuba that “have inflicted harm on the Cuban people and done nothing to advance democracy and human rights”.
The Trump administration announced on Monday it was returning Cuba to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that could complicate any efforts by the incoming Biden administration to revive Obama-era detente with Havana.
Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez, in a Twitter post, condemned the designation as a state sponsor of terrorism as ""hypocritical and cynical...U.S. political opportunism is recognized by those who are honestly concerned about the scourge of terrorism and its victims.""

1688,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 12:56PM ET</span>",U.S. House Speaker Pelosi won't say when Trump impeachment trial will start,"By Susan Cornwell
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday sidestepped a question about when President Donald Trump would face his second impeachment trial, on a charge of inciting his supporters to attack the Capitol.
The House on Wednesday approved one article of impeachment, similar to an indictment, levying that charge against Trump. But Pelosi would not say when she would send the article to the Senate, the step that triggers a trial.
""You'll be the first to know,"" Pelosi told reporters.
Congressional Democrats have been grappling with how to balance the impeachment of Trump -- which will continue after his term ends and could lead to him being banned from running office again -- with other Senate priorities including confirming Cabinet nominees and other priorities of President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on Wednesday.
Pelosi told reporters that lawmakers are working on proposed new legislation to deliver economic relief to Americans hurt by the coronavirus pandemic following a $1.9 trillion package laid out by Biden.
""This is a matter of complete urgency,"" Pelosi said of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution that is part of Biden's proposal. ""Now we have to move on and do it in the right way, and that will require resources, which will require legislation."" 
The Democratic impeachment managers are ""solemnly and prayerfully preparing"" for a trial, Pelosi told reporters.
The Democratic-led House voted 232-197 on Wednesday to impeach Trump one week after his supporters rampaged in the Capitol following a speech in which the outgoing Republican president urged them to fight Democrat Biden's Nov. 3 election victory.
Trump falsely claims he lost because of widespread voting fraud. He will likely be the first president to face an impeachment trial after leaving office.
Ten Republicans joined Democrats in supporting impeachment, while others argued Trump's remarks were protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which defends free speech.
According to Senate rules, the trial would start the day after the charge is sent over by the House. The last time the House voted to impeach Trump, in December 2019, Pelosi did not transmit the charges to the Senate for weeks.
The earlier charges related to abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from Trump's request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter. The Senate in February 2020 voted to acquit Trump, keeping him in office.
The Senate is scheduled to return to Washington on Tuesday, the day before Biden's inauguration.
A presidential inauguration traditionally draws hundreds of thousands of visitors to Washington, but the ceremonies have been scaled back dramatically because of the COVID-19 pandemic, even before last week's riot.
Now Washington is wrapped in a security blanket with thousands of troops and law enforcement officers on duty ahead of the inauguration. Trump initially praised his supporters after the storming of the Capitol but later condemned the violence.

Meanwhile, Trump plans to leave Washington on Wednesday morning, a source familiar with the matter said. He will then go to his club in Palm Beach, Florida, the source said. Trump had already said he would not attend the inauguration.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 12:50PM ET</span>",Internal watchdog to probe how Justice Department prepared before Capitol riots,"By Sarah N. Lynch and Brad Heath
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department's internal watchdog will review how the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies prepared and responded to the storming of the U.S. Capitol by President Donald Trump's supporters, Inspector General Michael Horowitz said on Friday.
The inquiry will be coordinated with other federal agencies whose law enforcement arms were also involved in responding to the Jan. 6 assault, including the Defense Department, Department of Homeland Security and Department of the Interior.
The review comes after many media outlets, including Reuters, reported that the FBI office in Norfolk, Virginia, circulated a bulletin a day before the events at the Capitol warning that extremists were preparing to travel to Washington to commit violence and ""war.""
A law enforcement source who spoke anonymously to Reuters said the bulletin was widely circulated among law enforcement agencies planning for possible demonstrations on Jan. 6, but it was considered to be ""raw open source"" material, meaning it was not validated by the FBI or other government investigators. 
Steven D'Antuono, the FBI's Assistant Director in Charge of the Washington field office, previously told reporters the bureau was aware of the memo and did take steps to address intelligence gathered ahead of the Capitol riots.
At the same time, however, d'Antuono said the FBI could not take action based on mere social media chatter, due to First Amendment guarantees of free speech.
""We have to separate the aspirational from the intentional and determine which of the individuals saying despicable things on the Internet are just practicing keyboard bravado, or they actually have the intent to do harm.""
""IT'S YOUR HOUSE NOW""
Horowitz's announcement on Friday did not mention whether the Capitol Police inspector general's office will participate, and Capitol Police Inspector General Michael Bolton could not be immediately reached for comment.
The Capitol Police have come scrutiny for being ill-prepared to deal with the throngs of Trump supporters who stormed the building last week. 
In some videos posted on social media, police also appeared to be overly friendly with rioters, with one even taking a selfie with people as they illegally entered the building.
On Jan. 11, the acting Capitol Police chief announced that its Office of Professional Responsibility was investigating several officers who had been suspended and could face discipline or termination.
The Justice Department has already filed charges against more than 80 people in connection with the riots.
Some of the court filings have offered a window into questionable behavior or a lack of preparedness by law enforcement.
In one case, prosecutors wrote that one officer was left to single-handedly confront a group of 25 rioters on the Senate floor. The officer asked to borrow a bullhorn from one of them so he could ask the crowd to leave. 
In another sworn statement, suspects Robert Bauer and his cousin Edward Hemenway told the FBI they were greeted with a welcome and a hug when he stormed the Capitol.
""According to Bauer, the police officer grabbed his hand, shook it, and said, “It’s your house now,'"" the statement says, noting the officer may have acted out of fear. 
""Hemenway similarly recalled the officer shaking Hemenway's hand and Hemenway said, 'Sorry,' to which the officer replied, 'It’s your house now, man,' and gave Hemenway a half-hug.""

At a news conference, Pelosi was asked whether any actions would be taken against lawmakers who may have brought tours to the Capitol on Jan. 5, the day before the attack by pro-Trump rioters in which five people died, including a police officer, and dozens of people were injured.
""If in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crimes, there have to be actions taken beyond the Congress, in terms of prosecution for that,"" Pelosi, a Democrat, said.
Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill has accused Republicans of inciting the Trump supporters, saying she saw colleagues leading groups on “reconnaissance” tours of the Capitol the day before the attack.
More than 30 House Democrats have asked the acting House and Senate sergeants-at-arms and the acting head of the Capitol Police for information about who was in the building on Jan. 5.
Pelosi also named retired Lieutenant General Russel Honoré to lead a security review of the Jan. 6 violence at the Capitol.

KYIV (Reuters) - President Alexander Lukashenko's main electoral challenger criticised the Belarusian authorities on Friday over an audio recording in which she said a top security official discussed putting people into camps to discourage unrest. 
Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the recording, which was circulating on social media and provoked an angry reaction online. The interior ministry said it was fake but declined further comment. 
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in an election last August, said the voice in the recording was that of a senior interior ministry official. 
She did not explain how she had identified the voice in the tape, but portrayed the recording as evidence of brutality by the security forces against protesters who say the election was rigged, an allegation Lukashenko denies. 
In the tape, the man says a protester who died during mass demonstrations against Lukashenko was killed by rubber bullets, contradicting the government, which said at the time that the protester was killed in an accident when an explosive device went off in his hand.
The man suggests security forces could ""either maim, or mutilate, or kill"" to make protesters understand their actions. He discusses building camps surrounded by barbed wire for the protesters and to ""keep them there until everything calms down"". 
Tsikhanouskaya wrote on Twitter that the man in the tape ""said he plans to build a camp for people, realizing their constitutional right to protest peacefully against lawlessness.""
""Can you imagine this in your country?"" she wrote.
She and another opposition figure, Pavel Latushko, said the recording would be handed to international organisations including the United Nations Security Council.

Interior ministry spokeswoman Olga Chemodanova told Interfax news agency that ""we did not comment and will not comment on fakes"". She could not be reached for further comment.

They are among the first to be identified since the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) began exhuming scores of bodies from numerous sites in and around Tarhouna. 
Last week Human Rights Watch said hundreds of Tarhouna residents were abducted or reported missing after the local Kaniyat militia took control there in 2015. 
The Kaniyat, headed by members of the al-Kani family, was allied to the LNA and helped it mount a failed 14-month assault on Tripoli that began in April 2019. 
The GNA has issued arrest warrants for leaders of the Kaniyat who are believed to be in LNA-held eastern territory. 
""My son was abducted from his workplace ... and taken to a rest house. He was killed the same night,"" said Mohammed Ramadan al-Tuhami, taking possession of the body of his son Ali from the authorities in Tripoli. 
The Tuhami and al-Saadi families took the bodies of their relatives back to Tarhouna for burial at a funeral attended by a large crowd of mourners later on Friday.
Men crouched by the grave side and embraced as the two bodies, wrapped in white shrouds, lay ready for burial. 
On Sunday more families will try to identify their relatives using belongings found by the authorities' forensic science department. 
Mahmoud Saadi was abducted by the militia in December 2019, said his brother Ali Saadi, who was also held by them. 
He said the militia commander questioned them both about people involved in political activism. ""I told him I didn't know them. Then he asked me to leave. He shot two bullets into my brother,"" he said. 
""This is a catastrophe, and it happened in Tarhouna,"" Saadi added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of U.S troops in Afghanistan has been reduced to 2,500, the lowest level of American forces there since 2001, the Pentagon said on Friday. 
In November, President Donald Trump's administration said it would sharply cut the number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan from 4,500 to 2,500 by mid-January, stopping short of a threatened full withdrawal from America's longest war after fierce opposition from allies at home and abroad.
""Moving forward, while the Department continues with planning capable of further reducing U.S. troop levels to zero by May of 2021, any such future drawdowns remain conditions-based,"" acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller said in a statement on reaching 2,500 troops. 
On Monday, Reuters reported the U.S. military had not halted an American troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, despite a new law prohibiting further reductions without the Pentagon sending Congress an assessment of the risks.
A Pentagon spokesman, Army Major Rob Lodewick, on Friday said Trump had signed a waiver allowing for the troop reduction, though it appears to have happened when the move was already complete.
""Convention dictates that reducing troop levels, associated equipment and adjusting associated force protection requirements across a country-wide combat zone is not something that can be paused overnight without increasing risk to the force and core mission goals,"" Lodewick said. 
U.S. forces invaded the country after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by the Islamist al Qaeda group based in Afghanistan. At its peak in 2011, the United States had more than 100,000 troops there.
President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office next Wednesday, has given few clues on what his plans are for Afghanistan. However, one option could be to leave a small counterterrorism force in the country, where its former Taliban rulers, al Qaeda and the Islamic State militant group still have a presence.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 11:40AM ET</span>",Canada's Trudeau embraces Biden in bid to turn page on Trump era,"By Steve Scherer
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's swift embrace of U.S. president-elect Joe Biden illustrates the degree to which Canada, one of America's closest allies, is looking forward to turning the page on the Donald Trump era.
Trudeau was the first world leader to congratulate Biden when he was declared the winner of the November election, and now hopes to be the first - or one of the first - to meet with the new president after he takes office on Wednesday.
""It's very much a tradition that the Canadian prime minister and the U.S. president meet very quickly to be able to talk about all the tremendous things that we can do together,"" Trudeau said in a Reuters interview on Thursday.
Mired in a long-running diplomatic dispute with China and weighing a possible snap election this year, Trudeau has much riding on his relationship with Biden. 
Canada shares a land border only with the United States, which is by far its top export market, and it has often been the first foreign trip for a new U.S. president.
That was not the case for Trump, a Republican who traveled only once to Canada for a G7 meeting in 2018, and then blasted Trudeau for being ""very dishonest and weak"" after he left. 
That contrasts with the Liberal Trudeau's close relationship with former Democratic President Barack Obama. In December 2016, after Trump's election, Biden, Obama's vice-president, passed the progressive torch to Trudeau on a visit to Ottawa.
""The world's going to spend a lot of time looking to you, Mr. Prime Minister, as we see more and more challenges to the liberal international order than any time since the end of World War Two,"" Biden said.
Canada's relationship with the United States ""went from the very best it probably ever was to near the worst it ever was,"" said Bruce Heyman, Obama's last ambassador to Canada.
While Trudeau sought not to provoke Trump, especially during difficult talks on a new North American trade treaty, Canada ended up in the crossfire of the U.S.-China trade war.
After the 2018 Vancouver detention of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. arrest warrant, Beijing detained two Canadian men and charged them with espionage. Meng remains under house arrest and the Canadians in Chinese prisons.
Now Trudeau and other allies are counting on Biden to re-engage on the world stage, in part to contain a ""more assertive and sometimes problematic China"", Trudeau said in Thursday's interview.
""We are seeing how volatile the U.S. situation is, and all of us want to push the reset button so we can focus on the three Cs - climate, China and COVID,"" a senior diplomatic source from a Western country said.
""It is hugely important for both sides (Canada and the United States) to start a new chapter in the wake of the Trump era."" 
Domestic politics is also in play in Trudeau's eagerness to renew U.S. ties with a potential election in 2021.
Trudeau will want ""to create a sense among Canadians (that) you've got to keep Trudeau because these guys click, and this is the opportunity to really be engaged with the Americans and kick this to the next level,"" said Chris Sands, head of the Canada Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

""Trudeau hopes that will outshine anything his opposition can do"" with the new president, Sands said.

THESSALONIKI, Greece (Reuters) - Greek taxi driver Konstantinos Bekio is doing his bit to lift his passengers' spirits amid the gloom of coronavirus lockdown, turning his cab into a nightclub complete with strobe lights and music.
""I saw that people were always stressed, sad, everyone was in a bad mood,"" he said as he drove through the nighttime streets of Thessaloniki in northern Greece where he began the service during the first coronavirus lockdown in March.
""I started to put on music - to turn up the volume, and I saw people enjoyed it, they were having fun, they were having a good time, even if it was a short route, they would get out happy. That is how we started the private club taxi.""
Although Greece has not suffered as badly as many other European countries from COVID-19, its nightlife culture has taken a hit. Bars, restaurants and nightclubs have been shut since November and no-one is sure when they will reopen.
While a taxi ride in a disco may not be everyone's idea of a good night out, Bekios, whose 11-year-old son helped with the decoration, just wants people to have a good time. He takes requests from a vast playlist built up over eight years driving his cab but charges no extra for the experience.
""It improves your mood in the first five minutes,"" said 24-year-old Ioanna Kargiannidou, a regular customer.

""The situation is very difficult and stressful for everyone, our mood is low,"" she said. ""So this is a good solution to escape our daily routine.""

Schools will remain open this time around, but some parents were nervous about the decision, which Prime Minister Antonio Costa said was based on studies showing that schools were not a major point of contagion.
""There's nothing we can do about it. I live far away and I have to work ... if the government says we have to do it, then we have to do it,"" said Pedro Salgueiro as he dropped his child off at school in Lisbon. 
Portugal reported a record 159 COVID-19 deaths on Friday and cases reached their second-highest level since the start of the pandemic at 10,663.
The country has reported a total of 528,469 cases and 8,543 deaths since the start of the pandemic and the Health Ministry is monitoring more than 140,000 active cases - more than 1% of its 10 million population.
All non-essential businesses must remain closed with remote working compulsory where possible. Fines for breaking the rules will double. 
Restrictions on movement will be eased on Jan. 24 so voters can go to the polls for the presidential election.

Under Portuguese law, regulations must be reviewed every 15 days but Costa said on Wednesday these rules would likely last a month.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 10:55AM ET</span>",Spanish king's ex-lover tells court spymaster threatened her,"By Belén Carreño and Emma Pinedo
MADRID (Reuters) - A former friend and lover of Spain's ex-monarch Juan Carlos testified under oath on Friday that the head of the intelligence service had threatened her life as he tried to recover financial documents involving the royal family in 2012.
Danish national Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein told a Madrid court via a video link from London she had had a ""romantic relationship"" with Juan Carlos - who abdicated in 2014 and left Spain last August under a cloud of scandal - and received unspecified financial information and documents from him.
The businesswoman testified in a slander trial brought by the former head of the CNI intelligence service, Gen. Felix Sanz Roldan, against former police commissioner Jose Manuel Villarejo, who is at the centre of several high-profile economic and political spying scandals in Spain.
Villarejo, who is in prison pending trial in a separate case, stated on a TV show in 2017 that Sanz Roldan had threatened Corinna's life and her family's.
Sanz Roldan has dismissed the accusations as ""lies"".
Zu Sayn-Wittgenstein told the court: ""I confirm I talked to Villarejo about the threats...The general explained various conditions, instructions, recommendations, that unless I followed them he could not guarantee my physical safety or the safety of my children"".
""King Juan Carlos and Gen. Sanz Roldan always made a great effort to explain that the king was commanding the general to carry out these operations...It terrified me. Everyone would be terrified,"" she said. 
Through his lawyer, Juan Carlos has previously declined to comment on the various allegations of wrongdoing against him.. The lawyer was not available for comment on Friday. 
Sanz Roldan, who acknowledged he had a meeting with the businesswoman in London in 2015, denied the accusations but stated that the details of the conversation were secret.
""It's a lie, I have never threatened a woman and a child. Never,"" he said. 
The newspaper La Tribune de Geneve has reported that Juan Carlos received $100 million from the late Saudi King Abdullah, and sent 65 million euros to Corinna in 2012.
Juan Carlos helped guide Spain to democracy when he became king after the death of dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975 but his popularity later waned amid a series of scandals and he abdicated in favour of his son Felipe in 2014.
He left Spain for the United Arab Emirates last August to relieve the pressure on King Felipe as allegations of corruption emerged that are being investigated by the Spanish and Swiss authorities.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2021 10:45AM ET</span>",Factbox: U.S. president-elect Biden pledged to change immigration. Here's how,"By Mimi Dwyer
(Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has promised a quick and dramatic reversal of the restrictive immigration policies put in place by his predecessor President Donald Trump. While Biden pledged to undo many of Trump's policies starting the first day he takes office on Jan. 20, the layers of reforms will take much longer to implement.
IMMIGRATION REFORM AND 'DREAMERS'
Biden, a Democrat, said in a June tweet he will send a bill to Congress ""on day one"" that laid out ""a clear roadmap to citizenship"" for some 11 million people living in the United States unlawfully.
Biden has said he would create permanent protection for young migrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, known as ""Dreamers."" Started by former President Barack Obama when Biden was vice president, the program currently provides deportation protection and other benefits to approximately 645,000 people. 
Trump's Republican administration tried to end DACA but was stymied in federal court. The program still faces a legal challenge in a Texas court.
Vice president-elect Kamala Harris said in an interview with Univision on Jan. 12 that the administration planned to shorten citizenship wait times and allow DACA holders, as well as recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), to ""automatically get green cards,"" but did not explicitly say when or how these changes would happen.
Trump moved to phase out TPS, which grants deportation protection and allows work permits to people from countries hit by natural disasters or armed conflict. Earlier in his campaign, Biden promised to ""immediately"" grant TPS to Venezuelans already in the United States. 
For years lawmakers have failed to pass a major immigration bill. Democrats may stand a better chance of passing legislation after a run-off election in Georgia handed them control of both houses of Congress.
RESTORING ASYLUM AND REFUGEES
Trump blasted what he called ""loopholes"" in the asylum system and implemented overlapping polices to make it more difficult to seek refuge in the United States.
One Trump program called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) forced tens of thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court. Biden said during the campaign he would end the program on day one. His transition team, however, has said dismantling MPP and restoring other asylum protections will take time. 
Under rules put in place by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control during the coronavirus pandemic, most migrants arriving at the border are now immediately expelled. Biden's team has not pledged to reverse that policy right away.
Migrant caravans have been on the move in Central America, with some aiming to arrive at the southwest border after Biden's inauguration. Advocates worry that the pandemic will make it difficult for border officials and migrant shelters to handle large numbers of people.
Biden has also said he would raise the cap for refugees resettled in the United States from abroad to 125,000 from the historic low-level of 15,000 set by Trump this year.
FAMILY REUNIFICATION
Biden's transition team promised to immediately create a federal task force to reunify children separated from their parents under one of the Trump administration's most controversial policies. 
Thousands of children were separated from their parents when Trump implemented a ""zero tolerance"" policy of prosecuting all border crossers, including families, for illegal entry. Though Trump officially reversed the policy in June 2018 amid international outcry, some children have continued to be separated for other reasons. Advocates are still searching for the parents of more than 600 separated children.
TRAVEL AND VISA BANS
One of Trump's first actions after taking office in 2017 was banning travel from several Muslim-majority countries. Following legal challenges, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a revised version of the ban in 2018. It has since been expanded to 13 nations. 
Biden has promised to immediately rescind the bans, which were issued by executive actions and could be easily undone, according to policy experts. 
During the coronavirus pandemic Trump issued proclamations blocking the entry of many temporary foreign workers and applicants for green cards. While Biden has criticized the restrictions, he has not yet said whether he would immediately reverse them. 
BORDER WALL
Biden pledged to immediately halt construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall, which Trump touted as a major accomplishment during a Texas visit just days before leaving office.
It is not entirely clear what Biden's administration will do with contracts for wall construction that have already been awarded but have yet to be completed, or with private land seized by the government in places where building has stopped.
(This story corrects paragraph 17 to clarify the measures blocked green card applicants).
