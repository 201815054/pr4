NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed lower on Tuesday, as investors focused on a report questioning  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s recent coronavirus vaccine early-stage trial results, wiping out modest gains on the benchmark index in the last hour of trading. 
Major averages fell to session lows in the wake of a report from STAT News that questioned the validity of the results of Moderna's vaccine trial, which the company had announced Monday. Moderna shares plunged about 10% after the report. 
""The market is keen on health-care news much more than it is on economic data,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York. ""We are largely baking in the second quarter being down significantly – GDP growth rates, earnings, economic data – but what we don’t know, what will drive markets will be incrementally good news on the healthcare front.""
Stocks had initially edged higher as investors attempted to glean information from a mixed bag of results from major retailers.
Home improvement chain  Home Depot  (N:HD) fell after it missed quarterly profit estimates due to higher costs, while department store operator Kohl's Corp (N:KSS) tumbled after reporting a bigger-than-expected loss.
Walmart Inc (N:WMT), on the other hand, exceeded expectations for quarterly revenue and earnings as online sales soared as consumers stockpiled essentials in response to coronavirus lockdowns. Still, its shares finished down after rising as much as 3.4% earlier.
""Everyone wants to take every retailer's report of being indicative of something, but at the same time staying open and doing stuff is good, it costs to do that,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. 
 Advance Auto Parts  (N:AAP) climbed after the company said same-store sales improved significantly at the start of the second quarter, helping to lift the S&P retailing index. 
Trillions of dollars in fiscal and monetary stimulus have helped the S&P 500 rebound nearly 35% from its March 23 intraday low. While the benchmark index is now less than 13% below its Feb. 19 closing record, gains have largely slowed in May on uncertainty over truly halting the spread of the coronavirus and allowing business to resume and rising U.S.-China tensions.
The benchmark index surged more than 3% on Monday, boosted by Moderna's promising early-stage data for a COVID-19 vaccine and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's pledge over the weekend to support the economy as needed until the crisis has passed.
Powell, in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, said the central bank was continuing to consider ways to accommodate additional borrowers, and that Congress should consider anything to keep people out of insolvency.

Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 1.56% to end at 24,213.76 points, while the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 1.03%, to 2,923.48. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 0.52%, to 9,186.97. 2,923.48. The Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 0.52%, to 9,186.97.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian banks followed stock exchange operator B3 SA (SA:B3SA3) on Tuesday and announced they will keep normal hours this week despite plans by Sao Paulo city and state officials to declare an extended holiday to get workers to stay home and curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In a statement, banking lobby group Febraban said the banks needed to stay open to pay out emergency stipends to nearly 50 million people during the pandemic. Febraban also said banks are considered essential services and follow rules by federal regulators, Brazil's Monetary Council and Central Bank.
Earlier on Tuesday, Brazil's stock exchange operator B3 SA (SA:B3SA3) had announced it will also keep normal trading hours this week, and all of its operations.
On Monday, Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria and Mayor Bruno Covas said they were working to turn Wednesday, Thursday and Monday into holidays, with Friday a day off at the discretion of employers to increase social isolation.
The holidays moved are Roman Catholic feast of Corpus Christi, normally on June 11; a Black Awarenss holiday normally celebrated on Nov. 20, and Constitutional Revolution Day, normally celebrated July 9.
Febraban and other financial industry associations had sent earlier on Tuesday a letter to Doria expressing concern about advancing the holidays. Mayor Bruno Covas said in a TV interview that banks were allowed to work and should pay their employees as they would in a holiday.
Brazil's coronavirus outbreak has exploded in recent weeks, with more than 250,000 confirmed cases, third-highest in the world, and nearly 17,000 fatalities. The city and state of Sao Paulo are at the epicenter, with about a quarter of the country's deaths and diagnoses.

DirecTV was the country's most popular television service, providing a range of foreign channels as alternatives to the country's beleaguered local television industry that has been battered by a hyperinflationary economic crisis. 
U.S. sanctions meant to force President Nicolas Maduro from office prohibit companies from contracting with state agencies, but local Venezuelan laws require subscription services to carry channels run by the government.
""Because it is impossible for AT&T's DIRECTV unit to comply with the legal requirements of both countries, AT&T was forced to close its pay TV operations in Venezuela,"" the company said in a statement. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Some users reported seeing their screens go blank, while others said they continued to receive foreign channels but no local ones. It was not immediately evident how long it would take for the closure to take effect.
DirecTV has for years been a mainstay of poor neighborhoods in Venezuela, where the company's antennas were often visible on the zinc roofs of low-income cinder-block houses.

""I don't like these Venezuelan channels, it's all politics,"" said Aura Leon, a homemaker in Catia, a working class area of Caracas. ""I called my son ... and he told me what was happening, that DirecTV wasn't going to exist anymore, and I was in shock.""

Investing.com – Late-selling hit the Dow on Tuesday, as investor sentiment was soured by a report suggesting that  Moderna  's potential Covid-19 vaccine may not be as effective as many believe.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.59%, or 390 points, the S&P 500 fell 1.07%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.54%.
Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) came under pressure after a STAT News report cooled some of the optimism surrounding the company's potential Covid-19 vaccine. The company also announced a secondary stock offering that would raise more than $1 billion. 
""Several vaccine experts asked by STAT concluded that, based on the information made available by the Cambridge, Mass.-based company, there’s really no way to know how impressive — or not — the (Moderna) vaccine may be,""  STAT News reported.
Moderna had rallied about 20% a day earlier, after announcing positive early-stage clinical results for its potential Covid-19 vaccine.
The downbeat news offset supportive remarks from Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
Just days after suggesting the Fed had plenty of ammunition left to support the economy through the pandemic, Federal Reserve Chairman Powell reiterated the central bank's supportive stance on monetary policy.
""We are committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time even as we recognize that these actions are only a part of a broader public-sector response,” Powell said Tuesday in remarks to the Senate Banking Committee.
Powell also said he expected the Fed would roll out its Main Street lending and other programs by the end of the month.
Mnuchin, meanwhile, said he expected the economy to recover in the third or fourth quarter and floated the idea of middle-class tax cuts.
Financials fell as investors continue to shun bank stocks on expectations a lower-for-longer interest-rate environment will hurt net interest income.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) fell 1.8%, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) slipped 2.14% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) fell 2.7%.
Investors also had to contend with a turn lower in retail stocks following mixed quarterly results from corporates.
Walmart (NYSE:WMT) gave up gains to close 2.19% lower despite posting quarterly results that topped analysts;' estimates. The beat was driven a 74% surge in U.S. e-commerce sales in the first quarter, as coronavirus-led stockpiling of groceries and household goods bolstered growth.
 Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) fell 2.6% after the home-improvement retailer reported profits that missed analysts' forecasts.
Department store chain Kohls (NYSE:KSS) fell 7.68% after reporting a wider-than-expected loss and revenue that fell short of expectations in the first quarter.
In tech, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) climbed 1.76% as it launched a new shopping feature to make easier for companies to sell products on Facebook and Instagram.
Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) jumped 8.41% after inking a multi-year deal to acquire the exclusive rights to world-famous podcast 'The Joe Rogan Experience,' which reportedly racked in about 190 million downloads per month last year.
Energy stocks also contributed to selloff despite oil prices settling higher on growing optimism for a recovery in crude demand.
On the economic front, U.S. housing starts plunged to a record 30.2% in April, pressuring the annual pace down from 1.276 million, revised higher from 1.216 million, to 891 million, the weakest pace since Feb. 2015, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF)."

7,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>","As coronavirus crushes small restaurants, big chains see room to move in","By Hilary Russ
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prime storefronts left empty by failed businesses. Cheaper or even flexible rents. Landlords willing to add drive-thru lanes.
As the coronavirus permanently shutters some small businesses, big fast-food brands like Domino's Pizza, Chipotle and Wendy's that were doing well before the crisis want to grow - or continue pre-existing expansion plans - after the pandemic subsides. 
David Deno, chief executive officer of Outback Steakhouse parent company Bloomin' Brands (NASDAQ:BLMN), told Reuters in an interview that ""I don't mean to wish ill on anybody, but there's going to be real estate opportunities,"" for new stores or relocations to areas with ""better visibility, better access and better parking.""
 Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (N:CMG), Taco Bell owner  Yum! Brands Inc  (N:YUM), and Domino's Pizza Inc (N:DPZ) are among several household names planning post-pandemic growth, according to their CEOs. 
""Brands that are doing well in this environment should have an opportunity to expand their footprint,"" said David Gibbs, Yum chief executive officer, in an earnings call in late April. ""There's no reason to think that this brand… is not going to be a growth business long term. And unit development is a big part of that.""
In the month of April, retail properties collected less rent than other real estate sectors, according to a Citi note on Friday after a week of real estate investment trusts' earnings reports.
Malls collected only 28% of rents and shopping centers 60%, among other commercial property declines, Citi found.
""It's really a time of opportunity for these firms to entrench themselves into where they want to be,"" said Susan Wachter, professor of real estate finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""The retail landscape is going to be open for redeployment and for expansion of the firms whose market share is growing.""
""You are going to have a location reshuffle based on the tenants that offer what people will want post-COVID,"" said Scott Crowe of the real estate investment firm CenterSquare Investment Management, including the ability to spend less time inside and lower prices.
 Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) and McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) could also be among those that grow, said Neuberger Berman analyst Kevin McCarthy.
""We're in a period of a few years where independents lose and chains gain"" as much as 10% to 15% of market share, McCarthy said of the restaurant industry. The winners of that share grab will be those models centered around convenience and accessibility.
""It was a trend going 30 miles an hour, now accelerated to 100 miles an hour,"" McCarthy said. ""It's corporate Darwinism on steroids.""
There is precedent for fast-food expansion in the face of crisis. In 2010, Burger King was able to grow its brand in Western Europe at the tail end of the financial crisis.
""These were some of the best years we had… in Western Europe with many of our developing partners because there is tremendous opportunity,"" said Jose Cil, chief executive officer of Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR), parent company of Burger King and Popeyes, in a May 1 earnings call. 
""Our business works in almost any environment,"" Cil told Reuters, adding that it is positioned to capture market share in Europe, Asia, the United States and Canada. ""We're very excited and bullish long term.""
To be sure, the path to expansion could be choppy. Sales plunged in late March and April, leading many corporations to drop their financial forecasts and stop construction projects to save capital costs.
Even if they wanted to keep building, permitting has been temporarily halted in many places.
Occupancy restrictions will make reopening dining rooms tricky, and some restaurants may eventually change their floorplans to adapt to a new way of dining out.
Nonetheless,  Shake Shack Inc  (N:SHAK) CEO Randy Garutti said during a May 4 earnings call that ""as additional real estate and development opportunities become available, we'll be ready to capture the white space ahead."" 
Wendy's Co (O:WEN), Papa John's International Inc (O:PZZA) and  Yum China Holdings Inc  (N:YUMC) also discussed post-coronavirus expansion during recent Wall Street calls. 

""If there's opportunities that make sense for us on the real estate side, we will pursue those,"" said David Hoffmann, Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) chief executive officer in an April 30 earnings call. ""But you also want to balance being a good corporate citizen and sticking to your values, and not being a shark either.""

(Reuters) - Five McDonald's (N:MCD) workers in Chicago filed a class action lawsuit against the chain on Tuesday, accusing it of failing to adopt government safety guidance on COVID-19 and endangering employees and their families.
McDonald's failed to provide adequate hand sanitizer, gloves and masks and has not notified its staff when an employee has become infected with the new coronavirus, according to a copy of the lawsuit provided by a spokesman for the workers.
McDonald's said in a statement that the allegations were inaccurate and that safety, including wellness checks and protective gear, was a top priority.
The workers requested the Illinois state court issue an injunction, which would make McDonald's stop requiring workers to reuse masks, mandate face coverings for customers and require the company to inform employees if a coworker becomes infected.
Separately, McDonald's workers at three California locations on Tuesday filed administrative actions over allegedly unsafe conditions with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. 
Employees at restaurants, warehouses and other essential businesses that remained open during the COVID-19 outbreak have protested and walked off the job over fears of getting sick. 
Trade groups have warned of a wave of litigation over the pandemic, but few cases have been filed. 
Retailer Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and meat producers JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) and  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) were each sued over employee deaths from COVID-19.
Smithfield Foods Inc [SFII.UL] was sued by a workers group demanding safety measures in a lawsuit that, like the McDonald's case, alleged the company was a public nuisance. 

The Smithfield case was quickly dismissed because the judge said workplace conditions were a matter for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, part of the Department of Labor.

16,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 19, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Skittish Treasury Hobbles Small-Business Loan Plan,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- The Trump administration is hampering a Federal Reserve lending program that could help keep small and mid-sized businesses afloat during the coronavirus recession. To correct that mistake, the U.S. Treasury Department needs to allow the program to take more risks.
There are troubling signs that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin doesn’t see it this way. His testimony before a key Senate committee Tuesday morning reinforced this.
The Fed’s “Main Street” lending program is intended to help businesses that were productive before the pandemic survive until the economy recovers. Business with up to 15,000 employees or 2019 annual revenues of less than $5 billion would get a loan from a bank, which would sell part of the loan — 85% to 95% — to the Fed. This would free the banks to make more loans.
The challenge for Treasury is to determine how much risk to take in these loans. This is Treasury’s decision, not the Fed’s, because the law requires it to provide the capital to cover losses and approve the terms of the program.
It’s admittedly a tough call. The Fed can’t make grants, and so it has to have a reasonable expectation that loans could be repaid. But lending always involves the risk of default. If the Main Street program is too conservative, money won’t go to the firms that need it the most, undermining the recovery.
There are troubling signs that Mnuchin is being more cautious than Congress intended and than the economy needs. He recently declared, “If Congress wanted me to lose all the money, that money would have been designed as subsidies and grants as opposed to credit support.”
This is misguided. Of course Congress did not intend for all the money to be lost. But there’s a lot of distance between that and putting some of the money at risk. Congress clearly expected the economy to benefit if Treasury tolerated some losses in exchange for getting money into the hands of the kinds of crippled businesses that need it the most.
When asked about this by Senator Mark R. Warner, a Virginia Democrat, at a Banking Committee hearing on Tuesday, Mnuchin reinforced the concern. He did say that he anticipated that the Main Street program would incur some losses, a shift in the right direction. But he didn’t give any specifics about how the program would change.
The Main Street program has $75 billion in capital from the Treasury, designed to support $600 billion of Fed lending. This allows for a default rate of around 13%. That loss rate implies that the program’s portfolio will be heavy on companies whose solvency is not in question. But economic recovery is the goal and solvency is the problem. If Treasury and the Fed are serious about addressing the problem, then losses are inevitable.
Indeed, under the terms of the program put in place by the Fed and Treasury, it’s not clear which businesses would qualify for help that couldn’t already access a standard commercial loan. By requiring banks to hold 5% to 15% of loans, the program encourages banks to use normal credit standards. Furthermore, the Main Street program requires borrowers to show that they have highly rated debt, with an internal risk rating equivalent to “pass.”
By requiring banks to use normal commercial lending standards, Treasury may discourage borrowers and lenders from participating in the Main Street program at all.
A new Congressional Oversight Commission created by the March relief legislation known as the Cares Act released its first report on Monday. It found that barely any money appropriated to the Treasury has been lent out under any of the Fed’s pandemic response programs.
Mnuchin may be wary of taking on risk in the Main Street program to avoid the public perception of corporate bailouts. If so, he is overlearning lessons from the 2008 financial crisis, when voters rebelled against bank bailouts under the Troubled Asset Relief Program even though the government recouped nearly all the money it disbursed. Loans to businesses today are going to be much riskier because of the shutdown.
He may also be underlearning a different lesson. After the 2008 crisis, the Fed faced political blowback from the perception that it rescued the financial system but didn’t do enough for Main Street. If today’s Main Street program doesn’t work — if few loans get made, or if funds from the program don’t reach the businesses that need it the most — the political ramifications could be more severe because the lockdowns put in place to slow the spread of Covid-19 have created a true Main Street recession.
To reach mom and pop shops, and not just much larger mid-size businesses, other changes will have to be made. For example, the program has a minimum loan size of $500,000. Many small businesses in need of funds are not in a position to take out a loan that large. And the four years allowed for loan repayments under the program is not enough time for many low-margin businesses.
Congress appropriated $454 billion in the Cares Act to support Fed lending programs. According to Mnuchin’s testimony, only $195 billion has been committed to a program, with the rest being held in reserve. And only $75 billion of this appropriation, 17%, has been allocated to the Main Street program. Additional capital would allow the program to extend riskier loans. Treasury has the money and the authority to make this change immediately.
Economic recovery requires taking risks.

“We hired BlackRock for their expertise in these markets,” Powell said to Senator Martha McSally, a Republican from Arizona. “It was done very quickly due to the urgency and need for their expertise. We’re not trying to reach out for other public policy objectives.” BlackRock has been hired by the Fed to manage potentially billions of dollars of assets purchased under emergency lending facilities launched to keep credit flowing during the pandemic.
Powell said the Fed plans to rebid the contract in the future. The firm stands to bring in as much as $40 million a year in fees to purchase and oversee corporate debt as part of a U.S. program to juice capital markets and counter the economic calamity of the pandemic, according to an analysis of the firm’s contract for the deal.
China “unleashed this virus on America and the world with their classic communist cover-up” and BlackRock is “one of the leading investment banks in Chinese funds,” McSally said.
Powell didn’t comment on China, but said the topic was not pertinent to the Fed’s emergency lending program. “All large asset managers buy Chinese securities. These are global asset managers. I’m not here to defend or criticize them for that. It’s not really relevant to the work we want them to do.”

19,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 19, 2020 01:27PM ET</span>",The Gig Economy Is Reshaping Fuel Demand Amid Virus Lockdowns,"(Bloomberg) -- As American drivers hunkered down to avoid contagion in March and April, they became increasingly reliant on delivery services for everything from groceries to alcohol.
The resulting surge in the use of services such as Instacart Inc. is increasingly influencing gasoline consumption in ways that will have a lasting impact. Online grocery orders climbed to 62.5 million in April, a 33% increase over March, according to research firm Brick Meets Click. Orders almost tripled in March compared to August when the firm last collected the data.
The gig economy didn’t prevent gasoline demand from falling to the lowest in almost 30 years, but these services are likely part of the nascent recovery the market is seeing now. Many consumers may never return to buying their own groceries in a store, as experts say virus lockdowns will alter consumer behavior for years ahead.
“What you have is the shift of gasoline demand from one household to another,” David Bishop, an e-commerce expert at Brick Meets Click said on a Bloomberg Intelligence webinar.
It’s more difficult to determine if the uptick in deliveries will be a long-term positive or negative on fuel consumption. It could be unchanged, with every trip to the grocery store being replaced by one trip for a delivery driver, and demand staying flat. Or drivers could double or triple deliveries for every pickup at the store, trimming demand. A third scenario could see families using delivery services, freeing up more time to hit the road for other reasons, and therefore, increasing demand.
South Florida grocery driver Jorge Alexander Ortiz, 43, said he doubles, and sometimes triples, up on orders for one stop at the grocery store. He spends about $10 a day on fuel and seeks out places where he can save money at the pump.
“That’s why I’m spending a lot more on gas, because I have to travel back and forth to see where I’m going to find” orders, Ortiz said.
​Once factors beyond food shopping are considered, declines in demand are probably ahead, IHS Markit refined products analyst and former Valero analyst Debnil Chowdhury said.
“Longer term, we expect to see demand declines due to increased fuel efficiency and structural shifts in consumer behavior, due to the disease impacting vehicle miles traveled, such as increased working from home, less eating out, less in-person social events, and more grocery deliveries,” Chowdhury said.

24,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>","JPMorgan directors reelected, former Exxon executive overcomes opposition","NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) shareholders voted to reelect all of the bank's board members on Tuesday, including a former  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) CEO who drew criticism from environmental groups and New York City's comptroller and pension system leader.
Each director received support of at least 84% of investors' votes at the bank's annual meeting, conducted virtually due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. In April, JPMorgan said it will name a new independent director to replace former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond, 81, ""by end of summer 2020."" https://reut.rs/2SummMh
The vote showed investors were willing to go along with JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon's assertions that the bank can support green initiatives, while continuing financing deals with some fossil fuel companies. 
Raymond was targeted by critics who said his previous role leading a major oil company put him at odds with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, which Dimon said the bank supports.
While none of the shareholder proposals won a majority of shares voted, one proposal, which asked that the bank report on its progress toward sustainable climate goals, including the Paris agreement, got close with 49.6% of shares voted.

Traditionally shareholder measures that receive more than 30% of support usually push companies to make at least some changes to assuage investor concerns.

VIENNA (Reuters) - A group of European Union states opposed to big spending by the bloc will present a counter-proposal to Franco-German plans for a 500 billion euro ($547 billion) coronavirus recovery fund, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Tuesday.
French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday proposed the fund to offer grants not loans to the hardest hit EU regions and sectors.
But Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden, a group https://twitter.com/sebastiankurz/status/1262432177213575168?s=20 of EU member states known as the ""frugals"", oppose far-reaching ideas such as the mutualisation of member states' debt.
""We are sceptical,"" Kurz, a conservative, was quoted as saying in the Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten newspaper.
""Our position is clear: we want to show solidarity with states that were hit particularly hard by the crisis but we believe that loans are the right way, not grants.""
Kurz spoke to his Dutch, Danish and Swedish counterparts on Monday and said they share that position.
""In the coming days we will present a proposal with our own ideas. We believe it is possible to stimulate the European economy and yet avoid a mutualisation of debt,"" he said.
France and Germany, whose agreements usually pave the way for broader EU deals, proposed that the European Commission borrow the money on behalf of the whole EU and spend it as a top-up to the 2021-2027 EU budget that is already close to 1 trillion euros over that period. 
While Kurz said it was ""legitimate"" for France and Germany to make their proposal, he added it must ""be decided by all member states of the EU"".

28,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 11:16AM ET</span>",S&P recovery will be far faster than 2008: Citigroup,"(Reuters) - U.S. stock markets will deliver among the steepest recoveries in their history over the next year, returning to levels from before March's coronavirus lockdowns more than twice as fast as after the 2008 financial crisis, according to analysts from U.S. bank  Citigroup  (NYSE:C).
In a note to clients dated Monday, the bank forecast the S&P 500 (SPX) index and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) index would stand at 3,160 points and 28,400 points respectively in June 2021, up about 7% and 15.5% from current levels.
The forecast is among the most bullish among U.S. market forecasters, many of whom are forecasting next to no gains for the next 12 months.
Citigroup's forecast would see the two indexes recoup 81% and 90% of the losses they suffered from February's record peaks in 465 days, or a little over 15 months. The equivalent recovery after the 2008 crash took the S&P 500 1,107 days and the Dow 1,288 days.
The optimistic targets reflect expectations for improved economic performance next year and in 2022, analyst Tobias Levkovich said in the note.
""Embedded in the forecast is an expectation for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments that lift many of the hindrances to 'back to normal' practices that still are in place currently,"" he said. ""While some industries could face permanent long-term damage, the Great Pause will reverse itself as time progresses.""
After the 1987 stock market crash the indexes also took more than 18 months to make such recoveries, though both then and in 2008, the losses also took longer than this time around.
Citi does include a note of caution, calling out unemployment, the U.S. presidential election and possibly tighter lending standards as risks, and expects a pullback before year's end.
However, the forecasts are no comparison to the market performance after the Great Depression, when it took the Dow Jones 22 years to recover 90% of its pre-crash level.

The S&P 500 closed at 2,953.91 points on Monday and the Dow Jones at 24,597.37. (N)

ZURICH (Reuters) - UBS (S:UBSG) wants to double the amount of assets under management at its business targeting wealthy clients in Russia and central and eastern Europe, a senior manager told Reuters. 
The bank is particularly looking to high net worth clients with assets in the $5-$100 million range, including from the recent boom in technology entrepreneurs. 
""Russia has had a very strong start to the year, which contributed very substantially to EMEA overall both in terms of revenues and net new money,"" UBS' wealth management head for Central and Eastern Europe, Caroline Kuhnert, told Reuters in an interview.
""We want to grow our business very strongly. We believe we can double it over the next few years,"" she said, adding they were looking to double revenues as well as assets under management over the next four-five years.
Western banks limited their activity in Russia after sanctions were imposed on Moscow in 2014, freezing the funds of some wealthy Russians, with further measures imposed by the United States in 2018. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, has tried to encourage businesses to return funds to the country by offering a capital amnesty and tax breaks.
Now UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, wants to expand the banking services it offers to Russian multi-millionaires both through its onshore Moscow office, where it made ""significant hires"" last year, and offshore through teams in London, Monaco, Singapore and Switzerland.
""We want to be not only a very well recognised franchise, but we want to be the most profitable franchise (in eastern Europe),"" Kuhnert said.
A trained economist and former investment banker who worked in Moscow in the early 90's for the former International Moscow Bank, Kuhnert heads up a team of roughly 300 employees covering wealth management for Central and Eastern Europe, Greece and Israel. They manage assets estimated somewhere in the mid-to-high double-digit billion U.S. dollar range. 
UBS overall employs roughly 70 staff in Russia and said last week it was promoting Ekaterina Lehmann to head of global wealth management in the country, a broader role intended to help roll out services offered by a tie up between the wealth management business and the investment bank to a wider group of clients. [nL8N2CU3O0]
Kuhnert said UBS had in recent months attracted a greater share of its Russian clients' wallets as it stepped in with loans to help business owners during the coronavirus pandemic. 
""Clearly in some markets in my region, government support in light of COVID-19 is less pronounced and fast than in Switzerland, for example,"" Kuhnert said. 

""So the owners and entrepreneurs are putting money back into their businesses. And then they also look for loans from international firms like us,"" she added, also saying that clients were seeing opportunities to invest equity.

30,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Exxon revives sale of stake in giant Azeri oilfield,"By Ron Bousso
LONDON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) has relaunched the sale of its stake in Azerbaijan's largest oilfield, the company said on Tuesday, as banking and industry sources said the move was drawing interest from large Asian oil and gas companies seeking to capitalize on the recent collapse in oil prices.
The top U.S. oil and gas company first tried to sell its 6.8% stake in the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) field in the Caspian Sea (NYSE:SE) in 2018, as rival  Chevron  (N:CVX) launched the sale of its own 9.57% stake in the field.
While Exxon's sale process was never officially suspended, it was put on the backburner when Chevron started negotiations with Hungarian energy firm MOL (BU:MOLB) for the sale of its assets last year, which led to a $1.57 billion deal in November.
Exxon's process, run by Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), was recently relaunched despite oil prices halving to around $30 a barrel after a historic collapse in oil consumption due to coronavirus-linked lockdowns that restricted people's movement.
""Exxon Mobil is testing market interest for its non-operated producing assets in Azerbaijan,"" Exxon spokeswoman Julie King told Reuters.
Exxon routinely evaluates its producing portfolio and ""if other companies find more value in an asset, we will sell,"" she added. 
A number of Asian national oil companies, including China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC (NYSE:CEO)), India's ONGC and Indonesia's Pertamina, have shown interest in the stake recently, hoping to clinch a deal at a lower price than before, according to four industry and banking sources.
It was unclear how much Exxon was seeking to raise from the sale, but it is likely to be valued significantly lower than Chevron's stake, the sources said.
A spokesman for SOCAR, Azerbaijan's national oil company declined to comment. BAML declined to comment, and Pertamina did not respond to requests for comment. 
ONGC did not respond to a request for comment. An Indian industry source said, however, that ONGC, which holds a stake in ACG, had yet to decide whether to bid for Exxon's stake and was in talks with other partners in the field.
The sharp drop in oil prices pushed Exxon into its first quarterly loss in decades in the first three months of the year and the Irving, Texas-based company cut its spending by 30%.
Exxon last year launched a plan to divest up to $25 billion of oil and gas fields in Europe, Asia and Africa as it sharpened its focus on a handful of mega projects at home and abroad.
The effort so far has fallen short of returning asset sale proceeds to a prior average of $5 billion a year. Exxon has sold assets in Norway for $4.5 billion and has launched processes in Australia, Malaysia and Nigeria. 
The launch of a number of processes, including the sale of its British North Sea oil and gas portfolio have been put on hold following the collapse in oil prices, according to sources. 
For Exxon, the sale of its operations in Azerbaijan would mark the end of a 25-year involvement. 
Exxon and Chevron were among five U.S. oil companies that helped create Azerbaijan's current oil industry soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and acquiring a stake in ACG in 1994.
The deal was dubbed by Azerbaijan and partners as the “the contract of the century” thanks to the field's large reserves and hopes for future major discoveries that would help Europe diversify away from Russian oil and gas.

(Reuters) -  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD) missed estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the home improvement chain spent about $850 million on benefits for employees keeping its stores and warehouses running through the COVID-19 pandemic.
Shares of Home Depot, which have gained 12.4% this year, dropped nearly 3%, as the company also scrapped its full-year outlook, citing uncertainties stemming from the pandemic.
While shelter-in-place restrictions and government stimulus checks boosted Home Depot's sales in the first quarter, with people spending more on tools for do-it-yourself house projects, analysts say a looming recession will weigh on home improvement spending later in the year.
U.S. homebuilding dropped by the most on record in April and permits for future construction tumbled, underlining fears that the crisis would lead to the deepest economic contraction since the Great Depression.
""Home Depot is showing that it should weather the COVID-19 pandemic better than most retailers ... That said, we are concerned about the expected deterioration of the U.S. economy, rapidly rising unemployment, and declining consumer confidence,"" Telsey Advisory Group analysts wrote in a post-earnings note.
Total net sales rose 7.1% to $28.26 billion, beating the average estimate of $27.54 billion, despite the company cutting operating hours and limiting the number of customers allowed in stores to maintain social distancing.
The risks posed to staff working through the crisis led the company to provide additional bonuses, double overtime pay and add more hours of paid time-off.
The lockdowns also sent online traffic on Home Depot's website above Black Friday levels, the company said, adding that its e-commerce sales soared by triple-digits at the end of April.

The company's net earnings fell 10.7% to $2.25 billion, or $2.08 per share, in the first quarter ended May 3. Analysts had expected $2.27 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) said on Tuesday that is launching a new business unit within its corporate and investment bank dedicated to environmental sustainability to strengthen its commitment to an area that has grown increasingly important to corporate clients and investors.
The New York-based company said its Sustainability & Corporate Transitions group will be led by Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory (BCMA) Chief Strategy Officer Bridget Fawcett and Keith Tuffley, who has lead the unit's sustainability efforts so far.
""The current Covid crisis will elevate the importance of ESG to our clients, as they increasingly focus on more sustainable and resilient strategies and on recovery plans that help drive the just transition to a net-zero emissions future,"" global BCMA heads Tyler Dickson and Manolo Falcó said in a memo to bankers sent on Tuesday.
Companies have become more focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in recent years as activists and investors put pressure on them and companies that put these considerations at the forefront are rewarded.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said in a February report the ESG Leaders 50 index has for the past two years outperformed the corresponding benchmark index.
""The sustainability revolution is accelerating, and our corporate clients are facing new challenges, risks and opportunities,"" Dickson said in a statement.
""With this shift, we see an opportunity and need in BCMA to better deliver insights, trusted advice, innovative financing and holistic solutions to support their strategies in driving towards more sustainable and resilient business models.""
The company said the division will also establish a Global Sustainability Client Council to advise clients on sustainability transitions across coverage areas and a separate advisory group with external subject matter experts. 

The new group will also work with other business lines in the institutional clients group and the consumer bank.

33,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>","Europe risks being left behind China, U.S. by coronavirus: Siemens CEO","ZURICH (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic could damage European competitiveness by accelerating the economic dominance of the United States and China,  Siemens  (DE:SIEGn) Chief Executive Joe Kaeser warned.
The European Union needs a common economic policy if it is not to be squeezed out by the two giants, Kaeser, who is also chairman of the Asia-Pacific Committee of German Business (APA), told Reuters in an interview.
""It is likely that the U.S. and China will emerge stronger from the corona crisis,"" he said.
""The U.S. is home to the big technology and digitalization companies,"" he added, pointing to the country's huge domestic market and the increasing importance of digitalised industries.
China, the first country to be hit by COVID-19, now had a time advantage of several months over other countries in kick-starting its economy, he said.
""China's companies are already working on major projects, while we are still discussing how interrupted supply chains can be restored,"" Kaeser said.
Much of Chinese industry like the automotive sector is back to operating at the levels similar to the end of 2019, while domestic sales were being boosted by infrastructure spending and economic stimulus.
""We can already see that in the infrastructure sector, such as power plants and other major projects, China is filling the international voids,"" Kaeser said.
As a major exporter, Germany in particular could be affected by a decoupling of multilateral ties between the United States and China, Kaeser added. 
There is a danger of localisation of value creation if the United States and China insist on local production, which companies like Siemens would have to adapt to by splitting up their businesses, he said.
This would mean jobs and value creation being lost to Germany, he added.
""Decoupling was already a big issue before corona and will continue to accelerate."" Kaeser said.
Europe with its 500 million-strong population could still be a third major player alongside the two giants, Kaeser added, although it would need to be radically focused on innovation.
""So what is the answer to this threatened bilateral dominance by China and the U.S? Europe, Europe, Europe - the order is up to the governments themselves,"" Kaeser said.

HONG KONG/NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Luckin Coffee  Inc (O:LK) said on Tuesday that Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) has given it notice that it plans to delist it from the U.S. stock exchange a month after the Chinese coffee chain disclosed that some of its employees fabricated sales accounts.
The move underscores Nasdaq's renewed focus on the auditing standards of companies on its bourse. This week it tightened its listings rules with an eye to curbing initial public offerings (IPOs) of Chinese companies that are closely held by insiders and are not transparent about their accounting, Reuters reported on Monday.
Luckin said in early April that as much as 2.2 billion yuan ($310 million) in sales last year were fabricated by its chief operating officer Jian Liu and other staff, who had been suspended while the company carried out its investigation.
The falsified numbers equate to about 40% of Luckin's annual sales projected by analysts, according to Refinitiv IBES data.
In its delisting notice, Nasdaq cited public interest concerns raised by the fabricated transactions and Luckin's failure to publicly disclose material information, the company said, confirming an earlier Reuters report.
Luckin plans to challenge the move before a Nasdaq hearing panel, and will remain listed until this delivers an outcome, most likely in the next two months, the company added.
Founded in June 2017, Luckin, a rival to Starbucks (O:SBUX) in China, had one of the most successful U.S. IPOs by a Chinese company last year, attracting interest from prominent U.S. investors, including long-only funds and hedge funds.
Luckin disclosed on May 12 that it had fired its chief executive officer, Jenny Zhiya Qian, who had led the company since November 2017, and Liu, who became COO in May 2018.
Shares of the Xiamen-headquartered company slumped more than 80% on April 2, the day the probe was revealed. Trading was halted on April 7.

Luckin has said it has been cooperating with and responding to inquiries from regulatory agencies in both the United States and China.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened mixed on Tuesday, with tech stocks outperforming after a recent battering due to concerns about worsening relations between the U.S. and China, while the broader market was supported by stronger-than-expected earnings from retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 61 points, or 0.3%, at 24,536 points. The S&P 500 was essentially unchanged, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.6%.
The market was largely in wait-and-see mode ahead of testimony in the Senate from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The two men have differed publicly in recent day about the need for further fiscal stimulus, with Mnuchin eager to sit back and see how much effect the measures already taken will have, while Powell said the recovery may take ""longer than we would like"" in the absence of further support measures.
Among individual stocks,  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) stock fell 1.6% after missing forecasts for earnings per share by just under 10% in the three months through April. The company's bottom line suffered as lockdown restrictions forced it to spend more on staff, while also limiting the number of visitors to stores.  Home Depot, which depends to a large extent on the overall state of the housing market, wasn't helped by the announcement - albeit not a surprise - that housing starts fell by more than 25% last month to their lowest since 2014.
Walmart  (NYSE:WMT) stock rose 2.0%, however, after it posted better-than-expected earnings thanks to record high online sales that were to a large degree the result of consumer stockpiling of essentials.
Elsewhere, airlines showed signs of life after reporting that current business was picking up from the immediate aftermath of lockdown restrictions. Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock rose 1.7% after the company said new bookings have outpaced cancellations so far this month, while United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock rose 0.4% after saying it expects its July scheduled capacity to rise to 25% of last year's level, from an almost non-existent 10% in May.
And Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), which surged on Monday after announcing positive preliminary test data for its experimental Covid-19 vaccine, took advantage of that spike to raise just under $1.4 billion in fresh capital by selling 7.6 million shares at a price of $76 each. The placement was absorbed without any stress, with  Moderna  stock falling only 2.7% to $77.85.

(Reuters) - Walmart Inc (N:WMT) beat Wall Street expectations with its quarterly revenue and earnings on Tuesday and reported record U.S. online sales as stockpiling drove consumers to its stores and website during the coronavirus pandemic, sending its shares up 3%. 
The world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, like many other essential businesses, has seen a surge in demand late in March and early in April as ""shelter-in-place"" orders made consumers stock up on staples while limiting their trips to the grocers.
However, the company pulled its forecast for the full-year due to the uncertainty to its business caused by the pandemic.
Walmart's online business, which rose 74% in the first-quarter, benefited from the retailer's investments in store pick-up and delivery services. It said the strength of its own online operation made it decide to discontinue Jet.com, the online start-up it acquired in 2016 for $3.3 billion.
The business was undergoing an overhaul last year by integrating its retail, technology, marketing, analytics and product teams with Walmart's own online business.
The company added that grocery pickup and delivery for food and other consumables reached record sales volumes and also saw high demand for electronics, toys and sporting goods in the quarter.
Overall, sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 10%, excluding fuel, in the first quarter ended April 30. Analysts had expected a gain of 8.8%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Walmart has also been ramping up hiring, temporarily increasing wages and spending more on the maintenance of its stores and fulfillment centers as frustrations mount among U.S. warehouse, delivery and retail workers over concerns about their safety and pay.
Operating margins fell 62 basis points to 20.5% in the quarter as Walmart said it incurred additional costs related to pandemic of nearly $900 million.
Still, operating income rose 5.6% to $5.22 billion in the quarter ended April 30 with adjusted earnings per share at $1.18, beating Wall Street expectations of $1.12. (https:// ""The reduction in margins, especially when considering coronavirus-oriented spend and the explosion in higher-cost online sales, is actually fairly benign, indicating that Walmart's online business was able to largely handle this growth surge within its existing capability,"" Moody's (NYSE:MCO) analyst Charlie O'Shea said.  
Total revenue rose 8.6% to $134.6 billion, beating analysts' estimates for $132.79 billion.

Kohl's was forced to close all its U.S. stores to curb the spread of the virus, hammering sales and sending shares in the retailer some 63% lower so far this year. 
But the company said that online sales rose 24% overall in the quarter and more than 60% in April, dwarfing earlier growth as the chain limited operations to its app and website. 
""We have begun the rebuilding process, recently reopening about 50% of our stores across the country,"" Michelle Gass, chief executive officer, said. 
The company, which owns over 1,100 stores in the United States, had earlier withdrawn its full-year forecast, suspended share buyback plan and borrowed money to combat the pandemic's impact. At the end of the quarter, the company had $2 billion in cash at hand.
The results come at a time peers when J.Crew, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney (N:JCP) have filed for bankruptcy protection due to huge losses. 
Department stores have been struggling even before the pandemic as consumers shift to online shopping and competition from fast-fashion brands add to the pressure. 
For the quarter ended May 2, Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl's reported a bigger-than-expected loss due to store closures and said net sales fell about 44% to $2.16 billion. 

The company reported net loss of $541 million, or $3.50 per share. Excluding one-time items, it lost $3.20 per share, missing Wall Street expectation of a $1.80 loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

 Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) is the first major global oil producer to see its stock recover to the level it traded at before the price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Aramco climbed 3.1% in Riyadh on Tuesday, advancing for a record sixth day alongside an extended increase in the price of crude. The stock has gained each session since the company announced it would retain dividend payouts, despite a drop in first-quarter profit.
Aramco’s recovery has been achieved on much smaller share volumes than its international counterparts, with less than 2% of the Saudi company’s stock available for trading. An average of about $35 million worth of Aramco shares changed hands each session last week, rising to $100 million on Monday. That compares with yesterday’s  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). share turnover of $1.4 billion.
Much of Aramco’s stock sold during its initial public offering in December went to locals, who stand to receive bonus shares if they maintain their holdings for six months. The shares are now 20% higher than this year’s lowest close on March 16.
Shares in oil companies plummeted in March after an OPEC+ meeting ended without a deal to curb production, an impasse that was followed by an all-out price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The Covid-19 pandemic disrupted global energy demand as economies shut down, prompting a collapse in the oil market. Crude futures have since recovered as governments started to ease lockdown measures and after major suppliers eventually agreed to production cuts.
While Aramco stuck to its dividend plans, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc slumped last month after cutting its payout for the first time since the Second World War. Total SA (NYSE:TOT) offered to pay part of its final 2019 dividend in shares, rather than cash.
“While oil-output cuts across the world have helped push prices above $30 a barrel, we remain cautious about the pace of a recovery in oil demand and compliance with the OPEC+ pact,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Salih Yilmaz and Rob Barnett. They added that price volatility may persist, “given uncertainty over the relaxation of coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.”

LONDON (Reuters) - A banking lobby group called on Tuesday for the European Union to further soften a capital measure to ensure banks do not run out of headroom to help companies hit by the coronavirus crisis.
The EU aims to approve a package of capital relief measures for banks by June to keep credit flowing to companies as the economy tumbles into a deep recession.
The Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) said the European Central Bank (ECB) has estimated that such measures will free up 120 billion euros ($131 billion) to support 1.8 trillion euros of additional lending.
""The question is are these changes going to be sufficient to furnish banks with enough capacity to provide the support to their customers that is going to be needed in the coming downturn, let alone the recovery?"" Michael Lever, head of prudential regulation at AFME, said in a blog post.
""We are not so sure that they will.""
A quarter of the extra lending capacity hinges on banks issuing new debt instruments, which would take some time in current markets, AFME's Lever added.
Banks also have to include billions of euros in government-backed loans to companies for calculating their leverage ratio, a broad measure of a bank's capital to assets.
Governments not banks shoulder the risk from the loans, and Lever said consideration should be given to exempting them from the leverage ratio for a limited time to free up lending, a step the Bank of England has already taken.
The EU package already includes a proposal to temporarily exclude reserves banks hold at central banks from the ratio, but Lever said the need to approve the package quickly has led to a reluctance to broaden out the proposals.

In the May 7-14 poll, 68% of investors called the rebound in equities a bear-market rally, or a short-term and fast bounce in stocks before they fall to new lows. Only a quarter believe that equities have entered a new bull market. Just 10% of the surveyed fund managers expect the economic recovery to be V-shaped, or quick and sharp, in contrast with 75% who predict a U- or W-shaped rebound that will take longer.
On the bright side, global growth expectations surged in May, with a net 38% of fund managers predicting the world economy will strengthen over the next 12 months, according to the BofA survey. At the same time, investors don’t see global manufacturing PMI rising beyond 50 -- the level that signals expansion -- before November.
Risk assets around the world have surged over the past two months on powerful monetary and fiscal support measures and spurred by optimism that growth can rebound as major economies relax lockdowns. However, continuing inflows into money-market and bond funds signal that many investors have avoided returning to equities amid fears about a second spike in infections and the lasting damage to corporate earnings.
The latest BofA survey showed a small reduction in cash levels to 5.7%, which is still well above the 10-year average of 4.7%, while bond allocation jumped to the highest since the 2009 financial crisis. Exposure to equities in May rose 10 percentage points to a net 16% underweight after hitting the lowest level since 2009 last month, according to BofA. Fund managers are long U.S. equities and short euro-zone stocks, the poll shows.
With the coronavirus continuing to dominate global headlines, the survey showed that investors see a second wave of the pandemic as the biggest tail risk for markets. A breakthrough in developing a vaccine is viewed as the most likely catalyst for a V-shaped recovery.
Since so many traditional fund managers have been staying away from risk assets, BofA’s survey provides a glimpse of which market players have been driving the rally in stocks. The responses shows hedge funds this month boosted their exposure to equities to a net 34% long position, bringing their allocation close to the levels seen before the February market collapse.
BofA polled 194 fund managers overseeing $591 billion in assets during the global survey.

48,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",British backing gives some RBS investors comfort in crisis,"By Sinead Cruise and Iain Withers
LONDON (Reuters) - Best known as Britain's biggest financial crisis failure, some investors and analysts view majority state-owned Royal Bank of Scotland (NYSE:RBS) as the lender likely to emerge strongest from the coronavirus downturn.
RBS (L:RBS) had built the largest capital surplus of any major British bank before the pandemic struck, some 14 billion pounds ($17 billion) above the regulatory minimum, and had hoped to use much of this to buy back the government's 62% stake.
Now investors are betting this capital cushion, which will help it absorb loan losses resulting from the economic crunch, will help RBS gain greater market share and potentially restore a dividend ahead of rivals.
""RBS can use this capital to increase lending without having to issue new shares,"" James Clunie, portfolio manager at top-15 investor Jupiter Asset Management (L:JUP), said, pointing to the bank's 16.6% core capital buffer against the required 9%.
""I have a feeling that's what they're going do, and it pleases everyone: customers, the taxpayer, the government.""
RBS was quicker than other banks to lend billions of pounds under the British government's coronavirus relief schemes, although executives say it was not under pressure to do so.
The RBS loan book grew by 7%, or 24.4 billion pounds, quarter-on-quarter, after 7% growth over 2019 and Chief Financial Officer Katie Murray has told analysts it should exceed its target of 3% lending growth this year.
By contrast, Lloyds Banking Group's (L:LLOY) first-quarter lending rose 1% in the first quarter, after the loan book of Britain's largest domestic bank had shrunk by 1% in 2019.
Although RBS Chief Executive Alison Rose has said it is only lending to existing customers via the government's relief schemes, analysts say any expansion risks greater losses as many of the loans are 80% not 100% state guaranteed.
Analysts at brokerages such as KBW are now forecasting losses ahead for RBS, which made 800 million pounds of provisions in the first quarter against expected loan losses.
KBW, which has a 'sell' rating on RBS, forecasts it will have to make more than 4 billion pounds of coronavirus-related loan provisions in 2020 and will suffer a pre-tax loss of around 800 million pounds this year.
And while a year-end dividend is unlikely given the economic downturn and political pressure on banks and other companies not to make payouts to shareholders, John Teahan, portfolio manager at RWC Equity Income, thinks RBS will reward their patience.
""It may take some time to get to their target, back to last year's earnings level, but when they do, then the 2019 distribution equates to a 20% return per annum to investors based on today's share price,"" Teahan said.
'MORE RBS-LIKE' 
While majority state ownership, the result of a 45 billion pound government bailout during the 2007-2008 financial crisis, may have made it more solid facing the coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath, RBS may also now take longer to emerge from it.
Chairman Howard Davies said this month that RBS still wants to buy back state-owned stock in the long term, but this could be some way off after a fall in its share price to just above 100 pence, well below the last government sale at 271 pence.
RBS secured shareholder approval for directed buybacks of the state's shares last year, which would complement any purchases of its own stock in the open market, should the government decide to sell down in this way.
But the British government's target of fully privatising RBS by 2025, which had already been pushed back by a year in the Budget in March, looks wildly optimistic, some analysts say.
""2030 may well be doable, but I'm sure the government thought 2020 might be doable when it bought in at 500 pence-a-share,"" said Ian Gordon, banking analyst at Investec, who rates RBS stock as a 'buy'. 
But with many firms seeking taxpayer backing to see them through the coronavirus crisis, some investors say the impetus to shed state ownership is far less pressing.
""Other companies have become more RBS-like,"" Clunie said.

50,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Investor urges reinsurer Watford to sell itself as it lags peers: letter,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Investment firm Capital Returns Management asked  Watford  Holdings Ltd (O:WTRE) to hire an investment bank and consider selling itself as the reinsurer's stock has lost more than half of its value since January and lags its peers.
Capital Returns Management principal Ronald Bobman said Bermuda-based Watford has no ""inherent competitive strengths or core competencies"" and said there have only been ""unprofitable underwriting and investment results.""
""The best course of action, I suspect,"" Bobman wrote to Watford's board of directors, ""is for the company to be sold, possibly to a runoff specialist, or alternatively, to forgo its ratings and self administer its runoff.""
A reinsurer in runoff stops underwriting and winds down its liabilities.
Reuters saw a copy of the letter, which was sent on Friday.
A representative for the company was not immediately available for comment.
Bobman, who has invested in insurance companies for 25 years and owned 1.67% of Watford at the end of the first quarter, said Watford has ""fallen horribly short of expectations"" since the company was created in 2014.
At that time reinsurance was a popular way for hedge fund managers, including Daniel Loeb and David Einhorn, to raise more capital, and many large hedge funds had a reinsurance business.
At Watford, HPS Investment Partners, which was originally a division of Highbridge Capital Management within J.P. Morgan Asset Management and known as Highbridge Principal Strategies, has been managing funds for the reinsurer since its birth.
Right now Watford trades at 40% of tangible book value, Bobman said, noting that both Loeb's Third Point (NYSE:TPRE) Re and Einhorn's Greenlight Re trade at 55% of tangible book value.
Other metrics are similarly disappointing Bobman wrote.
Watford's portfolio has lost 13% since January while peers' portfolios lost on average 3.7%. Watford's stock price tumbled 53% since January, far more than peers' average 29.1% loss.

51,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Past its peak? Battered oil demand faces threat from electric vehicles,"By Matthew Green and Simon Jessop
LONDON (Reuters) - Oil companies may be facing uncertainty as the coronavirus pandemic triggers a collapse in demand for their products, but auto makers are betting the crisis will help accelerate an electric future.
With economies reeling from lockdowns to curb the virus, the sharpest plunge in oil prices in two decades has slashed the cost of filling up a tank of gas, eroding some of the incentive to make the switch to cleaner fuels.
Looking ahead, cuts in capital spending forced upon energy companies as their revenues crumble could tighten supply enough to cause a spike in oil prices, making electric vehicles more attractive just as automakers ramp up production, analysts say.
""We think this will lead to a tipping point, accelerating the switch to electric vehicles in many more countries around 2023-24,"" Per Magnus Nysveen, senior partner at Rystad Energy, a consultancy in Oslo, told Reuters.
""We will start to see that this starts to dig into global oil demand in a very significant way,"" he said.
According to a Reuters analysis of 27 automakers compiled in partnership with Constellation Research & Technology, most companies apart from Elon Musk's Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) and China's BYD Co (OTC:BYDDF) Ltd (SZ:002594) are still in the early stages of transitioning to EVs, which make up a fraction of global sales. 
(For an interactive graphic on business model transformation and decarbonization within the auto manufacturing sector, see: https://graphics.reuters.com/DATA-ESG/AUTOS/ygdpzylllvw/index.html)
With mid-sized to large petroleum-fuelled SUVs and trucks driving much of the recent growth in the auto sector, many companies are banking on these high-emitting gas-guzzlers to drive their near-term performance.
Nevertheless, with China's BAIC Motor Corp (HK:1958) and German rivals Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  AG (DE:DAIGn) pursuing some of the industry's most ambitious decarbonisation targets, investors are increasingly using a company's EV prospects as a proxy for future success.
""All the growth in transportation is being eaten by electricity,"" said Harry Benham, chairman of Ember-Climate, a British energy transition think-tank. ""Oil and gas companies have got no ability to defeat electricity as a transport fuel."" 
PEAK OIL DEMAND?
With fuel for road transport accounting for about half of all oil demand, the possibility of a faster-than-expected switch to EVs in the wake of the pandemic is one of the main reasons some forecasts for a peak have been brought forward.
Global oil demand hit a record of just over 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019. Rystad now sees demand topping out at 106.5 million-107 million bpd in 2027-2028. The consultancy had previously forecast a marginally higher peak in 2030.
Although the oil industry has defied numerous attempts to call ""peak oil"" in the past, the fact that the International Energy Agency projects that demand will plunge by a record 8.6 million bpd this year has reignited the debate.
Though as yet a minority view, some believe the pandemic is reshaping patterns of work, aviation and commuting so profoundly that oil demand might never return to 2019 levels - a potential boost to hopes of avoiding the worst impacts of climate change.
""It's inconceivable that all that demand for oil comes back in one go, so the real question is how much of that is lost permanently,"" said Mark Lewis, head of sustainability research at BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) Asset Management.
Underscoring the changing economics of transport, Reuters revealed last week that Tesla plans to introduce a new low-cost, long-life battery in its Model 3 sedan in China that it expects to bring the cost of EVs in line with gasoline models.
Despite such potential breakthroughs, the Constellation data shows that automakers still have a long way to go to align themselves with climate goals enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, with  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) among the biggest laggards. 
Volkswagen has announced some of the most aggressive long-term plans to decarbonise its fleet, but the company still has to prove it can build EVs at scale, and has led the field in ramping up sales of mid- and large SUVs, the data shows.
Although the public decarbonisation targets of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) are only a little bolder than the industry average, the company's proven capacity to build hybrids may bode well for its EV ambitions, the data suggests.
Japan's Subaru Corp (T:7270), which produces only a small number of hybrid vehicles, might have to rely on its partnership with Toyota if it wants to prosper as demand for EVs picks up, Constellation analysts said.
'CRISIS OF UNCERTAINTY'
Although the oil industry hopes to offset demand lost to EVs with a growing appetite for crude to make petrochemicals and plastics, companies facing growing pressure from investors over climate change are increasingly open about the risks.
In April, Ben van Beurden, chief executive of Anglo-Dutch oil major Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), said the company did not expect oil demand to recover in the medium term, saying the industry was living in a ""crisis of uncertainty"". 
Bernard Looney, chief executive of  BP  (L:BP), was later quoted in the Financial Times as saying he would not ""write off"" the possibility the world had reached peak oil.
Much will depend on whether economies stage a V-shaped recovery, as some forecasters predict, and how far governments adopt new EV targets as part of ""green stimulus"" packages to spur a faster shift to a low-carbon future.
With many European politicians calling for green recoveries, the French government signalled on Monday that the country wants to boost sales of low-emission cars. China has extended backing for EVs as part of its recovery package, and U.S. Democrats are exploring ways to boost demand for clean vehicles.
With various European countries planning to ultimately ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars, some see increasingly ambitious EV commitments by automakers as another sign of the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.
""One of the primary factors holding back the transition has been resistance by the fossil fuel incumbents,"" said Kingsmill Bond, senior strategist at financial think-tank Carbon Tracker. ""Now those incumbents are significantly weakened.""

BENGALURU (Reuters) - Profits at Asian companies have plunged by an average of 43% in the first quarter, the steepest decline in at least 9 years, with the oil and consumer sector hardest hit as the coronavirus pandemic kept people at home.
There have been few winners in the March quarter, although companies are expected to fare better over the following three months, a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data on 2,087 companies found. Profit is expected to decline 27% in the quarter to the end of June.
The data showed that about 73% of Asian firms have reported their March quarter earnings so far. 
(GRAPHIC: Asian companies profit growth - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbpgnannvq/Asian%20companies%20profit%20growth.jpg)
""We are optimistic that China will lead the Asian region out of its depressed state. It will likely show a modest recovery in sales and profits in Q2, and a strong bounce ... from Q3 onwards,"" Khiem Do, a fund manager at Baring Asset Management, said.
""The rest of the Asian region will follow suit, most probably from Q3 onwards."" 
(GRAPHIC: Sector wise profit growth - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdwywkvo/Sector%20wise%20profit%20growth.jpg)
In the March quarter, oil companies cumulatively posted losses for the first time in at least a decade as oil prices slumped because cars remained parked and planes were grounded.
China's top two oil companies, PetroChina (SS:601857) and Sinopec (SS:600028), posted record losses.
Airlines reported their biggest losses in at least 10 years, and profit at companies that depend on discretionary spending, such as automakers, slumped 94%. Companies that supply machinery reported an 83% fall in profit as factories were shut.
Among the outliers was Chinese tech giant Tencent (HK:0700) as people spent money on its games and social media sites.
""There are very early signs that the cuts in earnings forecasts have started to show signs of coming to some end,"" Herald van der Linde (NYSE:LIN), head of Asia equity strategy at HSBC, said.
Analysts, according to Refinitiv data, cut their profit forecast for the next 12 months by 2% in the past 30 days. In the 30 days before that, they lowered their estimate by 9% for the period.

54,By Investing.com,"<span>May 19, 2020 06:56AM ET</span>","Stocks - U.S. Futures Lower as Powell, Mnuchin Set to Testify","By Peter Nurse   
Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open a touch mixed Tuesday, consolidating after Monday’s sharp gains, with investors cautious ahead of a key testimony from Fed chief Jerome Powell but encouraged by strong results from retail giant Walmart.
At 07:10 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 5 points, or 0.2%, lower, Nasdaq futures up 3 points, or 0.1%. The Dow futures contract fell 32 points, or 0.1%. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 911 points, or 3.9%, higher Monday, the biggest one-day gain since April 6. The S&P 500 gained 3.1%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 2.4%. This followed positive, but still only preliminary, news from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) about a potential vaccine for the Covid-19 virus.
Benchmark indices are on a three-day winning streak, with the Dow at its highest level since April 29, the S&P 500 the highest since March 6, and the Nasdaq at a three-month high. 
Attention will turn to the Hill later Tuesday, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee, alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, on the economic stimulus programs approved so far.
In a speech last week Powell gave a sober assessment of the long-term risks to the U.S. economic outlook and the possible need for more spending programs to keep the economy afloat.
This comes as states start to reopen their economies and after the U.S. posted its lowest daily death total due to the coronavirus since late March.
The retail sector will also be in focus Tuesday, after giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT) posted strong quarterly numbers, thanks to a doubling of e-commerce sales. Walmart stock climbed over 4% premarket.
Earlier Tuesday,   Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) stock fell 3% premarket despite the company reporting a sharp rise in first-quarter sales, as profits were weighed down by extra costs related to the pandemic.
On Monday JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) said it will permanently close nearly 30% of its 846 stores as part of a restructuring plan under bankruptcy protection.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) will also be in the spotlight after the resignation of streaming chief Kevin Mayer to become TikTok CEO. Mayer was instrumental in the development of Disney Plus, the company’s hit streaming service that launched in November.
Oil futures were mixed ahead of the expiry of the monthly WTI contract later Tuesday. However, the losses are small compared with the turmoil of last month when the lack of delivery storage resulted in the contract closing sharply in negative territory.  
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 0.4% higher at $31.77 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.1% to $34.78.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,736.75/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0965, up 0.5%.

55,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",'Nothing off-limits': Thyssenkrupp could sell steel business in historic shift,"By Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) could sell most of its steelmaking division, its CEO said on Tuesday, marking a historic reversal in strategy for the German conglomerate which has built its 200-year-old legacy as an industrial champion on the business.
""Nothing is off-limits anymore,"" Martina Merz said when asked by Reuters if Thyssenkrupp could a sell a majority stake in the steel business. 
The chief executive was speaking hours after announcing that the group was in talks with steel industry peers about consolidation options. She said the coronavirus pandemic was opening up new possibilities for cooperation. 
""We are drawing on the full range of options,"" she told journalists on a call. ""That means all forms of consolidation are being looked at, including mergers, takeovers, us acquiring peers, and us developing the unit independently.""
The fact that the steel division is no longer deemed an essential part of Thyssenkrupp represents a fundamental shift for a company that started off life in 1811 when Friedrich Krupp set up a factory to make cast steel.
The steel business, the second-biggest in Europe by sales, is reeling from weakening demand, cheap Chinese imports and a botched attempt to merge it with the European division of Tata Steel, a deal blocked on antitrust concerns. 
Shares in Thyssenkrupp have lost nearly two-thirds of their value over the past 12 months after a raft of profit warnings and due to dwindling investor confidence.
The announcement accelerates Thyssenkrupp's dismantling, a process that started last year when the group sold its crown jewel: its elevators unit. Some investors say the vast conglomerate, which makes everything from car parts to submarines, should be broken up to maximise its value.
Shares in the group were up 3.2% at 1016 GMT.
See FACTBOX on the Thyssenkrupp empire and possible M&A:
Sources have previously told Reuters that contact between Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel never broke off and that both were still in talks about consolidation.
Thyssenkrupp is also in discussions with Sweden's SSAB and China's Baoshan Iron & Steel, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Baosteel declined to comment as did SSAB. Tata Steel Europe had no immediate comment.

The steelmaking business accounts for more than a fifth of Thyssenkrupp's sales, making it the company's second-biggest unit after material services.

57,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Sovereign wealth funds fly to relative safety of U.S. assets amid pandemic,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Sovereign wealth funds flocked to U.S. equities and bonds in the first quarter at the expense of riskier investments such as those in emerging markets as the coronavirus spread around the world, data shows. 
U.S. equity strategies managed by third-party fund managers sucked in net flows of $5.36 billion from sovereign funds in the first quarter, with the majority headed to passive S&P 500 equity strategies which posted their largest inflows in at least three years, according to data from eVestment.
U.S. fixed income was also in demand, with net inflows of $341.1 million also the most in at least three years. 
eVestment's senior research analyst Mike Cho noted the inflows were particularly strong for those investing in lower-risk fixed-income assets. In general, sovereign funds were net contributors of capital to long-only strategies during the period, Cho said.
However, emerging markets passive equity suffered a $2.12 billion pullback - the largest quarterly net outflow since late 2017.
The coronavirus and oil price shock wiped $12 trillion off world stock markets in the first quarter, though equities have risen some 25% from their March lows. 
The investment flows suggest sovereign funds held their nerve amid the chaos, with net inflows to third-party fund managers across all equity and bond strategies of $1.44 billion during the quarter the highest in two years. 
A separate research report by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF) recently found institutional investors ""did not engage in panicked selling of equities, as they had done in 2008, but rather a more selective approach"".
The research, compiled by a network of sovereign wealth funds and financial services provider  State Street  Corporation (NYSE:STT), found in March and April there was a general flight to safety towards the U.S. at the expense of emerging and other developed markets, and into defensive relative to cyclical sectors.
A regulatory filing last week showed Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund has bought minority stakes in Boeing (N:BA), Facebook (O:FB) and  Citigroup  (N:C), giving it a portfolio of nearly $10 billion in U.S.-listed stocks.
An IFSWF survey of oil and non-oil sovereign funds found only two out of 10 said their governments had sought funds, with the same number saying they had received requests to support additional government projects.

""Rather than tapping their rainy day funds, several governments from oil-rich nations from the Arabian Gulf to Kazakhstan have recently borrowed from the international bond markets to cover budget shortfalls,"" it said.

TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sony  Corp (T:6758) said on Tuesday it will turn its listed financial arm, Sony (NYSE:SNE) Financial Holdings Inc (T:8729), into a wholly owned unit through a tender offer worth about 400 billion yen ($3.72 billion).
The deal will allow the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant to strengthen its presence in the fintech field to compete with global tech majors such as  Alibaba  Group Holding Ltd (N:BABA) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
It also reflects Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida's strategy of making revenue streams more stable following a major revamp by his predecessor which shifted Sony's focus away from low-margin consumer electronics to entertainment content and subscription-based businesses.
The deal is the biggest strategic move for Sony under Yoshida since a $2.3 billion acquisition of EMI Music Publishing, announced soon after Yoshida took the helm in 2018.
""The financial business has a stable profit base in Japan,"" Yoshida told reporters and analysts in a briefing. Taking full control of the business ""will help us hedge growing geopolitical risks.""
Sony, which will change its name to Sony Group next year, already owns 65% of Sony Financial. It offers about 2,600 yen for each remaining Sony Financial share - a premium of about 26% over Monday's closing price of 2,064 yen. The tender offer closes in July.
Sony Financial, a consistently stable revenue source for Sony, has banking, life and non-life insurance, credit card and nursing care businesses in Japan with about 11,000 staff. Total assets stood at 14.5 trillion yen as of the end of last year.
It contributed operating profit of 129.6 billion yen in the year ended in March, or about 15% of the group.
Sony expects the acquisition to have a positive tax-related impact of 40 billion to 50 billion yen annually on net profit.
The plan, first reported by the Nikkei business daily earlier on Tuesday, sent shares of Sony Financial up nearly 17% to 2,412 yen before trading of the stock was suspended. Sony Corp shares rose 3.3% in a broader market that ended up 1.5%.

62,By Investing.com,"<span>May 19, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Coronabond Sugar Rush Fades,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The sugar rush from Monday’s Franco-German proposal for a 500 billion-euro ($546 billion) Recovery Fund has faded quickly on Tuesday, with European stock markets mostly succumbing to profit-taking rather than extending gains.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 0.8%, while the French CAC 40 was down 0.9% and the Italian FTSE MIB was down 1.2%.  
That may seem odd, given how much has been said and written about the importance of Europe acting together and pooling its fiscal firepower. If adopted, the proposal can be a first big step towards a more comprehensive fiscal union, which banishes the threat of a eurozone breakup for good, bringing huge benefits for business and investor confidence.
However, Tuesday’s reaction is consistent with the fact that the idea still has many hurdles to overcome before it can become reality.
“It’s best to take this proposal as a starting point, not an end to the discussions,” given that the proposals will need unanimous approval from 25 other countries, said ING chief eurozone economist Carsten Brzeski in a research note. “In the end this is Europe, so there’s no reason to cheer until we’ve had some all-nighters, amendments to proposals and compromises.""
Skeptics will point to the fact that the proposal also left plenty of room for sub-optimal outcomes, even if it does get approved. For one thing, the proposal is embedded in a Franco-German vision for the new multi-year EU budget. As such, it is designed to maximize Franco-German leverage on those negotiations.
The proposal explicitly ties the offer to “a clear commitment of Member States to sound economic policies and an ambitious reform agenda” – in other words, external and routine supervision of national economic policy: the Troika in a newer, friendlier guise.
Other language in the proposals harks back to ancient desires of Paris to soften EU state aid rules and the desire of both to kill the independent tax regimes of Ireland, Luxembourg and others who don’t have big native centers of capital to fill their treasuries. A look at the current plans for bailouts of Air France KLM (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) gives a good idea of where that debate could go.
Markets were nonetheless right to react positively to a truly ground-breaking announcement. Never before have the bloc’s two biggest economies clearly acknowledged the principle of common borrowing to help the region’s weakest regions through grants, rather than loans, in such scale: Coronabonds - although the word obviously didn't make it into the final text.
That’s a big departure from the tools devised to fight the last economic crisis in the euro zone, which insisted that countries like Greece and Portugal repay all the aid they received.
So – an important first step, but still only that. Until it becomes available - no earlier than 2021, in any realistic time frame - the bloc remains dependent on the effectiveness of ECB policy.
Coming only a week after the Federal Constitutional Court raised a question mark over Germany’s commitment to the ECB’s crisis-fighting tools, the timing could hardly be better.  "

London wrote $110 billion in gross written premium in commercial insurance and reinsurance in 2018, increasing its lead over Bermuda, Switzerland and Singapore combined to $23 billion from $16 billion in 2015, the report by lobby group London Market Group (LMG) and consultants McKinsey showed. 
The numbers allay worries London would lose out to other centres.
""There was a fear that Bermuda would come and eat our lunch and there would be a gravitational pull away from the London market - that hasn't happened,"" said Clare Lebecq, Chief Executive of LMG.
""It's testament to the innovation we have here.""
Lloyd's of London and other commercial insurers with UK operations are famed for covering complex risks from oil rigs to cyber attacks.
London's share of global commercial insurance grew by 0.1 percentage points, with North America becoming its biggest market, surpassing its previous top market of Britain and Ireland.
But in global reinsurance - insuring the insurers - London's market share fell by 1.7 percentage points.
London faces competition from global reinsurers in growing markets like longevity risk, and the cost of transacting reinsurance business in London is higher than in centres such as Bermuda.
The London market is also ageing - 26% of the workforce was over 50 in 2019 against 16% in 2014, while the proportion of workers under 30 shrank to 20% from 23%.
""The insurance industry has historically not been good at promoting itself outside of its own market, and there is still too much hiring based on relationships and connections rather than wider searches for talent,"" the report said, adding that London should establish a more coordinated recruitment process. 
Forty-five percent of the workforce were women in 2019 compared with 44% five years earlier, the report showed. But the median gender pay gap of 30.6% was far higher than the UK average of 10.9%, and women made up only 25% of the market's top earners.
Insurers in London have been attempting to improve their record on diversity, with Lloyd's acknowledging issues with sexual harassment and daytime drinking.

(Reuters) - European shares pulled back on Tuesday after a rally in the previous session, with losses in healthcare, and construction and engineering firms countering optimism from fresh stimulus plans for the European Union.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) gave up early gains to trade 0.8% lower.
Euro zone stocks (STOXXE) also shed 0.9% after an early boost from a 500 billion euros recovery fund that France and Germany called to create on Monday that would offer grants to European Union regions and sectors hit hardest by the pandemic.
The STOXX 600 recorded its biggest daily percentage gain since March 24 in the previous session after an encouraging report from a potential COVID-19 vaccine and optimism as several economies eased coronavirus-driven lockdowns.
""We're following up yesterday with a bit of consolidation, but I would not read too much into it,"" said Andrea Cicione, head of strategy at TS Lombard.
""You can see a shift in sectoral responses in Europe. Financials and consumer discretionary stocks that had been lagging in the recent recovery led gains yesterday. To me, that is a sign that markets are reacting to something differently.""
Healthcare companies (SXDP) - which have largely held resilient in the wake of the coronavirus crisis - fell 0.7%, while construction and engineering firms (SXOP) dropped 1.7%.
Insurers (SXIP) were the sole gainers in Europe after UK's Beazley Plc (L:BEZG) raised 247 million pounds ($301.83 million) in fresh capital, sending its shares up 8.6%.
Banks (SX7P) also posted somewhat minimal losses after wealth manager  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) saw a spike in trading volumes boost its first-quarter margins even though a strong Swiss franc ate into assets under management.
Automakers (SXAP) took a hit as data showed European passenger car sales saw a record drop in April, the first full month with restrictions imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic across the continent.
Struggling German industrial company Thyssenkrupp AG (DE:TKAG) jumped 4.1% as it said it was looking for partners for its steel and warship divisions.
French spirits company  Remy Cointreau  SA (PA:RCOP) dropped 5.1% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded its shares to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" as it expects a moderate pace of recovery.

Shares in tobacco group Imperial Brands Plc (L:IMB) fell 6.1% said it plans to cut its dividend by a third, and expects a bigger hit from the coronavirus crisis in the second half of the year.

LONDON (Reuters) - The euro and Italian government bonds continued on Tuesday to cheer German- and French-led plans for a 500 billion euro EU coronavirus recovery fund, though stock markets were suffering from fatigue after their best day in months.
There was still a sense of optimism after Monday's news that early-stage tests on a possible COVID-19 vaccine had also proved encouraging but the momentum was shifting.
Europe's STOXX 600 index gave up an early rise to slip 0.4% after surging 4% in the previous session, oil began to tread water [O/R] and safe-haven U.S. government bonds were making ground in debt markets. 
""The Franco-German proposals are ambitious, targeted and, of course, welcome,"" European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said of Monday's plan, which would move the EU in the direction of a so-called 'transfer union'.
The euro was buying $1.0932, having gained about 1% against the dollar since the plan was announced. It was also up near a two-month high against the Swiss franc, while the cost of betting against the euro was falling.
After a sizeable fall in Italian borrowing costs, Spanish and Portuguese yields led the moves lower on Tuesday.  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s economists called the Franco-German proposal a ""powerful common response, helping to mitigate the risk of a southern slump.""
The Spanish 10-year yield fell 9 basis points to 0.715%, the lowest since early April, while Portuguese bond yields hit their lowest since March 31, down 12 bps on the day at 0.78%. 
Italian yields were between 2 and 8 bps lower on the day. The 10-year government bond yield fell nearly 10 basis points to 1.602%, its lowest since April 9 at one point.
""It was a meaningful breakthrough but it is not going to be plain sailing from here,"" said Vasileios Gkionakis, Global Head of FX Strategy at Lombard Odier, citing resistance already voiced by a sizeable number of northern EU countries.
In the equity markets, Wall Street's S&P 500 futures were down 0.4% after Monday's strong rally.
Asia had followed. MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 1.8% to two-week highs and Japan's Nikkei had added nearly 2%. 
In the commodity markets, profit-taking pruned Brent's early gains, though the rally looked broadly intact amid signs that producers are cutting output just as demand picks up.

Brent last stood 0.5% higher at $35 a barrel, after touching its highest since April 9. U.S. WTI was at $32.50. Gold was little changed at $1,731 an ounce.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways has laid off hundreds of employees this month, including cabin crew, after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to ground flights, according to industry and company sources. 
The state-owned airline, which had 20,530 employees as of August 2019, grounded passenger flights in March and a month later said it had made a large number of staff redundant.
Two sources said hundreds of staff had been laid off this month with employees being let go on an almost daily basis. More job cuts were expected, they said. 
An Etihad spokeswoman told Reuters there had been redundancies across several areas of the airline. 
""It is clear the demand for travel in the near future will be significantly reduced and as a result we must make difficult decisions to ensure Etihad will weather this storm,"" she said.
Etihad, which has lost $5.6 billion since 2016, has slashed wages as global travel has come to a near standstill.
It has operated some passenger flights since March, mostly for foreigners leaving the UAE and said it plans to resume regular passenger flights in June.

Countries are beginning to emerge from lockdowns, though the airline industry has cautioned it could take years for travel demand to recover.

Pier 1, which operates about 541 stores in the U.S., said in a statement that it intends to sell its inventory and remaining assets, including its intellectual property and e-commerce business, through a court-supervised process.
""Unfortunately, the challenging retail environment has been significantly compounded by the profound impact of COVID-19, hindering our ability to secure such a buyer and requiring us to wind down,"" Chief Executive Officer Robert Riesbeck said.
Pier 1 said it will continue to serve its customers through its online operations, Pier1.com, and will start closing stores and begin sales liquidation once stores can reopen based on COVID-19 guidelines from local government officials.
The company's debtor-in-possession financiers have agreed to allow the company to overdraw about $40 million to support operations through the wind-down period, it added.
The Fort Worth, Texas-based company had earlier in the year in February filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and was pursuing a sale, a month after announcing plans for up to 450 store closures and the shut down of two distribution centers.

71,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>","Slow recovery in markets seen as COVID-19 risks persist, cash still king: BofA survey","LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are bearish on stocks, especially riskier assets, and expect a slower economic recovery as the risk of a second wave of infections from the novel coronavirus persists, a BofA fund manager survey showed.
World stocks have bounced back by a whopping 31% in less than two months from a March selloff, recovering more than half their losses, as investors bet that economic activity would rebound rapidly once lockdowns were eased.
But evidence of fresh coronavirus infections in some countries has dampened those hopes. BofA's survey showed that a pandemic ""second wave"" was seen as the biggest risk to markets for the second straight month.
As economic forecasts continue to deteriorate, May's poll showed 75% of respondents believe the recovery will be U or W-shaped. Only 10% of the 194 respondents in the survey were expecting a V-shaped recovery.
A V-shaped recovery is when a plunge in growth is followed by an equally sharp recovery; U-shaped is when recovery takes more than a couple of quarters; and W-shaped refers to a double-dip in growth.
Investor pessimism was further evident in cash levels elevated at 5.7%, well above 4% in February and slightly below April.
Other findings from the survey included that long U.S. tech and growth stocks were the ""most crowded"" trade for May, and that hedge funds were increasing their exposure to equities by 15 percentage points to net 34% -- the largest increase since June 2018.
BofA's ""Bull & Bear Indicator"", a sentiment index, remained pinned at 0.0 since March, generating a contrarian ""buy signal"" for risk assets, the U.S. bank said.

On the bright side, risk of a ""systemic credit event"" - corporate credit defaults -- collapsed to 8% from 30%.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has overtaken China as the most attractive country in the world for renewables investment and the global clean energy sector is expected to bounce back quickly despite the coronavirus pandemic, research showed on Tuesday.
In an annual ranking of the top 40 renewable energy markets worldwide by consultancy EY, the United States was ranked first for the first time since 2016, followed by China.
U.S. growth was largely due to a short-term extension of a production tax credit for wind projects and plans to invest $57 billion to install up to 30 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2030, the report said.
Wind projects which began construction in 2016 need to be operational by the end of the year to qualify for the U.S. tax credit which is forecast to create a surge in installations this year. 
China’s growth in renewables has slowed, as the government looks to wean the market off subsidies. This, coupled with reduced demand as a result of COVID-19, has caused China to drop to second in the index from first last year, but forecasts remain optimistic for long-term growth, the report added.
France was ranked third, followed by Austria, Germany and Britain. India slumped to seventh place, having been third last year, due to warnings it might miss its 175 GW installation target by 2022.
Despite delays to some projects due to logistic issues amid the coronavirus pandemic, the global renewables sector is expected to bounce back quickly as the long-term drivers for investment remain strong, the report said.
""There was much discussion around environmental, social and governance issues earlier this year and this, along with climate change, is still the dominant long-term driver for renewable investment,"" said Ben Warren, EY global power & utilities corporate finance leader and chief editor of the report.
""As a result of the pandemic, pollution levels have fallen dramatically through reduced fossil fuel consumption. A greater focus on a sustainable long-term energy future therefore works in favour of clean energy, in particular wind and solar, together with storage,"" he added.

Investing.com - European stock markets sold off Tuesday, after struggling to maintain Monday’s strong tone despite talk of fresh stimulus in the region.
At 4:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 0.8%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 0.4%. The pan-Europe Stoxx 600 index fell 0.7%.
Late Monday, France and Germany proposed a 500 billion-euro ($547 billion) recovery fund that would offer grants to European Union regions and sectors hit hardest by the pandemic.
This represents a major shift in position by Germany, the region’s economic powerhouse, which had previously rejected the idea of nations sharing debt. 
However, the proposal needs to be put forward to all EU nations, and sharing debt as an idea has proved a tricky sell in the past. Even if it is passed, there are doubts about the size of the fund and how quickly the monies will be dispensed. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Tuesday the fund would not be available until 2021 at the earliest.
Monday saw sharp gains, with the Stoxx 600 posting its best performance since late March, caused by U.S. drugmaker  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) suggesting its vaccine has a ""high probability"" to provide protection from the coronavirus. This had bolstered hopes that a vaccine may be found sooner rather than later, strengthening expectations for a quicker economic recovery. 
The current economic news has continued in grim fashion, however.  Car registrations in Italy and the U.K. fell by 98% in April, while declines in France and Germany were only a little less severe.  
People claiming unemployment benefits in Britain soared to its highest level since 1996 in April, the first full month of the government's coronavirus lockdown, data published on Tuesday showed. The claimant count rose by 856,500, or 69% - the biggest ever month-on-month leap - to 2.097 million.
The German ZEW confidence indicator is also due later Tuesday. The expectations component of that index showed a strong bounce back in April and should continue to improve, but the key issue will be how much the assessment of current conditions improves by in response to Germany's partial lifting of lockdown measures this month. 
In corporate news,  Julius Baer  (SIX:BAER) stock climbed over 5% after the Swiss private bank posted a 16% rise in gross margins in the first four months of 2020, despite the coronavirus turmoil denting assets under management.
On the flip side,  Compass Group  (LON:CPG) stock fell 3% after the world’s largest caterer launched a 2 billion pound ($2.44 billion) share offer on Tuesday, seeking to shore up its liquidity as the coronavirus crisis continues to keep many of its food service operations in offices and schools closed.
 Remy Cointreau  (PA:RCOP) dropped over 5% after Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) downgraded its recommendation on the stock.

YUYAO, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - In the eastern Chinese city of Yuyao, a group of five face-masked workers at a Geely auto plant, stood almost shoulder to shoulder behind an SUV as they conducted paint and other quality checks.
That scene would not have been possible a month ago.
But Reuters visits to six factories including those operated by  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) China venture and Japanese chipmaker Renesas Electronics (T:6723) showed manufacturers in China have begun to ease strict physical distancing rules as the coronavirus outbreak is now contained. China's daily new coronavirus cases have recently dropped to single digits.
The most significant rule to be relaxed - in line with an easing of guidelines by local governments - has been the requirement that production line workers stand at least 1 metre apart. That rule was put in place by many authorities in February when the outbreak was at its height in China but it was also a rule that auto industry insiders said had hamstrung productivity.
""Workers need to work together to check the quality of the job,"" Shen Qingguang, safety manager at Geely's Yuyao plant where some 1,000 workers build sport utility vehicles for its Lynk & Co marque, told Reuters.
Employees often need to work together on the final assembly line in particular, he added. But where working close together is not deemed necessary, the 1 metre rule still applies and Geely office staff must work 1.5 metres apart.
North American auto plants began reopening this week, introducing temperature monitors for those entering plants, personal protective equipment such as face masks and shields, as well as revamped and deep-cleaned factory floors that emphasise social distancing.
Manufacturers in China are, however, several weeks or in some cases months ahead in terms of reopening, providing a window into how worker practices could evolve. That said, restrictions will vary by country and region.
For Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) Shanghai plant, workers were required to maintain a distance of 1 metre in February but like many other China plants, that rule has now been eased.
In contrast, Tesla's ""Return to Work Playbook"" published this month for its Fremont, California factory calls for workers to maintain a distance of 6 feet or 2 metres, or for barriers to be established where that is not possible.
At Beijing Benz Automotive Co, a Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) venture with China's BAIC Group [BEJINS.UL], the 1 metre rule has also been relaxed for production line staff and workers wearing face masks could be seen working near each other. 
A noticeboard showed weekly production for one line making E-Class sedans, GLC sport utility vehicles and other models had jumped to over 4,000 vehicles from 1,100 in early February.
Indeed, Chinese auto production is by and large back on track, climbing 2.3% in April from the same month a year earlier to 2.1 million vehicles. Vehicle sales also grew, up 4.4% for their first rise in 22 months. Geely said its Yuyao plant had managed to return to full capacity in early March. 
Many strict measures are, however, still in place. At all six plants visited by Reuters, face masks are compulsory - even though some smaller Chinese cities have begun to relax rules about wearing them. Workers must also have their temperatures checked daily and factories are regularly disinfected.
All of the plants visited, which included plants operated by Japan's  SMC Corp  (T:6273), which supplies equipment for production lines, Ningbo Joyson Electronic Corp (SS:600699) - a maker of electronic and safety gear for cars, and Hongyu Electric, a wire supplier for vehicles, said they have not had a case of a coronavirus infection since February.
At Geely's Yuyao plant, rules have also been relaxed for lunch. Previously, workers had to sit on chairs far apart near the production line, all facing one way with their backs to each other.
Now they are allowed back in the canteen, with two workers allowed to sit at a table for four, seated diagonally apart. There are no barriers on the table but sitting directly opposite each other or side by side is still forbidden. Hongyu Electric has introduced similar rules.
Shen, the Geely safety manager, said staff at the Yuyao plant adjusted to wearing masks and ""new normal"" work practices quickly.
""Everyone wants to be safe,"" he said.

Once a byword for German engineering prowess, Thyssenkrupp will be gradually split apart as Chief Executive Officer Martina Merz follows the path taken by other behemoths from Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY) to  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co.
“CEO Merz is moving to a more aggressive mode, which will see some continued restructuring but also potential widespread corporate deals, which we believe are likely to transform the group rapidly,” Christian Georges, director of metals and mining research at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA, said in a note.
Merz’s strategy is aimed at reviving the group after the $19 billion sale of its elevator unit closes later this year. The firm had hoped to use some of the proceeds from that deal to boost ailing units, although worsening finances are gnawing at the lifeline.
“We have taken some difficult decisions that were long overdue,” Merz said in a statement Monday. “Thyssenkrupp will emerge smaller but stronger from the transformation.”
Thyssenkrupp shares rose as much as 5.1% as of 9:18 a.m. in Frankfurt, after jumping more than 12% on Monday. That pared the stock’s decline this year to 57%.
The steel unit, the traditional heart and soul of the company, burned through over 1 billion euros ($1.09 billion) in cash in the six months ending March 31. It’s struggled for years against cheaper competition from Asia. Thyssenkrupp’s European steel business had sales of 4.37 billion euros in the six months through March, while its Marine Systems unit had sales of 235 million euros over the same period.
“The announced restructuring plan is an important step for Thyssenkrupp,” said Lars Foerberg, founding partner of Cevian Capital -- the company’s second-largest shareholder, which has pushed for a carve-up. “It is now crucial that this plan is implemented with urgency and decisiveness.”
The company said a cluster of loss-making businesses, including its plant technology unit that constructs factories, would also be dropped from its portfolio, with outright closures of heavy plate steel and battery solutions divisions an option. It will look to develop its raw materials distribution and its components units.
Thyssenkrupp’s rising debt underscores the shrinking room for maneuver. The company’s net debt stands at 7.55 billion euros, according to earnings figures released last week, a figure likely to rise as the fallout from the pandemic cripples the global economy.
Thyssenkrupp already held exploratory steel talks with Salzgitter AG, people familiar with the matter said last year. Chinese and Indian peers had also expressed interest in Thyssenkrupp’s European steel operations, the people said. Sweden’s SSAB AB is also among the potential partners, one of the people said.
The firm’s steel division was already wrestling with a global glut and a sputtering German economy before demand took a further hit as the coronavirus outbreak spread in March, leading to automotive and other factory shutdowns.
‘Capacity for Action’
While the European Commission blocked a planned merger of Thyssenkrupp Steel with Tata Europe last year, both companies could revisit a deal and potentially sell or close steel plants to allay antitrust concerns, some of the people said.
Thyssenkrupp said it was in intensive discussions over a merger of the Marine Systems business, which builds submarines and other military ships, with a combination with a national or European competitor an option. The unit has run into project overruns in recent years.
“We have left no stone unturned in very carefully examining the individual development potential of each business for Thyssenkrupp,” said Merz. “The sale of the elevator business gives us the capacity for action.”

77,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",Regulator asks for Credit Suisse directors' mobile data in spy inquiry: sources,"By John O'Donnell, Oliver Hirt and Koh Gui Qing
FRANKFURT/ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss regulators have requested electronic messaging data from the mobile phones of several  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) managers and supervisory board directors as part of a probe into spying at the bank, three people familiar with the matter said.
Switzerland's markets watchdog FINMA is examining the culture and governance at one of Europe's largest banks and whether management control failures allowed spying on former executive board members Iqbal Khan and Peter Goerke, the sources told Reuters.
The sources did not identify which managers and board directors FINMA was seeking the mobile phone data for. FINMA declined to comment. 
Credit Suisse has been under investigation after revelations in September that it had hired a private investigator to spy on Khan, its former international wealth management head, and Goerke, which eventually led to the ousting of CEO Tidjane Thiam in February.
Credit Suisse was trying to establish whether Khan was seeking to take clients with him in his move to rival bank UBS. The bank later apologised to Khan, saying no evidence was found. Reuters could not determine why Credit Suisse had spied on Goerke.
Thiam, who has long said he was not aware of the activity, could not be reached for comment. Khan declined to comment, while Goerke could not be reached for comment.
As part of the broader investigation, FINMA is examining whether people used encrypted messaging apps to hide some discussions, another person with knowledge of the inquiry told Reuters.
""What they are more focused on now is who knew what, when, and who should have known,"" said the person.
Homburger, a Swiss law firm that investigated the affair for Credit Suisse last year, said at a press conference in October that it had been inhibited by the deletion of messages sent on an encrypted communication app Threema, used by the company's then chief operations officer, Pierre-Olivier Bouee, and security personnel. 
Credit Suisse has publicly blamed Bouee for organising what it described as a rogue spying operation in which all executives and directors, including Thiam, were kept in the dark.
""Credit Suisse made public statements on the observation matter on several occasions this year and last year and informed the public of the results of internal and external investigations,"" a bank spokesman said in a statement to Reuters.
""Due to the ongoing review by the investigating auditor appointed by Finma, with whom Credit Suisse has been cooperating since the beginning, we are not commenting further on the matter at this time,"" the statement said.
Bouee, who has not spoken publicly about the affair, could not be reached for comment. 
Urs Rohner, the chairman of Credit Suisse, had used Threema, two people familiar with the matter said. One added that Rohner had used it for personal use only.
""The Chairman has never used Threema in a business context,"" a spokesman for Credit Suisse said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday.
FINMA has not accused anyone of wrongdoing as it continues to investigate. The Swiss watchdog's rules allow it to take action against individuals if it finds that a bank broke its own internal communication rules or if it strayed from its usual framework for recording management decisions. 

Credit Suisse declined to comment on its policy on employees using messaging apps, which Reuters was unable to independently review.

ZURICH (Reuters) -  Julius Baer  (S:BAER) posted a 16% rise in gross margins in the first four months of 2020 to 392 billion Swiss francs ($403.38 billion), the Swiss private bank said on Tuesday, while coronavirus turmoil in markets dented assets under management. 
""We are pleased to be able to report a strong start to the year, although it is clearly too early to assess with any certainty the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the global economy, the financial markets, and the results of Julius Baer for the remainder of 2020,"" Chief Executive Philipp Rickenbacher said in a statement.
The trading update from Switzerland's third-largest lender provided the first insight into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on wealth managers in April, after big banks UBS (S:UBSG) and  Credit Suisse  (S:CSGN) posted bumper profits for the first quarter and as wealth managers pointed to resilience.
Gross margins rose to 95 basis points as Julius Baer benefited from an ""exceptional increase"" in trading volumes, while assets under management fell 8% in the first four months of 2020 to 392 billion Swiss francs ($403.38 billion) on the back of falling markets and a strengthening Swiss franc.
The bank pointed to a slightly negative margin impact from lower net interest income and a moderate rise in expected credit losses, without providing figures.
Baer is cutting 300 jobs this year after a double-digit percentage earnings decline in 2019, impacted by outflows at its ailing Italian subsidiary Kairos.
Its three-year strategic programme was on track, Baer said. It posted net new money growth just over 2%, as wealth management inflows particularly from Europe-based clients were partly offset by outflows caused by client deleveraging.

LONDON/HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is urging domestic companies to look at listing in London, several sources told Reuters, as the country aims to revive deals under a Stock Connect scheme and strengthen overseas ties in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
The Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme, which began operating last year, aims to build links between Britain and China, help Chinese companies expand their investor base and give mainland investors access to UK-listed companies.
The original plan was for several companies to take part in the scheme in the first couple of years, but so far only one company, Huatai Securities , made the trip from Shanghai to London last June.
But now Chinese authorities have given the go-ahead for  China Pacific  Insurance (SS:601601) and SDIC Power (SS:600886) to move ahead with their London-listing plans, the sources said, after both deals were halted last year.
They also gave the nod to China  Yangtze Power  (SS:600900) to begin preparations for a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential.
In a statement to Reuters after publication of the report, the Shanghai Stock Exchange said it had been continuously promoting the Shanghai-London Stock Connect scheme that benefits both companies and investors. 
The exchange added that offshore listings under the scheme were ""companies' own decisions based on their development needs and market conditions,"" while the timing of a London listing by SDIC or China Pacific Insurance is also subject to approval from British regulators. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission and China Pacific Insurance did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. SDIC Power and China Yangtze Power declined to comment. The London Stock Exchange declined to comment.
Under the London-Shanghai Connect Scheme, first announced in 2018, Chinese companies are allowed to add a secondary listing of Global Depositary Receipts in Britain that would be linked to shares in Shanghai. 
The sources, including officials from banks, government and exchanges, said that the aim was to push for a resumption of listings under the Stock Connect scheme as China seeks to improve ties with the outside world and help to fund its post-lockdown recovery.
""In the second half of this year, we could see one or maybe two Chinese companies list in London,"" said one of the sources, who is closely involved in the process. 
""China is among the first countries to come out of lockdown, and is keen to get back on track with plans to improve trade relations with the UK,"" he added.
Anti-China sentiment in the United States on several fronts and the troubles surrounding U.S.-listed Chinese coffee chain  Luckin Coffee  (O:LK) may have made the route to New York harder to navigate. 
PIPELINE BUILDS
In the London-Shanghai listings pipeline, China Pacific Insurance is likely to be the first Chinese company to make its London debut this year, seeking to raise between $2 billion and $3 billion, and could price the sale in September or October, a second source said.
China Yangtse Power is another sizeable listing that could raise about $2.5 billion from a deal equivalent to about 5% of its share capital, the source added. 
The listings will not necessarily be an easy sell in the current environment, said a third source, a London-based banker involved in some transactions. 
""The IPO market is likely to remain shaky for a good while yet, and these are not 'need to own' assets. Investors will already be busy supporting the companies in their portfolio and are likely to be selective,"" he said. 
The market for initial public offerings (IPOs) has been all but shut since the virus outbreak, which has hit global economic growth, wreaked havoc on stocks and pushed market volatility to its highest in years. 

Many companies have been raising funds in secondary markets to keep businesses going through lockdowns. But the first quarter of 2020 saw only eight new listings, the lowest number since 2009, Refinitiv data showed.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc (T:8604) said on Tuesday it planned to beef up business with unlisted companies, including offering advice to startups, aiming to diversify revenue after quarterly earnings took a battering from the coronavirus pandemic.
Japanese biggest brokerage and investment bank said in a business strategy update it was seeking new growth in private equity, private debt and infrastructure, as well as in offerings of digital bonds and security tokens.
""To achieve sustainable growth, I have to take Nomura to a different dimension. How do we get there? Strengthening our expansion from public to private is the strategy,"" Chief Executive Kentaro Okuda told an online investor briefing.
Nomura said current revenue from business with private companies was ""not that big"" but declined to provide specific figures.
This month Nomura posted a surprise fourth-quarter net loss, its first in five quarters, as the pandemic wreaked havoc on global stock markets.
""It's unclear if Nomura will be really successful in private markets but fee income from the new businesses could become stable and a key driving force for growth,"" said Toshihiro Matsuo, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings in Tokyo.
Nomura's retail division saw revenue slide 20% in April after staff had to halt face to face meetings with customers due to Japan's state of emergency to curb the spread of the virus.
But the bank believes the problem is temporary, forecasting 110 billion yen in pretax income for the division for the year ending March 2023, more than double the amount booked for the past business year.
Nomura said a year ago it was aiming for about 140 billion yen in cost cuts by March 2022. About 70% of that plan had been achieved, Okuda said.

Investing.com – Sony Corp (T:6758) has partnered with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to embed artificial intelligence capabilities into the latest Sony (T:6758) imaging chip.
The enhanced chip will have its own built-in processor and memory, allowing users to analyze video using AI such as Microsoft’s Azure, but via a faster, simpler and more secure method.
Some potential uses in the retails and logistics sectors are optimizing warehouse and factory automation, calculating customer flow through stores, and cars that are smarter about their drivers and environment. For example, detecting when a driver is falling asleep at the wheel via high-resolution video and AI analysis.
Meanwhile, personal users can use the chip to enhance their mobile photography and videography.
Amid increasing concerns about surveillance, with several countries using tracking methods to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus and enforce lockdowns, the chip will provide more privacy-conscious monitoring. It analyses the video and provides metadata without sending data to remote servers, thus dramatically reducing hackers’ ability to intercept sensitive videos or images.

(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) will keep planes no more than 60% full through at least July, adding more flights to its schedule than demand would usually justify, people familiar with the matter said.
The move is part of a longer-term bet that CEO Ed Bastian highlighted to investors last month: that consumers' perceptions of safety will be instrumental in reviving more routine travel, and that they will be willing to pay a premium for comfort.
Specific details could still change, the people said on condition of anonymity, citing the uncertain timing of a recovery from the coronavirus crisis that has decimated air travel demand.
Delta has publicly said that it will limit first class seating capacity at 50% and main cabin at 60% through June 30, and earlier announced that it was resuming some flights next month.
""We announced a policy on seating capacity through June 30. Nothing has been decided beyond that but we are continuing to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary,"" Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said.
Social distancing on airplanes has become a topic of debate. The global industry's main group IATA has said that airlines will not be able to make a profit if they limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, unless they drastically increased airfares.
In the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week urged airlines to maintain at least one seat between all passengers and cap seating at 67% of capacity on narrow-body airplanes.
While major U.S. airlines' middle seat policies differ, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings, and they have all slashed their flying schedules by as much as 90% in an effort to stem a cash bleed amid withering demand.
Still, Bastian said on a quarterly investor call that fewer airplanes in the skies could be an ""opportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience.""
Industrywide, U.S. airline load factors have recently been about 33%, with some airlines reporting load factors in the 40% range as passenger traffic inches off historic lows. But it is still down about 90% over 2019 levels.
Adding more flights could bring in more revenues but also costs. Delta, which does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years, has said it aims to halve its daily cash burn to $50 million in June.

In an effort to reassure passengers, U.S. airlines have also intensified cabin cleaning protocols, in many cases using electrostatic cleaning and fogging procedures. They have also endorsed temperature screenings by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), though this has yet to be implemented.

91,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 10:54PM ET</span>","Baidu Weathers Covid-19 Better Than Expected, Sees Rebound","(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). reported a smaller slide in revenue than analysts projected and signaled a potential return to growth this quarter, driving its shares 10% higher.
Sales fell 7% to 22.5 billion yuan ($3.18 billion) in the March quarter, surpassing the 21.9 billion-yuan average estimate. It forecast a revenue growth rate of -5% to 4% in the current period.
Baidu’s outperformance shows how investments on content designed to ward off rivals like Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd. are beginning to bear fruit. The search giant has tried to diversify its ad revenue sources partly because those twin social media giants had begun to siphon off clients to more interactive formats like ByteDance’s Douyin, the local equivalent of TikTok.
Baidu’s Netflix-style affiliate iQiyi Inc., which competes with Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd., grew subscribers 11% in the first quarter. Chief Financial Officer Herman Yu told analysts on a conference call expenses will climb as the search giant ramps up activity such as hiring in the second quarter, now that the country has mostly gotten a grip on Covid-19.
“With the pandemic coming under control in China, offline activities are rebounding and Baidu stands to benefit from a restart of the Chinese economy,” Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Robin Li said in a statement.

Once the runaway leader in desktop search, Baidu struggled to stay relevant in the mobile era while fending off ByteDance, whose Douyin is growing users at a rapid clip and pushing down industry ad rates. The Chinese startup is the country’s best-performing ad platform this year in terms of impact and traffic, according to Raymond Feng, a Shanghai-based analyst with Pacific Epoch. To compete, Baidu plans to offer subsidies to influencers and direct more traffic to them across its family of apps, including in live-streaming.
“Baidu is gradually losing the market,” Feng said. “Whether it has topline growth recovery as strong as competing platforms in China is most important for the next few quarters.”
Longer term, Baidu is investing in artificial intelligence technology, and betting on the commercialization of that through smart speakers and self-driving cars. It was awarded contracts in March from local governments in cities including Chongqing and Hefei to build smart transportation infrastructure such as road sensors, part of China’s drive to spur the economy through investment in technology.
Oversight by Beijing remains a problem. In April, Chinese regulators suspended some key channels in Baidu’s flagship mobile app citing vulgar content. That two-week punishment could reduce revenue from its core search and feed business in the June quarter by under 2%, according to an estimate by Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Thomas Chong.

93,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Nasdaq to tighten listing rules, restricting Chinese IPOs - sources","By Echo Wang
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) is set to unveil new restrictions on initial public offerings (IPOs), a move that will make it harder for some Chinese companies to debut on its stock exchange, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.
While Nasdaq will not cite Chinese companies specifically in the changes, the move is being driven largely by concerns about some of the Chinese IPO hopefuls' lack of accounting transparency and close ties to powerful insiders, the sources said.
At a time of escalating tensions between the United States and China over trade, technology and the spread of the novel coronavirus, Nasdaq's new curbs on Chinese IPOs represent the latest flashpoint in the financial relationship between the world's two largest economies.
Nasdaq also unveiled some restrictions on listings last year, seeking to curb IPOs by small Chinese companies. Their shares often trade thinly because most stay in the hands of a few insiders. Their low liquidity makes them unattractive to many large institutional investors, to whom Nasdaq is seeking to cater to.
The new tightening of the listing standards reflects the bourse operator's concerns about some Chinese companies seeking U.S. IPOs. Last month,  Luckin Coffee  (O:LK), which had a U.S. IPO in early 2019, announced that an internal investigation had shown its chief operating officer and other employees fabricated sales deals.
The new rules will require companies from some countries, including China, to raise $25 million in their IPO or, alternatively, at least a quarter of their post-listing market capitalization, the sources said. 
This is the first time Nasdaq has put a minimum value on the size of IPOs. The change would have prevented several Chinese companies currently listed on the Nasdaq from going public. Out of 155 Chinese companies that listed on Nasdaq since 2000, 40 grossed IPO proceeds below $25 million, according to Refinitiv data.
Small Chinese firms pursue these IPOs because they allow their founders and backers to cash out, rewarding them with U.S. dollars they cannot easily access because of China’s capital controls. The companies also use their Nasdaq-listed status to convince lenders in China to fund them and often get subsidies from Chinese local authorities for becoming publicly traded.
The proposed rules will also require auditing firms to ensure that their international franchises comply with global standards, the sources said. Nasdaq will also inspect the auditing of small U.S. firms that audit the accounts of Chinese IPO hopefuls, the sources added.
U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox Business in an interview last week that he was looking ""very strongly"" at requiring Chinese companies that list in New York to follow U.S. accounting standards. But he noted that ""the problem with that"" was that Chinese companies could decide to list in London or Hong Kong instead.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been locked in a decade-long struggle with the Chinese government to inspect audits of U.S.-listed Chinese companies. The regulator’s accounting oversight arm, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), is still unable to access those critical records, it has said.
The PCAOB, which was set up by the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act and is overseen by the SEC, is tasked with policing the accounting firms that sign off on the books of the nation’s listed companies. Its problems with Chinese audit quality have been festering since 2011, when scores of Chinese companies trading on U.S. exchanges were accused of accounting irregularities.

The SEC is planning to host a roundtable this summer for companies, auditors, advisers and other parties to discuss issues with IPOs of foreign companies and their accounting disclosures, one of the sources said.

Najib’s lawyers are set to continue questioning witnesses after the last session in March was adjourned when his defense team said they may have been exposed to the new coronavirus. Proceedings were then unable to be held as the country imposed lockdown measures that were only eased on May 4.
The trial involves 25 of the total 42 charges he faces for his alleged role in 1MDB, including accusations that he received 2.08 billion ringgit ($478 million) of bribes. He was first charged in July 2018.
Much has happened since the last time the trial was convened. Malaysia recouped an additional $300 million of funds linked to 1MDB as part of U.S. forfeiture lawsuits, amid concern that the return of Najib’s party to the government in March might impede ongoing investigations and efforts to track down assets lost from the troubled state fund.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s government has pledged to continue fighting corruption, even as it was met with backlash after Najib’s stepson Riza Aziz was discharged, not amounting to acquittal, last week from allegations of receiving $248.2 million from 1MDB. The agreement with Riza would see Malaysia recover $107.3 million.
The deal has sparked a dispute between the nation’s current and former top prosecutors over whether ex-Attorney General Tommy Thomas had approved the settlement before resigning in March, which he has denied. “I would have never sanctioned this deal,” Thomas said in a Monday statement.
Opposition leaders said the decision to discharge Riza gave the impression that Malaysia wasn’t serious about battling corruption, they said in a statement on Monday. The case had tarnished the country’s image on the global stage, they added.
Najib himself has repeatedly said he plans to go through the court process to clear his name.

The SEC said the three former KPMG employees violated auditor integrity rules, part of charges against KPMG for which the auditing firm paid a $50 million fine last year. Former KPMG auditors Timothy Daly, Michael Bellach, and John Donovan each engaged in misconduct in relation to exams that the firm used to test that auditors, the agency said in a statement.
In 2018, Bellach texted Daly images of questions and answers to a required training exam, the SEC said. According to the agency, Donovan also received answers to training exams from subordinates on several occasions and shared answers with others at times that year.
Lawyers for each of the individuals charged did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
“These actions reflect our commitment to hold these gatekeepers responsible for breaches of their professional obligations,"" said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division. 
In 2019, KPMG agreed to the penalty to settle allegations of employees' cheating as well as charges that former staffers used stolen information to alter some of the accounting firm's previous audit work.
A KPMG spokesperson said in a statement on Monday: ""We are a stronger firm as a result of the actions we are taking to strengthen our culture, governance and compliance program.""

The former KPMG auditors did not admit or deny the findings, the SEC said. Daly, Bellach, and Donovan agreed to be suspended from appearing or practicing before the SEC as accountants, with the right to apply for reinstatement after three years, two years, and one year, respectively.

The scandal rocked Australia's second-biggest bank after it was accused of millions of breaches of anti-money laundering laws, including allegations that it enabled illegal payments between known child sex offenders.
Les Vance, the current chief operating officer of Westpac's consumer division, has been with the lender since 2008. 
Earlier this month, Westpac admitted it breached anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism laws but denied that it enabled those illegal payments, according to a filing with a federal court.
Chief Executive Officer Peter King said ""Westpac has made significant progress in improving its financial crime capability."" adding that Vance will bring a ""forensic approach"" to the job.
The lender has set aside A$900 million ($586.53 million) for an expected fine in the case, but some analysts expect the fine to be around A$1 billion.

Westpac also said David Lindberg, chief executive of the consumer division, and Chief Information Officer Craig Bright were leaving the bank to take up new roles outside Australia.

TOLEDO, Ohio (Reuters) - Dana Inc (N:DAN), a key supplier of truck parts to Detroit automakers, restarted its Toledo plant Monday on a single shift, with one-third of its 750-person workforce and less than 1% absenteeism, according to plant manager Craig Zimmerly.
""We don't have that vibe of 'too soon.' There may be a little bit of 'okay, the mask is bothering me,'"" said Zimmerly, adding that the usual absentee rate is 2-3%.
The Detroit Three automakers and their suppliers began restarting assembly lines on Monday after a two-month coronavirus lockdown in a slow revival of a sector that employs nearly 1 million people in the United States.
The Toledo plant supplies axles for such popular models as  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles' (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) Jeep Wrangler and Gladiator, and  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) Ranger pickup. Trucks and SUVs are among the auto industry's most profitable vehicles.
Hourly workers at the plant are represented by UAW Local 12, which also represents employees at the nearby FCA Jeep plant.
Assembly technician Brandon Green, 32, of Toledo said he was ""okay"" with the safety precautions put in place at the plant. ""I'm not really nervous. They worked with us pretty well to get us what we need,"" he said.
Among those precautions are staggered entrances and exits for workers, who get thermal temperature checks and are given face masks - although some have opted to wear their own facial coverings, including at least one with an American flag motif. Throughout the plant, yellow Xs remind people where to stand for proper social distancing.
Workers are responsible for cleaning their immediate work areas at the beginning and end of each shift. Overnight, a maintenance crew cleans and disinfects the plant with fogging machines.
The plant's UAW shop chairman, 61-year-old Mark Popovich of Toledo, said, ""We've got a good mood today. Everybody understands that we have to go back to work. It was better than we all thought. You don't hear too many negatives.""

In mid-afternoon trade, Dana shares were up more than 11%.

NIBC said in April it would delay payment of its 0.53 euro ($0.5785) 2019 final dividend amid the coronavirus outbreak, following guidance from the Dutch Central Bank. That prompted Blackstone to warn that the special purpose company it had set up for the intended offer for NIBC might not have sufficient funding to complete the acquisition. Blackstone also said regulatory hang-ups could jeopardize the deal.
""After further discussions NIBC has now committed to ... pay the dividend before settlement, in order to enable the offeror to pay for the offer at 9.32 euros per share,"" the bank said in an after-hours statement.
NIBC shares closed at 6.48 euros on Monday.
Blackstone is due to submit its request to review the proposed deal to Dutch regulators by Tuesday.
U.S. private equity firm JC Flowers, which holds 60.6% of NIBC's stock, and Dutch investment firm Reggeborgh, which owns 14.6%, have agreed to Blackstone's proposed offer.
NIBC said on Monday that as part of the deal JC Flowers and Reggeborgh would waive their right to the 2019 dividend ""until such time that in the opinion of the management and supervisory boards of NIBC, payment is feasible and appropriate in light of the impact of COVID-19 on the business.""

NIBC, which services around 600 small firms and 400,000 retail clients in the Netherlands, made a net profit of 194 million euros last year.

102,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",Fed Sees $500 Billion Muni Backstop Work Even Before Loans Made,"(Bloomberg) -- A Federal Reserve official overseeing the central bank’s $500 billion lending program to states and cities says he’s seeing signs that it’s working -- even before a single loan has been made.
Kent Hiteshew, who was hired by the Fed to work on the program, said Monday that the April announcement of the lending facility has been “positive” for the market even before the central bank has purchased any municipal debt. The mere prospect of such an unprecedented intervention helped halt a liquidity crunch in March that sent prices tumbling by the most on record and raised concern that governments’ ability to raise capital could be cut off.
The Fed will buy short-term debt sold by states and cities to cover cash-flow shortages that the economic shutdowns have created. According to Hiteshew, there are signs the program is creating “positive” impacts already, with new borrowings by issuers being “absorbed” by the market again. AAA municipal bond yields have fallen closer to where they stood before the sell-off began, with 30-year municipals yielding under 1.9% on Monday and the shortest-term debt yielding some 0.3%.
“It appears that there’s significant liquidity available to high-grade issuers in the municipal market today that didn’t exist a month or so ago,” Hiteshew said at a virtual event hosted by the Government Finance Officers Association, in his first public comments on the program. He said the Fed’s lending could start soon.
The Fed’s announcement that it would purchase corporate-bond ETFs also triggered a rally and fueled speculation the central bank might not have to make actual purchases.
Hiteshew’s comments about the muni facility offer a glimpse into how the central bank is viewing current market conditions, which its watching to see if more intervention is needed. But advocacy groups and lawmakers alike have called on the Fed to purchase a broader swath of securities, not just short-term debt as currently planned.
The central bank has also faced criticism about the pricing of its short-term loans, with  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). strategists saying the cost would deter borrowing under the program. Washington Treasurer Duane Davidson said in a statement on Monday that the rates were a “non-starter for the state” and many other highly-rated debt issuers.
But Hiteshew said that the Fed may adjust the pricing if market conditions change materially. The pricing was in line with the Fed designing the program as a “backstop, not a first stop” for issuers, he said. Under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, which allows the Fed to make emergency loans, the Fed is supposed to set rates at a “premium to the market rate,” according to a 2015 rule.
Hiteshew also pointed to an $800 million bond offering last week by Illinois, the lowest-rated state, as an example of the Fed’s impact. He said the Illinois deal benefited from the release of the pricing details because it gave investors more confidence that the state would have access to liquidity if needed.
Hiteshew said the program would be considered a success if governments are able to secure liquidity through banks or through the Fed’s program. He also pointed to comments by Fed chairman Jerome Powell that more fiscal policy may be needed to compliment the Fed’s actions. Congress is considering providing more aid to states and cities to cover their revenue shortfalls as part of another stimulus measure.
“The last thing we want to see is have state and local government balance sheets loaded up with deficit financing that can hinder their ability to provide the essential services and infrastructure financing that we as a nation depend on,” he said.

103,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>","As flying returns, jetmakers seek to quell fears over cabin air","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Jet manufacturers and airlines are launching an urgent initiative to convince nervous travelers that the air they breathe on planes is safe, believing this is critical to rebuilding a travel industry floored by the novel coronavirus. 
Boeing (NYSE:BA) has appointed former engineering and development chief Mike Delaney to head wider efforts to build confidence, and Airbus leaders say the industry is moving from an initial crisis phase to securing public trust.
That has triggered, among other things, a concerted effort to explain how cabin air filtration works in a bid to scotch the myth that the pressurised fuselage contains only static or recycled air.
Health officials are still quantifying various sources of transmission for COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, but attention focuses on the risk of catching it from airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing passengers as well as from touching infected surfaces.
The air-travel industry historically talks more about seat pitch than air quality. That's had to change as a result of the pandemic. 
""It's about explaining what we do for the safety of passengers in the large sense: aircraft safety but also sanitary safety,"" Airbus engineering head Jean-Brice Dumont said.
In an office building, air is exchanged about four times every hour. On a modern jet aircraft, that rises to 20 to 30 times.
""The air system on an airplane is as good as anything you will be exposed to,"" Delaney said. Air circulation is only one of several techniques for reducing potential for the virus to spread on board including rigorous cleaning of the plane and screening passengers for signs of illness, he added.
In most cases compressed air is fed from the clean part of an engine - untainted by fuel which is added later - to air conditioning packs and from there to fans in the cabin ceiling.
Both planemakers say cabin air pours downwards not lengthways through the fuselage, reducing risks of infection. 
Half that air is then recycled through hospital-grade HEPA filters designed to remove some 99.97% of contaminants including viruses. The other half is flushed outside through valves.
Planemakers say cabin air is renewed every two to three minutes, though scientists caution that in reality, air is always a blend. But the quicker the rate, the faster old air is diluted.
""The air turns over very, very quickly in the aircraft in terms of air-exchange rate. From that point of view the aircraft systems are very good,"" said Professor Byron Jones of Kansas State University, who has helped recommend air standards.
HIGH OCCUPANCY
But air flow isn't the only part of a complex equation.
""The biggest challenge you have on an aircraft is the extremely high occupant density. You have got a lot of people crammed into a small space, and you have to get a lot of air in there to ventilate that space to maintain the air quality,"" Jones said.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus is thought to spread between people in close contact or less than 6 feet apart, around half the width of many cabins. 
Air currents over such short distances are said to be hardest to predict. Passengers have some control through the individual air outlets nicknamed ""gaspers"" above each seat. 
On average, twisting them on makes things ""a little bit better, but there is no guarantee,"" Jones said. 
Although filtered, the pinpoint blasts of air could in a worst case push nearby virus particles across a passenger's face. On the other hand, the air shower could have the positive effect of limiting sideways movements of air.
Faced with such questions, Boeing and Airbus have deployed engineers to examine seat-to-seat air flows - using the same advanced physics at play in wind-tunnel testing of a wing.
""We are actively running simulations to see whether we could recommend something for the individual air jets, "" Dumont said.
The spectre of in-flight contamination dates back at least to the SARS epidemic in 2003, though no link has been proved.
In March that year, a 72-year-old man infected with SARS, which is also a coronavirus, took a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing. At least 22 of the 119 passengers and two crew later developed the illness.
It was the only significant case of in-flight transmission but prompted measures to prevent ill passengers boarding planes. 

Such ""kerb-to-kerb"" measures must again be part of the strategy to keep the new virus off planes, Delaney said. Research on technology like ultraviolet-cleaning systems and anti-microbial materials may join the fight in the future.

The stock is ripe for a short squeeze, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.
Short bets against the biotech firm have been growing since February even as the stock continued to scale new heights on optimism it may get regulatory authorization for one of the first vaccines during the global pandemic. Bears gambling against Moderna lost about $427 million Monday alone and more than $900 million so far this month, Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3’s managing director of predictive analytics, said in an email.
The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company has continued to rally despite potential safety concerns around the highest doses of its experimental vaccine. Moderna published results from a handful of patients that many were expecting to come from the government itself after the company received more than $400 million in federal funds to develop the vaccine.
Moderna’s nearly $30 billion valuation, mainly driven by speculation on the company’s prospects in Covid-19, is giving some hedge funds pause, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analyst Asad Haider wrote in a note dated late Friday before Moderna’s results were made public.
Specialists might be even more cautious Monday after the results showed three patients at the highest dose had severe adverse events -- a clinical term for a negative reaction that may or may not be drug related. While none of those events were life threatening, a broadly used vaccine will need to appear very safe if it’s to be given widely to healthy individuals.
‘Many Offsides’
Moderna plans to move forward with lower doses in the next step of testing. Manufacturing constraints will also be an issue for any vaccine developer as a global pandemic implies billions of people may eventually be looking for an inoculation.
Momentum among some small- to mid-cap biotechs “still seems to be catching many offsides,” Haider said. The news cycle has been “quick to trigger painful squeezes” he said, highlighting Allogene Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ALLO) Inc.’s 43% surge last week after positive results for its cell therapy, as well as  Sarepta  Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SRPT) Inc.’s 11% jump on Friday after disappointing gene therapy results from a major competitor.
More than $1.6 billion in shares of Sarepta and Moderna are sold short, along with about $590 million for Allogene, according to S3 data. All three are among names Dusaniwsky sees as primed for a squeeze after large mark-to-market losses this month.
Short sellers have also targeted  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD). and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN)., which have been rallying on speculation about Covid-19 treatments and are among the top ten biggest shorts in biotech.
As investors look to biotech, not only to quash Covid-19 but as shelter from a roiled stock market, short sellers in the sector “have not fared well,” Dusaniwsky said. Bearish gamblers had lost $2.81 billion through Sunday, on $48.6 billion in average short interest, according to S3 data.

Investors over the past seven months have pumped at least $6 billion into more than two dozen companies involved in autonomous delivery of goods and food, from drones to heavy trucks, according to a Reuters analysis. 
The bulk of that investment - more than $4 billion since January - has flowed to big, late-stage companies such as Waymo and Didi Chuxing that are automating both ride and delivery services. 
Automated sidewalk delivery robots have drawn lots of ink, but little recent investment. Still, more and more cities and companies are trying them out.
Christopher Bruno, head of the Fairfax, Virginia, economic development office, rushed to get Starship sidewalk robots on the street as soon as the coronavirus pandemic shut down the city. 
“I think without a crisis, there would have been some skepticism as to whether this would have been used or not,” Bruno said. Formal approval for new businesses usually takes six to 10 months, he said, but “we did it in a week and a half.” Now 20 robots in Fairfax are delivering meals, groceries, and hair products.
Early-stage investors are favoring heavy truck automation startups and companies that bundle hardware and software into a ""full stack.""
Autonomous trucking company TuSimple, which touts UPS as an investor, raised $215 million in September, bringing its valuation to over $1.2 billion, and is planning a new round of fundraising this year.
Some investors caution that pandemic-driven headlines are inflating expectations around automated delivery, which still faces technical and regulatory challenges.
“While there’s increased hype around automated delivery right now due to coronavirus, this health crisis will be mostly resolved in a few years from now before automated on-road delivery is ready for mass adoption,” said Quin Garcia, managing director of Autotech Ventures, an early investor in  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) who is focusing his investments more on autonomous vehicles used in warehouses and on private land for farming and mining.
Still, automated delivery startups are trying to take advantage of a moment when the idea of human-free delivery is getting attention.
Refraction AI, an automated delivery startup in Ann Arbor, Michigan; Kiwibot, a sidewalk robot startup in Berkeley, California; self-driving tech company Optimus Ride in Boston; and Ireland-based Manna Drone Delivery are raising money as demand for their delivery services has jumped.
Phantom Auto, which provides software to remotely control delivery robots for Postmates and others, has seen demand jump and expects to raise more funds this year.

The pandemic spurred “a practical need to provide some much needed food and package delivery services,” said Pony.ai CEO and founder James Peng, whose cars tested out food and grocery delivery services for the first time in California with the pandemic. The company received a $462-million investment in February led by  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, valuing the startup at more than $3 billion.

Investing.com - The Dow on Monday racked up its biggest one-day rally in more than a month, as news of progress on a potential Covid-19 vaccine and hopes of further central bank stimulus pushed stocks higher.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.85%, or 911 points, the biggest one-day gain since Apr. 6. The S&P 500 gained 3.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 2.44%.
 Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said early-stage clinical results suggested its vaccine has a ""high probability"" to provide protection from coronavirus disease, sending its share 19.8% higher.
The positive update from Moderna bolstered investor hopes that a vaccine may be found sooner rather later, strengthening expectations for a quicker economic recovery at a time many countries continue efforts to reopen their economies.  
Travel and tourism sectors, which have been hit hard by the pandemic, were up sharply, led by cruise companies, hotels, and airlines.
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR), MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) and Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH) were among the biggest movers, with the latter up about 18%.
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER), meanwhile, was also in rally mode, up 3.6%, as the ride-sharing company announced that it would cut 3,000 jobs and focus on its core ride-hailing and food delivery businesses as it continues on its path toward profitability.

109,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 03:54PM ET</span>",Hedge Fund That Timed Big Short and Crypto Rally Eyes Venezuela,"(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela’s bond market has been rocked over the past few years by defaults, sanctions and a collapse in crude oil prices. Yet the disastrous cocktail is attracting hedge funds including London’s Altana Wealth Ltd. that say the situation can’t get any worse.
Altana is pitching the South American nation’s government notes, which can be bought at pennies on the dollar, as the “trade of the new decade,” according to two letters to investors seen by Bloomberg.
In one of the letters, founder Lee Robinson said he plans to launch a Cayman Islands-based portfolio next month to capitalize on Venezuelan bond prices that he says could eventually multiply tenfold. He compared the risk-reward to returns delivered during the dot-com craze of the 1990s, shorting sub-prime mortgages before the collapse of that market in 2008 and riding the cryptocurrency rally in recent years.
“At these levels, the downside is low and the upside is the best we’ve ever seen for a sovereign debt restructuring,” Robinson and his colleague Steffen Dietel wrote in one of the letters.
Robinson, Dietel and a spokesman at Altana declined to comment.
Robinson, who previously worked for hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones, has a track record with opportunistic wagers. In 2014, he started a digital currency fund, which rode a rally in Bitcoin to four-digit returns.
Only a small pool of investors have both the patience and the legal ability to make the trade. Sanctions imposed by the Trump administration last year prevent U.S. funds from buying Venezuelan debt. That means firms from Europe to Latin America and the Middle East are the primary buyers, oftentimes through vehicles domiciled in the Cayman Islands for tax purposes.
Hedge Funds Buy Up Venezuela’s Sanctioned Debt After Record Drop
The nation’s dollar bonds due in 2027 fetch 6 cents, while state-run Petroleos de Venezuela’s notes due in 2020 trade at 12 cents. Those prices can’t drop much lower. The risk for investors is how long they’ll wait for a restructuring as the country careens toward its eighth straight year in recession and grapples with hyperinflation, sanctions and declining crude exports.
Venezuela’s situation is complicated further by its political crisis. Nicolas Maduro’s regime has access to most accounts in Caracas, yet U.S. courts recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as the head of state.
In one of its letters, Robinson’s fund said it hired legal advisers to file claims in court to protect against statute of limitations. The firm’s thinking is that U.S. restrictions on the bonds, which drove last year’s steep decline, will eventually be lifted and the recovery value on the debt in a restructuring far exceeds market prices, according to the letters.
‘Five-Year Investment’
Altana isn’t alone in taking a closer look at Venezuela’s bonds.
Francisco Ghersi and Carmelo Haddad, who oversee Knossos Asset Management, made a name for themselves with their big bets on the nation’s debt. But after the government defaulted in late 2017, the Caracas natives diverted their attention to other high-yield Latin American notes from Argentina to Ecuador.
Now, they’re looking to buy a mix of Venezuelan bonds and stocks. Their thinking is that one day -- be that months or years away -- a market-friendly leader will return to power in Caracas.
“It’s a five-year investment,” Ghersi said. “It’s a bet that in the long run something will happen and the prices are good enough to put some money to work.”

111,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>","Brazil, Now Fastest Growing Virus Hotspot, Is Only Getting Worse","(Bloomberg) -- Brazil is now the world’s fastest-growing coronavirus hotspot, accounting for 13% of all new cases globally in the past week.
Just days after it overtook Italy and Spain in total number of cases, the Latin American nation is poised to claim the No. 3 spot from the U.K. and is quickly catching up to Russia, which trails only the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
For health professionals and long-time Brazil watchers, the brushfire spread of the deadly respiratory illness is aggravating in its predictability. The country’s public health system, an emerging market with 210 million people, was already underfunded and under strain well before the pandemic raced around the globe.
But a quickly deteriorating political crisis and infighting among federal and state officials, as well as in President Jair Bolsonaro’s own cabinet, leave the nation without a comprehensive strategy to slow the spread. Social distancing measures vary from state to state -- even city to city -- as local leaders take charge of implementing their own quarantines and lockdowns.
On Friday, Health Minister Nelson Teich quit after less than a month on the job, just as Brazil had a record 17,126 new cases, according to the tally from Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins University. More than 16,000 people have died so far.
“Three health ministers in less than a month; fewer than 3,500 tests per million people; no clear federal guidance on how to deal with the pandemic; and varied, uncoordinated containment policies,” Alejo Czerwonko, an emerging markets strategist for UBS Financial Services, wrote in a note to clients. “It’s no surprise that Brazil” is a new epicenter, he added.
Emerging markets now account for the five fastest growing coronavirus hotspots, with Brazil leading the pack followed by India and Saudi Arabia. Daily new cases grew 5.5% on average in the past week to 241,080 infections as of Sunday. That compares with a growth rate of 4.1% in Russia. In the U.S., home to the biggest outbreak by far with 1.49 million total cases, new infections are growing on average about 1.6% daily.
Catching Up
Bolsonaro told allies over the weekend he’s in no rush to pick a new health chief and may leave the interim minister on the job until he finds the right replacement, newspaper Folha de S.Paulo reported on Monday. Acting Minister Eduardo Pazuello, who is a military general and not a doctor, is expected to expand the use of chloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients, the key demand from the president that prompted Teich’s departure, the newspaper said. Bolsonaro fired his previous health minister in April amid conflicts over social distancing guidelines.
Sao Paulo, the hardest-hit state, may move forward holidays, essentially shutting the city between Wednesday and next Monday in a bid to slow the spread and give the health system time to cope, Governor Joao Doria and Mayor Bruno Covas said in a press conference Monday.
Thomaz Favaro, a political analyst at Control Risks, said that while it’s normal to see some level of discord among federal and local governments in the region, “nothing compares to the level of chaos we’re seeing in Brazil.”
“The way they’re out of sync reduces the impact of measures,” he said. “Communication is the main tool governments have to fight the pandemic, and with so many different messages, it reduces the power of social isolation and creates a fertile landscape for fake news and conspiracy theories.”
As of Sunday evening, Brazil trailed the U.K. in total number of cases by just 2,615 infections. With a growth rate that’s more than twice as fast, the Latin American nation is due to overtake the U.K. on Monday.
A Bigger Share
With cases rising faster than anywhere else, the outbreak is expected to get much worse in Latin America’s largest economy. While lockdowns around the world have proven effective in flattening the curve, Brazil’s scatter-shot approach to quarantines means it’s accounting for a bigger and bigger share of new global cases. On average, more than one in 10 new infections worldwide can now be traced to the country, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Investors have seized on the political turmoil and spreading pandemic as reason to bail on Brazil stocks, bonds and the currency. The benchmark Ibovespa equity index has posted the world’s biggest drop this year, with a 51% decline in dollar terms. The real is also the worst performer among major currencies, losing about a third of its value.

Investing.com – Nvidia climbed on Monday as one analyst bet the chipmaker's shares are set to rally as much as 20% on the back of a pick-up data center demand and launch of new products.
NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 3%.
BMO upgraded its rating on Nvidia to outperform from market perform and raised its price target on the stock to $425 from $285, indicating about 20% upside from current prices.
""While there is no one single event we can point to which has led us to change our thinking, the continued execution on the data center side, along with the latest product rollout, has helped,"" BMO said.
The positive update comes just a week after the company, at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC), provided numerous updates and unveiled its new graphics architecture, Ampere, which succeeded Volta, the GPU architecture that supported a variety of artificial intelligence accelerators in the data center and the cloud.

113,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 02:50PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs: Brazil, Turkey vulnerable to local debt splurge","LONDON (Reuters) - Brazil, Turkey and some frontier markets face the biggest risk from a possible surge in local sovereign debt issuance as developing governments ramp up spending to tackle the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said on Monday.
Developing economies' assets were especially hard hit by a deep market sell-off in March and face rising borrowing costs.
That makes it more challenging for them to fund a stimulus spree on the scale of those by major governments, with interest rates near record lows, that are pumping trillions into their ailing economies.
How well-placed local debt markets across developing nations are to absorb heavy government debt issuance depends on factors such as domestic pension funds and insurance companies, the presence of local commercial banks and the buying power of central banks, Goldman Sachs said in a note.
""A key question is whether local markets are equipped to absorb the additional issuance if foreign portfolio investment is constrained or whether this will cause further increases in bond premia and renewed upward pressure on yields,"" Goldman Sachs' Kamakshya Trivedi wrote.
Brazil faced a ""medium-to-high risk"" from a potential surge in local government debt, he said. 
""Although local markets are liquid relative to peers, it is highly likely that the local banking sector (both commercial banks and the central bank) will eventually have to increase their purchases to counterbalance the high bond supply and the foreign outflows driven by the low FX (forex) carry,"" Trivedi said. 
Over the medium to long term, risks could escalate without meaningful fiscal adjustments, he said, adding the weakness of the currency over the last few months was a warning of domestic investors' low confidence in local assets.
Brazil's real  has been the worst performer among emerging markets. The currency has weakened by around 30% against the U.S. dollar since the start of the year. 
Frontier markets - a subset of smaller and riskier emerging economies - faced a high risk from any local sovereign debt surge because of their relatively small number of institutional investors, relatively small banking sectors and because their central banks need to preserve foreign asset buffers to prevent pressures on the currencies.
The lack of a private sector counterweight to mop up a possible debt splurge means support from the official sector was likely to be inevitable, Trivedi said, adding he would also put Turkey in this group.
Turkey's lira  fell to fresh record lows in early May although it has recovered since. Still, since the start of the year it has lost 14% against the dollar.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's Growthpoint Properties (J:GRTJ) said on Monday it had provided rent relief to 1,494 small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) hit by a lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic. 
President Cyril Ramaphosa imposed a 21-day lockdown from March 26, that was later extended to the end of April. 
This prompted property owners and tenants to work together, under government guidelines, to defer rent payments and find other solutions that allow shops, businesses and landlords to ride out the shutdown, which was partially lifted on May 1.
A halt in payments, however, has raised questions over whether landlords will be able to meet their own debt commitments.
Growthpoint - which owns the V&A Waterfront, home to several corporate head offices, industries, hotels, shops and restaurants - is still finalising rent relief for medium, large and listed tenants for April 2020, it said in a statement.
In April, excluding the V&A, it provided 99.2 million rand ($5.38 million) of rent relief for South African retail, office, industrial and healthcare tenants, while in May it provided 100.8 million rand in relief.
At the V&A, rent discounts totalling 19 million rand were granted for April and about 7 million rand for May, mainly to retailers. 
Growthpoint said it had rejected a proposal from the top five fashion retailers - TFG (J:TFGJ), Truworths (J:TRUJ),  Mr Price  Group (J:MRPJ), Woolworths (J:WHLJ) and Pepkor (J:PPHJ) - to pay only 20% of rates and rental for April 2020.
Together with the Property Industry Group, Growthpoint has approached the government to mediate, it added.
Growthpoint, which also owns Brooklyn Mall in Pretoria, said it had secured a 750 million rand bank loan for three years, and was in the final stages of negotiating a further 900 million rand, also for three years.
After non-food department chain operator Edcon entered business rescue, a form of bankruptcy protection, late in April, Growthpoint is investigating options to sub-divide space occupied by Edcon's Edgars stores and introduce a second supermarket anchor tenant, where possible, it said.
""In the interim, the entire industry has received an offer from the business rescue practitioner to pay only turnover rental for the next few months, which we are evaluating,"" it added, referring to rent calculated on a tenant's retail sales.
Growthpoint's exposure to Edcon, after the sale of stationery retailer CNA, is 88,000 square meters.
Landlords hurt by the demise in 2017 of South Africa's oldest department chain, Stuttafords, have been looking at ways to minimise exposure to Edcon to prevent huge losses in income.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil recorded a $19.7 billion maritime trade surplus in the first four months of the year as imports by value fell as the real currency weakened and exports of agriculture goods remained strong, a port operators group said on Monday.
The surplus is 14.56% wider than in the same period of 2019 despite the crisis caused by the novel coronavirus, which has disrupted transport systems worldwide, said ATP, which represents Brazilian private-sector terminal operators including miner Vale (SA:VALE3) and grain merchant  Bunge  (N:BG).
The widened surplus reflects the fact that Brazilian ports have operated regularly amid the pandemic, ATP said in a statement. The result comes amid a 30% drop in maritime freight prices following the global oil rout, ATP President Murillo Barbosa said in a separate statement.
Brazil's growing maritime trade surplus underscores the strength of the country's farm sector, which exported higher amounts of goods like soybeans in March and April driven by strong Chinese demand.
Brazil shipped some 36 million tonnes of the oilseeds through April, according to data from maritime agency Cargonave on Brazil's top export commodity. This corresponds to half of the volume of soy the country sold in the whole of 2019, Cargonave data show.
ATP said the maritime trade balance calculation involves only cargo moved by sea, largely mineral and agriculture commodities. 
By value, Brazilian maritime imports dropped by almost 7% from January to April, compared to the same period a year ago, while maritime exports were virtually stable at $56.75 billion, ATP said, based on government data.
By volume, Brazil's maritime exports were also relatively stable at 195.6 million tonnes while imports increased 1.09% in the first four months of 2020, ATP said, also using official trade data. 
The rise in imported volumes was mainly driven by a rise in fertilizer purchases as fertilizer prices drop, according a proprietary ATP analysis.

PARIS (Reuters) - Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s French warehouses are set to reopen on Tuesday with about 30% of employees, three union officials said, ending a month-long dispute over whether the e-commerce giant was doing enough to protect workers from the coronavirus pandemic. 
The U.S. retailer's six French warehouses have been closed since a court backed union complaints, and ordered Amazon to restrict deliveries to essential items during the pandemic or face hefty fines.
The 10,600 permanent and temporary staff employed at the warehouses will progressively return to work by June 2, according to an agreement signed by five French unions last week and seen by Reuters. 
During a first phase, starting on Tuesday and ending next Monday, a maximum of 50% of staff will be allowed to work, on a voluntary basis. As of Monday afternoon, about 30% of workers had volunteered to resume work on Tuesday, the three union officials said. 
A spokeswoman for Amazon declined to comment on the number of employees set to return to work on Tuesday. 
""What we're interested in is that we can start over on a sound and sustainable basis,"" she said.
Under the deal, voluntary workers will get a bonus of 2 euros per hour until June 2. During that same period, employees who stay at home will still receive their full salary. 
Amazon also agreed to reduce the working day by 15 minutes. That will create a delay of about 30 minutes between the morning and night shifts, reducing numbers in changing rooms and at entrance gates. 
The agreement also lifts restrictions on what kind of products Amazon can send to clients across France. 
The court had ruled Amazon should restrict deliveries to IT products, health items, food and pet food while the company reviewed its coronavirus-related health policies. 
An external firm, Progexa, has been hired to review the health measures implemented by Amazon, the agreement said. 
""We've buried the hatchet,"" said SUD union leader Laurent Degousée, who led the lawsuit against Amazon.

However, Amazon said the deal made no fundamental changes to the measures it had already put in place when it decided to close its warehouses on April 16.

123,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Joseph Stiglitz Sees Risk of Persistent Double-Digit U.S. Unemployment,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. will be stuck with double-digit unemployment for an extended period without more and better-targeted government support for the coronavirus-battered economy, Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz said.
“We are going towards an unemployment rate of at least 25%,” he told Bloomberg Television on Monday. While joblessness may fall a bit as businesses reopen after the lockdown, “we won’t be back anywhere near to what we would normally say is a terrible level of, say, 10% to 12%” unless more government aid is forthcoming.
The jobless rate more than tripled in April to 14.7% as employers cut an unprecedented 20.5 million jobs. A further rise is expected this month.
Stiglitz called the almost $3 trillion in economic help Congress already passed “poorly designed.” He contrasted it with smaller packages abroad that were more focused on keeping workers on company payrolls as governments shut down economic activity to contain the contagion.
The Democratic Party-controlled House of Representatives last week passed an additional $3 trillion economic-stimulus bill that Republicans and President Donald Trump already have rejected. The House measure would give cash-strapped states and local governments more than $1 trillion, while providing most Americans with a new round of $1,200 checks.
“What worries me is that many people in the Republican Party have said go slow” on stimulus, the Columbia University professor said.
Barring quick development of a vaccine -– which Stiglitz views as a low probability -– the government will have to continue providing support to the economy during the next 24 months to make up for the hit to demand from uncertainty about the course of the deadly virus, he said.

124,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",First COVID-19 vaccine tested in the U.S. shows promise in data from eight people,"By Julie Steenhuysen and Saumya Joseph
(Reuters) - Early data from  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc's COVID-19 vaccine, the first to be tested in the United States, showed that it produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers, the company said on Monday. 
The data comes from eight people who took part in a 45-subject safety trial that kicked off in March. The Moderna vaccine is one of more than 100 under development intended to protect against the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 4.7 million people globally and killed over 315,000.
Overall, the study showed the vaccine was safe and all study participants produced antibodies against the virus.
An analysis of the response in the eight individuals showed that those who received a 100 microgram dose and a 25 microgram dose had levels of protective antibodies to fend of the virus that exceeded those found in the blood of people who recovered from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.
The news, issued in a release by the U.S. biotechnology company, lifted shares of Moderna more than 22% and helped drive the broader stock market higher.
""These are significant findings but it is a Phase 1 clinical trial that only included eight people. It was designed for safety. Not for efficacy,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, in infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security who was not involved in the study.
The very early data offers a glimmer of hope for a vaccine among the most advanced in development.
Adalja said many glitches can occur between now and the time this vaccine is tested for efficacy in thousands of people. ""What we do see is encouraging,"" he said. 
Scientists are trying to understand what level of antibodies will ultimately prove protective against the novel coronavirus, and how long that protection will last.
Moderna said the vaccine appeared to show a dose response, meaning that people who the 100 mcg dose produced more antibodies than people who got the lower dose. 
The vaccine has gotten the green light to start the second stage of human testing. Last week, U.S. regulators gave the vaccine ""fast-track"" status to speed up the regulatory review.
In the Phase II, or midstage, trial designed to further test effectiveness and find the optimal dose, Moderna said it will drop plans to test a 250 mcg dose and test a 50 mcg dose instead.
Reducing the dose required to produce immunity could help spare the amount of vaccine required in each shot, meaning the company could ultimately produce more of the vaccine.
MAXIMIZING NUMBER OF DOSES
""In the context of a pandemic, we expect demand to far outstrip supply and the lower the dose the more people we expect to be able to protect,"" said Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks.
The U.S. government in April placed a big bet on Moderna, backing its vaccine with $483 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
The company said that grant will enable it to supply millions of doses per month in 2020 and, with further investments, tens of million a month in 2021 if the vaccine proves successful.
In May, Moderna stuck a 10-year strategic collaboration with Lonza Group that over time will allow the manufacture of up to 1 billion doses a year.
""We are investing to scale up manufacturing so we can maximize the number of doses we can produce to help protect as many people as we can from SARS-CoV-2,"" Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stéphane Bancel said, using the official name for the new virus.
Moderna said it expects to start a larger late-stage, or Phase III, trial in July.
There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, and experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop. 
The most notable side effects reported from the early testing of Moderna's vaccine were three participants with “flu-like” symptoms following a second shot of the highest dose. The company said it believed the symptoms were an indirect measure of a strong immune response.

127,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",Walmart trailed supermarkets amid peak panic-buying: data,"By Reade Levinson and Melissa Fares
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans increased their visits to supermarkets far more than to Walmart Inc (N:WMT) stores as panic-buying peaked in mid-March, a Reuters analysis of foot traffic to retailers in the United States shows.
Yet by early May, visits to Walmart had rebounded and were outpacing visits to supermarkets, according to the analysis.
The data offers a snapshot of some of the dramatic changes in Americans' shopping patterns in the weeks before and after the United States implemented lockdowns intended to curb the spread of coronavirus.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart gets more than half its U.S. revenue from grocery sales. The retailer on Tuesday will report its first-quarter revenue and earnings, providing a look at how it fared as COVID-19 hit a growing number of states.
Reuters compared foot traffic observed by SafeGraph from the first week of March through early May. SafeGraph compiles anonymized location data from mobile devices and compares it with building footprints to measure traffic. The number of mobile devices recorded by SafeGraph fluctuates, so Reuters adjusted the data based on the number of devices SafeGraph reported each day.
""During panic buying time, it was 'I want to get my groceries, and that's all I want to do. I want to do it safely, I want to get in and out,'"" said Randy Hare, portfolio manager at Huntington Private Bank, which owns shares of Walmart, Costco Wholesale Corp (O:COST) and others. Some shoppers might have concluded that ""Walmart is one of the worst places for lines,"" he said.
Walmart declined to comment.
Walmart saw an 18% increase in foot traffic from March 13 to March 17 compared to the first week of March, Reuters found. That's about half the 37% increase at supermarkets and other grocery stores during the same time period, when consumers stocked up on goods in advance of coronavirus lockdowns implemented around the United States.
During the same period,  Target  Corp (N:TGT) saw a 14% rise in foot traffic, less than half the increase at grocery stores. Major dollar store chains saw a 26% increase in foot traffic.
A Target spokeswoman referenced an April 23 press release, which said the company experienced a ""surge in traffic and sales"" in mid-March followed by a decline in in-store sales as ""guests across the country began to shelter in place"" and turned to online orders. She declined further comment.
(For a graphic, see: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/gjnvwedewvw/index.html)
After that initial surge in visitors, traffic to Walmart and other big box and grocery stores fell in late March and early April, Reuters found. Walmart lost more traffic than most supermarkets, but it still performed better than Target and Amazon.com Inc's Whole Foods (O:AMZN), which saw traffic drop by 26% and 33%, respectively, during the first two weeks of April.
An Amazon spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment.
Walmart has announced that stores would allow no more than five customers per 1,000 square feet, or roughly 20 percent of store capacity. Despite this, as of May 6, foot traffic to Walmart stores had rebounded and was up 16% compared to the first week of March.
""They've made a lot of investments in grocery and they did it at the right time,"" said Huntington's Hare, highlighting Walmart's plans to have more than 2,000 stores where they can deliver groceries within two hours. ""If COVID would have happened two years ago, they wouldn't have been ready.""
The SafeGraph data does not include transaction size, and it is possible that some shoppers made fewer trips but purchased more items per trip. The foot-traffic data also includes traffic by retail employees and gig workers fulfilling shoppers’ orders placed online.

Analysts have forecast Walmart will post its best quarterly sales in at least three years on Tuesday, but that is likely to come at the cost of profits as the retailer, much like Amazon, has invested millions to tackle the pandemic.

128,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",A Trade Deal ‘Born to Die’: China Outflows Highest in Four Years,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders have fled China-focused equity funds at the fastest pace in at least four years on the heels of renewed Sino-American tensions.
As Wall Street weighed the latest dramas between the world’s two largest economies last week, investors pulled $330 million from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK).’s iShares China Large-Cap fund, the most since 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
All in, money managers divested $2.7 billion from Chinese stocks in the five days to May 13, the most since at least 2016, according to  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). That brings the four-week total to $6.2 billion, outpacing emerging-market counterparts.
While pandemic-lashed investors are cheering any signs of a rebound in Asian investment and consumption, the geopolitical backdrop is darkening.
In the latest salvo, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested that Beijing sent airline passengers to spread the infection worldwide. The missive follows reports last week that the White House planned to block Huawei Technologies Co. from global chip suppliers.
“Tensions with U.S. spurring equity outflow,” Goldman FX strategists including Zach Pandl wrote in a note. “At this point we have not built higher tariffs or other aggressive action (e.g. potential delisting of Chinese firms on U.S. exchanges) into our baseline forecasts.”
Overall market participants in recent weeks have focused squarely on positive data signaling how China is bouncing back from the pandemic. The country’s industrial output increased in April for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak, adding to early signs of a recovery that economists cautioned would be slow and challenging.
Global stocks have rallied more than 25% from March lows on soothing actions from central banks coupled with signs that the lockdown is easing across major economies. The question now is how much credence should investors give to the recent jawboning between the two powers.
Wild Cards
“It is one of the biggest wild cards in the 2020 outlook; the main uncertainty is whether the confrontation will be mainly rhetorical or evolve into concrete actions,” JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategists including Haibin Zhu wrote in a note. “But it is clear that the bilateral confrontation will expand beyond trade into other areas, including technology, finance, and geopolitical issues.”
At TD Securities, strategists led by Mark McCormick (NYSE:MKC) suggest a “rise in rhetoric” even without concrete actions would likely be enough to “spook markets” given the fragility of the economic backdrop.
Meanwhile at Nordea Bank ABP, Andreas Steno Larsen and Joachim Bernhardsen are telling clients to go long the dollar against Chinese currency risk as a high-conviction call, citing the breakdown in economic relations.
“The trade deal was always ‘born to die’,” the strategists wrote in a note. “But no one had an incentive to reveal it until after the U.S. election. The coronavirus has offered the Trump administration an opportunistic chance to opt for China bashing instead.”
Still, one widespread view maintains that President Donald Trump can scant afford to alienate his Asian counterparts given their mutual interest in combating both the virus and the global downturn -- clearing the path for cross-asset bulls.
“There is co-dependency there which reduces a chance of a big fallout at this stage,” said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors.
All the same, Wall Street strategists recommend cross-asset hedges while they’re cheap.
At Susquehanna, Chris Murphy points out that the 30-day implied volatility for the BlackRock ETF, ticker FXI, has been trading largely in line with its American counterpart, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust. Yet the market calm looks potentially unsustainable -- a backdrop that has previously rewarded options traders using the popular ETF to hedge trade-war risk.
“Given China’s dependence on trade as nations look to rebuild supply chains from within, combined with risk of increased tensions with the U.S. and a potential for reinstatement of tariffs, I think volatility is too low (especially compared to SPY (NYSE:SPY)),” the derivatives strategist wrote in a recent note.

Global airlines have suffered an unprecedented decline in travel due to the pandemic, though some recent indicators show that U.S. demand may have hit a low.
The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened 250,467 travelers on Friday, the first time the number has surpassed 250,000 since March 24, according to daily data on its website.
While that is far below the 2.66 million passengers screened on the same day last year, it is significantly more than the mid-April low of 87,534.
Delta is adding roughly 100 more daily flights in June versus May, including service out of its Atlanta hub and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Florida, even as its overall second-quarter schedule is expected to be 85% smaller than last year.

The Atlanta-based carrier also hopes to resume passenger flights for Seattle-Shanghai in June, pending Chinese government approval.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) CEO Masayoshi Son on Monday pinned his hopes on a small group of ""winged unicorns"" to save the performance of his $100 billion Vision Fund - although he gave few clues on which ones they would be.
Announcing a record annual loss for his tech conglomerate, and an $18 billion shortfall at the Saudi-backed Vision Fund, Son told an earnings presentation on Monday that tech unicorns had plunged into the ""valley of the coronavirus"".
But he said a smaller number of the tech companies would make it and could eventually account for 90% of the value of the portfolio.
He showed a slide where cartoon unicorns were falling down a hole as a lone winged unicorn flew to safety on the other side.
The 62-year-old businessman offered few clues as to which of the fund's 88 portfolio companies would eventually succeed.
Son said winners from the current crisis included companies in food delivery, online medical services, video streaming and online shopping. Overall, the pandemic has been a disaster for the fund.
""If Son had a good idea of what these companies are he would have singled them out,"" said Amir Anvarzadeh, market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors. 
SoftBank has limited exposure to areas like online education and streaming, with TikTok parent Bytedance one notable exception. In food delivery, there has been demand from locked-down consumers but vendors also have faced disruptions, including being forced to shut down. 
Uber (N:UBER) and similar portfolio companies have been hammered by a slump in their core ride-hailing business.
Online medical services, such as Ping An Healthcare and Technology (HK:1833), have seen an upswing, although questions remain over the broader application of this type of healthcare technology. 
Son's thesis that a small number of hits can make up for other failures is typically applied to early-stage investment, because there's greater potential upside.
But the Vision Fund has focused on late-stage startups, meaning there may be less uplift.
ISOLATED EMPIRE
Son's business empire is ""becoming increasingly isolated,"" Mio Kato, analyst at LightStream Research wrote in a note on the Smartkarma platform.
Long-time ally Jack Ma is exiting SoftBank's board and Son, under pressure from U.S. activist fund Elliott Management, has been forced to sell down his  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) stake to fund share buybacks.
SoftBank has also been unable to secure further cash from the Vision Fund's big backers like Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund due to poor performance. 
Without more funds ""Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) can't raise its mark to market values by throwing more good money after bad,"" Kato wrote. The fund's portfolio slipped underwater at March-end. 
On Monday, Son repeated his pledge of no bailouts for struggling parts of the portfolio, although there are funds in reserve for ""follow-on"" investments. 
A stark change of tone from Son was reserved for WeWork, which as recently as November he said was heading for a rapid recovery. 
The largest portfolio companies ""have a relatively good chance of passing through the valley of the coronavirus,"" Son said. 
""The exception is WeWork.""

WARREN, Michigan (Reuters) - The Detroit Three automakers and their suppliers began restarting assembly lines on Monday after a two-month coronavirus lockdown in a slow revival of a sector that employs nearly 1 million people in the United States.
On a chilly and damp Monday morning, hundreds of workers at  Fiat  Chrysler Automobile's (FCA) (MI:FCHA) truck plant in Warren, Michigan began lining up before 4 a.m. to start the 5 a.m. shift. Signs overhead read: ""Let's restart.""
""I'm a little nervous,"" said Larry Smith, 53, of New Baltimore, who works on wheel alignment away from the assembly line. ""They made all the precautions (and) they've done everything they can to prepare us ... I'm trusting in God.""
FCA reopened four U.S. assembly plants on Monday, including Warren Truck, on a single shift, as well as four parts plants.
The reopening of car plants will be a closely watched test of whether workers across a range of U.S. industries can return to factories in large numbers without a resurgence of infections. 
General Motors Co (N:GM),  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and FCA have all been preparing for weeks to reopen their North American factories in a push to restart work in an industry that accounts for about 6% of U.S. economic activity.
Investors welcomed the gradual restart, sending GM's shares up more than 7% in early trading on Monday. FCA shares rose 6.5%, while Ford's were up 5.8%.
Auto companies have redesigned assembly lines and retrained workers in an effort to avoid coronavirus outbreaks that could derail production again. 
Workers entering factories on Monday were checked by temperature monitors. Face masks or shields are standard protective equipment. Jobs such as installing seat belts that used to require two or more workers to get close together inside a vehicle have been redesigned to keep people a safe distance apart. 
Plastic screens have been installed along assembly lines to separate workers leaning in to the engine compartments of vehicles. Break areas have been reconfigured to keep workers six feet apart. 
The Detroit automakers have collaborated with each other and with the United Auto Workers to develop common coronavirus safety practices. Other automakers in the United States are adopting similar safety measures. 
Some non-union automakers in the southern United States reopened earlier this month. Electric car maker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) began building vehicles last week in defiance of a shutdown order in Alameda County, California, then stopped and agreed to reopen again Monday.
CRITICAL RESTART
The Detroit automakers have many older workers in states such as Michigan that were hit hard by the pandemic.
Theresa Segura, 61, of Lincoln Park, arrived for work at the Warren plant on Monday but was immediately sent home after noting on an FCA questionnaire that she had been exposed to a family member who had just tested positive for the virus.
Segura, who has worked at the truck plant since 1993, said she thought that it was in any case too soon to reopen ""because there are still people sick out there.""
""We're risking our lives going in there,"" said Segura, who works as a ""floater,"" moving from job to job at the plant as needed. 
For the automakers and their suppliers, many of which began reopening their plants last week, the restart is critical to ending the cash drain caused by a two-month shutdown forced on them by COVID-19. 
The emphasis is on getting assembly lines again producing such profitable vehicles as GM's Chevrolet Suburban SUV, Ford's F-150 pickup truck and FCA's Jeep Wrangler SUV.
""Ultimately we're in this together. Because if we don't build trucks, Ford Motor Company is gone,"" said Todd Dunn, president of UAW Local 862, the union that represents more than 14,000 hourly workers at Ford's two Kentucky assembly plants, which build trucks and SUVs.
President Donald Trump on Thursday will tour a Ford manufacturing plant in Michigan that has been repurposed to make ventilators and personal protective equipment, according to the White House. 
GM is reopening a number of plants on one shift, including 1,600 hourly workers making pickup trucks in Flint, Michigan, and 1,600 workers manufacturing pickups in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
The UAW's Dunn said one question will be how many Ford workers punch in at his local production facilities on Monday given a lack of daycare in Kentucky, where schools are closed, as well as fear among those with underlying health conditions who are at greater risk. Ford has been hiring temporary workers to cover absenteeism, he said.

Another issue automakers will have to watch closely is the financial health of suppliers. As most suppliers get paid on average 45 days after they deliver parts, some will struggle to stay afloat as the industry slowly reopens, analysts say.

137,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nissan's survival plan for Europe: SUVs and sharing with Renault,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (T:7201) is working on a plan to scale back its European business, focusing on sport utility and commercial vehicles as well as more effective sharing of products and investments with partner  Renault , three sources told Reuters.
The strategy, part of a three-year global turnaround plan due to be unveiled on May 28, would see the Japanese carmaker's plant in Sunderland, northeast England, switch permanently to two daily shifts from three, but become a key hub for SUVs.
It could also see the company's Barcelona factory in Spain close, putting around 3,000 jobs at risk, said the sources with knowledge of the plan, who declined to be named because they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Central to the proposal is a new way of working with alliance partner Renault (PA:RENA) that would see the two companies divide up areas of responsibility, with one becoming the ""leader"" and the other the ""follower"" in each. 
Renault and Nissan have long struggled to achieved the full potential of their alliance, due in part to tensions over areas of control. 
Relations were then strained to almost breaking point in November 2018 when the alliance's long-standing boss, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested in Japan on financial misconduct charges, which he denies.
Nissan's sales and profits have been sliding ever since, and the hammer blow to the global car industry from the coronavirus epidemic has only added to the urgency for the company to come up with a strategy to secure its future. Renault is also working on its own restructuring plan. 
The sources said Nissan's plan for Europe was presented to the company's board on Thursday by chief operating officer Ashwani Gupta, who they said was the leading advocate and key architect of the new leader-follower model.
They added many on the board, whose 12 members include Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard, showed support for the plan, without giving details. 
Nissan declined to comment. Renault did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
DIFFICULT MARKET
Europe has long been a difficult market for automakers due to overcapacity, stiff competition and tight regulations. General Motors (N:GM) quit the region in 2017. 
Europe accounts for only about one-tenth of Nissan's global business by volume and has ""little prospects for growth and profitability,"" as one insider put it. 
However, the company is keen to maintain a presence in the region, albeit a reduced one.
""We need to be in Europe to keep up with regulations and keep our technology competitive, even though we cannot go for exponential growth,"" one of the sources said.
Under the new working relationship with Renault, Nissan would take the lead in Europe on crossover SUVs, which the sources said would be available in gasoline engine, hybrid and all electric battery versions.
It would operate as a ""follower"" in commercial vans and small city cars, using versions of vehicles produced by Renault. 
The arrangement would allow the two partners to share technologies and manufacturing capacity, while keeping advanced technology and product development separate from each other to ""keep our design, engineering and brands distinctive from each other,"" one of the sources said.
That is an attempt to resolve a major source of tension under Ghosn, who sought to cut costs equally at the partners as well as merge new technology and product R&D. Many at Nissan viewed the move as an effort by Renault to ride free on what they believe are Nissan's superior engineering capabilities. 
In terms of models, Nissan's main products in Europe would be narrowed to the Qashqai and the Juke, both locally produced crossover SUVs, plus the X-Trail SUV and the Ariya, a battery electric crossover due to hit the market soon, shipped to Europe from Japan, the sources said.
Likely out would be the sporty Z and GT-R models, as well as the Navara pickup truck made in Barcelona, they said. 
The product line would be supplemented by some of Renault-produced commercial vans and micro cars to give the brand scale and provide dealers with enough vehicles. 
Nissan's Sunderland plant would become the hub for the Qashqai and Juke SUVs, and could also produce their Renault counterparts, the Kadjar and Capture respectively, although no decision on that is expected imminently, the sources said.
The Sunderland factory has been operating below capacity and with a cloud over its future due to Britain's departure from the European Union. 
One of the sources said the plan for the plant depended on the new trading relationship agreed between London and Brussels, but that Nissan expected the UK government to adopt supportive policies. 
In forging the new relationship with Renault, Nissan's Gupta is adapting and expanding a business model he began developing when leading the French group's light commercial vehicles unit.

The Indian-born executive revived the unit and then created a leader/follower arrangement with Nissan's commercial vehicle business that saw the Japanese group building vans using Renault's vehicle underpinning technologies and Nissan providing the French group with technologies for pickup trucks.

On Monday shops, restaurants, coffee shops and hair salons reopened in Italy as the government further softened its coronavirus lockdown rules, one of the world's strictest, which lasted 10 weeks.
Starbucks said it would open its cafes in Milan and the one in the northern city of Turin but would still keep shut the Roastery in the finance capital's city center, opened in September 2018, and the location at the city's Malpensa airport.
""How we operate these stores will look and feel different,"" the company added, explaining that operations would follow the government's rules for the sector as well as social distancing.
All coffees will be served in takeaway paper cups, although people will be able to drink their beverages at tables in Milan as long as they respect social distancing measures, and contactless payments will be preferred. 
Staff will serve coffee wearing face masks and gloves. 
In the Turin cafe, only takeaway drinks will be available. 
Starbucks' Milan flagship store - Starbucks' first roastery in Europe - will stay shut as ""now is not the time to reopen it"", the group said in a statement. ""(It) is designed as an immersive experience and encourages customers to linger and enjoy the expansive space,"" it added. 
Opening dates for the Roastery and the Malpensa locations have not been decided yet.
Last week Starbucks said it would begin a phased reopening of 150 of its drive-thru locations and some takeaway-only stores in the United Kingdom.

In China 90% of Starbucks stores were now open and about 85% of its stores in the United States were open for delivery.

139,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 09:41AM ET</span>","Huawei calls U.S. move to curb chips supply 'arbitrary', expects business impact","By David Kirton
SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies in its first official response to the Trump administration's move to curb its access to global chip supplies called it ""arbitrary"" and said its business would be impacted.
""We expect that our business will inevitably be affected. We will try all we can to seek a solution,"" Chairman Guo Ping said in his keynote speech at Huawei's annual global analyst summit on Monday. 
""Survival is the key word for us at present,"" Guo said in a Q&A.
Guo said Huawei was committed to complying with U.S. rules and it had significantly increased R&D and inventory to meet U.S. pressures.
Friday's move by the U.S. Commerce Department expands U.S. authority to require licences for sales to Huawei of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology, vastly extending its reach to halt sales to the world's No. 2 smartphone maker.
The company was added to the Commerce Department's ""entity list"" a year ago due to national security concerns, amid accusations from Washington that it violated U.S. sanctions on Iran and can spy on customers. Huawei has denied the allegations. 
But China hawks in the Trump administration were frustrated that Huawei’s entity listing was not doing enough to curb its access to supplies.
Huawei said the new U.S. decision was ""arbitrary and pernicious, and threatens to undermine the entire industry worldwide"".
""Huawei categorically opposes the amendments made by the U.S. Department of Commerce to its foreign direct product rule that target Huawei specifically,"" it said in a statement, adding that Washington adding it to the entity list a year ago was also without justification.
Guo said that Huawei spent $18.7 billion buying from U.S. suppliers last year and would continue to buy from them if the U.S. government would allow it. He said customers have stood by the company, but acknowledged it had become harder to win contracts since the company was added to the entity list.
The company has had to rewrite 60 million lines of code and invest 15,000+ man years in research and development in a bid to deal with pressures created by being placed on the entity list.
It said Huawei has since remained committed to complying with all U.S. government rules and regulations, but despite its efforts, the U.S. government has decided to proceed and completely ignore the concerns of many companies and industry associations.

Huawei, which needs semiconductors for its smartphones and telecoms equipment, has found itself at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China, whose relationship has soured in recent months over the origins of the deadly coronavirus.

166,By Investing.com,"<span>May 18, 2020 09:29AM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Jumps at Opening on Reopenings, Vaccine Hopes","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets started the week sharply higher, as hopes for a cure to the Covid-19 vaccine combined with hopes for further stimulus measures in a powerful cocktail.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 675 points, or 2.9%, at 24,361 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.6% and the NASDAQ Composite was up 1.9%. Optimists were undismayed by further ratcheting up of anti-Chinese rhetoric over the weekend, after White House economic advisor Peter Navarro accused the country of deliberately spreading the virus throughout the world. Those comments were offset by comments from another White House advisor, Kevin Hassett, saying that China appeared to be holding up its end of the 'phase 1' trade deal with the U.S.
The market was lifted in particular by a positive update on preliminary trials of an experimental vaccine for the Covid-19 virus. Biotech company Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) said all 45 participants in a preliminary study had produced Covid-19 antibodies as hoped. The drug still needs further and larger-scale tests.  Moderna  stock rose 22.5% at the open.
Stocks also took heart from a TV interview with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at the weekend. Powell had told CBS's 60 Minutes that the Fed still had plenty of ammunition in the fight to support the economy, indicating that it could expand the asset purchase programs already launched. He repeated the Fed's opposition to negative interest rates, however. 
Among the biggest gainers were travel and leisure stocks, which had been the worst-hit by the pandemic. 
Carnival  (NYSE:CCL) stock was up 12,8%  while  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (NYSE:NCLH) stock was up 15.8%. Both companies have recently undertaken big capital raisings to get them through the next few months, a period that seems destined to stay entirely fallow. Rival  Royal Caribbean  Cruises (NYSE:RCL) stock was also up 16.1%.
The same logic held true for beaten-down airlines. United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was up 14.1% while Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock was up 10.1%.
Boeing (NYSE:BA),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) and Bank of America stock (NYSE:BAC) all gained, by 7.1%, 4.1% and 3.5% respectively, after the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund revealed it had taken a position in both. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock, another beneficiary of the PIF, likewise rose 7.5%.
Meanwhile, oil and gas sector stocks were lifted by a surge in U.S. crude prices, as the market moved to price in a quicker rebalancing of supply and demand on the national and global level, thanks to producer shut-ins and a recovery in gasoline demand prompted by the reopening of economies across North America, Europe and China. "

Hertz, backed by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, has suffered a ""sudden and dramatic negative impact"" on its business due to the coronavirus crisis, which has crushed demand for rental cars as people cancel travel and stay at home.
Lat week, the company disclosed that it had missed a loan repayment and asked lenders to extend the payment deadline to May 22.
Hertz, which operates the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty rental brands, said Stone replaced Kathryn Marinello, who will remain with the company in a consulting position for up to one year.

Stone was most recently Hertz's executive vice president and North America chief retail operations officer.

168,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Global dividends forecast to fall as much as 35% in 2020: Janus Henderson,"By Elizabeth Howcroft
LONDON (Reuters) - Dividends paid to shareholders could fall by as much as 35% in 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic cuts companies' profits, data from asset manager Janus Henderson showed on Monday.
Company profits and dividends are set to take a hit as the new coronavirus has spread around the world, having killed more 300,000 people worldwide and pushed U.S. unemployment to levels not seen since the Great Depression.
The level of uncertainty for the rest of the year is so high that Janus Henderson said there would be little value in giving a precise estimate on dividend payouts for 2020, and gave a range of scenarios instead.
In a best-case scenario, global dividends will drop by 15% to $1.21 trillion this year, while in a worst case scenario they could fall 35% to $933 billion, Janus Henderson said.
The asset manager tracked canceled and suspended dividend payouts from companies responsible for more than three quarters of the world's payouts by value, taking into account factors such as the extent of the lockdown, local regulation and dividend seasonality.
Some regions could have bigger dividend cuts overall than in the financial crisis of 2008, the report said.
""Dividend suspensions are inevitable due to the sudden, unprecedented halt in economic activity in many countries,"" said Ben Lofthouse, co-manager of global equity income at Janus Henderson.
""In some cases, dividend changes, along with executive pay moderation, are an acknowledgement or even requirement that shareholders should be part of society’s Covid-19 response,"" Lofthouse added.
Banks, discretionary consumer sectors and economically-sensitive industrial sectors are expected to be most affected while dividends from technology, healthcare, food and basic consumer sectors should be safer, Janus Henderson's report said.
North American dividends are likely to be less affected than Europe and the UK, partly because North America has a high exposure to technology.
The European Central Bank's ban on dividend payouts by banks will remove one in every seven dollars' worth of European dividend payouts in 2020, the report said.
Asia is expected to have less of an impact in 2020 and take a bigger hit in 2021 because in China and the rest of Asia companies have already fixed their payouts for this year based on profits from 2019.
The crisis had little impact on dividend payments in the first quarter of this year, when they rose 3.6% to $275.4 billion, a record high for a first quarter, pushing the Janus Henderson global dividend index to 196.3.
Fund managers whose portfolios rely on the payouts are looking for those most likely to deliver a sustainable yield when the world recovers.

But as the coronavirus and lockdown measures designed to contain the virus limit economic activity, consumer spending has seen record declines, leaving many companies facing an uncertain outlook.

169,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>","Oaktree’s Howard Marks Says Fed Support Isn’t Forever, Distress Coming","(Bloomberg) -- As successful as the Federal Reserve has been propping up corporate debt prices, the support is only temporary and distress will sweep through the credit markets when the central bank inevitably steps back, Howard Marks said.
“Can the Fed keep it up forever?” Marks, the billionaire co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Group, said in a Bloomberg “Front Row” interview. “Those of us in the markets believe that stocks and bonds are selling at prices they wouldn’t sell at if the Fed were not the dominant force. So if the Fed were to recede, we would all take over as buyers, but I don’t think at these levels.”
That, in a nutshell, is the dilemma for policy makers.
Confronted by the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression, they’ve resorted to unprecedented means to keep big employers in business, including the March 23 announcement of two corporate-credit facilities with $750 billion of total spending power.
The prospect of intervention on that scale sparked an immediate surge in demand for both investment-grade and junk bonds. Now that the program has started buying, it’s unclear what happens when -- and if -- the funding runs out.
Some investors think the prices of stocks and bonds are justified by the promise of endless central bank liquidity. In other words: You can’t fight the Fed.
Marks disagrees. He expects a slow and halting recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and said “there will be plenty” of debt defaults and bankruptcies when corporate borrowers start running out of cash in the months ahead.
“There are large, highly levered companies and investment vehicles that the government and Fed rescue program is not likely to reach and take care of,” he said.
Already, Neiman Marcus Group Inc., Stage Stores Inc., Avianca Holdings (NYSE:AVH) SA and J. Crew Group Inc. are among the bankruptcies hastened by the economic fallout from Covid-19. In the bond market, some 540 issuers are still trading at yields that suggest a high probability of default, though that number is down from almost 900 in late March.
One example of the Fed’s efforts is  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) Cruises Ltd. Even though cruises have been halted during the pandemic and revenue has shriveled to almost zero, the company was able to sell $3.3 billion of secured debt at a yield of about 11%.
“It’s what happens in a market which is, I would say, artificially supported by Fed buying,” Marks said.
‘Potemkin Market’
In the 1980s, Marks became one of the first investors to specialize in beaten-down bonds. Oaktree, the Los Angeles-based firm he co-founded with Bruce Karsh, is now trying to raise $15 billion for what would be the biggest-ever fund to invest in distressed debt.
Oaktree was a “very active buyer” when credit markets were swooning in mid-March, but has pulled back since the Fed announced it would intervene, Marks said. While the central bank has committed to buying investment-grade bonds and debt recently downgraded to junk, it hasn’t extended that support to less-creditworthy issuers.
“They could do that,” Marks said. “And in theory, if they bought aggressively, they could make all the markets rise. Now everyone would know that that’s a Potemkin market, a fake, and the minute they stopped things would collapse.”
In one of his recent memos to clients, Marks quoted a saying: “Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Catholicism without hell.” In the interview, he said he worries that Fed support for the credit market will result in moral hazard -- the likelihood that those who escape the consequences for reckless behavior will be reckless again.
That’s not to say he objects to Fed support for the economy.
“Thank God that it did what it did,” he said. “Just because something has unforeseeable negative consequences, that doesn’t mean it was a mistake.”

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's SoftBank Group Corp reported a stunning $18 billion loss at its giant Vision Fund, pushing Masayoshi Son's conglomerate to a record loss and highlighting the deepening crisis at its portfolio companies from the global downturn.
The disastrous 1.9 trillion yen ($18 billion) operating shortfall at the Saudi-backed Vision Fund, including losses of almost $10 billion at office-sharing firm WeWork and ride- hailing app Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc alone, left SoftBank with its worst annual loss of 1.4 trillion yen.
Son, who has been pressured by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management to make share buybacks and bolster governance, said SoftBank would raise 1.25 trillion yen against its stake in China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group.
""The coronavirus is an unprecedented crisis,"" a notably downbeat Son told an earnings presentation, comparing it to the Great Depression.
Appearing far more subdued than usual, Son said some of his tech unicorns had fallen ""into the valley of the coronavirus"".
""I believe some of them will fly over the valley,"" he added, standing beside a slide depicting cartoon unicorns dropping into a hole as a lone winged unicorn escaped to the other side. 
The crisis has pushed the Vision Fund's portfolio underwater, with its $75 billion investment in 88 startups worth $69.6 billion at the end of March. The $100 billion fund had already delivered two consecutive quarters of losses before being upended by the outbreak.
SoftBank booked a $7.5 billion loss on other tech investments, which it attributed primarily to the economic shock caused by the virus. The outbreak has exacerbated underlying problems at many of its bets on unproven startups. 
SCANT DETAIL
The company is loosening ties with Alibaba Group, the largest asset in its portfolio, with the Chinese e-commerce major's co-founder, Jack Ma, departing the SoftBank board.
SoftBank provided scant detail on which companies saw writedowns but offered a sector breakdown showing investments in construction and real estate were worth less than half of cost price, with flagship transportation investments also underwater. 
The company has leveraged its investments to supply further funding for other bets - a strategy that has come under strain as valuations tumble - with losses larger than the group's revised estimate from just last month.
SoftBank-backed satellite operator OneWeb filed for bankruptcy in late March, adding to an impairment loss for investments held outside the Vision Fund that also includes part of the stake in WeWork.
The group pointed to further pain to come, saying ""uncertainty in its investment business will remain over the next fiscal year"" if the pandemic continues.
Son declined to set a dividend for the current financial year for the first time, underscoring the pressure for SoftBank.
With his usual emphasis on the total value of SoftBank's assets rather than profits, which are buffeted by the Vision Fund's nebulous valuations, Son admitted that shareholder value has fallen and net debt grown this year. 
The turmoil has given leverage to activist shareholder Elliott, which, in addition to recommending share buybacks, is pushing for greater transparency and oversight.
The demands echo critics who argue SoftBank is dominated by Son and offers little visibility on how the valuations that drive its profit are reached. 
The group has pledged the sale or monetisation of $41 billion in assets, in part to finance a 2.5-trillion-yen buyback to prop up its share price. By the end of April it had spent 250 billion yen on share purchases.

172,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. probes PerkinElmer's role in massive Medicare fraud - sources,"By Sarah N. Lynch
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Medical diagnostic firm PerkinElmer Inc (N:PKI) faces a federal investigation into its role in an alleged Medicare fraud involving tens of thousands of unnecessary genetic cancer tests, according to three sources with knowledge of the probe and documents reviewed by Reuters.
The firm conducted the tests now under scrutiny over 18 months, earning millions of dollars, according to one of those sources and three others familiar with the company's lab operations.
Investigators are probing whether Massachusetts-based PerkinElmer enabled a scheme by some its laboratory clients, two of which the government previously has charged in connection with alleged Medicare fraud, said the three sources with knowledge of the probe.
PerkinElmer ran high volumes of tests for those clients. Investigators are focused on whether the firm knew - or should have known - that the tests were not medically necessary and that its clients were billing them to the government program for the elderly and disabled, those three sources said.
Such tests determine if patients are at risk of developing hereditary diseases, such as breast or colorectal cancer. Medicare covers the screenings if a patient's physician deems them necessary, often because of a personal or family history of hereditary cancers.
The tests sent to PerkinElmer raised red flags among some company employees because the patients often didn't fit the typical profile for testing and few results showed a cancer risk, according to the three sources familiar with the company's operations.
A spokeswoman for PerkinElmer, Fara Goldberg, did not answer detailed questions from Reuters but said in a statement that the company was not aware of any fraud or abusive practice by PerkinElmer or any employee, and that it had “not been notified of any actual or alleged wrongdoing by any government authority.”
The company said it supports government efforts to identify and prevent abuse in genetic testing, and that it would cooperate with such efforts “as appropriate.”
Madhuri Hegde, a chief scientist for the company’s genetic testing unit, is also under investigation because of her role in establishing business relationships with the lab clients charged in the Medicare fraud schemes, according to two people familiar with the probe and records of the investigation reviewed by Reuters.
Hegde, in an email to Reuters, she said denies ""any wrongdoing whatsoever."" 
PerkinElmer is a leading medical diagnostic company that sells laboratory equipment and performs testing in such areas as food, the environment and neonatal genetics. Genetic testing represents only a fraction of the company’s diagnostic sales, which it reported as $1.14 billion for 2019. It is currently competing with other diagnostic firms to develop and sell new tests to detect the new coronavirus amid the pandemic. It received emergency authorization in March from the Food and Drug Administration to start selling its test for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
The PerkinElmer inquiry is part of a broader Medicare fraud investigation unveiled by the Justice Department in September, saying it had charged 35 people accused of bilking Medicare out of about $2.1 billion. The probe was featured in a Reuters special report last fall, which explored how senior citizens were duped into providing cheek swabs to companies that billed Medicare for useless genetic tests.
The probe is being conducted jointly by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Health and Human Services Office of the inspector General, and the three sources familiar with the investigation said it includes PerkinElmer.
Justice Department criminal division spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on whether PerkinElmer is under investigation. Katherine Harris, a spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, also declined to comment.
NEW BUSINESS
Two businessmen – each of whom founded two labs that later outsourced genetic cancer tests to PerkinElmer – were criminally charged last fall in connection with the alleged genetic testing fraud.
One of the companies, Atlanta-based LabSolutions LLC, started doing business with PerkinElmer in late 2017, according to the three people familiar with the companies' dealings.
LabSolutions purchased equipment and servicing agreements and outsourced its genetic cancer testing to PerkinElmer until it could set up its own labs, according to one of the sources familiar with the probe and the documents reviewed by Reuters.
LabSolutions owner Minal Patel was indicted in September on charges of healthcare fraud and paying and receiving kickbacks to and from marketers who collected cheek swabs from patients for genetic testing. 
Patel, who has pleaded not guilty, did not reply to a message seeking comment. His lawyer, Steven Sadow declined to comment except to say he would ""aggressively"" defend his client.
LabSolutions has ceased business operations. Don Samuel - a lawyer the company retained to handle government asset seizures related to the criminal case - declined to comment.
In January 2018, Hegde became a LabSolutions Scientific Advisory Board consultant for a $5,000 monthly retainer plus $500 per hour to help set up LabSolutions operations, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. She remained on PerkinElmer's payroll at the same time. Reuters could not determine whether PerkinElmer was aware of Hegde's consulting for LabSolutions or whether the government is investigating the arrangement.
PerkinElmer and Hegde did not comment on the consulting work.
In November 2019, another PerkinElmer client - Personalized Genomics' operator Ravitej Reddy - was charged by the Justice Department for allegedly conspiring to pay and receive kickbacks to and from business consultants, a telemedicine company and marketers who provided the cheek swabs for genetic testing as part of a Medicare fraud scheme.
Reddy pleaded guilty in January and is due to be sentenced in September. Mark Rush, who represents Reddy and both labs, said Reddy accepts full responsibility for his actions in the scheme.
The Justice Department said in November that Personalized Genomics and a second lab Reddy operated in Monroeville, Pennsylvania - Med Health Services Management, LP - did not have ""properly validated equipment"" and were forced to send samples for genetic tests to another laboratory. That lab was PerkinElmer, according to the sources familiar with company operations.
'BAGS AND BAGS' OF SAMPLES
PerkinElmer performed about 1,500 genetic cancers tests per week at times in 2018 and 2019, said the three people familiar with the lab’s operations.
PerkinElmer charged its lab clients as much as $450-$550 per test during the 18-month period that is now under federal scrutiny, according to company pricing data obtained in the government’s investigation and reviewed by Reuters. Although the company's genetic testing unit is relatively small, its revenue growth quadrupled to $20 million between 2017 and 2019, company executives said in earnings calls.
The three sources familiar with PerkinElmer's testing operations said that the company's Connecticut lab, which ran all of the genetic tests, was inundated with what one source called ""bags and bags"" of samples, forcing staff to work overtime.
The bulk deliveries raised concerns among some employees that some clients seemed to be in business solely to collect samples from patients and bill the government for tests performed by PerkinElmer, according to one source familiar with the PerkinElmer’s testing operations.
Most of the cheek swabs sent for testing came from senior citizens, even though some of the leading inherited cancers are more common in younger adults. And one of the sources familiar with PerkinElmer’s testing said “almost all” of the results showed patients were not at risk of developing these cancers.

173,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Tech firms sweeten deals for U.S. banks cutting costs in crisis,"By Anirban Sen
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Top technology services firms are offering payment deferrals, discounts of up to 20% and other sweeteners to some U.S. banks to keep their business as the pandemic forces Wall Street to cut tech budgets, according to executives involved in the talks.
Large Wall Street banks are widely expected to reduce overall budgets and discretionary tech spending, which includes areas such as technology consulting services, business analytics, research and design and process management projects. 
Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) - among the world's largest tech services vendors - have offered to do more for them at lower rates, three executives who have taken part in the discussions told Reuters. 
The aim is to secure new contracts as well as to keep the relationships with the banks ticking over so that they can be expanded once more post-pandemic, they added. 
At least half a dozen meetings have taken place over the past month between the tech companies and some of the largest U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), said the executives who all requested anonymity as the discussions were confidential.
""The current crisis facing the IT industry is potentially bigger than the 2008 recession. We have no option but to use every tactic necessary, including heavy discounts, to gain a competitive edge,"" said one.
Major IT outsourcing contracts, which include software maintenance, cloud computing and analytics, are worth several hundreds of millions of dollars and typically stretch over many years. 
As well as some discounts and payment deferrals of typically between one to four months, the tech companies are in some cases offering to buy up computer data centers from their clients and the existing systems and hardware that are being replaced or upgraded at banks, the executives said.
Accenture said it was working with banking clients to address the implications of the crisis but did not comment on pricing talks. Cognizant and Infosys also declined to comment on its talks with clients, while Tata Consultancy did not respond to a request for comment. 
JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup declined to comment on their discussions with vendors. 
The negotiations are ongoing and no agreements have been struck yet as many leading banks have delayed finalizing their tech budgets due to the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis, according to the sources.
WIDER INDUSTRY TREND
The proposals reflect a wider trend, about half a dozen of tech industry insiders told Reuters, with discounts of varying size and investment commitments featuring in many discussions between vendors and their financial industry customers.
Research and advisory firm  Gartner  (NYSE:IT) estimates the banking and financial services industry's spending globally on IT and information security will fall 5.6% in 2020 to $502 billion.
India's IT outsourcing sector, which includes the likes of Tata Consultancy and Infosys, is likely to be particularly hard hit. It has grown into a nearly $200 billion a year industry over the past two decades, offering technology services to corporate heavyweights across the world. 
Developing and maintaining the plumbing of the world's financial services industry accounts for 40% of its revenues, with Wall Street banks among its biggest customers.
The top 10 U.S. banks collectively spend roughly $70 billion on technology annually, according to public statements and executives.
Cognizant,  IBM  (NYSE:IBM), and Infosys have all withdrawn their 2020 forecasts in recent weeks, citing concerns about pricing and budget cuts at their major clients. Accenture cut its full-year guidance in March, while  Wipro  (NYSE:WIT) withdrew its revenue forecast for the current quarter. 
""We've seen some delays in ... discretionary spending and select requests for furloughs, rate concessions and extended payment terms from our clients,"" Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries said in an earnings call this month.
IBM and Wipro declined to comment on any pricing talks with clients. But IBM said its broad client base provided a measure of stability in terms of recurring revenues and profit in ""these challenging times"".
SWEETNESS HAS LIMITS
Banks are not, however, slashing tech spending as heavily as sectors such as travel, hospitality and retail. Many are also investing in technology that helps staff work from home. 
For instance, Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF), which typically spends about $1 billion a year on technology, is preparing cuts in many areas, but also plans to invest in remote working tech, and wants to dedicate some of the money saved on travel to that, group chief information officer Michael Gorriz told Reuters.
""What has happened with COVID-19 is that these plans have been rapidly accelerated,"" he said.
For technology companies looking to keep customers on-side and weather the storm, there are limits, though.
While vendors have little choice but to offer discounts to remain competitive, they are unlikely to go as far as to accept losses, said Ray Wang, founder of Silicon Valley technology research and advisory firm Constellation Research.

""The discounting for client business will intensify as the number of contracts drop overall in the market,"" said Wang, but he added: ""I don't think they will hurt their own margins for growth right now. Profitability is very important.""

Investors were also encouraged by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's views on a recovery and hints on more monetary stimulus if required. He is slated to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday to discuss how economic rescue efforts are working.
Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher on Friday as investors weighed worries about Sino-U.S. trade relations and weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data against growing optimism that easing coronavirus restrictions would boost activity this month.
However, they posted a weekly loss as uncertainty still persisted over how the world would emerge from the coronavirus. U.S. stock indexes have stuck to a tight range after recovering from multi-year lows hit in March.
At 6:20 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis <1YMcv1> were up 360 points, or 1.53%. S&P 500 e-minis  were up 42.25 points, or 1.48% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis  were up 108.5 points, or 1.19%.

175,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 07:12AM ET</span>","Panasonic sees strong demand from Tesla, in talks to expand Nevada battery plant","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp's (T:6752) finance chief said the company is seeing strong demand for battery cells from U.S. partner Tesla (O:TSLA) and they are in talks to expand their joint plant in Nevada, which is now profitable.
The positive outlook comes after production troubles and delays at Tesla strained the company's partnership with Panasonic over the past few years.
Panasonic recently lost its status as Tesla's exclusive battery supplier, but has been able to turn around the U.S. joint battery business as demand for Tesla's electric cars soar.
Last month Tesla reported its third consecutive quarterly profit despite the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, taking investors by surprise.
""We are seeing strong demand from Tesla"" beyond the Nevada plant's current capacity of 35 gigawatt hours per year, Panasonic Chief Financial Officer Hirokazu Umeda told an earnings briefing on Monday. ""We are in discussions right now"" about expanding the plant's capacity, he said.
The plant made a profit in January-March for the second consecutive quarter, he said.
Umeda hinted that Panasonic has been developing new batteries with Tesla. ""We will be working to improve materials and technologies throughout this financial year,"" he said.
The Tesla battery business provided a bright spot in Panasonic's otherwise grim earnings, hit by plant closures and supply chain disruptions for its laptops, washing machines, automotive components and factory equipment.
The group's operating profit for the year ended in March dropped 29% to 294 billion yen ($2.7 billion).
Panasonic did not issue an earnings forecast for the current year due to uncertainty about the impact of the virus, joining a number of Japanese electronics companies, including Sony Corp (T:6758) and Canon Inc (T:7751), in refraining from providing outlooks.
Analysts have forecast an average 225.46 billion yen profit for the current financial year.
The company has been cautious about expanding its partnership with Tesla, as its $1.6 billion investment in the Nevada factory, which began construction in 2014, failed to produce solid returns. It did not make a profit until the October-December quarter of last year. 
Panasonic has decided to exit solar cell production at Tesla's New York plant this year.
It also decided not to build a new battery plant for Tesla in China. The U.S. car maker has entered into partnerships with South Korea's LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910) and China's CATL (SZ:300750).
Umeda said at the briefing that Panasonic has been supplying batteries to Tesla's factory in China from their Nevada plant.

In a statement, the company's works council said that Theo Henrar has been dismissed in what they described as an ""incomprehensible and ill-considered"" decision made in the interests of Tata Steel UK at the expense of the Dutch arm.
""Both the shareholders in India and the European leadership of Tata Steel have been failing to solve problems in Britain for years,"" it said. ""Billions of pounds and euros have not been able to make Tata Steel UK profitable.""
Tata Steel employs around 9,000 people at IJmuiden, about 25 km (15.5 miles) northwest of Amsterdam.
Labour Union FNV Steel said that Henrar had advocated to preserve the Dutch operations.
""The owners of Tata Steel in India are keen to downsize IJmuiden,"" said Roel Berghuis in a statement. ""Henrar had been able to convince them time after time of the large importance of the subsidiary for Tata Steel and the Netherlands.""
Tata Steel Europe began talks with workers in November over a ""transformation programme"" that would led to 3,000 job cuts, following a decision by European Union competition regulators to block a joint venture with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG).
In April the company said it had delayed reorganisation plans until after July 1, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Steelmaking operations around Europe are operating at reduced capacity due to a drop in demand from the auto industry.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Shareholders in the now defunct Russian oil giant Yukos have seized Netherlands-based assets of two well-known vodka brands controlled by the Russian state in their most recent legal move to obtain $57 billion in damages from Moscow, they said on Monday.
The seizure of the Stolichnaya and Moskovskaya vodka trademark rights via a Dutch court took place on May 7, a spokesman for shareholders said on Monday, adding that the Russian state was informed of the move last week.
However, an official in Moscow said neither the Foreign Ministry or the Russian Embassy in the Netherlands had been informed.
""There was no official notification of this decision,"" Andrey Kondakov, head of the International Legal Defense Center which represents Moscow's interests in the case, was quoted by state-controlled Russian news agency TASS as saying on Monday.
A Dutch appeals court on Feb. 18 overturned the annulment of a $50 billion award to Yukos shareholders, a surprise ruling 13 years after the assets came under control of the Kremlin.
The sum due has increased to $57 billion because of additional penalty fees, the spokesman said.
Last Friday, Russia's Justice Ministry lodged an appeal at the Dutch Supreme Court to contest the decision.
Yukos Oil went bankrupt in 2006 after oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky fell out with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the government began demanding billions of dollars in alleged back taxes that ultimately resulted in its being expropriated by the state.
Most of Yukos' assets were absorbed by the Kremlin's flagship oil producer Rosneft (MM:ROSN), and its former owners have for years been trying to recover their possessions.
Legal proceedings seeking damages have been brought in the Netherlands by the subsidiaries of GML, formerly known as Group Menatep Ltd., which held around 70% of shares in Yukos.
In a separate case, The Dutch Supreme Court in January upheld a lower court finding that stripped the rights to the Stolichnaya and Moskovskaya vodka brand in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg (Benelux) from SPI Group’s Spirits International and awarded them to Russian state-owned Sojuzplodoimport.
Those assets have now been seized in the Netherlands, the spokesman said on Monday.
The case dates back to a July 2014 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration which ordered Moscow to pay damages to Yukos shareholders, saying the Kermlin had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt the company and take Khodorkovsky's assets.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stock markets rose on Monday and oil prices climbed to their highest in as much as two months as a loosening of coronavirus shutdowns boosted market sentiment, even though the deadly outbreak has yet to be fully contained.
Warm weather enticed much of the world to emerge from coronavirus lockdowns as centres of the outbreak from New York to Italy and Spain gradually lift restrictions that have kept millions cooped up for months.
However, the weekend also saw anti-lockdown protesters in countries such as the United States, Germany, England and Poland arguing government restrictions demolish personal liberties and are wrecking economies.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was up 2% at 1020 GMT, with heavyweight bourses in Britain (FTSE), Germany (GDAXI) and France (FCHI) all comfortably in positive territory, recovering some of last week's losses.
""The resilience of stock markets relative to the awful economic data that we’ve been seeing over the past fortnight speaks to an optimism that... as economies come out of lockdown we can expect to see improvements as we head into the second half of the year,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.
Governments must balance the economic incentive to re-open businesses with the risk of triggering a deadly second wave of the virus, which has killed more than 312,000 people and spread to at least 210 countries since December. [nL4N2AY3AS]
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) strategist Jim Reid said, ""It does feel like we’re in the middle of a phoney war at the moment with all of us waiting to see how efficiently the various economies are able to re-open given all the social distancing that will be required.""
There were still lots of obstacles to a rapid recovery, with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell saying in an interview on Sunday that a U.S. economic recovery may stretch deep into 2021.
The most important data for the U.S. economy now are the ""medical metrics"" around the coronavirus pandemic, he said.
Health ministers from around the world, including China and the U.S., are expected to call for an independent evaluation of the World Health Organization's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic during a WHO meeting on Monday.
Already rocky U.S.-China relations also saw tensions increase over the weekend, as the United States raised threats over telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies  and China's treatment of journalists in Hong Kong.
U.S. lawmakers and officials are crafting proposals to push American companies to move operations or key suppliers out of China, including tax breaks, new rules, and carefully structured subsidies.
Japan's preliminary GDP data showed that the world's third biggest economy contracted an annualised 3.4% in the first quarter, slipping into a recession for the first time in more than five years. [nL4N2CX16Y]
But hopes of a worldwide economic recovery saw oil prices climb by more than $1 a barrel on Monday, supported by output cuts.
Brent crude reached as much as $34.35 a barrel on Monday, its highest since April 9, and was last up 5.3% at $34.22 (LCOc1). U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (CLc1) was up 7.1% at $31.51 a barrel - a two-month high.
In commodity markets, the flood of liquidity from central banks, combined with record-low interest rates and poor economic data from the U.S., lifted gold to a seven-year peak. The metal was last up 1.3% at $1,763 an ounce , with silver and palladium also boosted. [GOL/]
The MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up around 0.4% while MSCI's main European Index <.MSER> was up 2%.
Government bond yields edged higher across the euro area, while France's bonds saw some underperformance after its ratings outlook was lowered by Fitch Ratings.
Europe's biggest budget airline, Ryanair, reported a 13% rise in profit for the year to March 31 (I:RYA), but cut its annual passenger traffic target by a further 20% and said it had ""no visibility"" on customer demand once it reopens much of its network on July 1. Ryanair shares were last up 10.4%.
The dollar fell slightly against a basket of six major currencies in early London trading before recovering somewhat, last down less than 0.1% since New York's close (DXY).
The Norwegian crown was lifted by the rising oil prices, up around 0.8% versus the euro (EURNOK=D3).
Sterling fell below $1.21 - its lowest since March 26 - late on Sunday after the Bank of England's chief economist said the bank is looking more urgently at options such as negative interest rates.

It was last up 0.25% on the day at $1.2130, as a lack of progress in Brexit negotiations continue to weigh on the pound.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Monday amid hopes of more stimulus ahead and as states continue to reopen their economy, all of which is outweighing increased trade tension with China. 
At 06:55 AM ET (1055 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 43 points, or 1.5%, higher, Nasdaq futures were up 119 points, or 1.3%. The Dow futures contract rose 373 points, or 1.6%. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned over the weekend that the U.S. economy could ""easily"" contract by 20%-30% amid the pandemic, and that the economic downturn might last until late 2021.
However, he also told CBS’s 60 Minutes program that “we’re not out of ammunition by a long shot” as he said the Fed could enlarge existing lending programs or start new ones. Powell is due to appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday.
On Friday, Democrats in the House of Representatives passed an additional $3 trillion coronavirus relief package. However, it is not expected to pass the Republican-majority Senate.
This comes as more and more states start to reopen their economies. The Trump administration offered up reopening guidelines just over a month ago, and since then more than 30 states have partially reopened.
This positive news has tended to overshadow the latest salvo in war of words between China and the U.S. over the coronavirus outbreak. White House trade advisor Peter Navarro had accused China of knowingly spreading the virus around the world while concealing its full knowledge of the outbreak.
This week will see first-quarter earnings results from big U.S. retailers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT),  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Lowe's (NYSE:LOW),  Target  (NYSE:TGT), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and  Best Buy  (NYSE:BBY). Their figures will show whether U.S. consumers are still spending money despite the widespread coronavirus lockdowns.
Ahead of this, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) will be in the spotlight after news emerged that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) sold off 84% of its stake in the investment banking giant during the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will also be in focus after it released guidelines late Sunday for how it will reopen its retail stores once it is safe to do so. It plans to reopen 25 stores in the U.S. this week.
Oil futures continued to push higher Monday, hitting a two-month high ahead of Tuesday’s monthly expiration of the U.S. West Texas Intermediate contract. A repeat of last month’s turmoil looks unlikely at this point.   
At 6:55 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 7.8% higher at $31.31 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 6% to $34.45.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.9% to $1,771.30/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0814, largely flat.

Investing.com -- The real world is back.
As Europe lifts more and more of its coronavirus lockdowns, stocks are recovering their footing too. By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 index was up 1.9% at 334.80, while the German DAX index was up 2.6% and the FTSE 100 was up 2.0%, helped generously by a further weakening of the British pound.  
Specifically, the stocks that have been punished most for living in the physical world rather than the virtual one outperformed: in the U.K., food chains like Restaurant Group and Greggs were up 5.3% and 4.5% respectively, while Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) was up only 0.6%; online estate agents  Onthemarket  (LON:OTMPO) and  Rightmove  (LON:RMV) were flat and up 0.6%, while brickmaker Ibstock was up 4.3% and builders’ merchant  Travis Perkins  (LON:TPK) was up 2.0%. Primark owner Associated British Foods  (LON:ABF) was up 3.1%, for once outperforming online-only rival boohoo.com  (LON:BOOH), which was up 1.7%.
On the mainland, software stalwart SAP (DE:SAPG) is outperforming first-quarter market darling  TeamViewer  (DE:TMV),  Societe Generale  SA (PA:SOGN) was outperforming payments company Worldline (PA:WLN), while Borussia Dortmund (DE:BVB), which resumed its Bundesliga season at the weekend, was outperforming video games maker  Rovio Entertainment  (HE:ROVIO).
The odds on that lasting for any length of time may not be all that great, given the power of the long-term trends behind their respective investment cases, but something has still changed as regards the demand for physical goods to support physical activity.
Blackrock’s World Mining fund, which has a broad exposure to the makers of iron ore, copper, aluminum and nickel, was up a whopping 7.4% by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT).
Within the sector, iron ore giants BHP Group (LON:BHPB) and  Rio Tinto  (LON:RIO) were up 5.4% and 5.1% respectively, while  Glencore  (LON:GLEN), which has big exposures to copper, zinc, coal and oil, was up 5.1%.
However, the biggest upward moves were by miners of something that is not a play on industrial activity: gold. FTSE 100 member  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES) shares rose 8.9% as prices for the haven metal hit a seven-year high, while the midcap Hochschild Mining  (LON:HOCM) shares rose over 10% after it said its key mines in Peru had received permission to reopen, having been closed due to lockdown orders.
Another indication that Monday’s move was more a mean-reversion trade rather than a real expression of belief in the world economy is that  Johnson Matthey  (LON:JMAT), which specializes in turning platinum and palladium into exhaust cleaning systems for cars and trucks, was up only 2.4%."

The benchmark in the Asian financial hub is dominated by financial services institutions and conglomerates such as HSBC and CK Hutchison.
""There is a perception that local indices like Hang Seng aren't necessarily reflective of the opportunity set available out there,"" said Michael Lai, China equities portfolio manager at Franklin Templeton.
""(Inclusion) would be a reflection of how the Chinese markets, companies have developed.""
Companies from Greater China with a secondary listing in Hong Kong and those with two classes of shares carrying different voting rights will be included in the index, starting from August, with a weighting cap of 5%, the index provider said in a statement.
Hong Kong's stock exchange started allowing companies to list with two classes of shares in 2018, and also streamlined secondary listings by Chinese companies listed overseas, enabling the three tech companies' entry into the market.
Alibaba, Xiaomi and Meituan - the only companies with dual-class or equivalent structures in Hong Kong - are typically among the top five stocks traded there by value each month.
Adding the three companies could drive passive fund flows of $3.7 billion into their shares,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS)'s analysts said in a note before the announcement. The tech trio are also eligible to join the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index.
Alibaba has a voting structure different from the other two. A small group of current and former senior managers can nominate a majority of its board. But it is likewise treated as a dual-class shares firm by the Hang Seng Indexes Company. 
It is also the only one of the three with another listing elsewhere, in New York.
Other companies with dual-class shares, such as U.S.-listed internet company Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and online commerce firm JD (NASDAQ:JD).Com are planning secondary listings in Hong Kong, Reuters reported this year.

The Hang Seng is tracked by $20 billion of exchange-listed products globally and $8 billion of local retirement plans, the index provider said in a consultation paper in January.

Governments and central banks globally have unleashed unprecedented stimulus to prop up the economy, helping the STOXX 600 recover nearly 25% from its March lows despite dire readings of business activity and rising U.S.-China trade tensions.

186,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>","Norwegian Air completes emergency equity issue, shares plunge 50%","OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) completed a deeply discounted share issue on Monday and is expected to finalise a conversion of bonds to equity later in the day, allowing a downsized version of the budget carrier to survive the novel coronavirus outbreak.
Existing shareholders will see their stakes massively diluted by the financial rescue, which will increase the number of shares in the company to about 3.5 billion from just 163.6 million.
The debt conversion and share sale will allow Norwegian Air to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion crowns, which hinge on a reduction in leverage, in addition to 300 million crowns it has already received.
The airline's shares fell to 2.51 crowns in early trade, down 51% from Friday's close, before partly recovering to trade at 4.38 crowns at 0812 GMT, down 14% on the day.
The plan to save the carrier also involves further restructuring, grounding 95% of the fleet for up to 12 months and leaving just seven aircraft in operation before a slow build-up can start in 2021, it said last month.
The deeply discounted sale of 400 million new shares, at just 1 Norwegian crown each, was about seven times oversubscribed, and the new stock can be traded from later this week, the budget carrier said on Monday.
A meeting of bondholders is due to start at 1000 GMT.

A pioneer in low-fare transatlantic air travel, Norwegian Air's rapid expansion left it with some $8 billion of debt at the end of 2019, making it particularly vulnerable to the fallout from the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 respiratory disease.

187,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 18, 2020 04:27AM ET</span>",Bulk Shipping ‘At The Very Bottom’ as Carrier Earnings Plunge,"(Bloomberg) -- Vessels carrying dry bulk commodities are struggling to make a profit because of the double hit of lower seasonal demand for cargoes and the Covid-19 pandemic that’s wrecking trade and industrial activity worldwide.
“We’re really at the very bottom for dry bulk,” William Fairclough, managing director of Wah Kwong Maritime Transport Holdings Ltd., one of Hong Kong’s largest independent ship owners, said in an interview.
Shipments out of Brazil, one of the dry bulk market’s main shippers, continue to be low, and global supply chains are being upended by the virus, he said. “The entire dry bulk carrier sector’s earnings are basically nothing.”
The Baltic Exchange Capesize Index, a measure of freight rates for bulk cargoes from coal-to-iron ore, has tumbled this year, with a short rebound in April petering out. The Baltic Dry Index, a broader gauge of vessel demand, plunged last week to the lowest since 2016.
The virus is an additional blow to a market already in pain. The early months of the year are seasonally weak, and there were fewer iron ore cargoes from Brazil and Australia due to weather disruptions. Last year, a dam disaster at iron ore producer Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) lowered exports.
“We are now in uncharted territory because it’s impossible to understand, or to gauge, when various lockdowns measures are going to be lifted in different countries, or the impact of a potential second-wave of infection,” said Fairclough. For bulk shipping rates to see a sustained recovery, the India market needs to return, and higher iron-ore volumes from Brazil to China also are needed, he said.
Bulk shipping accounts for about 40% of the company’s revenue, with the balance coming from the tanker market, which has seen a big surge. Both sectors tend to move in opposite directions, which safeguards the company’s earnings. Wah Kwong currently owns 19 vessels with an additional five vessels under construction across bulk carriers and crude oil sectors.

188,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",Thyssenkrupp in talks with peers over steel business: source,"By Christoph Steitz, Tom Käckenhoff and Arno Schuetze
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - German ailing conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) is in talks with international peers about consolidating its loss-making steel business, a person familiar with the matter said.
The talks, to be unveiled as part of a strategy revamp later on Monday, follow a 372 million euro ($402 million) loss that Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe, Germany's largest steelmaker, posted in the first half of the group's fiscal year.
The update is expected to accelerate Thyssenkrupp's dismantling, a process that started last year when the group essentially put most of its divisions, including car parts, warships and plant building on the block.
Shares in Thyssenkrupp, which have lost nearly two-thirds of their value over the past 12 months after a raft of profit warnings and dwindling investor confidence, were 5.6% higher at 0806 GMT.
Ever since a strategy u-turn a year ago, which saw Thyssenkrupp dropping plans for a joint venture with India's  Tata Steel  (NS:TISC) in favour of a sale of its prized elevator unit, the group continued to champion the merits of steel consolidation.
Sources told Reuters that contact between Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel never broke off and that both were still in talks about consolidation.
Business paper Handelsblatt said that Thyssenkrupp was also in discussions with Sweden's SSAB (ST:SSABa) and China's Baoshan Iron & Steel (Baosteel) (SS:600019) and that both were interested in a majority of the German firm's steel unit.
Thyssenkrupp and Baosteel declined to comment as did SSAB, whose shares were also 5.6% higher. Tata Steel Europe had no immediate comment.
Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board, in a meeting scheduled for Monday, is also expected to discuss the auction of Plant Technology, the division building chemical, fertiliser and other industrial plants.
Indicative bids were submitted last month but those were based on a business plan before the coronavirus pandemic kicked in, having effectively put the process on hold, a second source said.
""This will only go ahead if the coronavirus impact is clear and bidders will be able to recalculate their asking prices,"" the source said, adding Denmark's FLSmidth (CO:FLS), Italy's  Maire Tecnimont  (MI:MTCM) and U.S.-based Fluor (N:FLR) were in the race.

Investing.com - European stock markets posted strong gains Monday, as the region’s economies reopen amid positive corporate news.
At 4:15 AM ET (0815 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.7% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 2.4%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 2.3%.
Shops, restaurants and hair salons have started trading again in Italy on Monday, while other centers of the outbreak, such as Spain and France, have gradually lifted restrictions that have plunged the region’s economy in a severe downturn.
""The economies of Europe and the U.S. likely bottomed out in April and are slowly starting to come back to life,"" said  Barclays  (LON:BARC)' economist Christian Keller, in a research note to clients.
""However, incoming data from most economies highlight the depth of the contraction, raising risks of longer-term scarring that might undermine the recovery.""
Regulators across the Continent also signaled a return to normality by saying they will end the bans on short-selling that they imposed in March as panic struck.
Earlier Monday, data in Japan confirmed the world's third largest economy slipped into recession in the first quarter, putting it on course for its worst postwar slump as the coronavirus takes a heavy toll.
In corporate news,  Total  (PA:TOTF) stock climbed 6.2% after the oil producer called off plans to acquire Occidental Petroleum's (NYSE:OXY) assets in Ghana, citing “the extraordinary market environment and the lack of visibility that the group faces.” Instead, the group is to buy gas and power assets in Spain from EDP Energias de Portugal  (OTC:EDPFY), in a deal valued at 515 million euros.
Fellow oil giants BP (NYSE:BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) also posted strong gains, 5.9% and 3.9%, respectively, as the price of crude continued to push higher.
At 4:15 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 5% higher at $30.98 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 4% to $33.80.
 Accor  (PA:ACCP) stock rose 3.4% after securing a new banking credit facility, as well as seeing some ""initial signs of business improvement.” The French hotel company, like so many in the tourism sector, has been hit hard by the impact of the coronavirus.
Ryanair (LON:RYA) climbed over 8% after reporting on Monday reported a profit after tax of 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) for the year to March 31. It added that it was unable to provide a forecast for the current year due to Covid-19 and cut its annual passenger traffic target by a further 20%.
German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) jumped 5% after a source told Reuters it was in talks with international peers about a possible merger for its loss-making steel business.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,770.85/oz, a new seven-year high, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0814, largely flat."

The deal is in line with the company's strategy to expand into the electricity market as energy majors face growing pressure to reduce their exposure to fossil fuels while increasing low-carbon businesses in their portfolio. 
Total's shares on the Paris bourse (FCHI) gained 4% in early trade after the deal, and a separate announcement that it was calling off a deal to acquire Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY)'s asset in Ghana. 
Total said it was buying EDP's portfolio of 2.5 million business-to-customers (B2C) base, along with the two power plants, which represented an electricity generation capacity of nearly 850 megawatts.
It added that the transaction with EDP was based on an enterprise value of 515 million euros ($557.4 million).
""This is a major new step in Total's ambition to become a broad energy company,"" Total's Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne, said in a statement. 
""This transaction enables Total to become one of the key players in the energy market in Spain, covering a wide spectrum from LNG imports to power generation from renewables and gas, as well as gas and electricity supply,"" Pouyanne said.

191,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 03:50AM ET</span>",Six EU states to scrap bans on short-selling shares,"LONDON (Reuters) - Six European Union states will scrap bans on short-selling shares introduced during bouts of extreme market volatility in March when national lockdowns were rolled out across the bloc to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.
The bloc's securities watchdog, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), said Austria, Belgium, France, Greece and Spain have decided not to renew short-selling bans that expire at 2159 GMT on Monday.
French markets watchdog AMF said that since the implementation of the ban, it has observed a progressive normalisation in trading.
""Markets have partly reduced their losses, trading volumes and volatility have returned to levels that are still high compared to mid-February, however this reflects market participants’ uncertainties in the current context,"" the AMF said in a statement.
Italy, whose ban was due to expire on June 18, has decided to lift its ban early to align itself with the other five EU states, ESMA said.
The six bans left traders facing a patchwork of interventions in what is mean to be a seamless pan-European stock market of 27 countries at a time of extreme uncertainty. Germany and Britain in particular declined to introduce short-selling curbs.
Last week the World Federation of Exchanges, hedge funds industry associations AIMA and Managed Funds Association, and the European Principal Traders Association called on the French markets regulator and finance ministry to end the ban.
""Over the longer term, the bans risk undermining confidence in key European financial markets and hampering the goal of a Capital Markets Union, something that will be vital to European recovery from the profound economic shock caused by COVID-19,"" the letter said.

""Market confidence has been further damaged by the lack of coordination when it comes to how bans have been implemented.""

SoftBank and Deutsche Telekom were not immediately available for comment. 
SoftBank is widely expected to try and monetise its T-Mobile stake as it looks to raise $41 billion through asset sales to prop up its floundering tech investing empire and fund a record share buyback. 
Lock-up provisions agreed to as part of the merger would likely be altered to permit the transaction, the WSJ said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Subaru Corp (T:7270) on Monday posted a 15.7% rise in annual operating profit in the year that ended in March as it recovered from a raft of product recalls last year, but warned that sales of its cars would take a hit from the coronavirus outbreak.
Profit rose to 210.3 billion yen ($1.96 billion) for the year just ended, from 181.7 billion yen a year earlier under international financial reporting standards. It exceeded a consensus estimate of 204.7 billion yen profit drawn from 17 analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Global automakers are struggling to recover from the coronavirus, which has pummelled car sales as shelter-in-place orders in many countries clobbered car demand, while plant workers had been left unable to commute to work.
Though Subaru and its rivals have begun to restart vehicle factories, anaemic demand, supply chain disruption and social distancing measures at factories are expected to limit output in the coming months.
""We saw a limited impact of the coronavirus on our results for the year just ended,"" Chief Executive Tomomi Nakamura told a teleconference.
""But although we have resumed production this month, we are only operating one shift in Japan, and the pace of U.S. output has slowed significantly ... we see many uncertainties related to the virus.""
As a result, the maker of the Outback and Forester SUV crossovers declined to give an earnings forecast for the current business year, while it slashed its year-end dividend for the year just ended by 61% to 28 yen per share.
Some analysts believe industry-wide global auto sales could slump by a third this year and that any recovery will be slow and patchy as job losses and reduced incomes weigh on consumer spending.
Subaru, which earns two-thirds of its vehicle sales from the United States, acknowledged that it may take a hit in the coming months as its biggest market struggles get the coronavirus pandemic under control. 
The automaker saw a 3% rise in global vehicle sales in the year to March to 1.03 million units, bouncing back from last year, when a defective steering component and measures to improve inspection tests had stopped output for two weeks at its sole assembly plant in Japan.
The process to restart its U.S. plants would take time, Subaru said, and it expects to produce only around 5,000 units this month, a fraction of last year's 40,000. The virus would result in a global production hit of around 150,000 units, it added.

The automaker said it had secured a 200 billion yen credit line from its lenders to see it through the coronavirus. It has been improving its free cash position over the past year, but warned that its coffers would take a hit through June.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp said on Monday that  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) co-founder Jack Ma will resign from its board, in the latest departure by a high-profile ally of CEO Masayoshi Son.
The departure of Ma, who retired as Alibaba's executive chairman in September, comes as he pulls back from formal business roles to focus on philanthropy.
SoftBank will propose three new appointments to the board, including group Chief Financial Officer Yoshimoto Goto, at its annual general meeting on June 25. The number of board members will expand to 13. 
SoftBank will also propose the election of Lip-Bu Tan, CEO of chip design software firm Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems who is also chairman of venture capital firm Walden International, and Yuko Kawamoto, a professor at Waseda Business School as outside directors. Kawamoto will become its only female board member.
That meets a demand from activist investor Elliott Management, which has pressed SoftBank to improve board diversity, and also wants a new subcommittee to oversee the investment process at the $100 billion Vision Fund.
Son's top-down management style is under increased scrutiny with the fund expected to report its third consecutive quarterly operating loss later on Monday, plunging the group as a whole to a record loss.
The board is largely comprised of SoftBank insiders and confidants. It includes Yasir al-Rumayyan, who heads the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund that is the Vision Fund's biggest outside backer. 
""Who is the voice of reason who can stand up to Son? You probably need more than one,"" said Nicholas Benes of The Board Director Training Institute of Japan, a non-profit focused on corporate governance training. 
""I am doubtful that these four outside directors, in a board of 13, will have much effect slowing Son down before the next WeWork deal,"" he added, referring to SoftBank's soured bet on the office-sharing startup. 
Ma's exit follows the departure of Tadashi Yanai, founder and CEO of Uniqlo parent Fast Retailing, who resigned from the board late last year to focus on his fashion business.
Separately, SoftBank said the board had approve a second 500 billion yen ($4.7 billion) tranche of share purchases, part of a 2.5 trillion yen buyback programme announced in March to prop up the group's share price as its tech bets flounder. 
SoftBank has bought back more than 250 billion yen of its shares at the end of April. It has pledged to sell down or monetise $41 billion of assets to raise cash, with its stake in Alibaba - the portfolio's most valuable asset - seen as a likely target.

""We are now beginning a new phase given the Mexican government's official announcement earlier this week to consider the transportation manufacturing industry as essential for the country's economy,"" Francisco Garza, president ofGeneral Motors de Mexico, wrote in an email to suppliers dated on Friday that was viewed by Reuters.
Noting the Mexican government is due to publish final safety rules on Monday, Garza added: ""Once those final guidelines are known, we will be in a position to move swiftly to comply.""
GM is tentatively planning to restart operations at its auto assembly plant in the Mexican city of Silao on Wednesday, according to a message to workers seen by Reuters on Sunday.
Workers at the plant in the central state of Guanajuato that has been idled for weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak had previously been told to plan to return to work on Monday.
A GM spokeswoman said the company could not confirm when it would restart operations at any of its facilities in Mexico because it is awaiting more guidance from the government.
The government's announcement, made on Friday, means that automakers from as early as this week can begin reconnecting supply chains between Mexico and the rest of North America, which depends heavily on parts made south of the U.S. border. 
Senior U.S. politicians and auto companies had pressed the Mexican government to reopen factories.
Some politicians are wary, however, of opening too fast. Mexico registered its first case of the coronavirus weeks after the United States and Canada and the toll of daily infections and deaths in the country reached new peaks over the past few days. 
Mexico has registered 49,219 cases of the coronavirus and 5,177 deaths.

HONG KONG/SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd's (AX:VAH) administrators have short-listed potential buyers BGH Capital, Bain Capital, Indigo Partners and Cyrus Capital Partners, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Monday.
The airline's administrators expected to receive as many as eight non-binding indicative offers from potential buyers before a submission deadline on Friday.
Binding offers for the airline are due on June 12. The company entered voluntary administration last month owing creditors nearly A$7 billion ($4.5 billion), making it the biggest Asia-Pacific casualty of the coronavirus crisis hitting the global aviation industry.
The strong interest in Virgin Australia at a time when the world aviation market is largely grounded shows the long-time attractiveness of the Australian domestic market, a duopoly between Qantas Airways Ltd (AX:QAN) and Virgin.
The administrators at Deloitte said in a statement they had shortlisted a small number of well-funded parties with strong aviation credentials but declined to name them.
Bain, which owns Trans Maldivian Airways, is being advised on its Virgin offer by Jayne Hrdlicka, the former head of Qantas budget airline Jetstar, according to media reports. 
One of BGH's founders, Ben Gray, led a failed takeover offer for Qantas in 2007 when he worked at private equity giant TPG.
Phoenix-based Indigo Partners' founder Bill Franke is the chairman of U.S. budget carrier Frontier Airlines, Chile's JetSmart and Hungarian Wizz Air (L:WIZZ).
Cyrus Capital was an investor in collapsed British regional carrier FlyBe, alongside Virgin Atlantic.
Bain and Indigo Partners declined to comment, while BGH and Cyrus Capital could not be reached immediately for comment.
The shortlisted bidders were first named by The Australian Financial Review. 
Other parties that had put in non-binding indicative offers included Brookfield, India's InterGlobe Enterprises and Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Brookfield on Sunday told the administrators it would exit the process if more than two bidders were shortlisted because it would be unworkable given the tight timeframe, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Brookfield declined to comment.
The administrators said they understood some parties would be disappointed they were not shortlisted and hoped they would respect the decision predicated on the business continuing and achieving the best outcome for all people impacted. 
The shortlisted parties will receive more detailed financial and operational information, management workshops and meetings with as many of the financiers, landlords, suppliers, unions and other stakeholders of the business as possible before making final bids, the administrators said.
They are aiming to agree a deal with the winning party by the end of June.

Under the new offer disclosed on Monday, BGH Capital will pay A$2.40 per Village Roadshow share - a premium of 36% to the stock's last closing price - valuing the Australian entertainment firm at A$468.5 million ($300.82 million).
BGH plans to drop its offer to A$2.20 if Village is not able to reopen its theme parks and cinema halls within three days of a shareholder vote on the proposal, Village said.
Shares of Village soared 13% in early trade to A$1.995 following the news.
In an earlier announcement on Monday, Village said its theme parks and cinema halls would remain closed due to the novel coronavirus outbreak, and that it was in regular contact with local and federal governments about easing physical distancing restrictions imposed to stop the virus spreading.
It said as of April 30, it had A$58 million in cash, A$342 million in gross debt and $5 million in an undrawn debt facility, and that it was in talks with lenders to increase its debt facilities.
The owner of MovieWorld and SeaWorld (NYSE:SEAS) theme parks is one of the most exposed firms to the coronavirus crisis and prior to the mass closure had entertained interest from BGH and private equity peer Pacific Equity Partners (PEP).
BGH had offered A$4.00 per share in January, while PEP bid A$3.90. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment.
BGH - a short-listed bidder for troubled airline  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) - has four weeks of exclusive access to Village's books to come to a binding offer, Village said, adding there was a A$4.29 million break fee.
Village, which also owns a stake in a Los Angeles-based affiliate that produced major Hollywood blockbusters such as ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""Joker"", said another BGH condition was that there be no further deterioration in its operating environment.
UBS is advising Village on the offer.

210,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2020 09:28PM ET</span>",Global Chipmaking Kingpin Gets Dragged into U.S.-China Trade War,"(Bloomberg) -- Since its founding more than three decades ago, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has built its business by working behind the scenes to make customers like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Inc. shine. Now the low-profile chipmaker has landed squarely in the middle of the U.S.-China trade war, an incalculably valuable asset that both sides are vying to control.
The Trump administration opened up a new front in the conflict on Friday by barring any chipmaker using American equipment from supplying China’s Huawei Technologies Co. without U.S. government approval. That means TSMC and rivals will have to cut off Huawei unless they get waivers from the U.S. Commerce Dept.
That would be a financial blow for TSMC, which gets an estimated 14% of its revenue from Huawei, but more importantly it risks provoking retribution from the Chinese government, which already views Taiwan as a breakaway province that belongs to the mainland. The Communist Party has vowed to protect Huawei, a company it regards as a national champion for its success in becoming the world’s top producer of telecommunications equipment -- and a dominant force in the rollout of fifth-generation or 5G networks.
“China likely will retaliate, and investors should brace themselves for a possible trade war escalation,” Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analysts led by Mark Li wrote in a research note on Friday.
Read more: U.S. Tightens Rules to Crack Down on Huawei’s Chip Supply
The latest restrictions inject fresh turmoil into a complex international ecosystem that produces computer parts, while escalating a campaign to contain Huawei’s and China’s technological ascent by cutting it off from vital gear. The U.S. already blacklisted Huawei last year, preventing American companies from supplying the Chinese company unless they got a license. The latest move tightens those restrictions to prevent chipmakers -- American or foreign -- from working with Huawei and its secretive chip-design unit HiSilicon on the cutting-edge semiconductors they need to make smartphones and communications equipment. The Trump administration sees Huawei as a dire security threat, an allegation the company denies.
“We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei and HiSilicon and prevent U.S. technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a tweet.
The U.S. decision is likely to hurt not just Huawei and TSMC, but also a clutch of American players including gear-makers Applied Materials Inc (NASDAQ:AMAT)., KLA and  Lam Research Corp  (NASDAQ:LRCX). themselves,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts wrote. Disruptions to Huawei’s production will also hurt U.S. Customers from Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU). and Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) Inc. to Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) Inc., they said. But “it bears repeating that any escalation of trade tensions is negative for the stocks overall,” they wrote in a research report.
It would have been impossible to imagine TSMC becoming such a coveted chit between the world’s great powers when it was founded in 1987. Morris Chang, born in China and trained in the U.S., started the company as a so-called foundry, manufacturing semiconductors for any customer that didn’t want to construct its own fabrication facility, or fab.
At the time, the business wasn’t nearly as glamorous as making chips yourself. Dominating the industry at the time were companies like  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Inc., which made processors for personal computers. “Real men have fabs,” AMD co-founder Jerry Sanders would say, making clear that was an insult.
But in the intervening years, the foundry industry has become far more strategic for the technology industry. Customers from Apple and Huawei to Qualcomm and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) Corp. have found they can innovate more quickly if they focus on chip designs and then turn to foundries like TSMC to produce them. Innovators in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence or the internet of things also depend on foundries to crack open new markets.
Today, many of the chips for mobile phones, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and any other key technology are made at foundries. TSMC has become the leading foundry in the world by investing heavily in ever more advanced fabs, with annual capital spending of about $16 billion this year.
It can now manufacture at 5 nanometers, about twice the width of human DNA, while China’s top foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., or SMIC, is at 14 nanometers. That makes TSMC’s chips far more powerful and energy efficient.
Huawei and HiSilicon will have few good options if they are cut off from TSMC. One possibility is to procure off-the-shelf chips from Taiwan’s MediaTek Inc. and South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co., an option Huawei’s rotating Chairman Eric Xu mentioned in late March. But even that may no longer be viable under the new Commerce restrictions.
SMIC itself is keen on moving up the technology ladder, eyeing a secondary share listing that could raise more than $3 billion on top of a large capital infusion from the state.

But that’s a longer-term endeavor and Huawei’s products meanwhile are likely to suffer, putting them at risk of falling behind those of rivals like Apple or Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp.
For TSMC, it’s growing ever more difficult to remain neutral amid the growing tensions between the U.S. and China. The company brands itself “everybody’s foundry,” effectively the Switzerland of the tech industry. It supplies Chinese customers like Huawei and the American military, while relying on U.S. producers of semiconductor-making equipment like Applied Materials and Lam Research.
TSMC did take one step closer to the U.S. last week, saying it would build a $12 billion chip plant in Arizona. The Department of Defense has expressed concern that overseas fabs may be vulnerable to cyberattacks and domestic manufacturing would assure a more reliable supply of chips.
The proposal appears to be carefully calculated to address such security issues without too much damage to profits or its political balancing act. Suppliers to the military, such as  Xilinx Inc  (NASDAQ:XLNX)., would be able to use the U.S. fab, but the facility would likely account for less than 5% of revenue so margins won’t be compromised.
It’s not clear if the plans for a U.S. plant will win TSMC leniency in supplying Huawei, however.
“TSMC will not be granted or granted a license based on their intent to build a 5 nanometer fab here in the United States. That’s not part of it at all,” Keith Krach, undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment at the State Department, told reporters on a call. “There’s no assurance on that and we don’t anticipate that.”
Meanwhile, China appears to be preparing to retaliate for the new restrictions on Huawei. On Friday, the Global Times -- a Chinese tabloid run by the flagship newspaper of the Communist Party -- reported Beijing was ready to initiate countermeasures, including imposing restrictions on Apple, suspending the purchase of Boeing (NYSE:BA) airplanes and putting U.S. companies on an ‘unreliable entity list.’
The list will cover “foreign entities that cause actual or potential damage to Chinese companies and industries,” the newspaper said.

211,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 17, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>","Pandemic Exposing U.K. Inequalities in Age, Education and Work","(Bloomberg) -- Inequalities in age, education and work are being exposed and reinforced by the pandemic in the U.K., reports published Monday show.
Children from better-off families are spending 30% more time on educational activities per day than those in the poorest households, a survey from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed. They’re also much more likely to receive online classes or private tutoring. Schools have been closed for most students since March 23 as part of a nationwide lockdown.
Among adults, anxiety is running high that restrictions to rein in the spread of the coronavirus will jeopardize their livelihood. With the country in a deep recession, one out of five workers fear losing employment in the next six months, and 77% believe this crisis will be worse than the slump in 2008, according to a poll from the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (CLASS), a London-based research group.
Those earning low incomes tend to be more vulnerable to reductions in hours, pay cuts or permanent layoffs.
While the government has put in place unprecedented help for furloughed workers, paying 80% of their wages, there’s concerns that jobs will be lost once the program is tapered as changes to the economy become permanent. Tourism and hospitality have been shuttered as a result of the lockdown, with slim chances of a quick rebound.
“The coronavirus has put society in an X-ray machine to reveal its structural weaknesses and it is magnifying existing inequalities,” said Faiza Shaheen, CLASS director. “Protecting workers now requires us looking past emergency measures to a recovery plan.”
Noting that wages for workers in education and social care fell between 2011 and 2019, Shaheen called on the government to raise pay in sectors hit hard by the virus.
Increasing opportunities for young people will also be crucial. Those starting their professional lives in the midst of an economic downturn can suffer negative effects for almost a decade.
Over a quarter of 16 to 25 year-olds say their career prospects have already been damaged, and around half say it will be harder than ever to get a job, according to the Prince’s Trust, a charity that helps young people into jobs, education and training.

The reopening of the plant would be a positive signal for the auto sector in North America, whose supply lines are highly interconnected between the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Workers at the plant in the central state of Guanajuato that has been idled for weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak, had previously been told to plan to return to work on May 18.
GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The message to the plant's workers came after the Mexican government on Friday clarified when the industry could begin easing restrictions imposed because of the health emergency.
On Wednesday, the government said automakers could start going back into production from May 18. It then withdrew that advice and suggested the new start date would be June 1.
Finally it indicated the sector, which forms the backbone of Mexican manufacturing, could begin operating as soon as next week if companies had the required safety measures in place.
U.S. officials and its auto industry have pressed Mexico's government to get its factories open again because American operations depend heavily on parts from south of the border.
However, some politicians are wary of opening too fast. Mexico registered its first case of coronavirus weeks after the United States and Canada and the toll of daily infections and deaths in the country reached new peaks over the past few days.

The Silao production facility, which makes highly profitable pickup trucks for GM, is one of the biggest automotive plants in Guanajuato, a major Mexican carmaking state.

General Atlantic will pick up a 1.34% stake in Jio Platforms which includes movie, music apps as wells telecoms venture Jio Infocomm.
The deal puts Jio Platform's equity value at 4.91 trillion rupees and gives it an enterprise value of 5.16 trillion, Reliance said in a statement.
Reliance, controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, last month forged a $5.7 billion deal with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms.
Days later it secured a $750 million investment from private equity firm Silver Lake.
The deals, along with Reliance's plan to sell $7 billion in new shares, will help the Mumbai-based oil-to-telecoms giant meet its target of eliminating $21.4 billion in net debt this year.
They also underscore the strength of a digital business which Ambani has built over the past four years in an effort to diversify Reliance way from petrochemicals and refining.
Ambani, Asia's richest man, launched the Jio telecoms venture in late 2016, driving several rivals out of the market and pushing others to consolidate.
He's often said ""data is the new oil"".
He has pitched Jio as a tech company with capabilities to build smart homes, making it a possible rival to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Alexa-based solutions, connected cars and security systems.

221,By Reuters,"<span>May 16, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>","J.C. Penney has need for speed in bankruptcy, lawyer says","By Mike Spector
(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) needs to exit bankruptcy proceedings in just a matter of months to survive the unprecedented financial strain of prolonged store closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a lawyer for the iconic U.S. department store chain said during a court hearing on Saturday.
""This company needs to move incredibly quickly through this restructuring. If we don't, the results could be disastrous,"" said Joshua Sussberg, a Kirkland & Ellis LLP lawyer representing the retailer. He unveiled a timeline that foresees the company agreeing to a business plan with lenders by July 15 or else putting itself up for sale.
J.C. Penney, which filed for bankruptcy on Friday, has started reopening some of its more than 800 stores in stages, but concerns remain that customers might be slow to return amid health concerns and job losses not seen since the Great Depression. It plans to close many stores permanently in the weeks ahead.
Even during less-fraught times, many retailers, including Barneys New York Inc and Toys 'R' Us, have failed to reorganize under bankruptcy protection and gone out of business for good. 
The concern for J.C. Penney's precarious position was echoed by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones, who approved the company's requests to continue paying workers and vendors delivering merchandise to stores during a hearing following the retailer's bankruptcy filing in a federal court in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
""You said it's fast, but fair. I want you to know that at least my looking at it says it's not fast enough,"" Jones said of J.C. Penney's plan, encouraging the company to beat its own deadlines. 
""I am very worried about this. It's why I'm having a hearing on a Saturday,"" the judge said later. He also approved the company using $500 million of its cash on hand. 
The judge and a parade of lawyers conducted J.C. Penney's Saturday hearing remotely in proceedings that were live-streamed through video-conference technology as courthouses avoid in-person gatherings.
J.C. Penney, which employs roughly 85,000 people, envisions handing control to lenders and reducing a significant portion of its nearly $5 billion of debt after reorganizing into two companies. One would be a company operating its business while the other would be a real estate investment trust holding some of the company's property, plans previously reported by Reuters.
The Plano, Texas-based company reached agreement before its Chapter 11 filing for $450 million of fresh financing from existing lenders. Another $450 million of current debt is to be ""rolled up"" and given the same legal status as that funding. 
J.C. Penney's negotiations are set to continue with investment firms holding its senior debt, which include H/2 Capital Partners LLC, Sixth Street Partners, Ares Management Corp (N:ARES), KKR & Co (N:KKR) and Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO) , among others, Sussberg said. 
Sussberg said the company hopes to persuade lenders to support its reorganization, which will require significant funding. ""A lot of that's dependent on performance and unknowns,"" he said.
Should the company and its lenders fail to agree on a standalone reorganization, J.C. Penney will pursue a sale. It is already in talks with possible buyers, Sussberg said. 
The company had hoped to give new Chief Executive Jill Soltau, who arrived in late 2018, more time to forge a turnaround by negotiating with creditors for some financial breathing room but those talks did not bear fruit.
J.C. Penney was struggling before the pandemic with declining sales and profits amid a consumer shift to online shopping, but Sussberg insisted the company had a turnaround plan in place.
Critics pointing to other reasons for the company's bankruptcy filing are ""dead wrong,"" he said. ""This is absolutely about the coronavirus.""

Jones said the company's 85,000 employees were counting on lawyers at the hearing. ""Retail cases have to move, and they have to move quickly,"" the judge said. ""I want to keep everybody's eyes focused on saving the business. This is middle America, at least in my view.""

Formed following the $2.3 billion acquisition of Texas shale oil properties in 2017, Gavilan listed secured debt of more than $550 million in its filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. 
It plans to sell its assets, according to the filing. It has hired investment banker Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Freres & Co and named attorneys Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Vinson & Elkins as bankruptcy advisers. 
Oil prices this year are off more than 60%, hurt by a collapse in demand for fuels due to coronavirus-related lockdowns and a market glut spurred by shale and a battle for market share among the world's top producers. 
Gavilan's bankruptcy comes amid an ""increasingly unworkable relationship"" with partner Sanchez Energy Corp, the filing said. The pair acquired 155,000 acres in Texas' Eagle Ford Shale oil field from Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC). 
Blackstone declined to comment. 
Gavilan and Sanchez have been embroiled in a lawsuit over the development and ownership of the properties. That lawsuit is set to resume May 22. 
Sanchez also filed for Chapter 11 last year blaming low prices and the more than $2 billion in debt it took on to help it grow through acquisitions. Its restructuring plan has been confirmed but is not yet effective, the court filing said. 
This year's oil-price collapse has led debt-laden shale producers including Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) to seek to restructure their loans. In April, Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) became the largest shale bankruptcy since the coronavirus pandemic cut demand.

The Italian-American group confirmed on Saturday its Italian unit was working with Rome to obtain state guarantees on a 6.3-billion-euro ($6.8 billion) loan facility designed to help Italy's automotive industry, comprised of approximately 10,000 small and medium-size businesses. 
The coronavirus outbreak, which has hit Italy especially hard, slammed the brakes on demand for new vehicles and forced automakers to halt most production, burning cash.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) said in a statement that talks were ongoing with lender  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP) for a three-year credit facility exclusively dedicated to the group's activities in Italy. 
Asked whether FCA, which has its legal headquarters in the Netherlands, could get a loan guaranteed by the Italian government, Conte said the group qualified.
""We're not talking about the parent company, we're talking about the group's companies in Italy, which employ thousands of people,"" the prime minister said. 
FCA runs several plants and research and development centres in Italy, directly employing around 55,000 people. 
In addition, over 200,000 people work in Italy's 5,500 parts suppliers and 120,000 people in car dealers and service companies, with the automotive industry accounting for 6.2% of Italy's domestic product, FCA said.
News that FCA was asking the Italian government for liquidity support had raised criticism.
The ruling party PD's deputy president, Andrea Orlando, earlier on Saturday said on Twitter that if a company asked the Italian government for sizeable financing, it had to bring back its legal base to Italy.
The scheme is part of emergency measures the Italian government is making available to the country's businesses. It offers more than 400 billion euros' worth of liquidity and bank loans to companies hit by the pandemic.
FCA said the state-backed credit facility it is seeking will have ""the sole purpose of providing operational support for payments to Italian suppliers to support their liquidity and, at the same, supporting the restart of production and investment at Italian plants.""

The group has gradually restarted operations in Italy since the end of April.

Manfred Weber, a senior German conservative and head of the centre-right EPP grouping in the EU Parliament, told Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper that he was in favour of declaring a twelve-month ban for Chinese investors who want to buy European firms.
""We have to see that Chinese companies, partly with the support of state funds, are increasingly trying to buy up European companies that are cheap to acquire or that got into economic difficulties due to the coronavirus crisis,"" he said.
The European Union therefore should react in a coordinated way and put an end to the ""Chinese shopping tour"" by imposing a twelve-month moratorium on sales of European companies until the coronavirus crisis is hopefully over, Weber said.
""We have to protect ourselves,"" he added.
China and the EU launched negotiations on a comprehensive investment agreement in 2013, and have held numerous rounds of talks since then. Sticking points have included reciprocal market access and a level playing field.
Chinese and EU leaders are slated to meet at a special summit in September, though the coronavirus pandemic has cast some doubt on whether the meeting can go ahead as planned.
""China will be our biggest competitor in the future, in economic, social and political terms,"" Weber said. ""I view China as the strategic competitor for Europe, that represents an authoritarian model of society, that wants to expand its power and replace the United States as a leading power.""
Europe should take China seriously and show respect for the country as a world power, ""but above all we have to be vigilant,"" Weber said.
The German government agreed last month to tighten rules to protect domestic firms from unwanted takeovers by investors from non-European Union countries.
The move comes at a time when Europe's biggest economy, and the EU as a whole, are reconsidering relations with China in the face of increased investment in critical sectors by Chinese state-owned enterprises.
German officials have described the Chinese takeover in 2016 of Bavarian robotics firm  Kuka  (DE:KU2G) as a wake-up call that underlined the need to shield strategic parts of the economy.

An attempt by China's State Grid in 2018 to buy a stake in power grid operator 50Hertz also focused German minds. After Berlin failed to find an alternative private investor in Europe, German state-owned bank KfW stepped in to keep the Chinese out.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday he would look at possible ways to help airlines further, but laid out no new measures after the country's biggest airline announced mass layoffs due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Air Canada said on Friday it would cut its workforce by up to 60% as the airline tries to save cash amid the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust to a lower level of traffic.
""This pandemic has hit extremely hard on travel industries and on the airlines particularly,"" Trudeau said in a briefing in Ottawa. ""That's why we're going to keep working with airlines, including Air Canada, to see how we can help even more.""
Canada has already put in place a wage subsidy to try to keep more Canadian workers on payrolls, and recently announced loans for large employers.
Trudeau sidestepped questions about whether his government may take an equity stake in Air Canada to help it survive, and whether its layoffs suggest the wage subsidy is not working.
Restoring demand for flights is likely to take years, John Gradek, lecturer at McGill University's Global Aviation Leadership Program, told CBC News.
""My interpretation is that Air Canada is playing hardball with the government, indicating that ... the industry is going to need billions.""
Asked why Air Canada did not use the government's wage subsidy instead of issuing layoffs, a representative of the airline repeated a statement that normal traffic levels ""will not be returning anytime soon.""
Canada's coronavirus death toll rose 1.7% to 5,595 from the previous day, reflecting a declining mortality rate. Total cases rose to nearly 75,000.
Trudeau also said his government had approved the first Canadian clinical trials of a potential COVID-19 vaccine, at Dalhousie University's Canadian Center for Vaccinology in Nova Scotia.
The candidate vaccine was developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics, two Canadian government spokesmen said.
Canada's National Research Council on Tuesday said it was collaborating with CanSino to ""pave the way"" for future Canadian trials.
The council will work with manufacturers so that the vaccine can be produced in Canada if the trials are successful, Trudeau said.
Even as the countries collaborated on a possible vaccine, China's consulate in Calgary rebuked Alberta Premier Jason Kenney for earlier critical remarks. 
Kenney said on Thursday that China would face a ""great reckoning"" for trying to cover up the dangers posed by the new coronavirus when it first appeared, the Canadian Press reported.
The consulate, in a statement on its website, said ""facts and data"" prove that China did no such thing. 
""We are defending ourselves with facts and reasons rather than slander and stigma,"" it said. 

Kenney's spokeswoman said his comments speak for themselves.

The report comes a day after the $300 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) disclosed its stakes in major U.S. companies including Boeing (N:BA), Facebook (O:FB) and  Citigroup  (N:C).
The wealth fund is in talks with investment banks regarding a margin loan backed by some of its investments in Vision Fund, the report said, citing sources.
PIF's decision to pledge stake happens amid time when SoftBank's finances are being squeezed after a disastrous bet on co-working firm WeWork and souring portfolio bets on startups.
Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) said last month it expected the $100 billion Vision Fund to book a loss of 1.8 trillion yen due to the worsening performance of its tech bets, which will tip the group as a whole into its first loss for 15 years.
PIF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

DUBAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund has bought minority stakes in major American companies including Boeing (NYSE:BA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C), a regulatory filing showed, giving it a portfolio of nearly $10 billion in U.S.-listed stocks.
The $300 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying minority stakes in companies across the world, taking advantage of market weakness in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.
The PIF disclosed stakes worth $713.7 million in Boeing, ABOUT $522 million in Citigroup, $522 million in Facebook, $495.8 million in Disney and $487.6 million in Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing https:// on Friday showed. 
The PIF has a nearly $514 million stake in Marriott and a small holding in Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa), according to the filing. The PIF also disclosed an $827.7 million stake in oil company BP (NYSE:BP), which has American Depository Receipts (ADRs) listed in the United States.
""The Saudi sovereign fund went shopping in Q1,"" tweeted Ali Al-Salim, co-founder of Dubai-based consulting firm Arkan Partners, adding that it now held about $10 billion in U.S.-listed equities, up from $2 billion at the start of the year.
PIF's strategy is two-pronged; building an international portfolio of investments and investing locally in projects that will help reduce Saudi Arabia's reliance on oil.
""PIF is a patient investor with a long-term horizon. As such, we actively seek strategic opportunities both in Saudi Arabia and globally that have strong potential to generate significant long-term returns while further benefiting the people of Saudi Arabia and driving the country's economic growth,"" the sovereign wealth fund said in a statement. 
""These opportunities include sectors and companies that are well positioned to drive economies and lead sectors moving forward.""
ENERGY GIANTS
The PIF has separately funded almost half of Japanese investor SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, which has been hit by losses on technology bets.
Last month the PFI's head, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said it was looking into investment opportunities in areas such as aviation, oil and gas, and entertainment, adding that there would be a lot of potential for investment opportunities once the coronavirus crisis passes.
The PIF disclosed an 8.2% stake in coronavirus-hit Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp in April, sending the cruise operator's shares nearly 30% higher. 
The Saudi fund bought stakes in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa), Total, Eni and Equinor earlier this year , a source familiar with the transactions told Reuters on April 9.
The SEC filing on Friday showed it had a $483.6 million stake in Shell, a $222.3 million holding in Total and a $481 million stake in Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU). 
An earlier filing in Norway had shown the PIF had a 0.3% stake in oil and gas firm Equinor.
PIF already has a $2 billion stake in Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) and electric car company Lucid Motors. It used to own a small stake in electric carmaker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), but the latest filing did not show any exposure.

The company listed allegations based on interviews with 168 migrant workers in Malaysia and 187 in Thailand that included passport retention, unexplained and illegal wage reductions, heavy indebtedness to labour brokers and excessive overtime work.
In Malaysia, the passports of 68 Indonesian and 171 Nepali workers were withheld, while 15 passports and up to 30 work permits were withheld by a supplier in Thailand.
""All passports were returned to workers and new policies and procedures introduced for when passports are required for work permit renewal or other government purposes,"" it said in the undated document.
Tesco also found that levels of indebtedness to service or labour providers were higher in Malaysia.
The firm has developed a plan to look further into the situation, including detailed investigations of specific allegations, setting up support lines and grievance mechanisms for agency workers in their home languages and guidelines to ensure workers have access to passports whenever needed.
Tesco will also train managers on diversity and inclusion, review and improve accommodation and worker welfare audits, provide full remediation, including the repayment of recruitment fees, and shift to recruit migrant workers directly as a preference.
Tesco commissioned an independent human rights consultancy, Impactt, in September last year to conduct an assessment of migrant workers' rights in stores and distribution centres in both countries. It also receives intelligence internally and from suppliers.

230,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. Justice Dept. subpoenas Wall Street banks for small business loans info - sources,"By Koh Gui Qing and Pete Schroeder
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has sent grand jury subpoenas to big banks seeking records as part of a broader investigation into potential abuse of a $660 billion emergency loan program to help small businesses hurt by the novel coronavirus, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The previously unreported subpoenas issued by the department's Washington fraud division do not necessarily indicate wrongdoing on the part of the banks, but will compound growing worries among lenders that they risk being swept up in a federal crackdown on Paycheck Protection Program fraud.      
The program allows small businesses hurt by the pandemic to apply with lenders for a government-backed loan which can be forgiven provided at least 75% is spent on payroll costs. 
Policymakers worry that the huge pot of cash has been a magnet for fraudsters, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned that companies found to have lied to secure loans could face prosecution. The Justice Department opened a probe into the program last month and has already brought criminal charges against borrowers it alleges lied about the state of their businesses and numbers of employees. 
Due to their critical role in processing the loans, banks have reams of information that could point to other fraud. 
Grand jury subpoenas allow prosecutors to get their hands on a range of private financial and personal records and to hear witness testimony as part of a criminal investigation. 
Recipients are not necessarily the subject of a probe and can be a cooperating witness. 
""Right now, we don't think banks are 100% the target,"" said one of the sources, but added: ""There are concerns that there will be a boomerang effect six months down the road on banks that they didn't do enough.""
A third person with direct knowledge of industry interactions with the Justice Department said the agency wanted to scan banks' records for possible wrongdoing by borrowers. 
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. 
The first two sources said major banks had received the subpoenas, but did not provide names. Industry data shows JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co,  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co were among the biggest banks to participate in the program.
The banks all declined to comment on Friday. 
Wells Fargo said in a regulatory filing this month that it had received ""formal and informal inquiries"" from federal agencies regarding PPP loans, but did not elaborate.
'HELD HARMLESS'
As the government raced to launch PPP in April, bank trade groups raised concerns with the Treasury and the Small Business Administration, which jointly administer the program, that the rush to get the funds to businesses in just days would expose them to too much legal risk. 
The agencies subsequently agreed that lenders could rely on borrower certifications and specified documents to determine their eligibility and use of the loans. Banks would be ""held harmless"" if borrowers broke the rules or lied. 
However, that pledge would not preclude the Justice Department from pursuing banks if the agency found evidence or identified patterns that suggested loan officers facilitated fraud, or wilfully ignored it, legal experts said.
In addition, the program still requires banks to conduct anti-money laundering checks which could have tripped some lenders up, said lawyers.
The third source said Wall Street banks are also worried that a Democratic administration would rip up their agreement with the current administration and launch a crackdown on lenders if they win the presidential election on Nov. 3.
Joe Biden, the former Democratic vice president expected to challenge Trump for the presidency, has said a comprehensive review of coronavirus stimulus relief will be a top priority.

Lenders are already in the crosshairs of Democrats in Congress, who have also asked for data on the loans, as have attorney generals in New York and Massachusetts.

231,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 08:55PM ET</span>",J.C. Penney files for bankruptcy protection,"By Mike Spector
NEW YORK(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Friday with plans to permanently close some stores and also explore a possible sale, making it the latest brick-and-mortar retailer to crumble as prolonged store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic drive a final stake through long-troubled businesses. 
The U.S. department store chain, known for selling family apparel, cosmetics and jewelry at roughly 850 locations, said it reached an agreement with existing lenders for $900 million of debtor-in-possession financing to aid operations while it navigates bankruptcy proceedings in federal court in Corpus Christi, Texas.
The loan consists of $450 million in fresh financing, the company said. The balance is made up of existing debt being ""rolled up"" to be given the same legal status as the new funding that J.C. Penney obtained, people familiar with the matter said. The retailer said it had an additional $500 million in cash on hand before the bankruptcy filing.
While J.C. Penney plans to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy proceedings after eliminating several billion dollars of debt, it will also explore a sale as part of the terms of its new financing, the company said. Reuters earlier reported that the company was nearing a bankruptcy filing and negotiating the financing. 
The company on Friday said it would begin closing some stores permanently in phases and would disclose further details in coming weeks. People familiar with the matter previously told Reuters that the company initially plans to permanently shutter roughly 200 stores, saying the figure could fluctuate depending on negotiations with creditors.
The bankruptcy filing caps a long decline for the 118-year-old department store chain, which once operated more than 1,600 locations that became fixtures in U.S. malls. The company at one point employed nearly 200,000 people. 
Even before the coronavirus outbreak, J.C. Penney was struggling with nearly $4 billion of debt and pressure from both discount retailers and e-commerce companies. 
Larger retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) have squeezed smaller rivals by offering bargain-price apparel, including online. 
IN THE FOOTSTEP OF OTHER BANKRUPTCIES
The coronavirus outbreak, which has resulted in more than 80,000 deaths in the United States, is now forcing a financial reckoning among an array of retailers that had to temporarily close their doors under states' orders. Other retailers already grappling with customers' abandonment of traditional stores for online shopping have also resorted to bankruptcy filings. 
Earlier this month, both luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus Group and clothing retailer J. Crew Group Inc filed for bankruptcy protection after alternative attempts to rework their finances failed. Stage Stores Inc, a U.S. department store chain selling mid-priced apparel at hundreds of stores in mostly rural areas, said earlier this week it would liquidate unless it finds a buyer.
Like other retailers, J.C. Penney has started reopening its stores in stages as many states have begun to loosen coronavirus restrictions. But with U.S. unemployment now at the highest level since the Great Depression of the 1930s, there are serious concerns that consumer spending will remain dampened for a prolonged stretch. 
Against that backdrop, J.C. Penney faced a looming $105 million debt payment in June and $300 million of annual interest expenses. Adding to pressure was an unprecedented span of lost sales and uncertainty whether shoppers concerned about their health would return to stores.
J.C. Penney negotiated with creditors earlier this year for more financial breathing room, hoping to give its new chief executive, Jill Soltau, additional time to forge a turnaround focused on the company's roots as a seller of affordable apparel for middle-class families. The talks did not bear fruit.
The coronavirus crisis forced J.C. Penney to prepare for a bankruptcy filing to address its strained finances, which on the horizon included more than $2 billion of debt coming due in 2023. 
In March, the company drew down $1.25 billion from its credit line. It later skipped debt payments, triggering grace periods to make good before defaulting that expired this week. The company made one of those overdue payments before filing for bankruptcy.
Under one plan being discussed, J.C. Penney would emerge from bankruptcy as two separate companies, the sources said. One would own some of the company's real estate and serve as a landlord to the other entity that would operate the retailer's business, they said. Creditors, many of them Wall Street hedge funds, would control the businesses in exchange for forgiving debt, they said. 
The company earlier this month resolved a legal dispute with Sephora, the French beauty chain owned by LVMH that had threatened to end its agreement to sell cosmetics inside J.C. Penney stores. 
Days before seeking bankruptcy protection, J.C. Penney paid nearly $10 million in bonuses to top executives. The company said it was ""taking necessary steps to retain our talented management team,"" which made strides on the company's turnaround plan before the COVID-19 pandemic. 
FROM RURAL ROOTS TO U.S. MAINSTAY
James Cash Penney founded the eponymous retailer with partners in 1902. Averse to the haggling that was common at the time, he believed prices should be low, set and marked, an attitude that served as a precursor to modern shopping, according to the J.C. Penney Museum in Hamilton, Missouri, the founder's hometown. 
The company's first store, opened in Wyoming, was called ""The Golden Rule,"" a reference to what the retailer viewed as its standard for customer service, according to its website. 
J.C. Penney stores initially dotted Main Streets in rural towns dominated by farmers. After expanding to operate more than 30 stores, it went public in 1929. 
By the 1970s, J.C. Penney had become a mainstay across the United States. The following decade, it acquired a bank, and later drugstores before eventually divesting both businesses. 
The e-commerce revolution that took root in the 21st century rocked nearly every corner of the traditional retail landscape and eroded J.C. Penney's business much as it did those of its rivals. In recent years, J.C. Penney has closed hundreds of stores and cut thousands of jobs. 
The company has also faced fierce competition from discount chains including TJX (NYSE:TJX) Cos Inc’s Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
J.C. Penney suffered a significant setback after a failed transformation attempt spearheaded by former CEO Ron Johnson, the one-time pioneer of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s retail stores. Johnson launched expensive renovations of J.C. Penney locations and eliminated coupons, resulting in a customer backlash that led to plunging sales. He was replaced in 2013.
Soltau took the reins in late 2018 after a revolving door of executives, and attempted to return J.C. Penney to its roots as a seller of affordable apparel for middle-class families. She jettisoned the company's appliance business and mostly abandoned its furniture offerings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S.-China ""Phase 1"" trade deal reached in January is not falling apart and the two countries are still working to implement it, the White House's top economic adviser said on Friday, but President Donald Trump added that he was not ""thrilled"" with the agreement.
Larry Kudlow told reporters at the White House the trade deal ""is continuing,"" a day after Trump suggested he could cut ties with the world's second-largest economy. 
In an interview with Fox Business Network broadcast on Thursday, Trump said he was very disappointed with China's failure to contain the coronavirus outbreak and that the pandemic had cast a pall over the trade deal with Beijing that he considers a major achievement.
Tensions between the world's two largest economies have spiked in recent weeks, with officials on both sides suggesting the hard-fought trade deal that defused a bitter 18-month trade war could be abandoned.
Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, was asked if the trade deal was falling apart. ""Absolutely not,"" he said. 
The Chinese are working toward holding up their end of the agreement, which calls for Beijing to boost purchases of American farm goods, manufactured products, energy and services by $200 billion over two years, Kudlow said.
""They're a little slow on the commodity purchases. I think that has a lot to do with market and economic positions,"" he said.
Kudlow's comments came at the end of a week of complaints from Trump about China's early handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and separate steps by his government to crack down on China's blacklisted telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies  and curb U.S. investment in some Chinese companies.
On Thursday, Trump said he now feels differently about the trade deal and may even cut economic ties with Beijing.
Asked at a White House Rose Garden event on Friday whether he is planning to impose additional tariffs on China or tear up the trade deal, Trump said: ""I don't want to talk about it. I can say China is buying a lot of our product. But the trade deal, the ink was barely dry when this (the virus) came in from China, so it's not like we're thrilled.""
Kudlow noted what he described as a successful phone call last week with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Liu He, China's vice premier, as well as a positive deputies call on Thursday night.
""We have other issues with China, and of course the origin of the virus ... but with respect to the trade deal, it is continuing, absolutely,"" Kudlow said.
Earlier this week, the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which oversees billions in federal retirement dollars, said it would indefinitely delay plans to invest in some Chinese companies that are under scrutiny in Washington.

And on Friday, the Commerce Department moved to block supplies to Huawei, spurring threats of Chinese retaliation against U.S. companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Boeing (NYSE:BA).

(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) said on Friday it has sold much of its stake in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), despite the billionaire's assurance that the banking sector was not a ""primary worry"" for him during the coronavirus pandemic.
In a regulatory filing detailing its U.S.-listed investments as of March 31, Berkshire said its Goldman stake fell 84% to 1.9 million shares, from 12 million at year-end, with the stake's market value dropping to $297 million from $2.76 billion.
Goldman's stock price fell about 33% during the quarter, and some of Berkshire's selling appears to have occurred after the slide began.
Berkshire sold its remaining small stakes in the insurer Travelers Cos (N:TRV) and oil refiner Phillips 66 (N:PSX), and tweaked several holdings. Its stake in  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) was unchanged, though the stock's price fell 47%.
A request for comment to Buffett's assistant was not immediately returned. Berkshire has more than 90 operating units including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen ice cream and its namesake energy business.
Investors monitor Berkshire's quarterly filings to see where Buffett and his portfolio managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs see value. Buffett normally directs larger investments such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL).
The Goldman stake originated in a $5 billion preferred stock investment at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, in a vote of confidence by Buffett for the Wall Street bank.
Berkshire's selling was disclosed after Buffett said at the May 2 annual shareholders' meeting of his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate that banks were now well-capitalized and capable of weathering economic distress from the pandemic.
""If problems become severe enough in an economy, even strong banks can be under a lot of stress, and we'll be very glad we've got the Federal Reserve system standing behind them,"" he said.
""Overall the banking system is not going to be the problem,"" he added. ""They are not a primary worry of mine at all.""
Berkshire remains a major shareholder in  American Express  (N:AXP), Bank of America (N:BAC), Bank of New York Mellon (N:BK), JPMorgan Chase (N:JPM), PNC Financial (N:PNC), US Bancorp (N:USB) and Wells Fargo.
Maeve DuVally, a Goldman spokeswoman, declined immediate comment.
Doug Kass, managing partner at Seabreeze Capital Investment Inc, called the Goldman stock sale ""not surprising,"" following Berkshire's sale of 6.3 million Goldman shares in the fourth quarter.

Berkshire ended March with a record $137.3 billion of cash, disappointing investors unhappy with the low yields it generates for the company. The cash stake likely rose in April as Berkshire sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines: American (O:AAL), Delta (N:DAL), Southwest (N:LUV) and United (O:UAL).

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state development bank BNDES said on Friday that the country's top three airlines had accepted a $680 million aid package, but two carriers said they were still discussing terms.
Brazilian airlines are clamoring for help as the COVID-19 pandemic ravages the travel industry, but negotiations were deadlocked for over a month until a formal proposal was issued by the Brazilian government this week.
""What we can say is true: We sent a proposal to the airlines this week and yesterday they all accepted,"" BNDES President Gustavo Montezano told reporters on Friday.
However, airlines  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) and LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM) denied that they had accepted the proposal and were still negotiating.
""LATAM Airlines Brasil confirms it is interested in the BNDES proposal,"" the company said in a statement. ""However, negotiations continue.""
Brazil's largest domestic airline, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4) declined to comment on Friday.
The government's latest offer totals 4 billion reais ($683 million) and is a mix of state loans through the BNDES, loans from private banks and funding raised in capital markets.
Brazil's three airlines have said in the past that they are interested but they have balked at outright accepting the terms because BNDES was asking for potential equity ownership in the companies.
Azul expressed disappointment on Thursday at the size of the rescue package, after initial reports that it would be more than twice as large.
Still, the airlines agree they want to benefit from aid. Azul said it has enough cash to run for a year under the current scenario, while Gol said it could run for 10 months.
The airlines have cut capacity by over 90% in Brazil and put tens of thousands of workers on unpaid leave to preserve cash.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM), the region's largest carrier, will lay off 1,400 employees, the company said on Friday, marking the first instance of a major Latin American airline laying off staff because of the coronavirus crisis. 
LATAM confirmed the layoffs, representing about 3% of the company's workforce, after Reuters reported on an internal video that was sent to employees. 
""Unfortunately, we have concluded that we have no other option but to downsize the company,"" CEO Roberto Alvo said in the video. 
LATAM is the first airline to announce layoffs in the region, although several others are not paying employees but have not formally let them go. 
Brazil's No. 3 airline  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) has 78% of its employees on unpaid leave. Larger rivals Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4) and Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) have about half of their employees unpaid. 

LATAM had already slashed the wages of its 43,000 employees in half.

The new rule gives banks the option of excluding holdings in Treasury securities of deposits held at the Federal Reserve from calculating their ""supplemental leverage ratio,"" which directs larger banks to hold more capital against their assets. The rule builds on similar relief provided to bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve in April during the new coronavirus outbreak.

BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. fund managers piled into big-name technology stocks and bottom-fished in the beaten-down energy sector as markets reeled from the coronavirus-fueled selloff in the first quarter, regulatory filings released on Friday showed. 
They also cut exposure in restaurants, retail and airlines as the mounting number of deaths from the coronavirus -- which have now topped 86,000 in the United States -- forced shutdowns of virtually all nonessential businesses in most U.S. states.
The first quarter was marked by a 20% plunge in the Standard & Poor's 500 index and a swelling of the jobless ranks by the millions. While the filings are backward-looking, they give a glimpse of what investors did during a historic stock market selloff and the start of an economic crisis that is being likened to the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Technology giants including  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc and  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) saw fresh buying from fund managers as their earnings were expected to stay comparatively steady this year. Hedge funds Viking Global Investors, Maverick Capital, Moore Capital Management and Arrowstreet Capital all increased their positions in Microsoft, which reported sharp demand for its Microsoft Teams product as offices and schools transitioned online as stay-in-place orders forced Americans to work and study from home.
Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Family Office increased its holding in Amazon by 713%. Amazon shares hit an all-time high on April 30 thanks in part to rising demand for consumer products at a time when many small retailers have closed. Druckenmiller also raised his investment in Facebook by 75%, the filing shows.
CONTRARIAN BETS
Several prominent fund managers took contrarian bets on the energy sector as a supply glut caused the price of oil to tumble to 20-year lows and briefly turned oil futures negative in April for the first time in history. 
Dmitry Balyasny's Balyasny Asset Management bought an additional 2.9 million shares in oil and natural gas exploration company  Noble Energy  (NASDAQ:NBL), raising its stake by 565%. Cinctive Capital Management, a new hedge fund that employs teams of traders like Balyasny, increased its position in Noble (NYSE:NE) by 300%. Noble's stock has surged 89% since March 23. Cinctive also bought into  Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO), whose stock price has jumped 85% since March 23.
As segments of the U.S. economy were shuttered by the lockdowns, fund managers hustled out of stocks that would suffer as business ground to a halt. Viking cut its stake in ride-hailing company Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) by 31% while Coatue Management reduced its Uber ownership by 58%, the filings show. 
Coatue also liquidated its position in retailer J.C. Penney, which is expected to file for bankruptcy soon, by selling 3.4 million shares.
With travel stalled, casinos and resorts struggled. Mutual fund company T. Rowe Price cut its stake in MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM) International, which owns the Bellagio in Las Vegas, 30% by selling 16 million shares.
But some hedge funds saw opportunity in the hospitality industry. Viking added a new position in  Las Vegas Sands  (NYSE:LVS) Corp, while hedge fund Long Pond Capital added new positions in MGM Resorts and Marriott Vacations, and more than tripled its existing position in Wyndham Hotel and Resorts, bringing it to more than 8% of its portfolio.
Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund manager in the world, sold its entire stake in several large financial companies, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). 
The firm added positions in consumer staples such as  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) and bulk retailer Costco (NASDAQ:COST). Bridgewater also added a position in  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), whose shares have fallen by more than 50% since January to a three-decade low amid concerns about cratering demand in the airline industry.

238,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>","Wall Street ends up after swings on reopening hopes, weak data, trade woes","By Sinéad Carew
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes closed higher after swinging between gains and losses on Friday as investors weighed worries about Sino-U.S. trade relations and weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data against growing optimism that easing coronavirus restrictions would boost activity this month. 
Economic data painted a grim picture on Friday as U.S. retail sales and manufacturing output showed record declines in April due to virus-related stay-at-home orders.
The data came after U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up trade tensions with China by moving to block semiconductor shipments to China's Huawei Technologies from global chipmakers. The trade worries sent the Philadelphia Semiconductor index (SOX) down more than 2%.
China was swift to respond with a report saying it was ready to put U.S. companies on an ""unreliable entity list,"" according to the Global Times.
The combination of trade tensions and weak data had sent S&P 500 down around 1.3% earlier in the session but for much of the afternoon session it oscillated between positive and negative territory. 
""We got the Friday jitters on China trade but late this afternoon the market turned its focus on reopenings,"" said John Augustine, chief investment officer at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio. 
""We're smack in the middle of May and think this might be the worst of the economic numbers. There's a chance they start to slowly turn positive,"" said Augustine citing moves by most states to at least partially reopen their economies. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 60.08 points, or 0.25%, to 23,685.42, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 11.2 points, or 0.39%, to 2,863.7 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 70.84 points, or 0.79%, to 9,014.56.
However, for the week S&P 500 fell 2.3%, for its biggest weekly drop since the week of March 20. The Dow dropped 2.7% for the week while the Nasdaq declined 1.2%, marking their biggest weekly drops since the week ended April 3.
Six of the 11 major S&P sectors closed higher, led by a 1.3% gain in communications services (SPLRCL). Utilities (SPLRCU) was the weakest with a 1.4% drop followed by a 0.7% drop in financial stocks (SPSY). 
""Today has very much been about this battle of conflicting factors,"" said Ed Perks, multi-asset solutions' chief investment officer at Franklin Templeton, adding that without ""something that's going to give us direction"" investors are viewing it as a lackluster Friday after a long week. 
The small-cap Russell 2000 (RUT) outperformed, with a 1.6% gain. One of its stocks, Sorrento Therapeutics Inc (O:SRNE), closed 158% higher after its experimental antibody candidate showed potential in blocking COVID-19 infections in early studies.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.41-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.69-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 16 new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.36 billion shares, compared to the 11.39 billion average for the last 20 trading days.

241,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 04:55PM ET</span>",Investors prepare for more U.S. stock swings as states reopen,"By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are bracing for more turbulence in U.S. stocks, as some states prepare to reopen their economies and global trade tensions rise.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, posted its biggest weekly gain in about two months, reflecting the S&P 500 index's (SPX) 2.6% slide from its April 29 high. VIX futures have jumped as well, with investors pricing elevated risk into June contracts.
Whether recent losses in stocks resulted from profit taking after April's swift rally or were the start of a prolonged decline may become more apparent in weeks to come, investors said. 
Many are watching progress of U.S. states trying to reopen their economies without fueling a resurgence in coronavirus cases. Parts of New York, Virginia and Maryland moved toward lifting lockdowns on Friday, and Connecticut and Minnesota are set to ease restrictions in the coming week.
""We don't know what the new normal will be,"" said Alessio de Longis, portfolio manager at Invesco (NYSE:IVZ). ""The managing of expectations will lead to some false steps along the way.""
For now, a pile-up of worrying domestic and international news prompted investors to pull back on equities after the S&P 500 in April notched its best monthly gain in decades.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up rhetoric on China, floating the possibility of cutting ties with the world's second-largest economy. The White House on Friday moved to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] from global chipmakers, which could put pressure on a global economy already suffering its deepest contraction in decades.
Hopes for a speedy return to normal took another hit when California's state university system canceled classes for the fall semester because of the coronavirus and Los Angeles County said its stay-at-home order was likely to be extended by three months.
""What we're seeing now is the wash of realism coming over the market,"" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private.
The VIX on Monday touched its lowest level since late February before reversing course as expectations for market volatility grew later in the week.
Concerns over economic reopening are reflected in the VIX futures curve, which shows investors betting volatility will be elevated in coming weeks, rather than later in the summer, said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.
The curve has fluctuated in shape over the past week. On Tuesday, front-month VIX futures (VXc1) traded at higher prices than futures expiring in subsequent months, reflecting heightened concern over near-term conditions. While that is no longer the case for now, VIX futures are broadly pricing in higher volatility than they were a week ago.
Several investors are positioning for further turbulence by shunning value sectors such as energy and financials in favor of technology and healthcare, two areas that have held up relatively well during recent market turmoil.
Andrew Graham (NYSE:GHM), managing partner at Jackson Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital in San Francisco, has focused on stocks he believes can maintain high dividend yields, especially within the pharmaceutical industry. His firm owns shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (N:BMY),  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV) and  Merck & Co  Inc (N:MRK).
Investors will also watch the U.S. Treasury Department's first auction for its 20-year bond on Wednesday. Treasury plans to borrow a record amount of nearly $3 trillion this quarter. 
Some investors said they were likely to keep equities at a slight underweight in their portfolios given the likelihood of further declines. 
Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, believes the recent stock rally did not factor in the likelihood of businesses operating below their usual capacity even if states reopened their economies. 

""Yes, there's going to be a strong growth rate from the bottom, but the place we're getting back to is going to be subpar for a while,"" Lafferty said. ""Are stocks priced for subpar growth? I think they aren't.""

Investing.com – Wall Street closed above session lows on Friday, led by a rebound in large-cap tech stocks, but couldn't avert its worst weekly slump since March as investors had to contend with weaker economic data and rising U.S-China trade tensions.
The S&P 500 gained 0.43%, but still recorded its worst weekly performance since the week ended March 29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.25%, or 60 points, after falling by as many as 271 points intraday, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.79%.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that retail sales fell 16.4% last month, worse than the 12% decline expected. But the prior month's numbers were upwardly revised to -8.3%.The retail sales control group, which has a larger impact on U.S. GDP, fell 15.3%.
The weaker backdrop for consumer spending, however, is expected to get a boost from pent-up demand and the recent stimulus rolled out by Congress.
""The pronounced weakness in April sales sets the stage for a bounce in May spending, which could be significant,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""There is near-term support from stimulus payments which were largely saved in April, and a good deal of pent-up demand.""
Also helping sentiment, Michigan consumer sentiment for May, was better than feared, rising to a reading of 73.7 from 71.8 a month earlier, topping economists' forecasts of 68.
Wall Street's comeback from session lows coincided with a rebound in the bulk of FAANG stocks, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) leading the pack, closing 2.8% higher. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the exception, falling 0.6%.
Energy gave up gains to closer just below the flatline even as oil prices surged on data showing that China, the world's largest oil importer, ramped-up daily crude oil use in April. That added to recent optimism for a recovery oil demand amid government efforts to lift restrictions that had weighed on economic growth.
Markets started the day on the back foot after the Trump administration took aim at Huawei, and sized up a move to block U.S companies from supplying semiconductor equipment to the Chinese tech giant.
""The Bureau of Industry and Security is amending its longstanding foreign-produced direct product rule and the Entity List to narrowly and strategically target Huawei’s acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain U.S. software and technology,"" The Commerce Department said."

But some on Wall Street expect retail sales to bounce back as the recent wave of stimulus and pent-up demand will spur consumer spending.
""The pronounced weakness in April sales sets the stage for a bounce in May spending, which could be significant,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) said in a note. ""There is near-term support from stimulus payments which were largely saved in April, and a good deal of pent-up demand.""
Stocks were also helped by a rise in materials with Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE:FCX) leading the pack as traders bet on an improved outlook for the sector following data showing industrial activity in China rebounded more sharply than expected last month.
Signs that China, the world's largest oil importer, is on the road to economic recovery sparked hopes that Beijing's appetite for crude will continue and help steady oil demand, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. Data released on Friday showed China’s daily crude oil use rebounded in April. 
Oil prices jumped 6%, pushing energy stocks more than 0.5% higher.
Technology, which has played a pivotal role in the rally off the March lows, remained under pressure, paced by falling chip stocks as the White House reportedly is looking to block U.S companies from supplying China''s Hauwei.
""The Bureau of Industry and Security is amending its longstanding foreign-produced direct product rule and the Entity List to narrowly and strategically target Huawei’s acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain U.S. software and technology,"" The Commerce Department said."
252,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2020 01:54PM ET</span>",A $4 Trillion Market Divided as ETF Giants Push for Shakeup,"(Bloomberg) -- An effort by investment giants including BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). to redefine the $4 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund universe has the industry’s smaller players bristling.
The push to re-classify funds into four separate categories looks like a move by the biggest providers to further cement their dominance, the critics argue, and risks confusing retail investors in the ever-more complex world of passive markets.
Under proposals sent to exchanges this week by a coalition of the largest asset managers, a host of products would lose their ETF designation, becoming instead exchange-traded instruments, notes or commodities.
“They’ve decided they want to monopolize the ETF label for only uses they declare,” said Rob Nestor, president of Direxion, one of the largest issuers of leveraged and inverse ETFs, which would become ETIs if the plan succeeds. “It’s just going to sow confusion for investors and basically serve the interest of the largest providers in the space.”
The consortium pressing for the changes -- which alongside BlackRock comprises  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT)., Vanguard Group,  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp., Fidelity Investments and Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) Ltd. -- says the four distinct categories will boost investor awareness of the different risks.
The six firms together make up more than 90% of the U.S. ETF market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The industry has come under scrutiny in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic roiled markets. Regardless, this long-standing push -- which would result in the vast bulk of funds from big issuers retaining their ETF classification -- is leaving the smaller players up in arms.
“What they’re trying to do is corner the market on the ETF brand,” said Alfred Eskandar, co-founder of Salt Financial. “It’s just the big trying to get even bigger.”
‘Needlessly Confuse’
BlackRock has been an advocate of re-classification in the ETF industry for several years. The world’s largest asset manager put forward a list of suggested categories in 2017 that mirror those in this week’s letter.
The following year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee -- of which BlackRock is a member -- submitted a similar proposal to the regulator.
But the SEC declined to implement the proposed naming system when it passed a long-awaited rule streamlining the process for launching funds in 2019. Instead the agency encouraged issuers to engage with their investors and each other on ETF nomenclature.
“This proposal, a retread of a scheme by Blackrock that has failed to gain traction numerous times in the past, would reverse 27 years of the common use of the term ETF,” said Michael Sapir, chief executive officer of ProShares, another heavyweight among leveraged ETF issuers. “It would draw arbitrary lines that would needlessly confuse investors, squash innovation, and further entrench the dominant financial players who are proposing it.”
BlackRock itself maintains the drive is an attempt to simplify things, however.
“ETF has become a blanket term for a range of products that can lead to significantly different outcomes,” said Samara Cohen, co-head of iShares Global Markets and Investments at BlackRock. The goal of the proposal “is to have a shared language to promote clarity and provide compass points to navigate the ETP landscape,” she said.
Retail Complaints
Leveraged funds in particular have come under fire after the virus spurred turbulence in the first quarter.
The SEC said in April it received numerous complaints from retail investors about leveraged products, revealing a “widespread lack of understanding” about how the funds were intended to operate.
Similar concerns were stoked just weeks later when the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) LP, ticker USO, was forced to take a series of unusual actions as crude prices plummeted. Retail investors had piled into the $4 billion fund just before the turmoil.
If the re-classification is adopted, USO would likely fall under the umbrella of an exchange-traded commodity rather than an ETF. John Love, president of USO issuer USCF LLC, said in an email that the firm has no objection to the proposal.
Still, there’s no shortage of market particpants worried that re-classifying funds will only add to the complexity in this booming corner of the investing world.
“The $4 trillion industry already uses hard-to-follow jargon, such as smart-beta and semi-transparent active, to describe existing products,” Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA Research’s head of ETF and mutual fund research, wrote in a Thursday note. “A new system could lead to more confusion.”

Investing.com - President Donald Trump reportedly said the U.S. will win the battle against the coronavirus pandemic even without an effective vaccine, and claimed that the disease will disappear ""at some point.""

258,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>","Exclusive: United Airlines only needs 3,000 of 25,000 flight attendants in June - sources","By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) has told staff that it only has work for about 3,000 of its about 25,000 flight attendants in June, sources said, and warned of job losses if demand does not recover by the time government payroll aid expires in the fall.
United is paying flight attendants until Sept. 30 thanks largely to $5 billion the airline is receiving in government payroll aid under the CARES Act, which prohibits any job or pay cuts for employees before October.
Chicago-based United and other airlines have begun to share more details with employees about the scale of their dilemma in trying to match crews and fleets to an uncertain recovery from the economic crisis sparked by the new coronavirus pandemic, which has sent the global economy into a tailspin.
United's flying schedule is down by about 90%. It and other U.S. airlines have slashed the number of flights and are scrambling to reduce a collective $10 billion monthly cash burn.
""If you just look at a way in which our network is flying we'd need about 3,000 flight attendants to fly our schedule for June,"" United's managing director of inflight crew resourcing, Michael Sasse told staff last week, according to people who listened to an employee briefing call.
That number cannot be extrapolated to the company's potential staffing needs going forward, he said, adding that United does not want to cut deeper than needed and is still trying to get a better picture of how demand will evolve.
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) told its 14,500 pilots on Thursday that it expects to have 7,000 more than it needs in the fall, according to a memo first reported by Reuters.
United President Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) told investors this month he intends to keep the flying schedule at around 10% of normal until demand recovers.
""But if demand remains significantly diminished on Oct. 1, we simply won't be able to endure this crisis ... without implementing some of the more difficult and painful actions,"" said Kirby, who takes over as CEO next week.
United is burning around $40 million in cash daily. If revenues do not recover, the company must take drastic measures to halve that burn rate in the fourth quarter, he said. 
United executives have said they want to be up front with employees as they try to position the company to emerge from the crisis.
It already warned that its management and administrative ranks would be around 30% smaller starting in October.

U.S. airlines have also asked employees to volunteer for temporary unpaid leave or early retirement, and United is expected to announce voluntary separation options for flight attendants later this month, according to a union memo.

""So, the rate is 21%. Why not try for a couple of years or longer, a 10.5% rate, which would make us extremely competitive and hospitable to new investments here?""
With the coronavirus pandemic sapping retail sales, the labor market and industrial production, President Donald Trump's administration and lawmakers are eager to find ways to shore up the U.S. economy.
Republicans are rejecting Democrats' attempt to send more money to states and first responders, as well as additional cash payments to individuals and families, through a $3 trillion spending bill. Trump has said he would veto the legislation should it reach his desk.
Kudlow told Fox Business network in an interview that ""we're not going to spend our way out of"" a coronavirus-related downturn, contradicting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's push this week for the government to spend more during the pandemic.
Trump's administration, currently talking informally with Democrats, wants to look at incentives such as a payroll tax cut instead, Kudlow said. Alongside slashing the corporate tax rate, the government could look into the possibility of suspending capital gains taxes on assets bought between now and the end of the year, he added.

PARIS (Reuters) - Air France (PA:AIRF) is putting its grounded pilots through their paces in the flight simulator as the airline prepares to restore flights to dozens of destinations that had been suspended under coronavirus lockdown measures. 
The French carrier, part of Air France-KLM, plans to increase capacity to about 10% of normal levels by mid-June from 3-5% today, Jean Fernandez, executive vice-president for flight operations, said on Friday.
European safety rules require extra training for any pilot who has not carried out at least three take-offs and landings in the last three months, although Air France sets the bar higher at five take-offs and landings.
""Pilots need to fly regularly to maintain their skills at the highest level,"" Fernandez said during a visit to a simulator session at an Air France training centre near Charles de Gaulle airport.
Behind him, Captain Emmanuel Mistrali, a 25-year veteran with the airline, and his co-pilot were running through challenging scenarios from engine failures to high winds in the Airbus A350 simulator, closely watched by a flight instructor.
Mistrali, out of action since his last flight to Sao Paolo three weeks ago, said the simulator sessions offer a welcome chance to ""regain contact with a world we've been missing"".
By sharing out the few services still running, Air France's 4,000 pilots can each fly at least one trip in May-June.
Before returning to the air, they also run through software-based training to test their recollection of key procedures - but Mistrali said there was no substitute for cockpit time.
""What is missing when you're on the ground is the routines, the reflexes, your sixth sense and the crew teamwork,"" he said.
By mid-June Air France aims to restore about 600 flights per week to 110 destinations, travel restrictions permitting - still far short of its usual weekly tally of more than 7,000 services to 196 destinations. It is currently operating 200-300 weekly flights on 43 routes.
Between now and then, the airline's 17 simulators will be busy but not over-stretched, Fernandez said. ""They are always in high demand."" 
Over the coming month Air France capacity should return to ""something like 10%"" of normal levels, he added. ""One thing we can be sure of is that the recovery will be slow.""

265,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>",Taiwan's TSMC keeps eye on China with $12 billion U.S. plant,"By Josh Horwitz and Yimou Lee
SHANGHAI/TAIPEI (Reuters) - In a race to position itself in the latest trade battle between the United States and China, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd made it just under the wire.
The world's biggest contract chipmaker unveiled plans for a $12 billion plant in Arizona on Friday just hours before Washington outlined a proposal to amend tech export rules that could restrict TSMC's sales to China's Huawei.
A U.S. Commerce Department official said TSMC's decision to locate the plant in the United States generated ""good will"" at the department, the drafter of the law that would require TSMC and others to get U.S. licences to sell chips to Huawei.
The move shows the delicate balancing act by TSMC to stay on side with Washington, which has stepped up criticism of Chinese trade practices and Beijing's handling of the novel coronavirus, while protecting its China business, analysts said.
""TSMC has to figure out how to best leverage and benefit from the U.S.-China tensions,"" said Liu Pei-chen, tech analyst at government-backed think tank Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.
It could not escape them so its room for manoeuvre consisted of negotiating the best terms for the U.S. factory it could, she said. Analysts estimate TSMC generates around 60% of its revenue from the United States and some 20% from China.
Liu said TSMC would enjoy the first-mover advantage as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China ahead of Nov. 3 presidential election.
U.S. government officials were not immediately available to comment on whether the investment would make it more likely that TSMC would get a licence to supply Huawei.
TSMC said it was working with outside counsels to interpret the rules in good time and maintains long-term collaborations with equipment partners around the world.
Huawei did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The Trump administration on Friday moved to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei from global chipmakers, in an action that could ramp up tensions with China.
The proposed export rule amendment requires foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment to obtain a U.S. license before supplying certain chips to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], or an affiliate like HiSilicon.
U.S. CHINA BALANCE
Semiconductors play a key role in both consumer electronics and defense equipment. The vast majority of the most advanced chips are made in Asia, which has caused concern among U.S. officials as a strategic rivalry with China deepens.
""Building a fab (production line) in the U.S. starting with 5 nanometre technology is not the cheapest option for TSMC, but it would help address fears of U.S. IPs and technologies theft. TSMC may continue its operations in China to serve domestic and other clients."" Citi analysts said in a note. 
With a small production plan that would contribute just 3-4% of its total output, the new U.S. plant may hit TSMC's margins, but the splurge underscores the extent TSMC is willing to spend to protect its customer base in its two biggest markets.
""The scale & technology is similar to what TSMC did in China, suggesting a balance between the U.S. & China,"" said Bernstein analysts, noting it took 7 years for TSMC's Shanghai fab to break even in operating profit level and 2-3 years for its Nanjing plant.
PRONE TO CHANGE
While huge in terms of foreign investment in the United States, the plan is small by TSMC's standards, and the company carefully planned to spend it over 9 years, leaving enough room to make downward adjustments depending on market situations. 
Its compatriot Foxconn pledged a $10 billion investment in Wisconsin and to create 13,000 jobs in 2017 when Trump became President, but it has not met early hiring targets and has said it has been reconsidering its plans.
""Considering the state of Foxconn's construction in the U.S., as well as the U.S. election this year, it’s not impossible that these plans for building the fab could change,"" said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy ICWise. Foxconn was not immediately available for comment.
While U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said chips from the new plant will power everything from artificial intelligence to 5G base stations to fighter jets, some analysts said 5 nanometre chips from the plant will no longer be the most advanced technology by 2024 when it begins production.
""This is more of a political response from TSMC to the US government's demands,"" Gu said.
TSMC said the plant was a business decision.
""Our intention to build and operate the fab in the U.S. is a business decision, to address the best interests of our customers,"" it told Reuters.
Some analysts also said the plant was too small to be economically efficient and the size of U.S. incentive and price from customers who prefer U.S. production would likely decide its profitability.
Yet the announcement is unlikely to be welcomed by Beijing who would see it as Washington's attempt to control more of a crucial supplier to its national tech champion Huawei, and only spur its ambition to build its own chip supply chains.
""I think it would be foolish for China to punish Taiwan or TSMC, given so many of its own companies still rely on it,"" said Stewart Randall who tracks the chip sector at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink.
""Huawei will continue using TSMC for all high-end chips and China will continue investing in local companies to be self-reliant at some point.""

China's state-controlled Global Times reported on Friday, citing a source close to the government, that China was ready to take a series of countermeasures against the U.S. plan to block shipments of chips to Huawei. Authorities in Beijing could not be immediately reached after hours for comment.

269,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Euro zone banks sell subordinated bonds after three month hiatus,"By Yoruk Bahceli
LONDON (Reuters) - The euro zone issuance market for subordinated, loss-absorbing bank bonds re-opened this week for the first time in almost three months after a severe sell-off in the asset class due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
The 80 billion euro ($86 billion) market for these bonds - the riskiest debt banks can issue - had been shut for issuance since Feb. 20, according to Refinitiv IFR data, as borrowing costs shot up, while banks also waited to release their first quarter earnings. 
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) kicked off the issuance earlier in the week, raising 1.25 billion euros of ""Tier 2"" debt on Monday, followed by Bank of Ireland (I:BIRG), which raised 675 million euros through an ""Additional Tier 1"" (AT1) bond on Thursday.
Additional Tier 1 bonds - also known as ""contingent convertibles"" or ""CoCo"" bonds, are deeply subordinated and convert into equity if a bank's capital level falls below a certain threshold. 
Tier 2 debt is a more senior type of subordinated debt, as it only gets converted into equity when a bank defaults.
A banker involved with one of the week's deals, who asked not to be identified, said that issuers were more willing to pay higher borrowing costs, realising they could come under further pressure once second quarter earnings demonstrate the full hit they've taken from the pandemic.
But a flood of issuance is unlikely to materialize, said ABN AMRO (AS:ABNd) strategist Tom Kinmonth, citing elevated borrowing costs, and more issuers may opt to not redeem their outstanding bonds at call dates. This has stoked debate about the risks in the market, as these securities are often traded on the assumption that banks will redeem them.
""The market focus from the regulators is to not weaken your position... The AT1 market is still at a very elevated level,"" Kinmonth said.
He added that banks' capital ratios have been helped by postponed or scrapped dividend payments and recent regulatory changes, meaning there is less need to borrow at expensive levels.
The European Central Bank's accelerated change in March in capital requirements allowing banks to make partial use of these bonds to meet their capital requirements could help issuance eventually pick up.
The yield on the iBoxx euro subordinated bank bonds index shot up to 6-1/2 year highs at the height of the sell-off in March. While it has reversed some losses since, the index still yields 2.26% compared to 0.75% prior to the crisis.

270,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Italy doubles down on debt sales to retail investors,"By Giuseppe Fonte
ROME (Reuters) - Italy will launch a campaign this month to entice individual investors to buy its government debt and shift some of the burden of funding the fight against the coronavirus from its banks, which are still recovering from the last crisis.
Italy is set to borrow half a trillion euros this year to help weather the pandemic and the Treasury is aiming to gradually double the amount of Italian sovereign bonds held by small retail investors.
""We have about 80 billion euros ($86 billion) of bonds in the hands of our retail investors, which is very little, and we believe we can double it to 160 billion within a few years,"" the Treasury's debt management chief Davide Iacovoni told Reuters.
He said banks were extending their opening hours and allowing orders from retail investors for a new five-year inflation-linked bond on sale next week to be placed by email and telephone due to lockdown restrictions.
Iacovoni said he expected a positive response from both savers and institutional investors to the new BTP Italia, which is due to be sold between May 18 and May 21.
""We are reasonably optimistic about the outcome of the placement, we are seeing good interest,"" Iacovoni said.
Italy's banks, which have played a key role in supporting government funding in the past, are limiting their exposure to domestic debt due to pressure from regulators and investors.
Banks are trying to avoid the kind of ""doom loop"" seen during the euro zone debt crisis when concerns about Italy's creditworthiness coloured investors' views of the banks and vice versa, amplifying market tensions.
Foreign investors have also cut their holdings of Italian debt to about 30% of outstanding bonds since the financial crisis. By comparison, more than 40% of German, French and Spanish debt is in foreign hands, according to Eurostat data.
That's why the Treasury, which manages one of the world's biggest debt piles worth more than 2.4 trillion euros, is keen to widen its funding sources, Iacovoni said, adding that Italian banks would still play a key role in placing and holding debt.
'UNDER CONTROL'
It was not immediately clear how much appetite there would be from retail investors for government bonds. In 2009, they held 13% of Italian sovereign debt but that has slumped to 3% as the fallout from the financial crisis hammered bond holders.
With fewer customers visiting banks due to lockdown restrictions, Iacovoni said lenders had used emails and codified telephone calls to generate and respond to interest from clients in the new BTP Italia issue.
A source told Reuters last week that the inflation-linked bond issue could raise up to 16 billion euros.
Buying government bonds would leave retail investors exposed every time concerns about the government's spending plans or political stability spark a sell-off in Italy's debt.
As the coronavirus panic gripped markets in March, Italian bond markets bore the brunt of the jitters in Europe. On March 18, the gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields blew out to almost 320 basis points and concerns about the outlook for Italy's economy and its high debt levels remain.
With Italy's debt heading towards 155.7% of national output this year, according to the Treasury's latest estimate, some analysts are questioning whether it will be sustainable without support from the European Central Bank.
Iacovoni dismissed such doubts, saying ""the fundamental structure of Italy's public finances is fully under control"".
Total issuance this year will amount to about 500 billion euros, he said, well above the 400 billion to 410 billion announced in early February, before the COVID-19 pandemic brought Italy's economy to virtual standstill.
Iacovoni said Italy was still working on a plan floated last year to issue its first green bond but more stable market conditions were needed to proceed.

""It would be desirable to bring a first issue this year,"" Iacovoni said.

LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Italian energy group Eni (MI:ENI) is working with investment bank Citi to sell natural gas assets in Australia that could fetch up to $1 billion, sources said.
The sale, which is expected to be launched next week in a two-round process, could see Eni all but exit from Australia.
Eni declined to comment, while Citi was not immediately available for comment.
The Italian group has chosen to sell the assets to raise cash after the global downturn resulting from the coronavirus pandemic led to a sharp drop in oil prices, one of the sources said. 
Eni's operations in Australia are mostly based on selling natural gas into the domestic market and therefore are less exposed to global demand and price fluctuations, the source said, making them a potentially attractive target for buyers.
Eni, led by oil veteran Claudio Descalzi who was reappointed CEO this week for a third term, operates a series of offshore gas fields in the north of Australia and has stakes in four exploration licences, including the Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Petroleum Development Area in the Timor Sea (NYSE:SE).
It owns the Blacktip Gas Project in the shallow waters off the Northern Territory, and has stakes in the Bayu-Undan gas and condensate field and the associated Darwin LNG plant.
In March Australia's Santos Ltd (AX:STO) agreed to sell 25% of the Darwin LNG facility and the Bayu-Undan gas field off Northern Australia to South Korea's SK E&S for $390 million.
Another source said the assets could be worth $700-900 million, with the bulk linked to the Blacktip gas field, which has a long-term gas supply agreement tied to it.
A third source said it had not yet been decided whether the Katherine solar project Eni acquired last year in northern Australia, which has not yet started production, will be included in the sale.
Eni, which has pledged to reduce its oil production from 2025, is investing heavily in renewable energy as part of a drive to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% in one of the energy sector's most ambitious clean-up drives.
Like other rivals it has cut production forecasts and investments as it looks to raise cash to fight the coronavirus crisis, which has destroyed oil and gas demand.

272,By Investing.com,"<span>May 15, 2020 09:42AM ET</span>","Stocks - Wall Street Opens Lower on Trade Tension, Dismal Retail Numbers","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets clawed back early losses on Friday , but still drifted lower amid growing concerns that the pandemic and its political fallout will breathe new life into an economically damaging trade war that had been in suspended animation since January. 
Wall Street rebounded after an initial blow from figures showing the biggest ever monthly drop in retail sales in April, the first full month of lockdowns dictated by public health concerns. April's data for industrial production and manufacturing output were, however, marginally better than expected. 
By 10:20 AM ET (1420 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down only 4 points, effectively unchanged on the day, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3%. In a conspicuous contrast to recent trading patterns, the Nasdaq Composite was underperforming, losing 0.4% as semiconductor stocks - typically sensitive to the trade issue - fell more sharply than most. That followed a new executive order tightening the current restrictions on sales of high-performance chips by U.S. companies to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, which the administration has repeatedly accused of aiding Chinese spying.
Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock fell 4.2% in early trading, while Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stock fell 3.6% and Intel  (NASDAQ:INTC) stock fell 2.4%, after Hu Xijin, editor of the Chinese English-language publication The Global Times, warned of possible retaliation. He also singled out Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Apple and Boeing (NYSE:BA) as possible targets. Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 2.0% but the other companies' moves were unremarkable. 
Earlier, the Census Bureau reported that retail sales fell 16.4% in  April as the country's malls and stores were shut down by government order to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Core retail sales fell an even sharper 17.2%. Industrial production, meanwhile, fell 11.2% and manufacturing output by 13.7%, as the nation's factories ground to a near-halt.
""As with the retail sales numbers, these data likely mark the floor for industrial output, but the rebound will be much less steep than the collapse, so a huge Q2 drop is a certainty,"" said Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson. ""The lost ground will not be quickly recovered.""
The retail sales numbers underlined how much online retailers had gained at the expense of traditional ones, with non-store retail actually rising 8.4% on the month. However, the news failed to move Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, which fell 0.6%, while Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock rose 1.0%.  The phenomenon wasn't limited to the U.S., with ADRs in Chinese retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) rising sharply after it posted better-than-expected quarterly numbers, also lifting the ADRs of rival  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD).
Elsewhere, crude oil prices extended their recent gains as more investors bought into the narrative of global market rebalancing.  U.S. Crude futures were up 5.1% at $28.96 a barrel, their highest since early April.

The drop in Toyota's production underscores the challenging conditions for carmakers around the world due to the fallout from the virus. Besides weak demand, problems with procurement and social distancing measures at plants are also expected to hit output.
The automaker said it would halt production at all of its 15 plants for four days next month, while stopping output for up to 7 days on 10 of its production lines, which make models including the Prius gasoline hybrid, Corolla sedan, and 4Runner SUV.
In addition, it plans to operate only single shifts on five production lines next month, an arrangement which would continue on two lines through July, and through August on another, it said in a statement. 
A Toyota spokeswoman said the reduced output represented a 40% cut from initial plans made earlier in the year, while declining to give further details. In June 2019, it produced 289,544 vehicles at home. 
Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Toyota planned to slash production in North America by nearly a third through October due to the coronavirus The automaker resumed some output at its seven North American sites this week.
Toyota is bracing for an 80% drop in full-year operating profit, its lowest in nine years, as it expect car sales to remain weak for much of the year.
Some analysts believe industry-wide global auto sales could slump by a third this year and that any recovery will slow and patchy as job losses and reduced incomes weigh on consumer spending.

Losses cannot be dumped on the state and taxpayers must be adequately compensated, Joerg Kukies, a deputy finance minister and a former investment banker at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), said.
""The state is acting here as a self-confident investor,"" he said at an event.
In the case of Lufthansa, the state's exact shareholding and its ability to exert influence over the airline group are still being negotiated.
The company is seeking to tap Germany's economic stabilisation fund to help it weather the the pandemic and what is expected to be a protracted travel slump.
Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said separately that the talks are ""intensive"" and still ongoing. ""I can't give you a date or a result,"" he said.
Lufthansa has said the bailout may include a non-voting capital component, known as a so-called silent participation, a secured loan, and a capital increase that may leave the government with a shareholding of up to 25% plus one share, the company said.
Some senior politicians continued to voice deep scepticism about the plan. 
Markus Soeder, head of the Christian Social Union (CSU) - the sister party to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and part of the federal coalition - said semi-nationalization would mean that the state would have a say in routes and wage negotiations, which would be wrong.

Lufthansa plans to resume flights to destinations including Los Angeles, Toronto and Mumbai next month as it begins to restore some of the capacity grounded by the coronavirus crisis, the airline said on Thursday.

280,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Abu Dhabi in talks with Dubai for support through state fund Mubadala - sources,"By Davide Barbuscia, Saeed Azhar and Pamela Barbaglia
DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - The governments of Abu Dhabi and Dubai are discussing ways to prop up Dubai's economy by linking up assets in the two emirates, with Abu Dhabi's state fund Mubadala likely to play a key role in any deal, three sources familiar with the matter said.
Some economic sectors have come to a near standstill in Dubai during the coronavirus outbreak, and it faces its most severe downturn since a 2009 debt crisis. It lacks the oil wealth of Abu Dhabi to cushion the blow. 
Abu Dhabi bailed out Dubai after the 2009 crisis with a $10 billion government loan, which was subsequently rolled over, and $10 billion in bonds that Dubai issued to the central bank.
One of the sources said any support from Abu Dhabi agreed now would be ""orchestrated through mergers of assets where Abu Dhabi and Dubai compete directly or where they have joint ownerships"".
""The most likely deal to happen in the near term is a merger of the local stock markets,"" the source said, adding that bank mergers were also possible.
A second source confirmed the talks and said Mubadala, which manages around $230 billion in assets, would make ""a big move into Dubai"", but gave no details.
Mubadala declined comment. Abu Dhabi and Dubai did not respond to requests for comment on the talks.
The two emirates have a quiet rivalry. Dubai has developed quickly to become the Middle East's tourism, trade and business hub, while Abu Dhabi is the UAE's political capital because of its size and immense oil wealth. The consolidation of political power in Abu Dhabi began with the 2009 bailout.
The first source said talks were happening in an ""elegant way,"" without the appearance of a direct bailout.  
The UAE said on Wednesday it would review the structure and size of its government to make it ""more agile and flexible"".
""We may merge ministries and alter bodies. We will make changes,"" UAE Vice President Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also ruler of Dubai, said following three days of virtual meetings on the country's post-coronavirus strategy.
A third source said Mubadala was likely to be involved ""at some stage"" because the state fund was always involved whenever there was consolidation between the two emirates in the past.
STRATEGIC ASSETS
Mergers took place after Abu Dhabi bailed out Dubai following the 2009 crisis, during which Dubai's property market crashed, almost forcing some state-linked firms to default on billions of dollars of debt.
The UAE merged Dubai and Abu Dhabi aluminium firms to create Emirates Global Aluminium, held jointly by Mubadala and the Investment Corporation of Dubai.
""You have already seen a pattern of mergers and this will now accelerate,"" the first source said. ""Essentially these bailouts will be engineered by having Abu Dhabi taking stakes in strategic assets owned by Dubai. It will happen over time.""
London-based Capital Economics has said Dubai is the most vulnerable of the economies in the Middle East and North Africa to the economic damage caused by measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, and it has said Dubai's economy could contract by at least 5-6% this year if the measures last into the summer.
Economic growth in Dubai was sluggish before the pandemic and hopes of benefiting from hosting the Expo world fair in October collapsed when the event was postponed to 2021.
Dubai has in recent weeks been in discussions with banks for several fundraising options including loans and privately placed bonds, sources familiar with the discussions have said.

It has also considered raising funds backed by road toll revenue, sources have said.

Fiat’s local unit is discussing the facility with Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) SpA, which is the lead lender, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is private. Sace SpA, Italy’s trade-credit insurer, will provide a public guarantee for 80% of the amount, they said.
The guarantee would need to be granted by a decree of the Finance Ministry, the people added.
Representatives for Fiat Chrysler, Intesa and Sace declined to comment.
The Italian-American carmaker is seeking to conserve cash after burning through $5.5 billion in the first quarter while its North American plants were shuttered and new-car demand stalled. Fiat Chrysler and French peer PSA Group decided earlier this week to scrap the 1.1 billion-euro dividends that each agreed to pay as part of their merger agreement, citing the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Fiat Chrysler loan would be the largest financing guaranteed by a European government during the pandemic after  Renault  (PA:RENA) SA’s 5 billion-euro deal last month.
Last month, Italy approved measures to spur liquidity, including a package of 200 billion euros of state guarantees for loans to larger companies through Sace.
Fiat Chrysler has already raised almost 10 billion euros in lending to manage through the crisis. It earlier took out a new, 3.5 billion-euro loan from, and drew down 6.25 billion euros from an existing revolver.
MF Milano Finanza reported earlier on the guarantee.

282,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Nissan sees bigger role for U.S., China markets in global car sales - sources","By Naomi Tajitsu and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co expects equal contributions to global car sales from China, the United States and elsewhere in coming years as the struggling Japanese carmaker strategises to recover profitability, two people with knowledge of the issue said.
Nissan aims to grow contributions from its biggest markets, China and the United States, to about a third each from just over a quarter now, while the share of other regions, including Brazil, Europe, Japan and Russia, will ease slightly to a third, from about 45% in total now, the sources said.
The comments offer the first glimpse of how the automaker's global sales breakdown could look in its recovery strategy, set to be unveiled on May 28. 
Under the plan, Nissan will aim to bolster cooperation with partners  Renault  SA (OTC:RNLSY) and Mitsubishi Motors (OTC:MMTOF) Corp to reverse losses and spruce up a brand dented from years of chasing market share. 
The steps will focus on salvaging profitability in the United States and ""stopping the bleeding"" in Europe, said one of the sources, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak with media.
""Eventually we see roughly one-third (of sales) in the United States, one-third in China, and one-third in other regions,"" the source added. 
""There are many newer markets we can continue to grow, like Brazil, Russia and south Asia,"" he said, adding, ""If we work well with our partners we can achieve volume growth and profitability."" 
Nissan declined immediate comment on its future sales outlook.
In April, Reuters reported that Nissan's latest recovery plan was likely to assume its annual sales target would hover around 5 million units, down from 6 million in the previous recovery plan announced in July.
Nissan's global sales plunged to a 9-year low of 4.8 million units in the year ended March, when the coronavirus worsened its slump in sales. 
Sources have told Reuters a downsizing plan envisions closing at least 14 assembly lines through 2021, leaving annual production capacity of about 5.5 million units.
An expected annual operating loss of around 45 billion yen in the year ended March is cranking up pressure on the company to scale back an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn. 
A key pillar of Nissan's ""operational performance plan"" will be to consolidate production, procurement and development with Renault (PA:RENA) in Europe, the French automaker's home market, and Mitsubishi Motors in southeast Asia, where the smaller Japanese automaker has a stronger presence. 
Nissan plans to reduce its manufacturing presence in Europe and is considering closing its plant in the Spanish city of Barcelona, sources have told Reuters, with one saying it was also assessing the prospect of Renault building cars at Nissan's massive plant in Sunderland, England.
""My view is that we will be left with more integration of Sunderland into the general European industrial scheme,"" the person said, while acknowledging such moves would hinge on Brexit trade pacts.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian lenders are facing a jump in coronavirus-related defaults on credit card dues, personal and vehicle loans, forcing them to set aside hundreds of millions of dollars and take steps like asking sales staff to track down borrowers who have vanished.
A near two-month nationwide lockdown to halt the spread of COVID-19 has clobbered India's retail financial segment, seen as the last bastion for a banking industry that had already raked up more than $120 billion in bad loans and is ranked the third-worst among 13 major world economies in asset quality.
The provisions for the bad loans are set to significantly shrink profits of privately owned lenders this financial year, while state-owned banks will need yet more government funds to survive, analysts say.
Non-repayment of credit card and personal loans has surged in the last few weeks, according to several senior bankers and industry insiders, increasing the troubles of lenders already struggling with soured loans to larger corporates, and potentially slowing down the country's recovery from the crisis.
""The situation is so bad that even people who can pay are not paying up or are delaying their payments and all of this will snowball into a big problem,"" said a banker in the retail division of a private bank.
ICICI Bank (NS:ICBK), India's second-biggest private sector bank whose lending is nearly two-thirds retail focused, reported a quarterly profit last week that fell way short of analyst estimates after it set aside 27.25 billion rupees ($362 million) for the coronavirus. Its shares fell after the results.
Banks such as RBL (NS:RATB) and IndusInd (NS:INBK) may be hit harder as a weaker deposit franchise makes them more vulnerable.
SOUNDING CAUTION
Public and private sector banks grew their retail lending rapidly over the past five-six years as India's economy expanded and consumption increased.
Retail lending was not only more profitable - rates on credit cards could be as much as 36% annually compared to the 9%-12% that banks typically charge corporates - it also helped banks reduce their exposure to the cyclical risks of industrial businesses.
Since 2015, retail lending has grown at an annual average of nearly 15%, at least twice that of corporate lending, as Indians' purchases of overseas trips to gadgets and automobiles were bankrolled by the lenders.
Even before the coronavirus struck, that surge drew caution from the banking regulator, which warned over the last few years that lenders were being too aggressive in the retail segment. But the warnings were ignored by the banks, and by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), also known as ""shadow banks"".
Shadow banks account for nearly 20% of total loans in India and typically lend to individuals in the informal sector who find it difficult to secure loans from a bank. The hit from the virus has been particularly severe on them. 
Suman Chowdhury, chief analytical officer at ratings agency Acuité Ratings & Research, said he estimated only a fifth of borrowers from shadow banks have paid up in April and May, and expects the same at their next due date as individuals try to conserve cash.
If the norms for bad loans-classification aren't relaxed by the central bank in the coming months, such loans at shadow banks will double in the next six months, he added.
STATE HELP
India's economy has ground to a standstill amid the lockdown, that, according to several rating agencies and analysts, will lead to the economy contracting in the year ending in March. 
As revenues dwindle, companies are rushing to cut costs, leading to a spike in job losses that bankers fear will result in more defaults. 
The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, an independent think-tank, estimates that during March and April nearly 114 million Indians lost their jobs.
Loan recoveries have also been hamstrung by hundreds of thousands of migrant workers leaving cities as work dried up.
""Many are not traceable now and it is proving to be very challenging,"" a senior executive at a leading NBFC said, adding that people from the firm's sales team were being moved in dozens to focus on debt recovery.
Collections have also dropped due to a moratorium on loan repayments allowed till end-May by the central bank. If that moratorium is not extended, bad loan ratios could spike sooner, analysts said.
At 9.5% of total banking assets in 2018, India's bad loan ratio was worse than even Italy's and Portugal's, according to Indian credit ratings firm CARE, which cited World Bank data.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government and bankers expect that ratio could double to 18%-20% by March 2021, which would push lenders deep into the red and threaten the viability of some state lenders, necessitating fresh capital infusions. 
The government has already pumped in close to $50 billion over the last five years into state-run banks, the worst hit by the bad loan problem. Till early last month it was considering investing at least $2.7 billion to $3.3 billion more, but the sum is now likely to go up significantly, sources said.
""With financial markets in a tailspin, the responsibility to fund new capital needs to be squarely borne by the government and/or the central bank,"" said Ketki Bhagwati, a veteran banker and senior advisor to U.S. think-tank the Atlantic Council.
""Otherwise India's banking sector will never fully recover.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to drift lower Friday, amid increased trade tensions with China and ahead of likely dismal economic data illustrating the damage done to the high street by coronavirus-driven lockdowns. 
At 07:25 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 19 points, or 0.7%, lower,Nasdaq Futures down 64 points, or 0.7%. The Dow futures contract fell 163 points, also a drop of 0.7%. This looks likely to be the worst week for stocks in two months.
The Trump administration on Friday moved to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei Technologies from global chipmakers, in an action that could ramp up trade tensions with China, Reuters reported.
Relations between the two largest economies in the world have become fraught of late, with the U.S. government blaming Beijing for the origin and spread of the Covid-19 virus. Trump on Thursday had talked of cutting the U.S.'s entire trading relationship with China.
The key economic release, in a busy end to the week, is April’s retail sales data, which is expected to show a 12% drop from March, the biggest monthly drop on record.
Industrial production and manufacturing output are also due at 9:15 AM, and are expected to have fallen 11.5% and 13%, respectively. 
Data from China published earlier showed a bright spot in that industrial production rose in year-on-year terms for the first time since the pandemic erupted, but consumers were still noticeable by their absence as retail sales slumped 7.5% on the year.
In a vivid illustration of the difficulties the retail sector has had during the lockdown, troubled retailer JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) could follow Neiman Marcus in filing for bankruptcy as early as Friday, according to reports.
That said, Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN) shares climbed more than 14% premarket after the restaurant chain reported better than expected earnings despite the difficult conditions.
Investors will also be keeping an eye on news from the Hill, with the House of Representatives Democrats set to present the latest relief bill, to the tune of $3 trillion. President Donald Trump has already indicated that he would be open to more stimulus, but would not support this bill.
Elsewhere,  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) stock dropped 3% premarket after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cautioned the public about the reliability of a widely used rapid test for the coronavirus made by the health care company.
Oil futures caught the positive tone Friday, helped by the industrial production data out of China, the world's largest importer of crude.   
At 7:25 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded .2.4% higher at $28.21 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 2.1% to $31.77.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.1% to $1,743.35/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0813, up 0.1%."

288,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2020 05:54AM ET</span>",Japan Banks Expect Highest Bad-Loan Costs Since Financial Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s top banks forecast the biggest bad-loan costs since the aftermath of the global financial crisis, joining other global lenders in bracing for the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
Total credit costs at Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc., Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group Inc. and Mizuho Financial Group Inc. will almost double to 1.1 trillion yen ($10.3 billion) in the year ending March 2021, the most in 11 years, the Tokyo-based lenders forecast Friday. They expect combined net income of 1.3 trillion yen, the lowest since the year ended March 2010.
Banks worldwide are setting aside billions of dollars to prepare for a wave of defaults as the coronavirus triggers potentially the worst global recession since the Great Depression. Interest-rate cuts around the world are compounding the misery for Japanese banks, which have been expanding loans abroad to make up for negative rates at home.
For years, Japanese banks have relied on low credit costs to prop up earnings as rock-bottom rates erode lending profitability. They have also been booking gains from sales of shares held in corporate clients -- something that’s becoming tougher after equity markets tumbled this year.
One bright sign for investors is the lenders all pledged to at least maintain dividend payments, with Sumitomo Mitsui planning an increase in the current fiscal year. That confirmed analysts’ expectations even after some overseas rivals were forced to curb or withhold payouts at the behest of regulators.
Another is the prospect of Japan reopening parts of its economy as new virus cases decline. The government is lifting a state of emergency in most prefectures earlier than scheduled and will evaluate next week whether do the same in major cities including Tokyo.
Mizuho CEO Tatsufumi Sakai said his bank’s projections for a 29% drop in profit this year were based on the assumption that the economy will bottom out by the end of the next quarter. Similarly, MUFG’s forecast was based on a slow U-shaped recovery.
Data next week is likely to confirm that Japan is in a deep recession, with analysts estimating the economy shrank an annualized 4.5% in the first three months of the year. Gross domestic product is expected to plunge 21.5% in the current quarter.
The banks are seeing strong loan demand, as businesses scramble to secure funding to weather the economic storm. Loans at major lenders grew the most since 2009 in April, Bank of Japan figures showed this week.
That may not be sustained because companies will have little incentive to spend during the slump.
“In the very short term, large corporates do have liquidity needs,” said Michael Makdad, an analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Tokyo. “You get a short-term boost, but after that things slow down.”

289,By Investing.com,"<span>May 15, 2020 05:53AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Richemont Mulls Bargain Stock Issue on Slow Road Back to Normal,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Times are tough for the luxury business. After spending the last three months cutting prices to drum up sales of watches, fashion goods and jewelry, Switzerland’s Richemont  (SIX:CFR) is now looking at offering its shares on the cheap.
The group behind Cartier and Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net a Porter is “looking at the potential to provide shareholders with some additional form of reward” to make up for the fact that it’s just cut their dividend in half. “Such a ‘loyalty bonus’ could potentially take the form of the distribution to shareholders of an instrument entitling them to acquire further shares on advantageous terms,” chairman Johann Rupert wrote in presenting the group’s annual results.
While most companies are pruning payouts to conserve cash right now, Richemont’s caution still stands out, given that it was still sitting on nearly 2.4 billion euros of net cash at the end of its fiscal year in March, and given that the cost of debt is likely to remain at rock-bottom levels for years.
Rupert will be hoping that discounted shares meet a better reception than discounted goods. The company’s operating loss at its online channel, which it depends on to reach new customers (especially in e-commerce-heavy China) more than doubled in the last 12 months to over 240 million euros.
Nor was Rupert optimistic about a return to normal any time soon, even though he said that the company has seen “strong demand” since it reopened its 462 boutiques in China.
“No-one can say when we will see economic activity normalize,” Rupert said, with disarming frankness. “Other economies will probably find it difficult to emulate China. We may be looking at 12, 24 or 36 months of grave economic consequences. Perhaps that is too pessimistic but who knows?”
 Richemont  shares were among the worst performers in the sector on Friday, dropping 1.0% on a broadly up-day for European markets. The benchmark Stoxx 600 rose 1.2%, while the Swiss SMI rose 1.0%, the FTSE 100 rose 1.5% and the German Dax was up 1.7%.  
Perhaps, in these straitened times, if you have to deal in luxuries, then it’s best to be in little ones, such as high-end ear buds. Much of the profit in those goes to German battery maker  Varta  (DE:VAR1), which has reinvented itself as a maker of microbatteries for the increasing array of gadgets that populate the Internet of Things.
Varta stock rose 7.8% to a three-month high on Friday after it reported a stellar 68% increase in organic revenue in the first quarter, but the company’s earnings release buried an even more startling nugget at the bottom:
“The high level of discipline we have shown in implementing protective measures against COVID-19 has meant we have been able to continue production without any restrictions so far,” CEO Herbert Schein said. Bucking the global uncertainty, the company expects increased operating cash flow this year that will finance an expansion of production capacity.
Overall revenue doubled as the company re-consolidated its traditional consumer battery business, which can hardly be suffering as locked-down children get to spend more time with electronic toys. For parents at least, the peace and quiet that can be bought (if only for a little while, alas) with AA and AAA is arguably the best-value luxury out there."

(Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, with miners and energy firms gaining after China reported its first monthly rise in factory output this year, but concerns about global economic recovery kept stocks on course for weekly declines. 
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 1%. Miners (SXPP), exposed to the health of the world's second-largest economy, jumped 3.7% after data showed China's industrial production climbed at a faster-than-expected 3.9% in April.
A surge in oil prices amid signs that demand was picking up helped add 2.2% to the oil & gas index (SXEP).
Global stock markets have slid this month after a solid recovery in April on fears of a possible resurgence in COVID-19 cases as economies ease restrictions. The STOXX 600 is set for its biggest weekly drop since the height of mid-March selling.
""The market is torn between stimulus, new infections and economic data,"" Keith Temperton at Tavira Securities said. ""The data is bad, but the stimulus is outweighing it for now. But I don't imagine it's going to last.""
U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with Beijing over the coronavirus, saying he has no interest in speaking to his Chinese counterpart right now and suggested he could even cut ties with the country.
However, global stocks took cues from a strong session on Wall Street overnight, pinning hopes on the reopening of economies and the possibility of additional stimulus.
An early reading of Germany's GDP showed Europe's largest economy contracted by 2.2% in the first quarter, its steepest slump since the 2009 financial crisis, but was largely as expected.
Supporting market gains on Friday, German food-processing equipment maker GEA Group (DE:G1AG) jumped 11% after reporting better-than-expected first quarter results and confirmed its 2020 forecast.
Britain's biggest telecoms group BT Group Plc (L:BT) surged 8.7% after a report that it was in talks to sell a multi-billion pound stake in its wholly owned network subsidiary, Openreach.
Swiss drugmaker Roche (S:ROG) edged up 1.1% after saying it would start selling a new digital diagnostics product that may simplify and accelerate screening of COVID-19 patients.
However, Swiss-based luxury group  Richemont  (S:CFR) fell 2.3% as it saw strong demand in China but expects ""headwinds in the months ahead"" globally due to the new coronavirus.

British retailer WH Smith (L:SMWH) dropped 5.5% as its total revenue plunged 85% in April after sales at its airport and train station shops and kiosks were hit by government travel restrictions.

France's tourism sector, which accounts for almost 8% of economic output, has been hammered by the pandemic, although companies are implementing schemes to encourage people to eventually return. 
Accor and  Axa  said in a statement that their programme would be operational from July.
""This initiative combined with our ... enhanced hygiene protocols, will be key to rediscover the love of travel,"" said Sebastien Bazin, Chairman and CEO of Accor.
Accor guests would get free access to the medical network and online consultations run by French insurer AXA. Eventual face-to-face consultations or medications would be charged to clients, according to the agreement.
In France 95% of hotels are still closed, although countries around the world are slowly easing draconian lockdown measures aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus. 
The pandemic has driven a surge in the use of online medical consultations across many countries, as the virus threat led to some anxiety among patients amid worries that seeing a doctor in person could expose them to infection. 

France on Thursday announced measures worth 18 billion euros ($19 billion) to support the tourism industry.

At 4:25 AM ET (0825 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.3% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 0.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 1.2%.
Earlier Friday, China reported that its industrial production increased 3.9% year-on-year in April, beating analyst forecasts of a 1.5% increase and giving a sign that the Chinese industrial juggernaut is picking up steam again. However, for a second straight month,retail sales lagged badly,  slumping 7.5% year-on-year.
Closer to home, the latest reading for first-quarter GDP in Germany confirmed a 2.2% slump, its steepest three-month decline since the 2009 financial crisis.
In corporate news, Swiss luxury group Richemont fell 2.2% after warning that the luxury sector could take three years to recover from the current crisis.
In the U.K., BT Group (LON:BT) jumped 7% after the Financial Times reported it was in talks to sell a multi-billion pound stake in its wholly owned network subsidiary, Openreach, to infrastructure investors.
Bookmaker  William Hill  (LON:WMH) soared over 10% as it managed to obtain from its banks latitude regarding some debt covenants, news that overshadowed the inevitable slump in revenue due to the total absence of sport and the closure of its betting shops. 
French manufacturer  Imerys  (PA:IMTP) climbed 14% after saying it had reached an agreement to resolve legal liabilities regarding its North America talc unit.
Overnight, the major indices on Wall Street all closed higher, aided by sharp gains towards the end of the session as a White House spokeswoman said President Donald Trump was open to another possible stimulus bill, but will not sign the bill put forward by House of Representatives Democrats.
The Democrats had put forward another relief bill, totalling $3 trillion, earlier in the week, but this had been rebuffed by the Republicans.

Some industry players say the shift to cosier working conditions has lifted the market participation by retail investors.
A 60% rally in the Mothers start-up shares market (MTHR), a favourite for retail investors, from a trough hit in mid-March, for example, has helped online brokerages, even as their institutional business slows.
Those online trading windfalls come despite a 40% decline in volumes on the Tokyo Stock Exchange since late March, when the coronavirus panic subsided.
Constrained to working at home, institutional investors limited trades, often to a bare minimum, as executing transactions became slower and more cumbersome away from their office trading desks.
Filling some of that void was an army of amateur traders.
The proportion of trades conducted by retail investors has risen to around 20% in recent weeks, exchange data showed, from around 15% in the past two years.
That was the highest percentage in more than two years, excluding year-end and new-year periods when participation by big foreign players typically declines.
""Looking at the characteristics of people who are trading, it seems likely that office workers who are now working from home are stepping up trading as it is easier to do so at home,"" said Tomoichiro Kubota, senior market analyst at Matsui Securities, which specialises in retail investors.
Although Japan has so far avoided the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak, with the total cases of about 15,000, many workers have started working from home after a government-declared state of emergency last month.
Based on mobility data by Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the number of people who travelled to work declined 30% in Japan and 41% in Tokyo in recent weeks.
""Since I started working from home, I have more time looking at charts. In the past, I could check charts only during my break between noon and one p.m.,"" said a 30-year-old Osaka engineer, who requested to be identified only as Kurono.
Kurono said he started working from home in early April. While he acknowledged big advantages to trading during market hours, there are downsides.

""You can maximise profits and minimise losses - the only drawback is the progress on my regular work becomes a bit slower.""

""High net short positions alone are not a reason,"" she said.
Hedge funds have significantly increased their bets on falling shares over the past few days. Net short positions now stand at more than ten percent, according to data published in the Federal Gazette on Thursday.
Short-selling is when an investor borrows shares to sell in the hope of being able to buy them back later at a lower price.
It marks a change of approach for the Bonn-based regulator which issued a two month short selling ban to curb the stock's volatility in 2018 after the Financial Times cast doubt on the company's accounting.
Wirecard denies accounting irregularities and disclosure violations. 
In an attempt to shore up investor confidence, Wirecard hired KPMG to conduct an independent audit. 
Last month KPMG published its report and said it had insufficient information to disprove the allegations, leading to an immediate 26% drop in Wirecard's share price.

BaFin said earlier this week it was conducting multiple investigations into Wirecard, which said it fully supports requests for information.

297,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 03:01AM ET</span>",Asia shares down on week as U.S.-China tensions rattle sentiment,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Asian stocks edged up on Friday but were on course to end the week lower as deteriorating U.S.-China relations add to uncertainties over how fast economies can recover as they start to emerge from lockdowns.
Worries about confrontations between the two largest economies in the world eclipsed Chinese economic data, which showed its economy is gradually recovering from the shock of the coronavirus outbreak.
With China the first to relax lockdowns, global investors are closely watching it for clues on how long demand will take to bounce back, as other countries begin to ease their own anti-virus measures.
European stocks are expected to play catch-up with the late recovery in U.S. shares on Thursday, with pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 futures (STXEc1) up 1.21%.
U.S. S&P500 futures (ESc1) dipped 0.2% after the index gained 1.15% the previous day, recovering from a three-week low.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) rose 0.6% but finished the week down 0.7% while mainland Chinese shares (SSEC) were mixed.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) rose 0.2% but has lost about 1.0% so far this week.
While many analysts regarded the weekly drop as a natural correction after a rally since mid-March, they are increasingly worried about rising U.S.-China tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump blames China for its handling of the COVID-19 disease that has killed more than 85,000 Americans.
Trump signalled a further deterioration of his relationship with China by saying he has no interest in speaking to President Xi Jinping right now.
He went so far as to suggest he could even cut ties with the world's second-largest economy, a day after the U.S. federal pension fund delayed investment in Chinese shares in the wake of pressure from the White House.
The move fanned fears the confrontation between Washington and Beijing could escalate beyond trade to finance and other areas.
""The U.S.-China trade war was the biggest theme for markets last year. It will be a big concern if the conflict escalates beyond trade,"" said Takeo Kamai, head of execution at CLSA.
China's industrial output in April rose 3.9% from a year earlier, exceeding expectations for a 1.5% rise and expanding for the first time this year as its economy slowly emerges from its coronavirus lockdown.
But retail sales remained weak as unemployment rose.
""On the whole, the Chinese economy is improving and the industrial output figures suggest GDP could be positive in April-June,"" said Wang Shenshen, senior strategist at Mizuho Securities. ""But concerns about the U.S.-China relations are weighing on markets."" 
In the currency market, the dollar steadied near a three-week high as Sino-U.S. tensions and worries about a second wave of coronavirus infections rattled investors.
In Asia, major currencies were little changed with the euro changing hands at $1.0806 (EUR=) and the yen at 107.19 per dollar .
Oil prices extended gains as data showed demand for crude picking up in China after the easing of curbs to stem the coronavirus outbreak, boosting hopes that the global supply overhang may start to fade.

U.S. crude futures traded 2.1% higher at $28.42 per barrel.

298,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 15, 2020 02:54AM ET</span>",IPhone Maker Hon Hai’s Profit Dives 89% in Virus-Hit Quarter,"(Bloomberg) -- Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. posted its worst profit decline on record after the coronavirus disrupted its China production and lockdowns dampened global smartphone demand.
Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).’s most important manufacturing partner recorded a 89% decline in net income to NT$2.1 billion ($70 million) in the first three months of 2020. Revenue slid almost 12% to NT$929.7 billion, according to Bloomberg News’ calculations based on previously reported monthly sales numbers.
Known as Foxconn, the Taiwanese company gets half its revenue from making iPhones and devices for Apple in China. But global shipments of smartphones fell at their fastest rate on record in the first quarter, hitting the assembler’s sales even though its main production facilities managed to return to full seasonal staffing levels around mid-March.
Production at many of Apple’s Asian partners ground to a halt after efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19 kicked in. That resulted in severe shipping delays for devices and led to component supply bottlenecks. Consumers also sheltered at home, hammering retail sales. At one point, Apple shuttered all 42 retail outlets in China, a critical market for the company, followed by store closures in other countries. While shops in China have reopened, most of its international ones have not.
Covid-19 has also delayed product development and launches. Apple’s four upcoming redesigned iPhones with 5G will come out several weeks later than usual -- but still within the fall window -- Bloomberg News has reported. In May, Apple failed to provide a forecast for the first time in more than a decade.
Foxconn has already slashed its 2020 revenue projections in the wake of the pandemic. It told investors in April that it still has time to help Apple launch new iPhones in time for the holidays, but cautioned the schedule could be disrupted if the pandemic persists.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Hon Hai’s sales pressure from the coronavirus pandemic, U.S.-China trade disputes, smartphone-market weakness and a broader slowdown in tech spending won’t abate quickly and will likely mean a w-shaped sales recovery through 2020, even as its Chinese manufacturing gets back to full seasonal capacity.

301,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Taiwan's TSMC to build Arizona chip plant as U.S.-China tech rivalry escalates,"By Stephen Nellis and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TW:2330), the biggest contract chipmaker, said it plans to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona in an apparent win for the Trump administration's efforts to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China.
The plan, which will create over 1,600 jobs, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump steps up criticism of Chinese trade practices and Beijing's handling of the novel coronavirus ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.
Trump has long pledged to bring manufacturing back from overseas and now a steep economic slump brought on by the coronavirus is driving a government-wide push to end U.S. production and supply chain dependency on China.
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross touted the deal as ""another indication that President Trump’s policy agenda has led to a renaissance in American manufacturing.""
TSMC is a major supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and  Qualcomm Inc  (O:QCOM), as well as Chinese firms like Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], which Washington has put on a trade blacklist.
""This project is of critical, strategic importance to a vibrant and competitive U.S. semiconductor ecosystem that enables leading U.S. companies to fabricate their cutting-edge semiconductor products within the United States,"" TSMC said. 
While huge in terms of foreign investment in the United States, the plan is small by TSMC's standards. For 2020, TSMC's capex plan is $15-$16 billion. 
The Taiwanese chipmaker said the plan was to build the plant over nine years.
""The budget... suggests the eventual scale won't be big,"" Bernstein analysts said in a note, adding revenue contribution from the plant will stay at around 3%-4%.
""The scale and technology is similar to what TSMC did in China, suggesting a balance between the US & China.""
A U.S. Commerce Department official said TSMC's decision to locate the plant in the United States generated ""good will"" at the department, the drafter of a law that would, if implemented, severely restrict TSMC chip sales to Huawei. 
 Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts said proposed restrictions could threaten TSMC’s 14% of sales from Huawei, escalate U.S.-China tensions and delay the rollout of the next-generation 5G mobile network.
""While it is hard to be certain, we believe that TSMC announcing a U.S. Fab could remove the threat of further Huawei restrictions in the very near-term at least,"" JP Morgan analysts said in a note.
Shares of TSMC, the world's most valuable semiconductor company with a market capitalisation of about $255 billion, exceeding  Intel Corp 's (O:INTC), closed up 1.7% on Friday, outperforming a 0.3% gain in the main Taiwan stock market (TWII).
ADVANCED CHIPS
The plant, the biggest foreign investment by TSMC, will produce the most sophisticated 5 nanometer chips, which can be used in high-end defense and communications devices. 
TSMC manufactures the bulk of its chips in Taiwan and has older chip facilities in China and Washington state.
Its chips power Apple's iPhones and the iPhone maker works closely with TSMC to become the first to take advantage of new advances in its chip-making processes.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said chips from the new TSMC plant will power everything from artificial intelligence to 5G base stations to F-35 fighter jets.
Semiconductors play a key role in both consumer electronics and defense equipment. The vast majority of the most advanced chips are made in Asia, which has caused concern among U.S. officials as a strategic rivalry with China deepens over the origins of the deadly coronavirus.
While Intel has major manufacturing operations in the United States, it supplies only its own chips rather than making them for outside customers.
The Trump administration has been in talks with both Intel and TSMC to build a plant in the United States, and Intel said last week it was in discussions with the Department of Defense about improving domestic sources for microelectronics and related technology.
The TSMC announcement is not expected to derail the Pentagon’s efforts to bolster the supply chain for microprocessors, despite the Commerce Department's working on the TSMC deal independently, a person familiar with the matter said.
Apple and Intel declined to comment.
TSMC said that construction of the Arizona facility would begin in 2021 with production targeted to begin in 2024, and that it would be able to process up to 20,000 silicon wafers per month. Each wafer can contain thousands of individual chips. The investment will be made from 2021 to 2029.

The Wall Street Journal first reported the latest details of TSMC's plans.

The bank lowered its 2020 global gross domestic product forecast to a contraction of 4.8%, according to a note from chief economist Janet Henry dated May 12 and published on Friday.
It had forecast a 3.3% contraction for the year in early April. Many large banks last published growth forecasts around then and the cut could signal another round of dire predictions.
HSBC has downgraded its 2020 forecasts for the developed world from a contraction of 5.9% to a contraction of 7.1% and for emerging economies from 0.5% growth to a 1.7% contraction. It forecasts full year U.S. GDP at -7.0% and China's at 1.7% growth.
""Most countries under our coverage have either tightened lockdown restrictions or extended the duration of them,"" Henry wrote in the note, co-authored with economist James Pomeroy.
Where reopening has begun, it has also been slower and more tentative than had been expected a few weeks ago, they said.
""It is not just the pace of opening up and possible behavioural shifts that is damping the pace of activity, but consumer sentiment and employment prospects too.
""This has already been evident in China and will likely be a factor in many countries.""
China on Friday reported a better-than-expected rebound in April industrial production but consumer spending languished.
The International Monetary Fund's chief economist said this week that data gathered since April confirmed her forecasts for a 3% contraction this year, or worse.

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a virtual halt in air travel, leading to an unprecedented number of flight cancellations globally and forcing airlines to book hefty losses.
Southwest last month posted its first quarterly loss in nine years and warned that there was no major improvement in air travel in the second quarter.
As the industry grapples with the crisis, Kelly said in a video posted on the airline's website that the company was offering employees more options to opt-in for leaves as well as voluntary separation packages. 
About 21% of the company's active workforce is volunteering to take some form of time off or partial pay program, Kelly added.
The airline is receiving about $3.3 billion in government payroll support and had said that it was considering tapping an additional $2.8 billion in secured government loans under the stimulus package known as the CARES Act, among other liquidity options.
It had $9.3 billion in cash and short-term investments as of April 24, with leverage of 47%.
Under the terms of government payroll support, airlines cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30. If demand remains weak, Southwest has said it may need to reduce its workforce after that date and re-think its fleet.

Separately, the Dallas-based company also said it would provide masks to passengers who are not wearing one. It had implemented a policy on Monday that required passengers to wear face masks or coverings.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Thursday pushed back by two weeks the reopening of automotive plants and the mining sector after the coronavirus lockdown, creating confusion among companies about how soon they can reconnect supply chains tied to U.S. manufacturing.
The government on Wednesday had indicated the auto sector would resume operations on Monday and published advice to that effect in its official gazette. It later withdrew the page from the gazette and on Thursday published fresh instructions in the gazette indicating the industry would not reopen until June 1.
""This would be a real crisis for suppliers,"" said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, a major U.S. auto parts industry group, referring to the possibility of not being allowed to resume production next week in Mexico.
Despite the intensifying challenge posed by the pandemic in Mexico, the United States and auto companies have been pressing its government to reopen factories quickly because automakers will struggle to operate without parts from south of the border.
Some lawmakers in President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's ruling MORENA party had publicly expressed concern about a Monday restart in regions badly hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
Mexico's Mining Undersecretary Francisco Quiroga on Thursday said certain safety protocols have to be carried out with the ministries of health and labour after May 18, which would take time, before the mining sector reopened.
""In principle, we are planning everything for a start on 1 June,"" Quiroga told Reuters. ""Reopening activities cannot be done from one day to the next.""
The uncertainty follows death figures that show Mexico's pandemic is still increasing, despite government predictions that the virus would peak last week. Tuesday and Wednesday were the two most lethal days in Mexico's outbreak, with 353 and 294 additional deaths.
The Mexican government is now indicating that companies should use the period between Monday and June 1 to put in place their safety protocols to mitigate the virus' spread.
However, auto industry sources told Reuters that talks are still ongoing between Mexico and automakers and suppliers about when they can resume production. 
Industry executives believe Mexico may still clarify whether they can begin production before June 1, the sources said. 
If auto parts plants cannot resume next week, automakers would have to halt most production soon after they restart in the United States and could see shortages of key vehicles assembled in Mexico, the sources said. 
""We are seeking clarity about the situation as soon as possible,"" one Mexican industry source said.
One major industry body representing Mexican auto part manufacturers said it would not adhere to the new date of June 1 and considered the previous May 18 restart date as having legal force.
""We will start to operate according to page 29 of the decree published in the official gazette yesterday,"" said Alberto Bustamante of the National Autoparts Industry lobby group. General Motors' (N:GM) pickup plant in Silao is critical to the Detroit company's North American operations and had been expected to reopen next week. ""But just now I have just been told we will not restart until June 1. For now we will only be able to use the next weeks to get ready to restart the operation,"" said a source in the Silao labor union, who asked not to be identified.
A GM spokeswoman, Teresa Cid, said the company had no comment about an official date to restart manufacturing operations in Mexico.

The ban includes Kangmei’s chairman at the time and five others, who won’t be allowed to participate in the securities market or take positions as executives or board members at any listed company for at least 10 years, Kangmei said in a stock-exchange filing. The China Securities Regulatory Commission also ordered the company, a producer of traditional Chinese medicines, to pay a 600,000 yuan ($84,558) fine.
After a months-long regulatory probe into its finances, Kangmei said in May last year that it had overstated its cash positions by 29.9 billion yuan using false documents and transaction records -- an amount one lawyer said was unprecedented in China. The firm admitted to “serious” deficiencies in its corporate governance and internal controls.
Under China’s previous securities law, the maximum fine for securities violations was 600,000 yuan. Penalties were increased significantly with a new law implemented in March: the maximum punishment for wrongful information disclosure at listed companies is now 10 million yuan, according to the CSRC’s website.
The fine “is way to small compared with the massive amount of Kangmei’s financial fraud and definitely not enough to deter any other company to do the same,” said Jiang Liangqing, a fund manager at Beijing-based Ruisen Capital Management. “It is a loophole of the old securities law. He added the new maximum fine is also “not enough to deter financial fraud compared with the benefit these firms can get. Kangmei’s case just once again shows the lack of deterrence for financial fraud in the A-share market.”
Kangmei shares rose 4.8% in Friday morning trading, the most they could climb as daily moves remain restricted. The stock has tumbled about 70% since the company told investors that it was under investigation in late 2018. Kangmei was removed from the MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) China Index and a list of China Connect Securities almost a year ago.
In February, Kangmei failed to repay about 2.4 billion yuan of puttable bonds. Later that month, a majority of creditors accepted a debt workout proposal in which creditors holding no more than 500,000 yuan in face value would get full repayment. Those owning more would get paid in proportion to their positions.

Cash and unfunded cash commitments were $3.9 billion as of March, Chief Financial Officer Kimberly Ross said in the email. 
The company said last quarter it had $4.4 billion in cash and cash commitments as of end of 2019.
First-quarter revenue rose 45% to $1.1 billion.
WeWork said in late March its cash on hand was enough to meet the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
WeWork faces a tough business environment due to the health crisis as a rush to work-from-home arrangements has weighed heavily on the company by reducing occupancy and increasing operating costs. 
Earlier this week, Chief Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani said in an interview with CNBC that WeWork has collected 70% of rent in April. 
WeWork's 7.875% bond is trading at 39 cents on the dollar and is yielding 34.3%. The bond's price has tumbled from about 85 cents on the dollar since late February, when the coronavirus outbreak slammed financial markets. 
Majority owner SoftBank Group Corp said two weeks ago that it anticipates a loss of about 700 billion yen ($6.6 billion) for the year ended March on the portion of its WeWork investment held outside the Vision Fund, as the coronavirus compounds woes at one of the firm's biggest bets.

SoftBank is embroiled in a legal dispute with two WeWork directors and co-founder Adam Neumann after the Japanese company backed out of a $3 billion tender offer that was part of its bailout of the floundering startup. The tech conglomerate has poured more than $13.5 billion into WeWork.

310,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 08:10PM ET</span>",China's top energy firms to grow gas output despite spending cuts,"By Chen Aizhu and Muyu Xu
SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's top energy producers will grow their natural gas output this year by twice as much as in the previous oil rout even as they slash spending due to collapsing oil prices, company officials and analysts said.
The world's top energy consumer is forecast to expand its natural gas production by 5% or more in 2020 despite plans for deep spending cuts which will likely curb local oil production, they said.
That would be half the growth in 2019 but double the 2.2% growth seen in 2016 following a lengthy oil slump.
China's state-owned energy companies are joining others worldwide in slashing expenditure after this year's 56% drop in oil prices as a global pandemic ravaged economic activity.
As the country's oil and gas trio plan double digit spending cuts, they are prioritising gas development at home particularly as the market is relatively insulated from sharp oil moves due to government subsidies.
""Under the capital expenditure cuts, companies are revising their gas strategy from an earlier aggressive push to a more practical approach, as gas production remains profitable,"" said Zhu Kunfeng, Beijing-based associate director at IHS Markit.
PetroChina (SS:601857), Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) Corp (SS:600028) and CNOOC Ltd (HK:0883) said in April they would reduce spending by roughly 20% to 30%, similar to the cuts they made in the last oil rout in 2015/2016. 
(Graphic: Chinese oil majors' E&P spending link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xegvbkeejpq/nocspending.png) 
Against this backdrop, China's main energy firms are focusing on developing gas and stablising oil at home, while decreasing overseas spending on costly projects such as oil sands and shale gas in North America.
The rise in gas output would also help offset some of the hefty losses these firms have incurred from paying higher prices for gas imports than current market value, prices set out in long-term contracts years ago.
China has boosted gas investment in recent years under a massive anti-pollution drive to replace coal with the lower-carbon gas.
It has also sought to unlock the kind of unconventional resources that have transformed the United States into the world's top gas producer and a leading exporter in the recent decade.
GAS OUTPUT
The bulk of the growth will come from tight gas and shale gas, resources that require unconventional technology like hydraulic fracking to prop open rock shales to allow gas to escape. 
PetroChina and Sinopec, which together pump more than 90% of domestic gas, are set to accelerate drilling at top basins including Ordos in north China, Tarim basin in the northwest and Sichuan in the southwest.
PetroChina and Sinopec were not immediately available to comment.
(Graphic: Chinese oil majors' domestic natural gas output link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/azgvomllmvd/NOCGAS.png)
An oil executive at Changqing in Ordos, China's largest gas field, said gas output there is expected to reach a record 41.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) this year, 2.2% higher versus 2019, by launching nearly 1,000 new production wells. 
""The message across PetroChina is to accelerate productions from new wells and enhancing recoveries at older wells,"" said the executive based in Changqing, who declined to be named due to company policy. 
Companies will also step up developing top shale gas blocks in Sichuan province, making the most of low-cost domestically honed technology and local services and operational expertise like shortened drilling speed. 
Chen Zhu, managing director at SIA Energy, estimated shale and tight gas will rise by a combined 7 bcm in 2020 - which will account for nearly 80% of the total gas increment this year. 
In China's regulated gas market, energy companies receive subsidies for producing uncoventional gas and are allowed to sell them at market-driven rates, thus shielding gas from being immediately impacted by any oil downturn. 
MILDER CUT IN OIL 
In addition to keeping the production of natural gas going, analysts expect China's top energy firms to try to minimize the impact of widespread spending cuts on local oil output.
Analysts at consultancies Wood Mackenzie, Rystad Energy and IHS Markit forecast China's domestic crude oil output may drop 3%-5%, or roughly 133,000 barrels per day this year.
(Graphic: Chinese oil majors' domestic oil output link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/xlbpgnyybvq/NOCCRUDE.png)
PetroChina, which announced the deepest cut in capital expenditure among China's top three energy producers, could lower its crude oil output by 4% a year for the next three years, Woodmac's principal analyst Max Petrov estimated.
But the forecasts are all smaller than the 7% fall in Chinese domestic crude production seen during the last oil rout when crude prices fell to a low of under $30 in early 2016.
That is in part because companies have become more experienced in managing output declines by using more sophisticated drilling techniques, analysts said. 
Meanwhile Chinese energy firm CNOOC Ltd aims to keep domestic oil production at the same level as 2019. It expects oil to average $30-$40 a barrel this year and company officials say most of its projects will break even or win a small profit at those levels.

311,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",China healthcare investment booms on virus-related spending bets,"By Julie Zhu and Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's healthcare and biotech firms are capitalising on a surge of interest in the sector due to the coronavirus pandemic by raising a record $6.8 billion in fresh equity-linked transactions this year. 
While healthcare and related sectors have long been popular, with investors betting that China's ageing population and growing middle class would boost spending, the virus has raised expectations that Beijing will funnel even more funds into them.
""Because of the epidemic outbreak, the biotech, healthcare industry has been valued more by everyone. People realise that no matter what the economy looks like, patients always need to see the doctor,"" said Xia Yu, co-founder and CEO of Chinese biotech firm Akeso Inc.
China's healthcare expenditure accounted for just 6.6% of its GDP in 2018, compared with 17.7% in the United States, according to official data from the two countries. 
""After the virus outbreak, government and society will greatly increase spending on healthcare systems, which will benefit the industry,"" said Andy Lin, founding partner of Chinese private equity firm Loyal Valley Capital.
Loyal Valley has been looking into investment in vaccine- and testing-related companies and encouraged portfolio firms like Shanghai Junshi Biosciences to expand into businesses related to tackling the coronavirus, he said. 
Chinese biotech and healthcare firms have raised $2.1 billion from IPOs in mainland China, Hong Kong and the United States this year, nearly double the rate this time last year, according to Refinitiv data.
Healthcare-related companies have been a driving force in Hong Kong in particular this year, accounting for 30% of the total $2.78 billion raised via IPOs in the city, Refinitiv data showed. 
""It is really the scarcity value. Healthcare right now is probably the most active sector (in the capital markets),"" said Cathy Zhang, a managing director at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) and head of healthcare for Global Capital Markets in Asia.
She also attributed investors' confidence to strong market performance of many biotech firms. 
HEAVILY OVERSUBSCRIBED
An index of Hong Kong-listed biotechs has gained 14% so far this year while the benchmark Hang Seng Index has fallen by about 15%. 
Akeso, which focuses on oncology and immunology, raised $330 million last month in the city's largest IPO this year. Other significant transactions include InnoCare Pharma's $288 million IPO in March and medical devices maker Peijia Medical's $302 million deal this month. 
Both Akeso and Peijia's offerings were heavily oversubscribed by retail and institutional investors, with the retail tranche being over 600 times and 1,000 times covered, respectively, according to public filings and people close to the deals. 
As well as IPOs, investment banks including JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and Morgan Stanley are looking to already-listed groups to raise further funds via follow-on share sales and convertible bonds. 
""For (pre-revenue) biotech companies, it is very important that you are able to continuously raise money after the IPO... The sector's stocks have done quite well, so obviously biotech companies want to take advantage of the share price to continue to raise capital,"" said Morgan Stanley's Zhang. 
Already-listed firms have raised $3.3 billion in follow-on share sales and $1.3 billion from convertible bonds this year, against $1 billion and $712 million, respectively, by this time last year, showed Refinitiv data. 
Some investors and bankers cautioned that despite the rising interest in the sector, many firms might still have to adjust valuations and maintain business growth as the overall economic and market conditions have turned challenging since the virus outbreak. 
""It is actually a testing ground for their abilities,"" said Nisa Leung, managing partner and leader of healthcare sector at China-based Qiming Venture Partners.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) and unions representing workers at Florida's Walt Disney World have reached an agreement on safeguards to protect employees from coronavirus, a union statement said on Thursday, removing one of the company's hurdles to reopening its popular theme parks.
The measures include social distancing practices, increased cleaning and mandatory masks for workers and guests, according to a statement from the Service Trades Council Union (STCU), which represents about 43,000 workers at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. 
Disney shares rose 2.8% to close at $105.91 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Disney has announced that some retail stores and restaurants in the Disney Springs shopping area in Orlando will open on May 20, but the company has not set a reopening date for any of its four theme parks in Florida. 
The entertainment giant shut its parks in Asia, France and the United States starting in late January to help prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading. 
Shutting theme park gates cost the company $1 billion from January through March, Disney said earlier this month. About 120,000 of the company's workers were placed on unpaid furlough, many of them theme park ""cast members,"" as Disney calls them.
As the coronavirus recedes in some parts of the world, Disney has been developing plans to help workers and visitors feel safe returning to large groups. The company reopened Shanghai Disneyland to a limited number of visitors on Monday, selling out thousands of available tickets.
In the United States, Florida is ahead of California, home to Disneyland, in reopening businesses that were closed starting in mid-March. Walt Disney World hotels are accepting reservations for July, though it is unclear if they will be operating at that time. 
Among other measures, the new agreement with Walt Disney World unions calls for plastic barriers and touchless transactions at cash registers, temperature checks for guests, and monthly worker safety meetings, the STCU statement said. 
Employees who contract COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, will receive paid time off to quarantine, the statement said. 

The agreement also paves the way for individual unions to have ongoing discussions with Disney about worker safety, the STCU said.

314,By Investing.com,"<span>May 14, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for May 15,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - It was quite a comeback for the Dow today as investors finally decided to dip back into financial stocks.
Bulls will hope that the same sentiment that was able to shrug off a rise of 3 million in jobless claims today will be on hand tomorrow, with more devasting data expected.
Here are three things that could move the market tomorrow.
1. Consumer in Focus
Retailers without a big online presence will be hoping measures to reopen across the country will start paying dividends quickly.
Tomorrow the market will get see what is expected to be another historically band month for sales.
The Commerce Department will report the April retail sales figures at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that retail sales plunged 12% last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. That would be the biggest drop ever, taking the top spot from March’s dive of 8.4%.
Core retail sales, which exclude autos, are forecast to have dropped 8.6%, compared with a 4.2% drop in March.
There will be more shopping data when the University of Michigan issues its preliminary measure of May consumer confidence at 10:00 AM ET.
The consumer sentiment index is seen dropping to 68 from 71.8 in April.
That would still be well off the lows seen during the Financial Crisis and the early 1980s.
And the Michigan consumer expectations index is forecast to tick up to 71.8 from 70.1 last month.
2. JOLTS, Empire Manufacturing on the Cards
Along with indicators on retail there will be numbers on the labor market and manufacturing.
At 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT), the Labor Department will release its March Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS).
Job openings, voluntary quits and hires will likely have dropped sharply.
At 8:30 AM ET, the New York Fed will release its measure of manufacturing in the region. The May Empire State Manufacturing Index is seen coming in at -63.50, up slightly from -78.20 in April.
And at 9:15 AM ET, April numbers on industrial production and capacity utilization arrive.
3. Oil Rig Count Likely to Dip Again
Oil prices settled higher thanks to some optimism on demand from the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA).
The specter of negative prices has receded as a drop in total U.S. crude stockpiles and inventories as the Cushing, Okla. hub eased the pressure of storage constraints.
Investors will get another glimpse of how production is faring tomorrow when Baker Hughes issues its measure of rig activity.
Last week the oil rig count dropped to 292, the first time it had fallen below 300 since the Great recession.   "

The sportswear maker forecast a hit to its fourth-quarter financials in all the geographies where its products are sold, as only 5% to 40% of Nike-owned stores are open there.
However, the company said all Nike-owned stores are open in China, while more than 95% are open in South Korea, some with reduced hours. It added that traffic remains below prior year levels.
The company also said it is seeing increased new member acquisitions and the strong digital demand is partly offsetting declines in its owned stores and wholesale channel.
Nike has been reopening stores in more than 15 countries including Germany, France, Brazil and the United States.

Shares of the company fell marginally in extended trading.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co's (N:GM) self-driving car unit Cruise told staff on Thursday it has decided to lay off workers, the latest start-up in the nascent industry to cut jobs during the coronavirus pandemic.
Cruise officials acknowledged they were cutting jobs, but declined to confirm the number. According to an internal email partially read to Reuters, about 8% of the staff would be cut, which amounts to more than 140 people.
The outbreak has caused funding to dry up in the autonomous driving industry. That is only the latest challenge in a sector whose promise of large-scale rollouts of so-called robotaxis has been pushed out by many years.
“In this time of great change, we’re fortunate to have a crystal clear mission and billions in the bank. The actions we took today reflect us doubling down on our engineering work and engineering talent,"" Cruise spokesperson Milin Mehta told Reuters.
The cuts at Cruise, which had 1,800 full-time employees, come just a week after GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said the No. 1 U.S. automaker's commitment to Cruise was ""unwavering"" and it was growing the business.
""Cruise is well capitalized,"" she told analysts on a May 6 conference call after GM posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit. ""We have and will continue to grow our team by recruiting and retaining the very best engineering and leadership talent.""
The email said layoffs at Cruise include staff at an engineering team in Pasadena, California, that works on Lidar, a sensor technology that uses pulsed laser light to sense objects, similar to the way radar uses radio waves. The email was sent by Cruise CEO Dan Ammann on Thursday. 
Lidar start-ups had mushroomed when self-driving car tech drew billions of dollars in investments.
The cuts at Cruise echo pain felt elsewhere in the industry.

Starsky Robotics, a five-year-old San Francisco start-up focused on automating long-haul freight delivery, closed its doors in mid-March due to lack of funding. And Zoox, a self-driving tech firm based in Silicon Valley, also has laid off staff during the pandemic.

(Reuters) - Wall Street surged on Thursday as investors weighed the prospect of economic recovery against bellicose remarks from President Donald Trump regarding U.S.-China trade and a whistleblower's dire warnings about the U.S. response to the coronavirus pandemic.
While all three major U.S. stock indexes ended the session solidly higher, they see-sawed for much of the day, with reopening state economies and the possibility of additional stimulus doing battle with revived trade war fears and bleak economic data.
""This market is a battle over time frames,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. ""Those pushing the market up believe we're going to get a vaccine in a reasonable amount of time, the economy isn't totally going to fall apart, that unemployment is not going to spike appreciably higher."" 
""On days when (the market is) pushed down, the naysayers come to the forefront, when it bounces back up the more optimistic investors see an opportunity,"" Ghriskey added.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the governor's lockdown orders, fueling hopes that mandated restrictions could be lifted sooner rather than later.
But an ousted health official testified before a U.S. House of Representatives panel that the United States could face ""the darkest winter"" if its response to the pandemic failed to improve.
Comments by Trump late Wednesday blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak and revived trade war fears, even as mandated lockdowns continue to damage the economy. 
That damage was in evidence in a report from the U.S. Labor Department, which showed just under 3 million new jobless claims last week, pushing the seven-week tally well over 36 million.
A White House spokeswoman said Trump is open to another possible stimulus bill, but will not sign the bill put forward by House of Representatives Democrats.
""One of the major parts of the House bill is support for state and local governments and that's critical for state institutions that are really hurt by this pandemic,"" Ghriskey added.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 377.37 points, or 1.62%, to 23,625.34, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 32.5 points, or 1.15%, to 2,852.5 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 80.55 points, or 0.91%, to 8,943.72.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but consumer staples (SPLRCS) closed higher, with financials (SPSY) and energy companies (SPNY) enjoying the biggest percentage gains.
First-quarter earnings season is on the final stretch, with 451 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 66.7% have beaten consensus, according to Refinitiv data.
In aggregate, earnings for the first three months of the year are seen falling by 12.1% from the year-ago quarter, a stark reversal from the 6.3% annual growth seen on Jan. 1.
Cisco Systems Inc (O:CSCO) closed up 4.5% after its earnings beat, driven by a jump in demand for its work-from-home networking equipment.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.20-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.03-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted four new 52-week highs and 16 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 117 new lows. 
Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.81 billion shares, compared with the 11.45 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com – The Dow made an impressive comeback on Thursday, bouncing back from deep losses, led by a surge in financials, even as U.S.-China tensions flared up again and millions more Americans filed for unemployment.  
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.62%, or 377 points, but had been down by as many 570 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 gained 1.15%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.91%.
A jump in financials stocks turned the tide of selling to buying as traders seemingly swooped for beaten-down bank stocks, even as the fears of a deep recession and longer-than-expected recovery threaten to ramp-up defaults in the coming months.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) closed more than 4% higher, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)  jumped 6.9% following a report of speculation it could merge with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
But the economic backdrop is hardly supporting the bull case in markets, as the latest surge in weekly jobless claims means that now one in four working Americans are claiming unemployment benefits.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims were 2.981 million for the week ended May 9, above economists' forecasts of 2.5 million.
Just a day earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he expected unemployment would likely peak over the next month. 
Tech stocks, meanwhile, also recovered losses as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) turned positive, with chip stocks also catching a bid.
Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) were among the biggest gainers.
Elsewhere, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) climbed 0.5% after it acquired Metaswitch Networks as the tech giant looks to bolster its move into telecommunications.
Energy stocks were supported by rising oil prices after the International Energy Agency touted an improved outlook in the wake of easing coronavirus restrictions, though it warned that any resurgence in infections would pose a major risk to oil demand.
Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) ended up 0.75% higher, cutting its intraday losses even as Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it will ""permanently retire"" its fleet of 18 Boeing 777 aircraft by the end of the year as part of efforts to cut costs."

DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) is ready to start building its new generation of large sport utility vehicles at a plant in Arlington, Texas, when it reopens North American assembly plants on May 18, Philip Kienle, the automaker's North American manufacturing chief, told Reuters on Thursday.
The big SUVs, including the Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Suburban, are critical to the automaker's profitability, and especially so now that GM has taken on billions in new debt and suspended its dividend to ride out the coronavirus crisis.
Workers at the Arlington plant volunteered to finish the last of the current generation of GM's Cadillac Escalade, Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon SUVs after GM shut down most operations in March. 
""That was an amazing feat in itself,"" Kienle said.
Workers then finished retooling the factory, clearing the way for the redesigned models to begin production next week, he said. 
""That work is complete. We are ready to start the system fill and start the new model,"" Kienle said. Before it had to shut its North American plants, GM had told suppliers it was aiming to launch the new large SUV lineup beginning in late April. 
As North American vehicle manufacturing restarts, GM also plans to focus on accelerating production of its profitable large pickup trucks, Kienle said. He would not comment on the timetable for restoring three shift operations at the company's pickup plants. 
GM executives have said the automaker is running short of certain truck models after losing 40 days of production to a strike last fall.
GM suppliers have been told the company plans to resume three-shift production at it Fort Wayne, Indiana, truck plant as soon as June 1, according to information viewed by Reuters.
Like rival U.S. automakers, GM has had workers going through its North American factories this week, fitting them with new safety equipment ahead of Monday's relaunch. GM,  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) are following the same coronavirus safety procedures, in agreement with the United Auto Workers. 
Kienle said the pace of the company's production restart will be ""slow and deliberate"" and will depend on safety within GM's plants, and the performance of suppliers that are restarting their own factories.

328,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>",Mexico Central Bank Cuts Key Rate to Lowest Level Since 2016,"(Bloomberg) -- Mexico’s central bank cut the benchmark interest rate to its lowest level in three-and-a-half years as the country falls into a recession that economists say will be the worst in decades. The peso strengthened following the unanimous decision by the board not to cut any deeper.
Banco de Mexico, led by Governor Alejandro Diaz de Leon, reduced borrowing costs by half a point to 5.5%, as forecast by 20 out of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. One economist had predicted a 75-basis point cut and another saw a 100 basis-point drop.
The move followed two unscheduled rate cuts of half point each in March and April as the normally hawkish central bank moved quickly to contain the impact of the pandemic and plunging oil prices. Mexico faces an economic contraction that may reach as much as 12% this year, according to the most pessimistic forecast by BBVA (MC:BBVA) analysts.
“I am surprised that the decision was unanimous, after some board members had hinted at the need to move faster,” said Alonso Cervera, chief Latin America economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG. The board is “refraining from declaring victory over inflation despite the collapse in growth.”
Following the decision, the peso gained 0.4% to 24.0863 per dollar.
Unless the bank gives new guidance in upcoming days or weeks, the strong central scenario will be for a 25 basis-point cut at its next meeting on June 25, Cervera said.
The central bank board stated in the communique that accompanies its decision that it saw an economic slump deepening in the second quarter, along with a significant contraction in employment.
‘Monetary and Fiscal’
Central bank policy makers Thursday suggested that fiscal stimulus would be helpful to financial markets and the economy.
“Persevering in strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals, and adopting the necessary actions - both in monetary and fiscal areas - will contribute to a better adjustment of national financial markets and to the economy as a whole,” the central bank board wrote it in its statement.
The country suffered record losses of formal jobs in April as President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador steadfastly resists major fiscal stimulus or bailouts for the nation’s largest companies.
The easing cycle has seen Mexican rates decline from 8.25% in less than a year, and is widely expected to continue. Swap markets are pricing a terminal rate near 4.2% in a year before staging a rebound.
Despite the pace of reductions, Mexico continues to maintain one of the world’s highest real rates in order to protect the Mexican peso and limit inflation.
MEXICO INSIGHT: Track the Recession -- High-Frequency Dashboard
But slowing inflation has bolstered expectations for easing, as prices fell 1.01% in April, the most for any one-month period since at least 1969. Meanwhile, the peso has lost nearly 22% of its value this year, but showed early signs of recovery in May, strengthening close to 1% as of Wednesday.
Apart from the rate reductions, Banxico has made a concerted effort to boost market liquidity, selling dollar credit using a $60 billion swap line with the Federal Reserve. The central bank has also increased sales of non-deliverable forward hedges.

329,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>","U.S. eases rules for truck drivers, allowing longer work day","By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department on Thursday published new rules for truck drivers that will allow short-haul drivers to work a longer day and revising rules for longer trips, saying the changes will save the industry $2.8 billion over 10 years.
Safety advocates criticized the change, saying it would lead to more fatigue-related crashes.
The Transportation Department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) said the changes include lengthening the maximum on-duty period for short-haul drivers from 12 to 14 hours and extending the distance limit from 100 air miles to 150 air miles. The current limit of 11 hours of driving time is unchanged, but the longer work day applies to the time needed for stops such as deliveries.
The decision, which takes effect this fall, could give a boost to online shopping deliveries.
While some Democrats in Congress and labor unions opposed the changes to short-haul driving, the top Republican on the House of Representatives Transportation and Infrastructure Committee praised the rule. The Transportation Department said it did not believe the data supported the contention that crashes would increase.
""Expanding the workday from 12 to 14 hours may result in more deliveries than were possible within a 100 air-mile radius, but total driving time will usually continue to fall short of the 11-hour limit,"" the FMCSA said.
The U.S. trucking industry employs more than 7 million people and moves 70% of U.S. domestic freight.
The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, Robert Sumwalt, told the FMCSA last year the agency had ""presented no evidence that the proposed changes will improve highway safety. ... We understand that drivers and motor carriers value flexibility; however, the proposed rules allow hazardous fatigued-driving conditions.""
In 2018, 4,951 people were killed in crashes involving large trucks. The U.S. government said last week it estimates large-truck crash deaths increased 1% last year even as overall deaths fell 1.2%.
The president of the Teamsters union, James P. Hoffa, was sharply critical of the new rule. ""Allowing truck drivers to work longer and longer each day puts everyone on the roads at risk,"" he said in a statement. Expanding short-haul exemptions for local delivery and waste drivers ""would allow drivers to work 14 hours a day without a single federally protected break during their day,"" he said.
The new rules will also allow long-haul truck drivers to take a required 30-minute break using on-duty, not driving status, rather than off-duty status. During off-duty status, truckers may not perform any work, while during on-duty, not driving status they may perform paperwork. The new rules will allow drivers to split a required 10 hours off duty into two periods, and extend by two hours the maximum window during which driving is permitted during adverse driving conditions.

Short-haul drivers do not need to take a 30-minute break.

Investing.com – The Dow clawed back the bulk of its losses on Thursday, shrugging off another surge in jobless claims as financials climbed, led by bank stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.68%, or 157 points, but had been down by as many 570 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 gained 0.19%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 0.65%.
Financials rose 1.3% as banking stocks found their footing after days of getting hammered amid growing fears that a protracted economic recovery could lead to further defaults.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) were up more than 2%, while  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC)  jumped 6% following a report of speculation it could merge with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
On the economic front, investors had to contend with another surge in jobless claims as businesses have been forced to shut down amid government measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims were 2.981 million for the week ended May 9, above economists' forecasts of 2.5 million.
Just a day earlier, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he expected unemployment would likely peak over the next month. 
Energy also pushed the broader market off session lows, underpinned by rising oil prices after the International Energy Agency touted an improved outlook in the wake of easing coronavirus restrictions.
Elsewhere, Boeing (NYSE:BA) fell 0.7% after Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) said it will ""permanently retire"" its fleet of 18 Boeing 777 aircraft by the end of the year as part of efforts to cut costs.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadians should accept the world will change even if a vaccine is found and the coronavirus pandemic ends, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday, urging people to adjust to a new normal that will require modified behavior.
Trudeau unveiled new measures to support hard hit sectors, including C$470 million ($334 million) for fisheries, and the partial reopening of some national parks.
""We have to recognize that things will change in this world, even after the end of this pandemic, even after a vaccine,"" he told reporters. ""COVID-19 will be one of the things that create changes in our society. There will be adjustments.""

It was impossible to put a date on the next stage, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said, adding it was contingent on a continued decline in cases.
""The truth is we can't predict where things will go so we need to be ready,"" Ford told reporters. ""As we get more and more people back to work, the risk of flare up is real so we must be vigilant.""
Canada's coronavirus death toll edged up by 2.5% to 5,337 from Wednesday, one of the smallest daily increases, according to public health agency data.
More than 60% of the deaths have occurred in Quebec, the second most populous of the 10 provinces.
Premier Francois Legault said the situation in Montreal, Canada's second largest city, was fragile. Many enterprises are still closed and a planned reopening on May 25 can only happen if the daily death toll starts to fall, he said.
""I understand some people in the business community are a bit discouraged, but we have to think about our health most of all,"" Legault told a briefing, urging people to wear masks.
Legault also said Montreal schools would stay shut until the start of the new year in late August rather than reopen this month as originally planned. 
Besides support for fisheries, Ottawa will also extend the federal wage subsidy program to encourage more employers to keep workers on the payroll.
Canadian farmers and agriculture businesses have claimed most of the C$5 billion ($3.55 billion) in extra credit offered by Ottawa to boost their cash flow during the coronavirus pandemic, in less than two months. 
In an annual review of Canada's financial systems, the Bank of Canada said that while the coronavirus remains a massive challenge, measures it has taken ""are showing signs of succeeding.""

332,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",European Stocks Post Worst Back-to-Back Losses in Two Months,"(Bloomberg) -- European stocks capped their biggest two-day decline since March on growing concern about the economic toll of the coronavirus and the prospects of a U.S.-China trade war.
The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 2.2% to its lowest close since April 21. All 19 industry groups fell, led by retailers. Banks flirted with a record low closing level, before paring declines in the final hour of trading.
Gloom reigned in the stock market on Thursday after U.S. jobless claims remained in the millions for an eighth week, while President Donald Trump continued to target China, stoking worries about a renewed trade war. Optimism about easing lockdowns and stimulus measures is fading in May after spurring an equity rebound from a mid-March low. Instead, investors have focused on bleak data and an increase in virus cases in countries loosening restrictions, while Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell this week warned of long-term economic damage without further fiscal support.
“Hard on the heels of Jerome Powell’s downbeat comments on the U.S. economy come initial jobless claims that are worse than expectations, although continuing claims are a bit better than thought,” Neil Birrell, chief investment officer at Premier Miton, said by email. “Equities have been struggling since Powell spoke and there is nothing in these numbers to provide respite. However we seem to be immune to such data points, the worry must be that the cumulative effect will become overbearing.”
European equities paced a slump in U.S. peers. Banks in the Stoxx 600 slid as much as 4.5% toward their lowest level on record, before closing 1.3% lower. Thursday’s broad sell-off also saw all western European markets in the red.
“The market optimism between the end of March and early May has now vanished and led markets to fresh lows for the first time since the beginning of the April rally,” said Pierre Veyret, a technical analyst at ActivTrades. “The short to mid-term bullish trend is now over and traders wonder if prices will enter into a horizontal consolidation phase or start a new corrective move that could lead to much lower lows.”

The move follows a report by website dossier.at which said Seele's use of private jets had cost the company 400,000 euros ($432,320) since 2016.
The report also said the partly state-owned company's sponsorship deal with Russian soccer club Zenit in St. Petersburg, reportedly President Vladimir Putin's favourite team, cost 25 million euros ($27 million). 
Berndt told Reuters that all of Seele's, as well as his own, travel expenses from 2017 until the end of last year would be reviewed. ""And also all sponsoring expenses,"" he added.
He defended Seele's travel expenses, saying he had to take up a contract with a charter airline from his predecessor which he could not cancel when he joined OMV as CEO in 2015. The contract ended last year.
The report on Seele's expenses is due by the end of June, Berndt said. 
OMV has said it cannot comment on the terms of the Zenit sponsorship deal due to the contractual terms. 
The company supports many sports associations and cultural events. It is a major sponsor of the Vienna Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) Ball (NYSE:BLL), Austria's most glamorous event, and helps fund Austria's ski jumpers, as well as Vienna soccer club SK Rapid.
OMV, which produces a large part of its gas in Russia and has close business ties with Gazprom (MM:GAZP), launched a 4 billion euros savings programme for 2020 in March. 
Days earlier it agreed to raise its stake in plastics maker Borealis for $4.7 billion, its largest acquisition ever.

334,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Former UAW President Gary Jones pleads not-guilty in embezzlement case,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Former United Auto Workers (UAW) President Gary Jones on Thursday pleaded not guilty to charges that he embezzled more than $1 million of union funds amid a U.S. corruption probe that has raised the specter of a federal government takeover of the union.
Jones, of Canton, Michigan, had the plea entered by his attorney, J. Bruce Maffeo, during a brief videoconference hearing held by the U.S. District Court in Detroit. Jones was released on a $10,000 unsecured bond with the conditions that he surrender his passport and restrict travel to the continental United States.
Jones was charged in March in a criminal information, a court document typically used when the government has reached a plea deal with a defendant to plead guilty. He is scheduled to do that on June 3.
Maffeo declined to comment following Thursday's hearing.
The union in a statement on Thursday called the actions for which Jones was charged ""an unforgivable violation of his oath of office and an utter betrayal.""
Federal officials have said a takeover of the labor union remains an option.
The charging of Jones and other senior UAW leaders has shaken the union and led General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) to file a racketeering lawsuit against its smaller rival, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. FCA has called the lawsuit groundless.
Jones resigned his post and UAW membership in November after the union removed him from office, as U.S. prosecutors widened a criminal investigation of illegal payoffs in which at least 13 people have pleaded guilty.
Jones, a certified public accountant, was charged with conspiracy to embezzle funds from the UAW from 2010 through September 2019, and with conspiracy to defraud the United States by failing to pay taxes on the money prosecutors charge he stole. He faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for each count.
Jones was implicated in the corruption case in September when his former deputy was arrested on embezzlement charges.

In the scandal's wake, the UAW announced ethics reforms and changes to its financial procedures.

José Luis Valls, the president and chairman of Nissan North America and executive vice president of the company, stepped down for family and personal reasons, effective June 15, the company said.
Nissan said Jérémie Papin will oversee the region as vice chairman of North America.
Reuters reported on May 4 that Nissan will pull back from Europe and elsewhere to focus on the United States, China and Japan under a plan that represents a new strategic direction for the carmaker.
The ""operational performance plan"" is due to be announced on May 28 and goes beyond fixing problems from ousted leader Carlos Ghosn's aggressive expansion drive, people with direct knowledge of the plan told Reuters.
Since Ghosn's arrest in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing in 2018, Nissan has struggled to turn around its ousted leader's aggressive growth strategy, which has left the company with underutilised vehicle plants that have drained its finances.

338,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Acquitted former Barclays rainmaker Jenkins plots gentler comeback,"By Kirstin Ridley
LONDON (Reuters) - A near decade-long battle to clear his name has ended in victory, but the star rainmaker credited with playing a pivotal role in saving one of Britain's biggest banks from a government bailout in 2008 is still waiting to put his life back on track.
Former  Barclays  (L:BARC) executive Roger Jenkins headed to his London hotel on Feb. 28 after being unanimously acquitted in a high profile fraud trial revolving around credit crisis-era payments made by Barclays to Qatar.
Jenkins had planned to tie up loose ends before preparing to return to his family in Malibu, California. But the coronavirus pandemic, sweeping across Europe, struck at his luxury hotel just as U.S. President Donald Trump extended a travel ban to Britain.
The former athlete turned multi-millionaire banker packed his bags and is now sitting out a British lockdown, imposed in late March to curb the spread of the virus, in a borrowed house in East Sussex on England's south eastern coast.
It was ""just one of those things"", the softly-spoken 64-year-old told Reuters in his first interview since his acquittal.
The banker, whose tenacity and personal relationship with Qatar's former prime minister helped Barclays secure 4 billion pounds ($4.9 billion) from the wealthy Gulf state 12 years ago, now orders food deliveries because the local shop is only open at weekends. 
But Jenkins, who once sprinted for Scotland in the Commonwealth Games, takes crises in his stride.
Asked how he is, he says: ""Terrific"".
FALLOW YEARS
His relief at the acquittal is tempered with frustration at having cut short a career that earned him a reputation for being one of London's most powerful bankers. 
Nicknamed ""Big Dog"" by colleagues, he secured bonuses that outstripped those of his bosses and was photographed with glamorous women and celebrity friends. But he lived a hectic, globe-trotting life that rarely saw him in the same place for more than four days and holidays were often interrupted or cancelled.
After leaving Barclays in 2009, he set up an advisory business before joining Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual as managing director in 2011, but resigned after British authorities began their investigations.
Over the telephone, Jenkins sounded pragmatic about the mere five hours it took the jury to acquit him and two former colleagues after an eight-year criminal investigation. 
""I have the ability to compartmentalise sometimes,"" he said. ""But it's hard. If you think about this chapter, let's call it eight to 10 years of investigations of a 35 to 40-year career. That's quite a chunk of your working life that this cloud has hung over my head and held me back from doing a lot of things.
""I am looking forward to being active after a very fallow 10 years."" 
He says he feels no resentment towards prosecutors or Britain's Financial Conduct Authority, which last month also closed its civil investigation into his role in the fundraising.
But he added: ""If they are going to deal with such complicated cases, they need staff that really do have the experience of both banking and capital markets, ... that understand the importance and culture of the Middle East and ... ensure that they meet their obligations of fairness ...""
The Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted the case, was not immediately able to provide a comment. But the agency said after the acquittals in February that prosecution decisions were always based on the available evidence.
""Wherever our evidential and public interest tests are met, we will always endeavour to bring this before a court,"" it said. Supporters argue that the SFO's job is to bring cases to trial and that convictions and acquittals are a matter for the jury.
Prosecutors alleged in the trial that the three defendants had lied to the market in public documents and used bogus side agreements to pay Qatar extra fees during Barclays' cash calls. The three defendants denied wrongdoing, saying the deals had been genuine and were approved by superiors and lawyers.
Qatari investors were not investigated.
SMELLING THE ROSES
Jenkins now spends up to five hours a day dealing with and reviewing business interests and hopes to rebuild a career as a financial adviser to banks and public companies.
In the meantime, he reads voraciously about business and ""general life"" and tries to make up for lost time with his children in California, playing chess online with his son and chats to his daughter on FaceTime.
In the family tradition, he is also penning a memoir for his children. He keeps the leather-bound life story his mother wrote for her family close by.
And he still keeps fit, but is more careful than in 2008, when a punishing work schedule, compounded by the stresses of a divorce and ferocious workouts in the pool with weights, led him to rupture his left coronary artery.
In what he calls the ""twilight"" of his career, Jenkins is enjoying the slower pace -- for the moment. 

""I want time to smell the roses a little bit more,"" he says. ($1 = 0.8149 pounds)

341,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",The Covid-19 Vaccine Fight Is Getting Ugly,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- An effective Covid-19 vaccine, if it ever arrives, should be treated as a public good for the whole of society. Every continent has been struck by the virus bar Antarctica.
But the combination of national self-interest and pressure for the pharmaceutical industry to turn a profit is already triggering a geopolitical bust up over who actually gets access to the vaccine first. It’s a reminder that the spoils of drug research aren’t equally divided. The system is ripe for a rethink.
Already, the French government is hauling its national drug-making champion Sanofi (PA:SASY) over hot coals after the company suggested that the U.S. — and not Europe — would be first in line to get access to its proposed vaccine if it works out. The reason, according to Chief Executive Officer Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD), is that the U.S. was first to contribute funding to the project. “Unacceptable,” came the reply from French Junior Economy Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher. The head of Sanofi’s French business quickly sought to defuse the tension by promising that an effective vaccine would be “available to all.” But this debate isn’t going away. French President Emmanuel Macron plans to meet with Sanofi officials next week to discuss the issue. Elsewhere, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc is prioritizing the U.K. in its own vaccine project.
On the surface, Sanofi’s stance seems logical enough. The cost of researching a vaccine is between $500 million and $1 billion, according to a 2015 paper by physician and consultant Stanley Plotkin. If the U.S. taxpayer is willing to foot the bill, shouldn’t they reap some of the reward? Drugmakers know this is a vaccine that will have to be sold in bulk, and not at an eye-wateringly expensive price — Johnson & Johnson, for example, says its own plan is to produce the one it’s working on at cost, or about 10 euros ($10.81). Given some kind of prioritization is going to be necessary as production ramps up to millions of doses, it may as well start with those that funded the project, according to Sam Fazeli, senior pharmaceutical analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
But Paris has a point, too. Sanofi’s vaccine is not produced in a vacuum. The company benefits from European shareholders, employees, factories — and tax credits. It’s worth noting that research and development funding in France is the second-most generous as a share of GDP among countries tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, at 0.4%. (The U.S. comes in tenth.) That’s largely thanks to tax-incentive schemes awarded to companies like Sanofi to the tune of 150 million euros every year. French taxpayers might wonder why that shouldn’t be taken into account.
Simply rapping Sanofi on the knuckles isn’t going to be a durable solution, though. The risk is that, if countries take turns in shoving their way to the front of the line, the result will be a kind of vaccine trade war along national lines. That would make a mockery of the World Health Organization’s plea to view vaccines as a common public good, and would also echo the damaging scramble for masks and medical equipment that set European countries against each other. If France were to get hold of a vaccine first, would Italy or Greece get the same access?
It would be more productive if European countries backed up their indignation by working together more to take on the financial risk of vaccines. Then they could divide the spoils more equally. There is no reason why the European Union’s 27 countries couldn’t come up with their own version of the U.S.’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and match the Trump administration’s deep pockets. The EU’s recent $8 billion vaccine fundraising is one good example, and its joint procurement vehicle for medical equipment and vaccines another.
The broader the cooperation, the more chance countries have to level the playing field with big pharmaceutical companies. Drugmakers have for decades focused on lucrative new treatments protected by patents, often putting them out of reach of people in developing countries. New organizations are fighting this: The United Nations-backed Medicine Patent Pool (NASDAQ:POOL), for example, has licensed patented HIV drugs for manufacture by generics companies at lower cost. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations has also brought together countries to fund vaccine research. 
The pandemic has revealed a lot of problems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, from a dependence on emerging markets for vital drug supplies to a lack of interest in potentially unprofitable vaccine research. If the opportunity here is to ensure life-saving drugs get the funding they need, taxpayers around the world — not just in France or the U.S. — should also get better access to them.

342,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>","Delta, others wrestle with too many planes, too many pilots","By Tracy Rucinski and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) moved to retire its  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 777 fleet and reduce its pilot ranks on Thursday as it joins other airlines wrestling with the need to shrink their operations to match reduced air travel due to the coronavirus crisis.
After announcing that it would no longer fly its 18 wide-body 777s, Delta told its 14,500 pilots that it expects to have 7,000 more than it needs in the fall, according to a memo to flight operations employees first reported by Reuters.
""I recognize that is an alarming number so it's important to know that our intent is to align staffing for what we need over the long term,"" John Laughter, S.V.P. of flight operations, said in the May 14 memo seen by Reuters.
U.S. airlines are collectively burning more than $10 billion in cash per month and averaging fewer than two dozen passengers per domestic flight in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic as they brace for two or three years until air travel will return to pre-crisis levels.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) has also announced a large fleet retirement, and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) has told its pilots to brace for changes. 
All three are receiving billions of dollars in government payroll aid that bans any job cuts before October.
Taking into account the exit of pilots who will reach mandatory retirement age over the next year, Delta would still have between 2,500 and 3,500 more pilots than needed to fly its schedule in the third quarter of 2021, Laughter said.
U.S. pilots must retire by age 65, a requirement that until a few months ago was fueling a rush by airlines to recruit new aviators to feed what the U.S. industry expected would be continued growth in domestic air travel.
But the spread of the novel coronavirus has brought airports around the globe to a virtual standstill, turning airlines' growth plans upside down.
Delta said it also plans to retire its older and higher- maintenance MD-90 planes by the end of the year, resulting in second-quarter non-cash impairment charges of $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, before tax. 
Shares in Delta were down 2.7% at $18.89 in late-morning trading after earlier hitting a 7-year low.
When international demand returns, Delta plans to use Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) more fuel-efficient and cost-effective A330 and A350-900 wide-body planes for long-haul flying, it said.
Few companies in the aviation industry are immune from the shake-down.
Airbus has told senior staff the company must be ""resized"" and is ready to cut jet production again to tackle any second wave of the coronavirus crisis, people briefed on the matter told Reuters.

Despite the grim news, President Donald Trump on Wednesday sounded an optimistic note, saying “the airline industry is in good shape,"" although he provided no evidence.

343,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 14, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>",Cities Seen Losing $360 Billion of Revenue From Economic Rout,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. cities are projected to lose about $360 billion of revenue through 2022 because of the economic damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, an unprecedented loss that would trigger deep spending and job cuts, according to a National League of Cities analysis released Thursday.
Pennsylvania’s municipalities will be hit the hardest, with the potential loss of about 40% of their revenue this year, followed by those in Kentucky, Hawaii, Michigan and Nevada, the advocacy group calculated. The projections are based on the expected rise in unemployment and assumes that every 1 percentage point increase in joblessness will cause tax revenues to fall about 3%.
The dire outlook adds to the growing warnings from state and local government officials about the financial impact of the pandemic-related shutdowns. Without aid from the federal government, cities will be forced to enact vast budget cuts that would exert a drag on the economic recovery.
The survey’s release came a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Congress and the White House may need to enact further economic stimulus beyond the $3 trillion already allocated. House Democrats have proposed a $3 trillion measure that would funnel $1 trillion to cash-strapped state and local governments, though it faces uncertain prospects in the Republican-led Senate.
“If America’s cities are not provided the funds from the federal government, we won’t be a part of the economic solution,” said Clarence Anthony, the league’s chief executive officer. “This survey, and the findings, puts a face on the impact of the pandemic and the need for city leaders to get direct funding to respond quicker than at the state level, where most of the funding has gone in the past.”
The fiscal impacts are being felt around the country, in cities at the epicenter of the outbreak and those whose economies have been shuttered to prevent it. San Francisco expects budget shortfalls of $3.6 billion over the next four years. Houston faces a $169 million shortfall and is seeking to furlough 3,000 workers as part the mayor’s fiscal 2021 budget. To balance its budget, the city will have to use all of its rainy-day fund that’s reserved for emergencies.
“It’s the toughest budget we’ve had to put together since I’ve been mayor,” said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, who took office in 2016.
In Philadelphia, the mayor had to scale back his fiscal 2021 budget proposal in light of a deficit of some $650 million that he said is five times larger than what the city saw in 2009 in the aftermath of the recession.
Overall, U.S. municipalities are expected to lose $134 billion in 2020, $117 billion in 2021 and $110 billion in 2022, according to the league’s projection.
The analysis didn’t assess the impact on specific cities. Rather, it calculated how expected unemployment in each of the 50 states will affect revenues overall in their municipalities. It combined that rate with assessments of the tax structures in each state. Those that rely on sales or income taxes are faring worse than those that rely on property taxes, according to the league.
The league also didn’t factor in aid to cities from states, which are facing their own economic crisis. Last week, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced the state is facing a $54 billion shortfall, roughly one-third of its annual budget. On Wednesday, New Jersey said it will face a $10.1 billion budget gap through fiscal 2021.
The group said that the tax revenue losses for cities could eclipse what they saw during the last recession.
“This is an unprecedented time and it’s going to take unprecedented strategies,” Anthony said.
Anthony sounded an alarm about the pandemic’s impact on rural and small towns. Those cities are struggling with a lack of access to transportation and hospitals and a dearth of comprehensive services, he said.
Kentucky, for instance, is “getting hit in a major way in their rural communities,” he said.
“If any communities are facing a big challenge in America, it’s the small cities that may be wiped out, not only by the pandemic and the lack of access to health care,” Anthony said. “They’re being wiped out because of the loss of jobs to the small businesses, the loss of industry, and loss of hope.”

Aegean, a member of the Star Alliance airline group, suspended its international flights on March 26 as a result of flight restrictions related to the coronavirus crisis.
Airlines around the world grounded flights as civil aviation authorities imposed restrictions and countries closed borders and imposed lockdowns to try to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.
The carrier said it will restart operations from its Athens hub to Munich, Zurich, Frankfurt and Geneva, initially with a reduced timetable. It will also add more flights to Brussels - the only international destination that had not been suspended.
Aegean will increase flights in its domestic network from May 18-25, adding capacity to destinations including Heraklion and Chania in Crete, Thessaloniki, Alexandroupolis and the islands of Rhodes, Corfu, Lesbos, Chios and Samos.
""Aegean is willing to gradually and with extreme cautiousness restore its network while fully respecting the tremendous national effort to control the COVID-19 outbreak within the country,"" the carrier said.
Greece was one of the effective European countries in handling the pandemic, containing the spread of COVID-19 infections to 2,770 confirmed cases and 156 deaths.
In preparation for the resumption of flights, Aegean said it has already stepped up precautionary measures, including the mandatory use of masks during flights and aircraft cleaning and disinfection procedures.

Early in the outbreak, Ford ""made sure"" its U.S. dealers applied with the U.S. Small Business Administration for federal loans to protect their payrolls and employees, Jim Farley said during the company's annual shareholder meeting held online.
""This really paid off because about 90-plus percent of our dealers applied and now more than 80% have been funded,"" he said. 
Ford worked closely with its network of just over 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to ensure they were aware of the loan process and tracked their progress, spokesman Said Deep said after the meeting. 
""They are independent businesses, and they all have their own relationships with their banks, so that was the extent of our involvement,"" Deep said in an email.
Auto dealers were hard hit by the outbreak, with some states temporarily barring new-vehicle sales. Sales have plummeted amid stay-at-home orders aimed at curbing the spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.
The U.S. government's ""Payroll Protection Program"" to aid small businesses, part of an economic relief package passed by Congress, opened chaotically in April and ran out of funds in less than two weeks. The SBA then processed a second batch of applications.
The loans are forgivable if companies use at least 75% on payroll expenses. 
The program has been criticized for not getting loans to the smaller firms that need them and have few other capital sources. 
Among the companies that have returned the loans are dealer groups AutoNation Inc (N:AN) and  Penske Automotive Group Inc  (N:PAG).
Others that returned their SBA loans included the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, restaurant chains  Shake Shack Inc  (N:SHAK) and Potbelly Corp (O:PBPB), and online news site Axios.
Ford's Farley said Thursday the No. 2 U.S. automaker watches its dealers' profitability closely, and that in March and April those dealers were in ""great shape"" and their financial health was improving daily as state economies reopened.

Asked when Ford might reinstate the dividend payout it suspended in March, Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said that would be an option after the company repays its corporate revolver debt. The suspension saved Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion.

NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS) plans to buy a boutique wealth management custodian and technology company called Folio Financial Inc for an undisclosed amount of money, according to a letter that Folio sent to its customers on Thursday and was viewed by Reuters.
Folio would be the second wealth management company Goldman has acquired in two years, following United Capital in 2019, and it fulfills Chief Executive David Solomon's goals to build out the bank's other businesses. 
A Goldman Sachs spokesman confirmed plans for the acquisition and the contents of the letter but declined to comment further. Both companies declined to comment on the price of the acquisition, saying it was not material information for investors. Typically, companies are required to disclose to investors the price paid for acquisitions on deals worth more than $500 million. 
Based in McLean, Virginia, Folio has roughly 160 employees and $11 billion in assets under custody for registered investment advisers, or RIAs. RIAs are independent, often smaller wealth management firms that sell investment products from a number of financial services providers, rather than from one bank or fund company. 
Wealth management firms are required to custody, or keep, clients' money at a third-party financial institutions to make sure it is safe, and they pay that third party a fee.
Goldman has made investment products and funds for RIAs, as well as operated several RIAs in its asset management business for years. The Folio acquisition will build out the services Goldman already provides, and give it access to Folio's technology, as well as the ability to earn fees from being the custodian of assets for other firms. 
By joining Goldman, Folio said it gains a global audience to market its investment technology to, a long-term goal of the firm, Folio Chief Executive Steven Wallman wrote in the letter to customers. 
The execution, clearing and custody business would be incorporated into Goldman's global markets division. Folio also has a few RIA firms, which will join Goldman's consumer and investment management division.
Several of Folio's RIAs focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing strategies, an area of investment expertise that Goldman has been building out in recent years. 

The deal, which was in the works since mid-2019, is subject to regulatory approval. The companies hope to finalize it by the end of the third quarter, according to the letter.

350,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: IKEA's shopping malls arm Ingka Centres plans U.S. entry in major play,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - IKEA's shopping malls business, one of the world's biggest, is looking to enter the United States in the next couple of years and is in talks to snap up central properties in major cities, its boss told Reuters. 
Gerard Groener, managing director of Ingka Centres, which has 45 shopping centres in Europe, Russia and China, said his company was in several negotiations for inner-city real estate.
New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago locations are high on its wish list, he added. 
It may appear an unlikely time to be planning expansion, as COVID-19 lockdowns in North America, Europe and elsewhere have deeply depressed the retail market, with little certainty about how and when consumer demand will rebound. 
However the pandemic also presents opportunities in the squeezed commercial real estate market. 
""We are in a very active search. Maybe it's a good time to buy now. I'd say it's more a buyers' market than a sellers' market currently in the U.S.,"" Groener said in an interview. 
""So hopefully we can be successful now, with the timing.""
In the United States, Ingka Centres would be taking on mall giants such as Simon Property Group (N:SPG), General Growth Properties (O:BPY) and Westfield (AS:URW).
Groener said that, in all, Ingka Centres was looking to enter 45 large cities across all its existing markets and the United States, alongside IKEA stores. 
To that end the company is in talks, which are at various stages, to buy properties such as old post offices, department stores or existing malls to convert, he added.
CHINA BOUNCING BACK
Ingka Centres is a division of Ingka Group, which owns most IKEA furniture stores world-wide. Its centres, all anchored by an IKEA store, operate under brands such as MEGA in biggest market Russia and LIVAT in China. 
In January, it made its first-ever acquisition of an existing mall location, that of Kings Mall in London, which Groener said would hopefully open in April 2021. 
The company had overall tenant sales of 6.7 billion euros ($7.2 bln) last year, with big tenants include  Inditex 's (MC:ITX) Zara, H&M (ST:HMb), Fast Retailing's (T:9983) Uniqlo and Auchan. 
Over the past month 15 of 38 centres closed due to the pandemic have gradually reopened, starting in China last month, with shoppers returning quickly in most locations.
Groener said that in China, footfall at its Beijing and Wuxi centres in April was at 67% and 81% respectively of the levels seen a year earlier. In Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, visitor rates were slower to pick up. 
He added there were little change to vacancy rates compared with before the crisis when Chinese centres had waiting lists and vacancy rates in Europe were around 4%. 
Where closures have been called upon by authorities in various countries, Ingka Centres has relieved all tenants from paying rent altogether. In the subsequent restart phase, some tenants have negotiated temporary rent reductions, he said. 
Centres in Russia, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Britain and Slovakia remain temporarily closed. In Russia, he said, the plan was to reopen gradually from May 15, starting in St Petersburg. 
DIGITAL INVESTMENT
Ingka Centres, which had a leasable area of 4 million square-metres globally and 480 million individual visits in the year through August 2019, is working on three new out-of-town centres in China, and two in India. However it has no plans for more new out-of-town sites at present, Groener said. 
Ingka Centres' move into city locations comes alongside furniture giant IKEA's strategy shift towards smaller albeit more accessible inner-city stores with more digital and other services. 
Along with its rivals, Ingka Centres has also increased the share of restaurants and entertainment at its centres in recent years to adapt to consumers' online shift and a tougher retail landscape.
""We plan to build mixed-use facilities that we call meeting places and that have a wide range of facilities and services,"" Groener said, adding activities could range from healthcare and education to festivals and events, besides retail and food.
One of the China projects underway will be a first to include adjacent residential and office space. The site is due to open in April 2020, Groener said, after its construction was delayed a few months due to the pandemic. 
Groener said a loyalty scheme app in China launched in 2017 and connected to social media WeChat, sporting services such as virtual reality centre navigation, online restaurant queuing and cinema ticket purchases, now had 1.5 million members. 
Boosting a more basic loyalty scheme in Russia to similar levels would be the main digital investment this year, he said.

The world's largest fast-food chain's new reopening guidelines push restaurant owners to encourage social distancing among diners and more frequently clean restrooms, digital kiosks 
and door handles, the Journal reported. (https://on.wsj.com/3609XoX)
The guide also recommends franchisees to buy expensive new fitments such as automatic towel dispensers and touchless sinks, the report said, adding that franchisees can still choose when to reopen dine-in service and how to staff restaurants. 
The company did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
McDonald's nearly 14,000 restaurants in the United States have been serving diners through drive-thru, take-out and delivery, as strict lockdown measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic effectively shut down dine-in services.
However, more U.S. states are easing some of those restrictions to get their economies going again. Health experts have warned that reopening too quickly could lead to a new wave of infections.

These could ultimately deploy trillions of dollars in lending.
The programs seek to keep financial markets functioning and, in unprecedented steps, provide direct loans to businesses, states and local governments.
Here’s a round-up of the nine programs -- five of which are now up and running -- with details on their current status. Lending totals are as of May 6 and the Fed is due to report an update on those facilities in its weekly data later Thursday:
Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)
Purchases short-term company IOUs directly from U.S. corporate and municipal issuers. Eligible securities about $1.1 trillion. Demand has been low as the Fed’s mere pledge to backstop the market drew normal lenders back in.
Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)
Buys a wide range of securities, including investment-grade corporate debt, municipal debt, and mortgage- and asset-backed securities from primary dealers, which are the big banks and broker-dealers licensed to transact with the Fed. Its lending peaked in mid April at around $33 billion, then faded as the short-term funding markets calmed.
Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (MMFLF)
Finances the purchase of high-quality assets from U.S. money market mutual funds, including government debt, commercial paper and municipal debt. Eligible securities estimated at $600 billion to $700 billion, according to Fed officials. Lending peaked in early April at around $53 billion as withdrawals from prime money funds halted and then reversed.
Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility (PMCCF)
Will buy investment-grade corporate debt with maturities up to four years directly from U.S. issuers, and debt from some issuers downgraded after March 22.
Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF)
Purchase investment-grade corporate debt from U.S. issuers with maturities up to five years in the secondary market, debt from some issuers downgraded after March 22 and some ETFs that buy corporate debt. The New York Fed began ETF purchases on May 12.
Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF)
Will purchase securities backed by credits to consumers and small businesses, including credit-card receivables, student loans, auto loans and leases, equipment loans and some small business loans.
Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF)
Finances lending to small businesses that qualify for the Treasury’s Paycheck Protection Program. Congress appropriated a total of $669 billion for the loans, which can turn into grants if companies retain or hire back workers.
Municipal Liquidity Facility (MLF)
Will purchase municipal debt maturing in less than 36 months directly from states, counties and cities. After initial criticism, the Fed lowered the population thresholds for eligible counties and cities to 500,000 and 250,000, respectively. Issuers must have held an investment-grade rating as of April 8.
Main Street Lending Program
Will finance full recourse bank lending to U.S. companies with fewer than 15,000 employees or less than $5 billion in annual revenue. The four-year loans will be extended through three distinct facilities: one for new loans, another for increasing existing debt and a third for more heavily leveraged borrowers.

353,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Airbus to be 'resized,' could cut output again - sources","By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) has told senior staff the company must be ""resized"" in plans to be set out around end-June and is ready to cut jet production again to tackle any second wave of the coronavirus crisis, people briefed on the matter said.
Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told Airbus bosses to ""face reality"" in a briefing on Thursday on the crisis, which has idled an estimated 14,000 jetliners or two thirds of the global fleet and left manufacturers and airlines battling to save cash. 
Faury once again warned that Airbus may not survive without change and insisted that ""radical,"" ""proactive"" and urgent steps were needed, according to people briefed on the presentation.
An Airbus spokesman said no decisions had been made. ""Any further measures will be discussed first with our social partners, which means it is too early to speculate on any figures,"" he added.
The warning by the head of one of Europe's largest industrial employers, with major factories in four nations, comes amid speculation of thousands of restructuring job losses.
Faury made reference in his presentation for the first time to a possible ""restructuring plan"" but told bosses a figure of 10,000 job cuts reported by a British newspaper was speculation. 
Airbus plans to overhaul its structure to become simpler and more profitable, using ""all necessary"" social tools, Faury said, according to the people briefed after a weekly management call.
On Wednesday, industry sources said Airbus was exploring restructuring with potentially deep job cuts after furloughing thousands of staff, but no decision was imminent.
Unions are steeling themselves for heavy cuts in production and administration posts after Airbus slashed jet production.
SECOND OUTPUT CUT
A resurgence of the virus could trigger new output cuts, on top of a one-third cut in narrow-body jets and cuts of up to 42% in wide-body models, people briefed on the presentation said.
However, Airbus appears confident current plans will hold if a fragile recovery from lockdowns and travel bans continues.
The company has been producing only a trickle of aircraft due to lockdowns and difficulties in bringing in airline crews to take delivery. Now, it faces a complex industrial task of increasing output sharply solely to reach its recently lowered targets.
Analysts have said Airbus and Boeing (N:BA) may both have to reconsider their latest output goals due to the depth of the crisis, though no decisions are expected before the summer.
Faury's message aimed to position Airbus for long-term growth based on a greener but smaller-than-anticipated fleet of jetliners, while acknowledging this would mean short-term pain. 
In a letter to staff last month he warned the survival of Airbus was in question.
Observers say Airbus has been trying to square conflicting messages during the crisis, reassuring investors that it has moved to protect liquidity while paving the way internally for painful cuts and negotiating government loans for suppliers.
Faury is ""starting to send messages to the staff and to the politicians,"" a person familiar with the company said.

The Frenchman faces the delicate task of preparing future job cuts while implementing furloughs or job-protection schemes funded by states. Restructuring plans will also face political pressure for balance between France, Germany, Britain and Spain.

The bans were introduced by Italy, Greece, France, Belgium, Austria and Spain after extreme market volatility in March as investors sought to price in an expected recession triggered by national lockdowns implemented in an effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic.
Italy's ban lasts until June 18, but others are due to lapse on Friday against a backdrop of lower volatility in markets.
Short-selling involves a trading order that bets on falling share prices, which the regulators said could exacerbate the broad sell-offs that have hit markets worldwide.
Europe failed to agree a common stance on the matter, with Britain and Germany declining to introduce their own bans, as did the United States.
""Our decision will be taken depending on market behavior until the end of the week and in consultation with other countries that put these restrictions in place,"" said AMF Chair Robert Ophele.
The AMF head said that a short-selling ban, which in France runs until May 18, is an exceptional measure that is not intended to last.
""Its abandonment would in this case be excellent news, as it would reflect a certain normalisation of the market,"" Ophele told French lawmakers.
Stephane Boujnah, chief executive of pan-European exchange  Euronext  (PA:ENX), on Wednesday said that it was clear in March that markets were highly volatile and a short-selling ban was one of the measures that could calm the situation.

The Nikkei newspaper reported on Thursday that Nissan is planning to reduce its global capacity by 20% and close its Barcelona-area plant, shifting its production to  Renault  (PA:RENA) plants.
A Nissan Spain spokesman declined to comment on the Nikkei report, but said the carmaker plans to present an updated global business plan in late May. 
""The company does not comment rumours or information about the future of the plant,"" a Nissan Spain spokesman said, adding that Nissan's European chairman had earlier told union leaders at the Barcelona plant they would be informed about the factory's future before summer. 
The factory partially reopened on May 4 after the coronavirus outbreak forced a total shutdown in mid March, but a workers strike brought production back to a total halt from May 6, the spokesman said.
As a consequence of the strike, over 2,000 out of the 3,000 workers in Nissan's plant and related facilities in the Barcelona area have been temporarily laid off, he added.
A plant union leader did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Unions have long complained about the lack of a clear strategy on the Barcelona plant's future, which produces pick-up trucks and electric vans. 
Reuters reported on May 4 that Nissan will pull back from Europe and elsewhere to focus on the United States, China and Japan under a plan that represents a new strategic direction for the carmaker.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Credit card spending among some of  JP Morgan Chase  (NYSE:JPM) & Co's U.S. customers fell 40% during March and early April compared to last year, as Americans stayed home to protect against the novel coronavirus, according to a new report on Thursday.
Spending on non-essential goods and services, like retail, restaurants, and entertainment, fell sharply across income brackets accounting for nearly all of the drop in spending during that period, the JP Morgan Chase Institute said.
This is primarily due to the stay-at-home orders put in place by many U.S. states, and less due to job loss, at least for now, said Diana Farrell, president and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase Institute.
""While surprising, we expect this may change over time as layoffs, furloughs and unemployment insurance further impact families' bank accounts,"" Farrell said in a statement.
The overall fall in spending was 8 times larger than the average drop in household credit card spending in the first month of unemployment during regular times, according to the report. 
The global outbreak of the coronavirus has forced governments worldwide to impose lockdown orders to contain its rapid spread, crippling economic activity.
In the United States, more than 32 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since March while consumer demand has also been hard hit.
The U.S. Federal Reserve warned this week that the country will likely see weak economic growth for ""an extended period"".
The JPMorgan Chase Institute studied anonymized spending data from more than 8 million Chase credit card customers for the period from March 1 to April 11. 
Credit card users who report household incomes of less than $39,000 reduced spending by 38%, while wealthier cardholders, with incomes of more than $92,000, reduced spending by 46%. The group says the difference largely reflects higher average spending by wealthier households.
The report showed essential spending, like on groceries and healthcare, initially spiked by 20% before falling back.
Spending on non-essential things fell by 50% and dropped 70% on restaurants.
The group tracked only spending on Chase credit cards, like its Slate, Sapphire and Ink cards. It did not track spending with cash, debit cards or other bank credit cards.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Binladin International Holding Group, Saudi Arabia's biggest construction company, is seeking an adviser to cut costs as well as restructure the debt of a Mecca skyscraper complex, sources familiar with the matter said and a document showed.
The move is part of efforts to restructure the construction group, after the government took a 35% stake from Bin Laden family members that were swept up in an anti-graft campaign launched by Riyadh in late 2017.
Binladin completed the $15 billion government-owned Abraj Al Beit golden clocktower complex in 2011. The development has seven towers of hotels and malls and looms over the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the holy city visited by millions of Muslim pilgrims every year. 
The 603-metre tall clock tower is the landmark feature of the complex, which was built to modernise the old city and provide accommodation and other facilities for pilgrims.
Binladin has been seeking proposals from advisers ""on behalf of the shareholders in the Abraj Al Bait Complex"" to review its operational and financial performance and to assess financial restructuring options, it said in a request for proposals in the document seen by Reuters.
The adviser would ""review potential financing structures and options for implementation which may include rescheduling current loans, refinancing or other options taking into account any implications of changes in ownership structure,"" the document said.
Saudi Binladin did not respond to emailed requests for comment on the proposal.
The group has recently appointed financial advisory firm Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) to restructure billions of dollars of company debt, two financial sources said. Houlihan Lokey declined to comment.
The Binladin group's request for proposals is dated October 2019 but the sources said they had learned about it only in recent months.
DOUBLE EFFORTS
The Abraj Al Bait complex was built by Binladin under a lease of the Development of King Abdul-Aziz Endowment Project and with a ""design, build, operate, and transfer"" agreement which expires in 2035.
Three of the towers were leased to investors, including a Kuwaiti consortium, while the original shareholders maintained control of the remaining complex including four hotels, the document showed.
""Essentially this is restructuring of government debt,"" said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is private.
A Saudi Arabia ministry of finance spokesman said: ""We are aware and support the SBG (Saudi Binladin Group) board's efforts to bring more efficiency into their operations and restructure their balance sheet to enable them to utilise the strength and execution excellence to bounce back and excel as a significant contractor and developer in the region and beyond.
""As a shareholder and the largest client, we support the group efforts and encourage them to double their efforts.""
Binladin has dominated the Saudi construction sector for years and is central to the country's plans for tourism and infrastructure projects aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil revenues by 2030.
Those plans risk being compromised by an economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices that are forcing the government to rein in spending and increase borrowing.
The annual Haj pilgrimage, scheduled for late July this year, is an important source of tourism income for Saudi Arabia but it could be postponed due to virus containment measures. 
Some 2.5 million pilgrims usually flock to the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina each year for the week-long ritual.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower for a third straight day after data showing initial jobless claims fell more slowly than expected than last week, further stoking fears that the economy will struggle to rebound even as the country moves out of lockdown.
By 10:10 AM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 378 points or 1.6% at 22,870 points, its lowest in over a month. The S&P 500 was down 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 1.4%. 
Earlier, the Labor Department had said initial jobless claims fell to 2.98 million last week - the first week since March that they've been below 3 million but still considerably above expectations of 2.50 million.  The numbers took the total number of initial claims since the pandemic erupted to over 36 million, or one quarter of the workforce.
Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the numbers showed a disappointingly slow decline in the rate of new claims, and said the number is now unlikely to drop below 1 million before the end of June. 
""That said, the proportion of the previous week’s initial claims then appearing in the continuing claims numbers a week later has fallen for seven straight weeks, so hiring is not completely dead,"" Pantheon's Ian Shepherdson said in a note to clients.
The market was also rocked early Thursday by more aggressive rhetoric toward China from President Donald Trump, reviving fears of the trade war that rocked markets last year. Trump told Fox Business News that: ""We could cut off the whole relationship"" with China, something he said would ""save"" the U.S. $500 billion a year. Fox also reported that the administration is looking for ways to punish or seek financial compensation from China for what it sees as withholding information about the coronavirus. 
Already this week, Trump has directed a federal pension program to divest its holdings of Chinese equities and signed an executive order extending a ban on U.S. companies doing business with telecoms company Huawei until the end of May 2021. 
That helped push names such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which manufactures its smartphones in China, down 1.7%, while Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, which relies in large measure on the Chinese market for its growth outlook, fell 2.5%. 
Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock fell 8.9% after a Reuters report detailing the likely extent of overstaffing at the end of the third quarter. The company is currently not allowed to lay off staff as part of the conditions for its bailout from the federal government. United Airlines stock fell over 10% after a class action was filed by employees to stop it forcing them to take off 20 days as unpaid leave, something they said violated the bailout conditions.
Elsewhere, Grubhub  (NYSE:GRUB) stock fell 8.3% and Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock fell 3.6% as enthusiasm for their mooted combination cooled. 
The day's winners were largely limited to those seen as gaining from the pandemic, including an array of biotech small caps, website maker Wix.Com (NASDAQ:WIX) and, of course, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which rose 1.5% to another all-time high."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Latin America will be the last region in the world to recover to pre-coronavirus air travel levels, which could be a serious blow to its weak airline industry, according to a report by consulting firm ICF set to be published on Thursday.
ICF predicts Latin America will take six years to recover, while the United States, Canada and the Asia-Pacific regions will take no longer than four. Europe would take five and a half years.
Overall, the forecast is significantly more pessimistic than what is held - at least in public - by the airline industry itself. And it cautions that the travel crisis will last much longer than the coronavirus itself.
""We've never been in a hole this deep,"" said Carlos Ozores, a consultant at ICF who works with airline management teams.
In comparison, a poll by brokerage Cowen earlier this week of travel executives and stock analysts found that 62% of respondents expect air transportation to get back to 2019 levels in no more than three years. Only 12% expect it to take more than four.
ICF, however, expects that the worst is yet to come and next year will be the bottom of the crisis, with passenger demand sinking by 62%. This will force airlines to scramble to reduce their fleets and send a ripple effect throughout the economy.
""This is a fall in traffic and revenue that could lead many airlines to go bankrupt,"" Ozores said. ""If you have fewer planes, you have fewer pilots and fewer crew members, and those layoffs will be permanent.
The long recovery forecast by ICF will put more strain on airlines in Latin America that were already in a frail position. Colombia's Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p) filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, and its rivals are praying for bailouts.
Domestic travel will recover faster across the world, ICF forecasts. That could be good news for one struggling planemaker, Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3), whose midsized planes have been lauded for their fuel efficiency but whose sales have lagged.
On the other hand, demand for large, long-haul jets by  Boeing Co  (N:BA) or Airbus (PA:AIR) would evaporate for a longer time, as ICF predicts that international travel will take at least one year longer to recover. Airbus and Boeing have already announced tens of thousands of layoffs.
But this could also be an opportunity for an airline to take the risk and order planes when prices are low, so they can then take delivery of the aircraft in the recovery years.
""Airplane manufacturers are desperate to sell,"" Ozores said.

(Reuters) -  Zoom Video Communications  Inc (O:ZM) said Thursday it plans to hire 500 software engineers for research and development locations in Phoenix and Pittsburgh over the next two years, expanding its engineering workforce by about 60%.
The San Jose, California-based videoconferencing company has seen a large spike in usage as families, friends and organizations use its software to connect while under lockdown orders during the global coronavirus pandemic. The company said last month it has about 300 million daily meeting participants, up from 10 million in December.
The sudden crush of traffic revealed a number of privacy and security issues that caused Zoom to pause new feature development for 90 days to address the concerns. It also prompted Zoom to seek out an additional cloud computing vendor,  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL), to help handle the volume.
Zoom's current engineering workforce is mostly split between its San Jose headquarters and China. Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg told Reuters the company is looking for offices near Arizona State University and Carnegie Mellon University to tap engineering talent coming out of the schools.
Steckelberg said hiring will start immediately, and the new employees will work from home until at least September. Zoom had previously said it does not plan for staff to return to its offices until at least then.
Zoom is roughly halfway through its 90-day plan to improve its privacy and security. Steckelberg said the hires in Arizona and Pennsylvania will be for ""longer term capabilities"" rather than the immediate work for the plan. However, she said almost two dozen engineers who came to Zoom from Keybase, an encryption firm it acquired last week, will have an ""immediate impact"" on the company's security work.
Steckelberg said the new locations will also give Zoom the ability to hire engineers hesitant to move to Silicon Valley due to its high living costs. The median home value in San Jose is more than $1 million, according data from Zillow. 

""Today, most of our U.S.-based engineering staff is in San Jose, so this will be a really great opportunity to extend our talent base across the U.S.,"" she said.

The S&P 500 Index rose as much as 31% from its closing low in March, as waves of central-bank stimulus combined with fiscal measures from governments worldwide reassured markets ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. But Calvasina, RBC’s head of U.S. equity strategy, cautions that there could be another leg down before markets truly regain their footing.
“It’s possible, though far from certain, that the S&P 500 found a bottom on March 23 due to unprecedented Fed stimulus and a looming bottoming of the economy,” Calvasina wrote in a report Thursday. “But valuations are stretched again and investor capitulation never occurred, leaving stocks vulnerable to bad news in the coming months.”
Other concerns Calvasina has include:
RBC has plenty of company, with the big-name investors like Stan Druckenmiller and David Tepper saying stocks had run up too far.  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s David Kostin expects a potential near-term drop by the S&P 500 to 2,400 -- 15% below the last close of 2,820. As of mid-April, the median year-end estimate for the benchmark was 2,875 among strategists tracked by Bloomberg.
“The S&P 500 is currently a bit above our year-end 2020 S&P 500 price target of 2,750,” Calvasina said. “But we feel no need to raise it.”

376,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",Fiat Chrysler/Peugeot deal in spotlight after Exor setbacks,"By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler's (MI:FCHA) decision to scrap its dividend marks another setback for plans by the Agnelli family's Exor (MI:EXOR) arm to raise cash after a $9 billion sale of its reinsurer unit PartnerRe collapsed this week.
Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and French  Peugeot  (OTC:PUGOY) owner PSA (PA:PEUP), which have agreed a tie-up to create the world's fourth largest carmaker, said late on Wednesday they were both withdrawing their annual dividend. That will allow them each to preserve 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in cash during the coronavirus crisis.
Exor, led by Agnelli scion John Elkann and FCA's controlling shareholder with a 28.9% stake, will miss out on around 320 million euros in cash at a time when two deals to reshape its portfolio of businesses have either been scrapped or delayed.
The coronavirus crisis had already forced vehicle and equipment maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI), also controlled by Exor, to delay to late 2021 ""or beyond"" a plan to split in two and list its truck, bus and engine business, which was initially due to be completed by early next year. 
All eyes are now on the $50 billion FCA-PSA merger.
The two automakers said on Wednesday that preparations for their planned 50-50 merger were ""advancing well"" and that the closing was expected on schedule, before the end of the first quarter of next year. 
The sale of Bermuda-based PartnerRe foundered after Exor resisted attempts by French insurer Covea to drive down the price of the cash deal.
Some saw that as a warning shot to PSA not to try the same tactics with FCA where Elkann is the chairman.
""With its decision not to accept a discount on PartnerRe, Elkann has sent a strong message to PSA and its CEO (Carlos) Tavares,"" an investment banker close to the situation, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. 
""The message is: don't expect to come around and get much different conditions on the FCA-PSA merger"".
The decision to scrap payment of ordinary dividends, which had been announced in December as part of the tie-up agreement between the two automakers, did not alter the terms of the deal as both companies took the same step.
Analysts are, however, focusing on a 5.5 billion euro special dividend FCA is set to pay to its investors just before completing the merger.
Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) analyst Monica Bosio said she still expected the payment of the special dividend, ""which implicitly represents the premium assigned to the group in the deal thanks to its positioning in the U.S. and to its high-value brands such as Jeep, Ram and Maserati"".
Marco Opipari, an analyst at Fidentiis, said the merger was essential to the two group's long-term competitiveness, especially in the current scenario, but that some terms of the agreement could be rediscussed.
""A Solomonic solution could be to cut FCA's extraordinary dividend to 3 billion euros,"" he said, adding that, as a rebalancing, PSA could ditch the planned spin-off of its controlling stake in parts maker  Faurecia  (PA:EPED).
The COVID-19 spread has hit asset valuations hard and raised questions about the terms of deals struck before the virus swept across the world. Shares in both FCA and PSA are both down around 45% this year. 
Exor's other investments include  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), Italian soccer champions Juventus (MI:JUVE) and weekly magazine the Economist.

377,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",IAG's Walsh says Britain is throttling a travel recovery,"By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's quarantine plans and a minister's comment that big foreign holidays were unlikely this year are seriously hindering any travel recovery, said Willie Walsh the boss of British Airways parent company IAG (L:ICAG).
Airlines have been brought to their knees by the coronavirus pandemic and are making tens of thousands of job cuts to try to survive.
They had been hoping for a recovery to begin in July, but Walsh, one of the most experienced airline bosses in the world, said the British government was seriously damaging the chances of a recovery. 
""The prime minister's decision to quarantine people arriving in the UK, by air, and the Health Secretary's comments that it was unlikely that 'big, lavish international holidays' were going to be possible this summer, have seriously set back recovery plans for our industry,"" Walsh said in a letter to parliament's transport committee on Thursday. 
In the letter, which came after he was questioned by British lawmakers on Monday, Walsh also said that planned consultations with unions over 12,000 job cuts at British Airways would go ahead.
""We must act now to secure the maximum number of jobs possible, consistent with the reality of a structurally changed airline industry in a severely weakened global economy,"" he said.
Walsh said the UK finance minister's extension of a coronavirus job retention scheme on Tuesday was helpful to the company, but not enough to save jobs given the deep challenges faced by the aviation industry. 
The quarantine rules, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said consist of a 14-day isolaton period for most arrivals from abroad, will hit travel demand airlines have said. 
With planes grounded since late March, IAG had said flights would restart in July. Another big European airline group Ryanair (I:RYA) plus holiday company TUI Group (L:TUIT) are also eyeing a July resumption. 
The industry is waiting for more details on the quarantine, such as when it will start and how long it will last. 
BALPA, the UK's pilots union, said the quarantine was too blunt a tool that would cause further damage to the travel industry and the economy. 
""We have seen no evidence that such a blanket policy is needed and would strongly urge the government to move to a targeted and tailored approach according to destination and risk,"" BALPA's general secretary Brian Strutton said. 
The letter from Walsh also provided the transport committee with details on refunds, after lawmakers questioned BA's policy. 

British Airways has provided cash refunds on 921,000 tickets, he said, adding that there were 47,400 bookings outstanding which were being processed. Vouchers were accepted by customers on 346,000 bookings, Walsh said.

378,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Uber offer for Grubhub fans worries over delivery fees charged to restaurants,"By Hilary Russ and Lisa Baertlein
NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The possibility that  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), which runs Uber Eats, could acquire  Grubhub Inc  (N:GRUB) is reigniting some restaurants' worries over the commissions charged to eateries by the third-party delivery companies.
Uber is in negotiations to buy Grubhub Inc (N:GRUB) in an all-stock deal, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
Some small eateries have been vocal about their distaste for the services, which sometimes charge mom and pop restaurants - already operating on thin margins - as much as 15% to 30% commissions on each order while giving discounts breaks to marquee chains like McDonald's Corp (N:MCD).
In March and April, as the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States, Grubhub added as many new partner restaurants to its platform as it did during the entire second half of 2019, Chief Executive Officer Matt Maloney said last week in a letter to shareholders. 
It now has about 300,000 U.S. restaurants on its app, while Uber eats has more than 100,000 in the United States and Canada. Their merger would create the nation's largest restaurant delivery company.
In April, daily average orders via Grubhub were 20% higher than the same month last year, Maloney said.
Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, a trade association, said consolidation among third-party delivery firms ""poses significant concerns."" 
""You get nervous when you potentially have a provider that's going to be over 50 percent of the market,"" said Robert Guarino, chief executive officer of 5 Napkin Burger, which has four sit-down locations in Manhattan. Most of his delivery orders come through Grubhub.
""The big question is, what happens as all these companies are trying to reach profitability, where does it come from,"" he said.
New York City Council on Wednesday passed an emergency bill to limit fees charged by Grubhub and other big platforms, including Uber, DoorDash and Postmates, while it continues to pursue longer-term regulations it had already been considering.
The rules would expire 90 days after a state of emergency is lifted and will limit fees paid by restaurants to 15% of an order for delivery services and 5% for non-delivery services like marketing.
Grubhub has repeatedly emphasized that it values the local restaurants that make up the vast majority of establishments on its app. 
Grubhub is deferring up to $100 million of commission payments for some restaurants to a later date that the company did not disclose.
Uber Eats said it would waive delivery fees for restaurants during the pandemic, while DoorDash and subsidiary Caviar cut commission fees in half through May. 
Even so, anger persists. 
Chicago pizza restaurant consultant Giuseppe Badalamenti said the that mergers and industry consolidation usually give consumers ""less choices and gives the companies too much power.""
Two weeks ago, he posted a receipt on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showing that one restaurant kept just $376.54 out of $1,042.63 of Grubhub orders - the rest going to the delivery service for promotions, commissions and fees. 
""Stop believing you are supporting your community by ordering from a 3rd party delivery company,"" Badalamenti said in the post, which went viral.

On Tuesday, Chicago enacted new rules requiring the delivery companies to give customers itemized cost breakdowns of each transaction, including commissions and service fees the restaurant pays to the apps.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to trade mostly lower Thursday, with investors warily waiting for the latest unemployment data after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s sobering update about the state of the U.S. economy.
At 7:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 12 points, or 0.4%, lower, Nasdaq futures were down 36 points, or 0.4% higher. The Dow futures contract 127 points, or 0.6%.
In prepared remarks delivered during a webcast Wednesday, Powell said the scope and speed of the economic downturn are ""significantly worse"" than any recession since World War II and warned the economic outlook was highly uncertain.
Powell also suggested that additional support will likely be needed from the federal government, but the latest attempt by House Democrats to put together a relief bill to the tune of $3 trillion has run into opposition from the GOP-controlled Senate.
With this in mind, eyes will turn to the release of the latest  initial jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM. This week’s claims are expected to come in at 2.5 million, down from about 3.17 million the week before, but still meaning that over 35 million Americans have claimed unemployment benefit from the start of the coronavirus crisis.
In the corporate sector, Uber's (NYSE:UBER) move to buy food delivery service GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and merge it with its own UberEats service is still on, according to The Wall Street Journal, despite the ride-hailing company refusing to pay the price initially demanded by GrubHub.
Additionally, chip equipment maker Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is scheduled to report earnings after the bell, and is expected to report a profit of 94 cents per share on revenue of about $4.1 billion, 
Oil futures gained Thursday, helped by the International Energy Agency stating the outlook has “improved somewhat,” with demand a little stronger than expected and supply reined in by a brutal price crash.
Adding to the positive tone was the news late Wednesday that U.S. crude stocks fell by 745,000 barrels to 531.5 million barrels in the week to May 8, marking the first decline since January.
At 7:30 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 3.4% higher -- well off the day's highs -- at $26.16 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 3.1% to $30.09.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,721.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0791, down 0.2%.

Investing.com -- European stocks, as the saying goes, are invited to only some of the parties but all of the funerals. But the people who run those markets have the enviable position of catering to both, as  Euronext  's first-quarter results showed after the close on Wednesday.
The stock exchange operator posted a 30% increase in like-for-like revenue growth in the first three months of the year thanks to a surge in market volatility in March. Euronext (PA:ENX) stock rose as much as 5% to a new all-time high before being dragged down by the rest of the market to be up only 2.0% by 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT). It's now up 16.6% in 2020, outperforming both  London Stock Exchange  Group  (LON:LSE) shares and Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) shares, which have risen 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively.
Financial marketplaces of all stripes have all benefied from the same market volatility since the pandemic erupted - spread better IG Group(LON:IGG)'s shares have risen 11% year-to-date, while smaller rivals CMC Markets (LON:CMCX) and Plus500 (LON:PLUSP) have risen by 38% and 45%, respectively. With the S&P VIX index, which measures stock market volatility, still at 35,72, far above historical averages, there seems to be little risk to that outperformance in the near term. 
However, it can't be expected that volatility will continue to stay so high forever. Quite the reverse: increasing talk of yield curve control by central banks points to a future dominated by financial repression, which will hit trading in interest rate products particularly hard. Equity markets, meanwhile, seem destined to be invaded by an army of zombie companies as a round of state and regulatory intervention threatens to do for travel and leisure companies what it has 'achieved' for European bank stocks in recent years. 
Euronext has done well to insulate itself against that risk by expanding into new areas such as power trading (with the acquisition of two-thirds of Nord Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) and custodial services. CEO Stephane Boujnah told analysts on a call after the results that he sees ""no pause"" to its M&A activity, and his refusal to get drawn into a bidding war for Spain's Bolsas y Mercados Espanoles (MC:BME) gives confidence that its available resources will be used well. 
Elsewhere Thursday, stock markets across the continent trended lower, following U.S. markets that have slid this week as a string of high-profile investors and, most importantly, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have warned that the economic outlook is not as rosy as the liquidity-driven rally in April would suggest. 
By 5:15 AM ET (0915 GMT), the Stoxx 600 benchmark was down 1.6% at 328.70, testing a four-week low. The German DAX index was down 1.5% and the U.K. FTSE 100 underperformed with a drop of 2.2%, weighed on by renewed fears about the country's handling of the pandemic, the cost of its wage subsidy scheme, and the apparent lack of interest in protecting the economy against a fresh economic shock at the end of the year, when the Brexit transition period ends.

Earlier this month BMW (DE:BMWG) lowered its profit expectations for its automotive and motorcycles divisions, citing worse-than-expected demand which would deteriorate in the second quarter.
""There is at least a glimmer of hope coming from China,"" Chief Executive Oliver Zipse said in a speech held at the company's annual general meeting, which is being held in a virtual format for the first time.
""Unfortunately, our biggest single market is only of limited use as a blueprint for development in other markets.""
After China sales fell 88% in February 2020, deliveries rose 14% in April, thanks to pent-up demand in a market where vehicle ownership is relatively low by global standards, BMW said.
""Economies in Europe have been affected to varying degrees by the pandemic, for instance. Demand for cars in countries like Spain, Italy and the UK will probably be very slow to recover. The same applies to the US,"" Zipse said.
The Munich-based manufacturer is gradually ramping up production and last week re-opened its factory in Goodwood, England, a plant in Spartanburg, United States and a motorcycle assembly factory in Berlin. 

This week BMW is re-starting production in Dingolfing, Bavaria and next Monday the carmaker will resume work at its German plants in Munich, Regensburg and Leipzig, as well as facilities in Oxford, England, Rosslyn, South Africa and San Luis Potosí in Mexico, BMW said.

At 4:05 AM ET (0805 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.5% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 1.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.8%.
The major indices on Wall Street fell back sharply overnight, with the Dow dropping over 500 points, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned Wednesday of the threat of a prolonged recession resulting from the viral outbreak, stating that the U.S. economic outlook was ""both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks."" 
Given the global nature of the coronavirus pandemic and the size and importance of the U.S. economy, these comments can be applied to most of the world’s economies.
ECB President Christine Lagarde has already told European Union ministers of the possibility that the eurozone contracts by up to 15% as a consequence of the coronavirus outbreak.
French unemployment fell in the first quarter to 7.8%, an 11-year low, from 8.1% in the fourth quarter. But this figure was distorted as people without work were unable to seek jobs once France entered its coronavirus lockdown. 
In corporate news, Sanofi (PA:SASY) dropped 1.4% as the French pharmaceutical giant found itself in a political minefield after stating that the U.S. government would have the right to the most advance orders if it were to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The French government described that position as “unacceptable”.
Airbus (PA:AIR) slipped 1.1% following a report that the aerospace group is exploring restructuring plans involving the possibility of further ""deep"" job cuts, industry sources said.
In contrast, pan-European exchange operator  Euronext  (PA:ENX) gained 5% after reporting a hefty jump in quarterly revenue, partly driven by the heavy trading in March. 
And Pexip, a Norwegian video-conferencing firm touted as a potential rival to Zoom Video, rose 54% on its market debut in Oslo after its initial public offering was oversubscribed 12 times.

389,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",China unicorn creation falls to six-year low as investors play it safe,"By Kane Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's rate of creating unicorns has dropped to a seven-year low as venture capital funds shy away from early-stage funding while the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak batters portfolio investments.
Only four Chinese startups have reached unicorn status – valued at $1 billion or above - as of May 13, the lowest number for the same period since 2014, showed data from PitchBook.
The slowdown comes as many businesses across the country suffer falling sales and tighter cash flow after the outbreak paralysed the country for over two months from late January.
A slowing infection rate has allowed the government to relax virus-busting restrictions on movement and business. Still, investors are in no rush to deploy cash as sporadic cases of new infections make it impossible to return to pre-virus activity.
Early-stage venture funding has dropped with just 13% of fundraising going into ""angel"" and ""seed"" rounds as of April-end, down from a third five years earlier, showed Reuters calculations based on PitchBook data. Angel and seed funding typically help entrepreneurs get business ideas up and running.
In comparison, venture funding into the series B round - when investors help startups expand - accounted for nearly 29% of total fundraising, versus just 19% in 2015.
Venture investors now demand even more clarity and detail in business plans before investing early in a startup, said investor-turned-entrepreneur Zijing Wu, whose Moli Culture & Technology designs dolls and picture books and offers related online courses based on inspirational female characters.
""During the heyday of tech startups, a good business idea would already be valued at millions of dollars and startups would be burning cash while looking for ways to profit. Those days are gone,"" said Wu, whose firm was able to close its angel round in February, when China was still under lockdown.
The number of venture capital investments for the first four months has fallen 35% this year, and the investment value has dropped 6.6%, according to data provider Preqin.
""The pandemic is not just a stress test for startups. It is a critical, life-threatening moment for them,"" said JP Gan, founding partner of INCE Capital and popularly called ""unicorn hunter"" due to his previous role at Qiming Venture Partners.
Data from researcher IT Orange showed 27 startups have failed so far this year, and only 170 were founded in the first four months - a drop from 1,980 in the same period last year.
SURVIVAL
Venture investors interviewed by Reuters said they are currently more focused on helping portfolio companies survive the pandemic than investing anew. Those in offline sectors such as retail, travel and car rental have been worst hit, they said.
David Tang, partner at NGP Capital, said most startups in his firm's portfolio need to cut costs through reduced spending or redundancies because fundraising has been difficult.
He said portfolio education firm Squirrel AI, which offers artificial intelligence-based teaching for primary and secondary schools, suspended all offline business during the pandemic. Another - a recruitment website for blue-collar workers - suffered as China locked down factories.
""All of our companies have entered a state of emergency,"" he said, adding his firm had dropped pipeline deals as face-to-face communication and due diligence had been impossible.
To be sure, Nisa Leung, managing partner at Qiming, said there is still plenty of unutilised cash in China and that portfolio firms in online education and cloud computing were able to raise funds during the outbreak.
""It's important for companies to be laser focused on what they do best,"" she said. ""For companies yet to establish a track record, you really need to save money and cut costs. Things will only get tougher and tougher.""

390,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>","Fed's credit operation launched, but job already done","By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's pledged support for exchange-traded funds may not end up costing the central bank much, but will still have the desired effect of keeping the credit market afloat. 
As part of an unprecedented stimulus endeavor, the Fed announced it would support the ETF market in March, and on Tuesday launched the backstop.
Data on what the Fed actually spent in the first few days of the facility's being open will be visible on its weekly balance sheet published on Thursdays. But investors believe the Fed may not ultimately make significant purchases in ETFs, allowing the central bank to maintain its preferred role as a lender of last resort.
""Let's see how much they buy and if any,"" said Lale Topcuoglu, senior fund manager at J.O. Hambro Capital Management. ""The markets are functioning well, ... and we have not seen major dislocations similar to the one in mid-March. By and large, the Fed's announcement already took care of the concerns.""
Credit markets were badly hit as the coronavirus pandemic forced economies across the globe to shut down. Corporate earnings were decimated in many sectors, bond prices dropped, and it became difficult for companies, particularly those with junk credit ratings, to borrow money. 
Credit ETFs plummeted in March, with bigger losses in the high-yield sector. The iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (P:HYG) and the iShares iBoxx Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (P:LQD) both hit 11-year lows in March before the Fed's announcement, although they have rallied 16.8% and 21.1%, respectively, since. 
In addition to the secondary market facility, which covers the backstop for the ETFs, the Fed on March 23 announced it would buy new bonds directly from companies. 
Buying stakes in ETFs allows the Fed to support the entirety of the credit market, without having to pick winners and losers. It offers some relief to highly distressed companies that would not qualify for its primary market facility, which lends to higher-rated companies. 
Fed Chair Jay Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the central bank's actions have already helped, saying that markets had loosened up and started functioning after the announcement, meaning that ultimately the Fed may not be needed.
Issuance of investment-grade corporate debt in April hit a record $256.5 billion, according to Refinitiv IFR, while some of the riskiest companies - in sectors hardest hit by the pandemic including cruise operators, airlines and energy - have been able to issue debt. 
After recording decade highs in March, credit spreads - the premium investors demand to hold riskier corporate bonds over safer Treasuries - have narrowed in both high-yield and investment-grade issues, as measured by the ICE/BofA indexes tracking those markets. While those spreads have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, investors argue that the Fed does not need to up its intervention. 
""If they buy aggressively right now they would no longer merely be guarding liquidity but rather chasing spreads tighter. That's beyond what their mandate should be,"" said Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory. 
Significant bond buying, particularly in the riskiest corners of the market also runs the risk of creating so-called corporate zombies - deeply indebted companies with dysfunctional business models that in a normal market would default. 
Powell on Wednesday acknowledged the limitations to the central bank's backstops, saying that a Fed loan can help bolster liquidity - or a company's access to cash - in the short term, but an extended crisis may mean that corporate liquidity problems become solvency problems, meaning companies may be unable to pay off long-term debt. 
Gaurav Saroliya, director of macro strategy at Oxford Economics, wrote in a research note that it ""would be a mistake to think that the U.S. corporate sector is out of the woods,"" and that if the pandemic ""leads to long-term shifts in consumer behaviour, then business models that drove profitability before the crisis may well become unprofitable and consequently unviable."" 
Indeed, credit agency S&P Global predicts the default rate for speculative-grade companies will increase to 10% in the next year, from 3.1% at the end of 2019.

""The Fed can't cure fundamentals. It cannot fix high corporate leverage, credit impairment, flawed business models and changing consumer preferences,"" said Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, senior credit portfolio manager at MacKay Shields.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Merck KGaA (DE:MRCG) said a slight decline in operating earnings was on the cards this year as the coronavirus pandemic weighs on demand for chemicals in TV screens and is putting couples off seeking the German group's fertility treatments.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), adjusted for one-off items, would likely be between 4.35 billion euros ($4.70 billion) and 4.85 billion euros, compared with 4.39 billion last year, it said on Thursday.
First-quarter adjusted EBITDA gained 27% to 1.2 billion euros, the healthcare and chemicals company said, surpassing an average analyst estimate of 1.1 billion euros in a Refinitiv poll. 
Chinese patients sought larger prescriptions of Merck's older diabetes and heart drugs for less frequent hospital visits, offsetting lower sales of fertility drugs. 
Results in the January-to-March period were further bolstered by the addition of electronics materials maker Versum, which the company acquired in October 2019. 
Merck said it expected Versum's chemicals that are used in semiconductors to see strong growth for the remainder of the year despite the coronavirus.
""The Covid-19 crisis... only had a moderate impact in the first quarter of 2020. However, the company expects the effects to amplify in the coming months,"" it said. 
Merck had previously banked on the pandemic peaking in the first quarter and subsiding during the second, raising the prospect of strong EBITDA growth in 2020.
But it is now bracing for the crisis to prevail during the entire year, posing a significant burden to the economy. 

Many fertility clinics across the world had closed in response to the virus outbreak and are now reopening only at reduced capacity, Merck said, adding that it does not expect a catch-up effect until after an economic recovery.

393,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>",Storm clouds gather over U.S. stocks as hopes of quick recovery fade,"By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - A lightning-quick rally in U.S. equities is showing cracks, as investors face mounting evidence that the economy's coronavirus-fueled woes may be far longer-lasting than many had anticipated. 
For weeks, hopes that massive stimulus from the Federal Reserve and U.S. government would set the stage for a recovery later in the year fueled a blistering rebound in stocks even as the worst drop-off in jobs since the Great Depression slammed the economy.
But recent comments from top officials have undercut the case for a speedy economic recovery even as states ease lockdown restrictions, forcing investors to factor in a protracted downturn that would likely weigh on stocks while fueling flows to bonds and other safe-haven assets. 
After surging over 30% in just over a month, the S&P 500 (SPX) benchmark stock index has edged down about 4% since late April. Equity-focused funds have seen three straight weeks of outflows totaling around $30 billion, analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a report. In contrast, bond funds have notched inflows for four consecutive weeks, drawing nearly $47 billion, the bank said. 
""There’s still a lot of uncertainty out there,"" said Nela Richardson, investment strategist with Edward Jones. ""There’s corporate earnings uncertainty, there’s economic uncertainty, and then there’s just the behavioral adjustment of consumers ... facing down a health risk and trying to restart their lives.”
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday of an “extended period” of weak economic growth, citing concerns over how well future outbreaks of the virus can be controlled and how quickly a vaccine or therapy can be developed.
Those comments came a day after the nation’s top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told Congress that U.S. states lifting sweeping lockdowns could touch off new outbreaks of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, which has killed over 80,000 Americans.
In addition, there are renewed tensions between the United States and China, a reminder of the trade tensions between the world's two largest economies that rattled stocks throughout 2019, and some predictions of deflationary pressures on prices.
“Skepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,” analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said in a recent note to clients. “A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but concerns exist that we believe ... investors are dismissing.” 
Concerns include $103 billion in expected bank loan losses over the next four quarters, a lack of stock buybacks and domestic and global political uncertainty, the bank said. 
Several big-name investors have warned in recent days about the rally in equities becoming overextended. David Tepper of hedge fund Appaloosa Management told CNBC on Wednesday that the current market was the second most overvalued he has ever seen.
Famed hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller told the Economic Club of New York https://twitter.com/EconClubNY/status/1260302609824522240?s=20 on Tuesday that the risk-reward https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/risk-reward-for-stocks-is-maybe-as-bad-as-ive-seen-it-stanley-druckenmiller-says.html in today’s market was ""maybe as bad as I've seen it in my career."" 
The concentration of the market's gains in a small group of technology and internet stocks, obscuring the underperformance of other areas, is also sending a cautionary note. 
The average stock in the S&P 500 is down 8.7% since April 29, more than double the index's losses since that date, according to an analysis by Bespoke Investment Group.
An extended resurgence of stock market volatility could accelerate flows into fixed-income assets, which have recently drawn investors seeking to benefit from the Fed’s expanded bond-buying program. 
""The stock market is indicating that we are going to continue to move toward recovery whereas the bond market is just kind of sitting there,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital.
The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note (US10YT=RR) has stayed in a tight range in recent weeks after falling sharply in late March. Bond yields move inversely to prices.
The rally in stocks may have left equities more vulnerable to bad news, including problems that U.S. states may encounter as they move to reopen their economies in coming weeks, said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
“There is probably more downside in equity prices than there is in bond yields,” Samana said. ""The bond market is already fairly cautious in its positioning in terms of the view of the world that it has.""

394,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>","India's investment policy upsets Xiaomi, Oppo's consumer finance plans","By Aditya Kalra and Nupur Anand
NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Tougher scrutiny of foreign investment in India has soured the plans of China's smartphone manufacturers seeking to expand beyond selling hardware for a bigger share of the South Asian country's competitive financial services market.
Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) and Oppo, with more than 100 million in combined smartphone users in India, cannot directly lend to consumers without a shadow banking licence and have partnered with Indian financial companies to provide the funds for services offered on their platforms.
Xiaomi in December launched its online lending service MiCredit in India, connecting users with Indian lending firms to access small loans. By the end of 2019, its platform had disbursed loans worth $16.5 million. 
Oppo introdued a similar financial services model Oppo Kash in March.
The Chinese phone brands, however, are keen to establish their own non-banking financial company (NBFC) which will help improve margins by allowing them to directly sell financial products to their pool of smartphone users, people familiar with their plans said. 
""India is a very important market...This (rule change) will have a dampening effect,"" said an industry executive familiar with Xiaomi's consumer finance plans.
That is because India's new foreign direct investment (FDI)rules add another layer in an approval process already incumbered by red tape, a lack of transparency and worries that Chinese investors are encroaching into Indian businesses.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been cautious about issuing such approvals after the near collapse of one major lender in 2018, and it may now go even slower.
In April, the government said it would monitor FDI from companies based in neighbouring countries, in what was widely seen as a move to keep Chinese firms from taking stakes in distressed local businesses amid the coronavirus crisis. China has called the rules ""discriminatory"".
For Xiaomi and Oppo - both of which sources say have been waiting for around a year to get an NBFC approval from the RBI - the policy comes when India's smartphone shipments are likely to decline by 10% this year due to the coronavirus-led slowdown. 
Xiaomi and Oppo did not respond to a request for comment. 
Before tighter scrutiny of foreign direct investment was announced, would-be investors only sought RBI approval for a shadow banking licence.
Now, it will be a two-step process for those from the neighbouring countries and approval will probably take longer to obtain, industry sources say.
Alok Sonker, a partner at Indian law firm Krishnamurthy & Co, said the government needs to sign off on the initial capital infusion into an entity before it applies to the central bank for a licence.
And even if the RBI were to grant an NBFC permit to those who have already applied - such as Xiaomi and Oppo - companies who raise funds from the neighbouring countries will face delays on their plans as these will need government approval, he said. 
""It raises questions about India's hard-earned regulatory agility that had banked on ease of doing business and single-window clearance,"" Sonker said.
BUILDING THE ECOSYSTEM
Xiaomi is the No. 1 smartphone brand in India, which is also its biggest international market, according to Hong Kong-based technology firm Counterpoint Research. It has a 30% market share based on shipments versus rival Oppo with a 12% share.
Neil Shah, a vice president for research at Counterpoint, said that an NBFC would give Xiaomi and Oppo access to user data and spending patterns which can be exploited to boost revenue for other services. Profit margins from their smartphone sales are estimated at 1-2%.
""Chinese brands are sacrificing margins on hardware to build a user base of hundreds of millions which they can monetise,"" said Shah. ""Their ambitions can be delayed (by the policy)."" 
In recent years, several companies have started operating as Indian shadow banks that lend more easily to customers new to the credit ecosystem. India's total credit demand is projected to be $1.41 trillion by 2021-22, consultants PwC estimate.
India is lucrative for Chinese players as some have encountered regulatory setbacks in other Asian markets. Xiaomi's financial unit, for example, had to shut down in Indonesia in late 2018 due to a disagreement with regulators over the type of licence it needed.
Xiaomi's and Oppo's consumer finance ambitions could face further delay as worries about Chinese investments grow more broadly amid anger in India over China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, industry executives said.
At least 30 applications backed by Chinese investors for licences to operate shadow banks are now with the RBI, two other industry sources said. The RBI does not disclose such statistics and did not respond to a request for comment for this story. 
Santosh Pai, a partner at Indian law firm Link Legal, said he had in recent months been approached by dozens of Chinese investors seeking advice on obtaining NBFC licences.

""Given the sector is attracting scrutiny, some Chinese investors who did not have a great track record might not consider this (Indian NBFC) market now,"" Pai said.

395,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",Lloyd's of London to pay up to $4.3 billion in coronavirus claims,"By Carolyn Cohn
LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyd's of London is likely to pay out $3.0-4.3 billion in claims related to the coronavirus pandemic and underwriting and investment losses for the global non-life insurance sector could reach a record $203 billion, Lloyd's said on Thursday.
Insurers across the globe have suffered losses from the virus, which has locked down economies, bringing businesses, events and travel to a halt.
Reinsurer  Swiss Re  (S:SRENH) said last month it took a hit of $476 million for anticipated and actual pandemic-related claims, whie German insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) this week reported a nearly 30% drop in first-quarter profit.
In a double blow, insurers have also lost money due to falling markets, slashing the investments they use to pay out claims.
""I don't think anyone in our industry has ever seen both happen at once,"" Lloyd's Chief Executive John Neal told Reuters.
Insured losses are likely to total $107 billion, similar to natural catastrophe losses in 2005 led by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma and to 2017 including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, Lloyd's said.
Investment losses are seen at $96 billion.
Its estimates do not include life insurance and assume continuing social distancing and lockdown measures in 2020, as well as a drop in global GDP. 
The bulk of the insurance losses come from cancellation or postponement of major events around the world including the Olympics, business interruption claims on property insurance and trade credit.
Small businesses in Britain are battling insurers who they say have denied them payments for disruption. The insurers say most small business policies do not cover the pandemic.
Lloyd's of London insurer  Hiscox  (L:HSX) is one of those under scrutiny.
Neal said the UK domestic property sector accounted for less than 2% of the Lloyd's market, adding that ""any valid claims should be paid"".
The crisis is also throwing up opportunities for new products. Lloyd's is insuring clinical trials and is considering ""Recover Re"" after-the-event long-term insurance to help businesses recover from pandemics, including COVID-19.
The underwriting floor at Lloyd's, a focal point for the market which employs nearly 50,000 people, was unlikely to open before August, Neal said.

But some of Lloyd's' own staff could start returning to its City of London tower in June, he added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Stock markets fell and bonds were in demand on Thursday as worries grew about a second wave of coronavirus infections and a dour assessment from the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve dashed hopes for a quick economic recovery. 
""The path ahead is both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a webcast speech.
He warned of a recession worse than any since World War Two, and called for additional fiscal spending to stem the fallout from the pandemic - a pointed comment from a central banker who has avoided giving advice to elected officials. 
New outbreaks in South Korea and China were cause for concern, even as more countries begin to re-open their economies after lengthy lockdowns.
European stock futures were down, and every market in Asia fell. Bonds and the dollar held ground won overnight.
FTSE futures (FFIc1) and EuroSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) dropped about 0.5%, while futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) struggled to lift much above flat.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) fell 1%.
""We don't think the market is going to re-test the lows, but it's probably seen its best also, so I'm expecting a correction,"" said Tony Huntley, chief investment officer at Melbourne-based fund manager Adansonia Capital.
""The issue is whether we get a second wave (of infections) ... that would be my greatest fear.""
China has re-imposed movement restrictions near its borders with North Korea and Russia after a new outbreak was detected there and South Korea is working to contain an outbreak centred around bars and nightclubs in Seoul.
""It is important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,"" WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan told an online briefing on Wednesday.
Bonds and the dollar rallied after Powell talked down the prospect of negative interest rates in the United States, and extended gains on Thursday. Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) fell slightly to 0.6395%. 
A surprise drawdown of U.S. inventories helped oil prices make meagre gains, but the bleak outlook capped rises. 
Gold pulled back from a one-week high hit early in the Asian session, but held comfortably above $1,700 an ounce at $1,711.20. 
Markets are looking ahead to the release of the European Central Bank's latest economic bulletin at 0800 GMT and the latest U.S. jobless claims data at 1230 GMT.
SLOW GOING
Equity markets have wavered since April's rally as investors and authorities try to weigh the risks of re-starting economies quickly against the financial ruin that lockdowns have wrought, while worrying about a flare-up infections.
Australian jobless data bought the latest sign of doom, with a record plunge in employment dragging the currency to a one-week low of $0.6420.
Already bleak expectations and strong demand for Aussie bonds kept it from steeper falls. 
In the United States, the Trump Administration is pressing on with re-opening plans despite urgings of caution from medical experts.
""We're going to slowly open the economy,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox News on Wednesday.
""But there is also a risk that we wait too long, there is a risk of destroying the U.S. economy and the health impact that that creates.""
Caution is also prevailing in Europe and the Antipodes, where restrictions are beginning to relax.
""Global markets are still licking their wounds, and while equities remain robust, gains are slowing,"" said Societe General FX strategist Olivier Korber.
""A second pandemic wave is unfortunately not a tail risk, so the full extent of the economic damage may be underestimated,"" he said, recommending a long position in euro/kiwi (EURNZD=) which has gained nearly 9% this year as market volatility has increased.
Elsewhere a strong greenback pushed the kiwi  to a three-week low of $0.5968 and had the euro and pound under pressure. 

Brent crude (LCOc1) firmed slightly to $29.36 per barrel and U.S. crude (CLc1) was up 1% at $25.58 per barrel.

397,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 01:16AM ET</span>","Temperature checks, masks the new normal for air travel, says Dubai airport CEO","By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - Temperature screening and face masks will become common sights at airports to mitigate the spread of the new coronavirus but physical distancing could make flying more expensive, the head of Dubai airport said. 
Around the world, governments, airports and airlines are considering temporary safety measures to restart air travel, including mandatory temperature checks, wearing face masks and keeping passengers apart. 
""We are going to have to take whatever measures are necessary to protect the travelling public and our staff,"" Chief Executive Paul Griffiths told Reuters.
Dubai International, one of the world's busiest airports, suspended passenger services in late March as the United Arab Emirates took drastic measures to contain the virus. 
The UAE has since allowed some repatriation flights and eased other restrictions in the Gulf state, though it is not clear when normal flights will restart. 
Temporary safety measures should be expected as flights resume but Griffiths cautioned physical distancing rules would eventually limit growth as demand rebounds.
""We will not be able to operate at anything close to our original design capacity if we had to maintain social distancing,"" he said.
Dubai airport, the hub of airline Emirates, was handling Airbus (PA:AIR) A380s with over 600 passengers before the virus forced the airport to halt flights.
Physical distancing could also increase airfares if airlines were restricted to selling fewer tickets in order to keep some seats empty, Griffiths said.
FIT TO TRAVEL
But until there was a vaccine, treatment or reliable, quick method to detect the virus, measures that reduce the risk of contagion would need to be enforced, Griffiths said.
It is unclear when global travel will recover from the coronavirus pandemic which has shattered demand and will partially depend on countries lifting their lockdowns.
Regaining public confidence in the safety of air travel is seen by the aviation industry as a significant challenge. 
Countries who have the spread of the virus under control and agree to reopen their borders to each other are likely to drive air travel demand over the near term, Griffiths said, but it is impossible to say when travel could return to pre-pandemic levels.

400,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 12:11AM ET</span>","All eyes on Detroit as automakers ready slow, careful reopening of plants","By Joseph White and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - The U.S. factories that make Fords, Chevys and Jeeps are coming back to life this week as workers install new safety equipment and wake up machines ahead of the high-stakes restart the Detroit automakers plan to launch on Monday.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) all plan to reopen North American factories on May 18. The reopening of the U.S. auto sector will be a closely watched test of whether workers across a range of industries can return to factories in large numbers without a resurgence of COVID-19 infections. How well the automakers do will be significant for the U.S. economy, as nearly 1 million workers are employed in the sector. 
Executives at Ford and GM said separately this week the companies have not recorded any cases of COVID-19 transmission in plants outside the United States since adopting new safety protocols. Those procedures include mandatory face masks, separation of workers on assembly lines, frequent cleaning of work areas and requirements that workers pass through temperature monitors and report any symptoms before entering a plant. 
The Detroit Three have taken unprecedented steps to share information about coronavirus safety practices and develop a common set of workplace standards for their restarts, working with the United Auto Workers union, executives said.
""We thought it was critical that we did it together,"" Ford manufacturing and labor chief Gary Johnson told Reuters. ""We've never done this as an industry.""
The Detroit automakers will restart U.S. plants without regular testing of workers, because they do not have access to sufficient testing capacity, executives and UAW officials said. They will test workers who report COVID-19 symptoms or have fevers discovered by temperature scanners installed at factory entrances.
""We have to continue to push for this testing,"" United Auto Workers union Vice President Cindy Estrada told Reuters on Wednesday. ""Unless we have testing weekly to keep sick people out of the plant there is always a risk."" 
Adopting new safety practices is just part of the work the companies must do to reopen after an extraordinary shutdown that has lasted two months. 
WAVE ZERO
At Ford, workers going in to ready factories are part of what Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley calls ""wave zero."" The work of wave zero employees ""is really important for success of the startup,"" he said in an interview.
The machinery used to build cars and trucks - welding robots, stamping presses, painting equipment, computer controlled metal cutting machines - is designed to be run almost constantly. Restarting requires more than throwing some circuit breakers.
Lubricants used in engine machining systems must be checked. Fluid tanks in paint shops have to be filtered for bacteria and other contaminants.
Aluminum that was sitting in plants waiting to be turned into exterior panels for the company's best-selling F-series trucks has to be formed into parts within a certain period of time, Ford's Johnson said.
During the shutdown, some Ford workers went into the automaker's Dearborn, Michigan, pickup plant to build aluminum parts and apply protective coatings so the metal did not have to be scrapped. Some aluminum doors were then trucked out to the homes of quality inspectors who tore them apart in their garages to check that adhesives had not failed, Johnson said.
Ford has had finished vehicles sitting in lots and at rail heads for two months, which means the batteries could be dead. ""We can now ping the vehicle and get a reading back - has the battery drained?"" Johnson said.
Along assembly lines, UAW skilled trades workers at Fiat Chrysler's Jeep plant in Toledo, Ohio, worked during the shutdown to install shields to separate workers who would otherwise get too close. 
At one point on the line, one worker is supposed to install a windshield washer fluid bottle while another installs fuses. Now, those workers are separated by an orange plastic sheet that descends from a hanger installed over the vehicle, said UAW Local 12 President Bruce Baumhower, whose local represents about 6,000 hourly workers.
""Our UAW skilled trades guys have worked through this entire shutdown developing those kinds of systems, those kinds of brackets and tooling,"" he said.
The automakers are learning daily from their operations in China, which are weeks ahead of the United States and Europe in terms of reopening. As the weather has gotten warmer, Chinese workers are getting hot under their masks and want more breaks, Farley said.
""We've found lots of hacks,"" he said. ""People are putting lavender oil in the masks.""

Chicago-based United is among the U.S. airlines that have accepted government payroll support, which is conditional on the companies not cutting jobs or pay rates before Sept. 30 as the sector weathers a sharp downturn in travel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
According to the lawsuit, two weeks after United signed the agreement to receive paycheck protection funds, it told domestic management and administration employees that they would be required to take 20 unpaid days off, between May 16 and Sept. 30.
""United's breach harms the agreement's intended beneficiaries: United employees,"" Kenneth England, who works as a shift manager for United at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, said in the complaint.
The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Illinois, said United employees face a substantial reduction in pay as a result of the policy.
""This lawsuit is without merit, as we continue to employ 100% of our workforce,"" United said in a statement. 
The airline said it is taking cost-cutting measures now to offset an unprecedented drop in travel demand and help it ""preserve as much financial flexibility now so we can not only survive this crisis, but thrive once it is behind us.""
United, which is due to receive roughly $5 billion in payroll support under the CARES Act, has already said that it plans to cut at least 3,400 management and administrative positions in October.

It said ""tens of thousands of United employees"" have voluntarily agreed to temporary unpaid leave.

402,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 11:30PM ET</span>","Trump extends U.S. telecom supply chain order aimed at Huawei, ZTE","By David Shepardson and Karen Freifeld
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday extended for another year an executive order signed in May 2019 declaring a national emergency and barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by firms posing a national security risk.
The order invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives the president the authority to regulate commerce in response to a national emergency that threatens the United States. U.S. lawmakers said Trump’s 2019 order was aimed squarely at Chinese companies like Huawei Technologies Co and ZTE Corp (HK:0763).
The U.S. Commerce Department is also expected to extend again a license, set to expire on Friday, allowing U.S. companies to keep doing business with Huawei, a person briefed on the matter said.
The department has issued a series of extensions of the temporary license and previously extended it until April 1. Huawei, the second-largest maker of smartphones, is also a major telecoms equipment company that provides 5G network technology.
In March, the Commerce Department sought public comments on whether it should issue future extensions and asked what was the ""impact on your company or organization if the temporary general license is not extended?"" The Commerce Department also asked about the costs associated with ending the licenses.
Wireless trade association CTIA urged the department to approve a ""long-term"" license extension, writing that ""now is not the time to hamper global operators’ ability to maintain the health of the networks."" 
The group argues that ""ongoing, limited engagement with Huawei to protect the security of equipment and devices in the market benefits American consumers by reducing the risk that they will be subject to device compromise.""
It also asked Commerce to ""reinstate and modify its prior authorization for standards development work to allow for exchanges with Huawei in furtherance of global telecommunications standards.""
The Commerce Department and Huawei declined to comment.
Since adding Huawei to an economic blacklist in May 2019, citing national security concerns, the department has allowed it to purchase some U.S.-made goods in a move aimed at minimizing disruption for its customers, many of which operate wireless networks in rural America.
In November, the Federal Communications Commission designated Huawei and ZTE as national security risks, effectively barring their rural customers in the United States from tapping an $8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment.

Steven Barry, who heads the Competitive Carriers Association, told a congressional hearing in March that rural carriers were ""essentially attempting to rebuild the airplane in mid-flight"" by having to remove and replace network equipment.

404,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 11:18PM ET</span>",Fresh Crisis Looms for India Shadow Banks After Fund Closures,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s shadow lenders are facing fresh turmoil after asset manager Franklin Templeton shut funds late last month, prompting other large investors to dump the financiers’ debt.
Mutual funds are big buyers of non-bank financial firms’ bonds and some are struggling to meet redemptions after the biggest-ever forced closure of funds in the country. Spreads on AAA rated five-year bonds of shadow lenders have soared to an eight-year high. Three other gauges of the sector’s health compiled by Bloomberg showed no improvement last month, with a measure of shares of 20 financial firms and other companies staying depressed.
The scores attached to each of the measures have been calculated by normalizing the deviation of the latest value of the indicator from its yearly average. They are assigned on a scale of 1 to 7, with 1 implying weakness and 7 showing strength.
There are mounting concerns that the default rate in India may spike after the world’s biggest stay-at-home restriction halted manufacturing and wiped out consumption. Credit growth has remained sluggish, with banks hoarding cash, Bloomberg’s index of banking liquidity showed last month.
To help cash-starved shadow lenders cope with the coronavirus-fueled slowdown, the Reserve Bank of India last month announced it would inject 500 billion rupees ($6.6 billion) into the banking system to encourage lending. Banks were ordered to use the funds exclusively for buying debt of shadow lenders, but some opted to stay away.
Authorities have been struggling to steady India’s shadow-bank sector since the collapse of major infrastructure financier IL&FS Group in 2018. The firms form the backbone of Asia’s third-largest economy as they lend to everyone from small merchants to business titans.
India’s non-bank financiers aren’t alone facing the heat. Global peers in the U.S. were struggling until the Federal Reserve last month expanded its unprecedented support of credit markets to include the debt of riskier borrowers.

405,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 10:00PM ET</span>","Australia Employment Slumps by Record 594,300","(Bloomberg) -- Australian employers slashed workers last month as government restrictions to stem the spread of the coronavirus forced the shut down of many industries across the economy. Unemployment held up as labor force participation tumbled.
Employment plunged by 594,300 in April, compared with an estimated 575,000 drop, data from the statistics bureau showed in Sydney Thursday. The jobless rate rose to 6.2%, well below economists’ median estimate of 8.2% as participation plunged to 63.5% from 66% in March.
The underemployment rate rose to a record high 13.7%, up 4.9 percentage points, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said. The Australian dollar held declines on the day and was trading at 64.32 U.S. cents at 11:43 a.m. in Sydney.
The result comes as companies ranging from Australia’s two major airlines to casinos to department stores furloughed or stood down tens of thousands of workers as demand collapsed and, in many cases, doors forced shut.
The Reserve Bank of Australia predicts the economy will contract 10% from peak-to-trough this year and expects unemployment to surge to around 10% by June. Governor Philip Lowe says hours worked will be a key metric to gauge the hit, as the government’s JobKeeper initiative that keeps workers attached to employers during the shutdown, and an expected fall in participation, limit some of the increase in the official unemployment rate.
The government and central bank responded with a massive fiscal-monetary injection worth 16.4% of gross domestic product to support the economy.
Qantas Airways Ltd. in March furloughed most of its 30,000-strong workforce and rival Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. stood down 80% of its workforce. Star Entertainment Group Ltd. furloughed 90% of its 9,000 employees after the government ordered the closure of casinos and Myer Holdings Ltd. temporarily shut all stores.
Retailer Premier Investments Ltd. closed all of its stores for about a month, standing down almost all 9,000 employees, while Flight Centre Travel Group Ltd. said it was furloughing 3,800 people. Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. stood down 700 workers.
The initial closure of swathes of the economy had a dramatic impact on consumer and business confidence, with both plummeting in response. Sentiment regained some ground in the subsequent month, reports showed this week.
Authorities success in flattening the infection curve has improved sentiment and allowed restrictions to partially be eased. The government aims to reopen many parts of the crippled economy by July and get 850,000 people back in jobs.

The government rejected all four offers received for the 19,788 square meter site after they failed to meet the reserve price, it said in a statement late Wednesday. It’s just the seventh failed government auction in the past eight years in the city, which doesn’t have enough suitable land for housing.
It’s also a reversal from the heady days of last year, when developers were paying top-dollar for land at Kai Tak. Roughly the size of New York’s Central Park, and jutting into Victoria Harbor just across from Hong Kong island, the old airport site offers a rare opportunity to develop prime real estate in the center of one of the world’s most densely populated cities.
Hong Kong’s economy has been buffeted by last year’s anti-government protests, and then the coronavirus outbreak. The city had its worst slump on record in the first quarter, and key economic drivers such as tourism and retail sales are in freefall.

“Even though the pandemic situation in Hong Kong has improved recently, the economy is expected to be unstable and business will be difficult,” said Thomas Lam, an executive director at Knight Frank LLP, who valued the plot at between HK$6 billion ($774 million) and $7.1 billion
“Industries like tourism and retail will need a long time to recover, so the rental income from this type of commercial plot will likely decline,” he said.
The four bidders were for the site were Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., CK Asset Holdings Ltd., K&K Property Holdings Ltd., and a joint offer from Lifestyle International Holdings Ltd. and Sino Land Co., the government said.
To be sure, the plot may have had less appeal to developers, because it can’t be used for a residential project.
“The government will not speculate on the reasons accounting for the bids placed by tenderers,” the statement said. “Bids put forward depend on a myriad of factors, such as the attractiveness of the site to individual tenderers, as well as how individual tenderers consider market conditions.”

407,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 09:45PM ET</span>",Tencent Game Sales Surge Most in Years in China’s Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) --
Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s revenue beat expectations after Covid-19 lockdowns propelled gaming sales to their fastest pace of growth since 2017, sending shares surging in Hong Kong.
The WeChat operator’s revenue rose 26% to 108.1 billion yuan ($15.2 billion) after online gaming sales leapt 31% during the coronavirus-stricken March quarter, helping offset shrinking ad budgets and a record Chinese economic contraction. Shares rose as much as 4% Thursday, their biggest gain in more than a month.
The numbers underscore how Tencent’s among the more resilient of China’s internet giants thanks to its bread-and-butter gaming division, which rode an upswell of spending from homebound players in the world’s largest gaming arena. But the company warned those gains could peter out as China returned to normality and went back to work, while global macro uncertainty may continue to depress spending by corporations on online advertising.
Ad spending on “long-form video from multinationals has seen a substantial step-down,” Chief Strategy Officer James Mitchell told analysts on a conference call, adding those clients account for about half the business. “You should expect media advertising revenue to be under pressure in the second quarter of the year.”
Tencent offered the first glimpse of how China’s giant internet industry fared during the pandemic. It gained more than $42 billion in market value since Covid-19 first broke out, defying a global market rout to outperform peers like Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU). and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd.
A surge in social media and gaming traffic drew new ad revenue to help offset shrinking traditional online marketing budgets. Tencent’s total smartphone games revenue surged 64% during the first quarter, helped by the consolidation of Clash of Clans maker Supercell. Revenue at Tencent’s burgeoning fintech division slid from the previous quarter after merchants shut their doors, but began recovering from April as activities in China resumed.
“It may be challenging for Tencent to sustain 1Q’s strong growth into the next quarter as the pandemic retreats in China and online game players return to work,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “Lingering industry and macro headwinds may also dampen ad sales ahead.”
After the results, shares in major shareholder Naspers Ltd. and the entity that holds its internet assets, Prosus (OTC:PROSF) NV, rose more than 5% to a record.
But longer term, the world’s largest game publisher is contending with renewed challenges from the likes of ByteDance Ltd. and Alibaba.
While Tencent’s core online entertainment business must convince consumers to keep splurging on aging cash cows like Honor of Kings, rival ByteDance is luring users and advertisers away and into its viral social networks. It’s also preparing to enter hardcore gaming.
It’s in cloud and fintech where Tencent faces possibly its fiercest battle with Alibaba. Parts of those units, which made up more than a quarter of the company’s revenue in 2019, are expected to bounce back over 2020 and resume driving its longer-term expansion. Alibaba-backed Ant Financial’s Alipay is also seeking to attract more merchants and transactions in part by replicating the lite-app model WeChat pioneered.
Alibaba and ByteDance will also fight fiercely for online advertising, which remain vulnerable to economic shocks if Covid-19 persists.
“WeChat’s Moments ads are really designed for big brands, and we see risk that they are cutting budgets under intense pressures on cash flows,” said Richard Kramer, an analyst at Arete.

The company said it initiated the NAFTA arbitration process against Mexico after its unsuccessful attempts to resolve the matter through local bodies.
The notice initiates a 90-day process for Mexico to enter into negotiations with the company, First Majestic said in a statement.
The company alleges that the Mexican tax authority has ""exhibited a total disregard for the applicable provisions of three separate double taxation treaties"" that are relevant to the company and its Mexican units, including the Primero Mining business bought two years ago.
The tax authority, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria (SAT), did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Vancouver-based company, which owns several mines in Mexico, said in its latest annual report that its business was dependent on its operations in Mexico.
The company said it had tried to resolve its differences through local bodies and that some of those proceedings had not yet been resolved. Due to the coronavirus crisis, the other remaining Mexican courts are unavailable for hearings.

409,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 08:30PM ET</span>",Financial trade group says it reaches agreement with exchanges in U.S. database dispute,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A financial industry trade group said on Wednesday it resolved a dispute with U.S. stock exchanges that had threatened to hold brokers liable for any breaches of a new trading database controlled by the exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
Brokers must soon begin sending sensitive client trading information to the database called Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the exchanges and FINRA, collectively called self-regulatory organizations (SROs), to build and operate the database.
But before they begin sending the information, the SROs had insisted the brokers sign an agreement limiting the SROs' financial liability to $500 per reporting firm in the case of a data breach.
That would have put brokers on the hook for any security breaches of the database, which they have no control over, said the trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).
SIFMA, which represents banks, broker-dealers and asset managers, had petitioned the SEC to suspend the requirement that brokers sign the agreement before they begin sending the mandated data, which includes sensitive financial information of their customers, and open the process up to public comment.
SIFMA said on Wednesday the SROs agreed to remove the language from the agreement limiting SRO liability for a breach of the database.
""SIFMA's guiding principle is 'they who hold the data bear the liability,' and it was inappropriate and unfair for the SROs to unilaterally impose limits on their liability when they alone hold and control the data inside the CAT, the largest data base to ever be constructed,"" the group said in a statement.
The CAT will allow regulators to track all trades from their inception, pinpointing buyers, sellers, exchanges and brokers involved, with one former SEC commissioner likening it to a Hubble Space Telescope for the securities markets.
The CAT has face years of delays. The idea for the project first gained traction after so-called flash crash in May 2010, which wiped out around $1 trillion from the stock market within minutes before an almost equally rapid rebound. It took regulators months to piece together the data needed to even attempt to diagnose what caused the event.

410,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>",Virus Hotspots Multiply in Meat Plants From Germany to Brazil,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus outbreaks that shuttered U.S. meat plants are spreading to other industry powerhouses from Europe to Brazil.
So far, the supply disruptions haven’t matched the burger shortfalls and soaring prices seen in the U.S. That’s partly because abattoirs outside America tend to be smaller, damping the market impact when one is halted. But as slaughterhouses become virus hotspots, they’re attracting greater scrutiny and more plants are being shut.
In Europe, one Irish beef plant has closed, while German authorities blamed working conditions and crowded seasonal staff accommodation for virus outbreaks that shut two facilities. That prompted criticism from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said the situation was “alarming.” In Brazil, meat giants BRF SA (NYSE:BRFS) and  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) were each ordered to close one plant as a surge in infections is investigated.
“Brazil is not immune to the pandemic,” said Lorival Luz, chief executive officer of BRF, the country’s largest chicken and pork exporter. “Depending on measures taken by local authorities, we may see some difficulties that may lead to a supply shortage.”
While a handful of companies dominate the U.S. industry, the top 15 producers in the European Union only account for less than a third of output. That minimizes the impact when shutdowns occur. And in contrast to the U.S. feedlot system, cattle in Brazil are fattened across extensive pastures, requiring a higher number of smaller abattoirs near farms.
“The scale issue is a sort of mark of the size of the U.S. industry,” said Justin Sherrard, a global animal-protein analyst at Rabobank Group. “It also creates a certain vulnerability under this pandemic situation.”
Infection Rates
Processors in Europe have also cut back operations during the pandemic because of sluggish meat sales and shuttered restaurants, said Karsten Maier, secretary general at the European Livestock and Meat Trades Union.
Infection rates at meat plants partly reflect government policies to both tackle the virus and restart economies. In the U.S., the coronavirus spread at more than twice the national rate in counties with major meatpacking plants in the first week after Donald Trump ordered them to reopen. His Brazilian counterpart, Jair Bolsonaro, has railed against virus containment efforts adopted by local authorities, even as the country’s death toll surged to a record.
For the moment, Brazil’s meat industry is still largely operating at a normal pace. Companies took early measures to reduce contamination, such as curbing groups in cafeterias, distributing masks and boosting disinfection.
Top South American beef exporter Minerva SA (OTC:MRVSY) adopted a minimum distance of 2 meters (6.6 feet) among workers and increased shifts to offset the idle capacity, according to Chief Financial Officer Edison Ticle.
“We enhanced the protection equipment used by all employees,” Ticle said. “They look like astronauts going to work.”
Social Distancing
Social distancing is also easier at more automated plants, such as those in Russia, where the bulk of investment was made over the past 15 years, said Anastasia Mikhailova, a spokeswoman for producer Cherkizovo Group.
Still, Ros Agro Plc expects the virus to only peak in some Russian regions in late May, making it too early to say whether the nation’s meat plants will be affected, said CEO Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Basov.
Australia, a top red-meat exporter, has only had one slaughterhouse virus cluster so far, after 62 cases were linked to the Cedar Meats sheep-meat facility near Melbourne. The plant has been closed for two weeks for deep cleaning and all 350 workers have been tested for the virus.
The country probably won’t see outbreaks like those in the U.S., according to federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud, who praised the industry for being proactive on social distancing and hygiene. Still, labor unions are calling for processors to strengthen health and safety protocols.
For the moment, nowhere has experienced an impact like the U.S., where more than 30 meat workers have died of Covid-19 and at least 30 plants have closed at some point in the past two months.
In Ireland, 556 workers in 10 meat-processing facilities tested positive as of last week, the nation’s health department said. The death this month of a worker from a poultry producer in Northern Ireland prompted the Unite labor union to ask processors to temporarily close facilities with outbreaks.
Not Pleased
Authorities in Germany’s leading livestock states of Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein and North-Rhine Westphalia have ordered virus testing of meat-plant workers. On May 8, state officials ordered the closure of Westfleisch’s Coesfeld plant, with more than 250 workers infected. Vion also closed a slaughterhouse in Bad Bramstedt in Germany this month, after some workers were found to be infected.
“I am not pleased with what we have seen here,” Chancellor Merkel said on Wednesday.
One sector that resembles the scale of meat plants in the U.S. is Brazil’s poultry industry. The nation’s facilities are enormous -- slaughtering as many as 500,000 birds a day and requiring 2,000 or more workers.
Processors were initially reluctant to share information and adopt official recommendations, said Priscila Schvarcz, a prosecutor in Rio Grande do Sul, where the two Brazilian plants were shut. Six companies, including BRF, have since signed up to protocols to curb the virus’s spread, according to Schvarcz.
“What a lot of people are looking at in the meat industry is what’s happening in Brazil, because Brazil’s such a big supplier to the whole world,” said Max Green, a livestock and meat analyst for IHS Markit in London. “If they have a serious hit to their production, it would have more of an impact to global meat supplies.”

411,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Hong Kong’s Economic Crisis Just Keeps Getting Worse,"(Bloomberg) -- On the ninth floor of a building near Hong Kong’s old Kai Tak airport, Kung Fu master Lam Shu-shing teaches the Wing Chun technique to students, something he’s been doing since 1978. A banner on the wall nods to a legacy that traces back to his teacher’s master, who also trained Bruce Lee.
Passing on this cultural touchstone to the next generation is proving to be Lam’s biggest challenge yet as the number of students has dwindled to a handful. “This is the toughest moment in the past 40 years that I am teaching Kung Fu,” said Lam, who at almost 70 had to give up his gym when he couldn’t afford the rent. “I don’t see any improvement in Hong Kong any time soon.”
First came months of protest in 2019 and then the coronavirus outbreak, sending Hong Kong spiraling. Now, just as other economies around the world look to a recovery as their virus restrictions ease, Hong Kong’s reprieve appears fleeting: clashes between police and protesters are resuming and worries about another virus wave remain. It’s a dual threat that has businesses and shoppers on edge and raises fundamental questions about how -- or if -- one of the world’s most storied finance hubs will regain its past prominence.
Financial Secretary Paul Chan has described Hong Kong’s economic challenges as unprecedented. In the first quarter, the city had its worst slump on record.
Even pillars of the economy that had been holding up, like finance and real estate, are showing signs of softening.
In the property market – the world’s priciest -- the political deadlock is eroding demand from buyers based in mainland China, according to Simon Smith, head of research and consultancy at Savills Plc.
“Obviously, the outbreak really reduced mainland visitors to almost nothing and the return of the unrest will continue to keep them away,” he said. Wealthy individuals from China had dominated the high-end home market, with about 60% of international buyers hailing from the mainland over the past 10 years, according to Savills.
Banks are feeling the strain, too. Loan risks loom for lenders including  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) as the city’s recession grinds on, according to Francis Chan, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Insurance agents and private bankers have been hurt by the virus outbreak as travel curbs blocked potential customers from the mainland.
At the same time, deteriorating relations between the U.S. and China will squeeze the city’s port if trade tensions resume. U.S. lawmakers routinely threaten to punish China for its actions against Hong Kong’s democracy protesters.
Sales Slump
The biggest strain so far has been on retailers, hotels, bars and restaurants. Tourism to Hong Kong has dried up amid virus-related travel restrictions, and for months before that mainland visitors stayed away because of the political unrest. Retail sales by value slumped by more than 40% for an unprecedented second straight month in March as inbound visitors sank by 99%.
To ease the pain, Hong Kong’s government has announced about HK$287.5 billion ($37 billion) of direct virus-related aid this year, or about 10% of GDP, including a wage subsidy program and a cash handout of HK$10,000 to all permanent residents age 18 or older.
Open Again
Elaine Cheung, who runs Elaine Beauty House not far from the central finance district, recently reopened her beauty salon after a 28-day compulsory shutdown to contain the virus. She is racing to make the most of pent-up demand, while it lasts.
“My WhatsApp just kept popping up messages from clients. I’m rushing to serve as many customers as possible when the situation is relatively safe,” she said. “Who knows what will happen next?”
Government officials warn the city may see its worst full-year economic performance on record, with a contraction of as much as 7%, after the economy shrank 1.2% last year. It contracted 8.9% in the first quarter from year-ago levels. Unemployment has risen for six straight months while industry barometers including small business sentiment and Markit PMI hover near record lows.
It’s an outlook overshadowing Hong Kong’s success in containing the virus, with cases in the city slowing to a trickle. Hong Kong has confirmed just 1,051 cases and four deaths, and hasn’t recorded a virus-related death since March. Yet the risk of another wave became real in recent days as health officials confirmed two new local cases, bringing to an end a 23-day streak without a locally transmitted case.
As authorities take a more aggressive approach to rein in protesters with little sign of compromise to meet their demands, the unrest is expected to heat up again in coming months.
Last Drinks?
On Friday, May 8, in the city’s popular bar district, the mask wearing staff at the Honi Honi Tiki Cocktail Lounge were hustling to prepare for reopening after the enforced shutdown. Just 30 minutes after the doors opened, customers began trickling in, adjusting to the temperature checks and rules on spacing as they ordered tropical cocktails in Polynesian tiki mugs.
Bar owner Max Traverse has had to reduce staff. A rental discount has helped tide him over. Conditions had been improving earlier this year before the virus hit yet now, like others, he’s worried what will happen if either the protests or another virus outbreak returns.
“If the city has to close again, it would be a ghost city,” he said.
That concern is widespread across the bar and restaurant sector. Alan Lo, co-founder of the Classified Group of eateries as well as the Michelin-starred restaurant Duddell’s, said the political logjam could be a blow that shrinks the city’s food and beverage industry, with owners “down to their last drop of capital.”
Expat Exit
Hong Kong’s bustling lifestyle, low tax rates and gateway-to-China status have long attracted expatriates. There are anecdotal signs that the appeal is waning after months of home schooling and travel restrictions, though much will depend on what happens in coming months.
“I think many companies are still taking a wait-and-see approach to matters,” said Lee Quane, regional director for Asia with expat consultancy ECA International. “If you see two years of continued disruption and no real solution in sight, a lot of companies will think twice about it.”
What Bloomberg’s Economists Say...
“We expect the economy to recover in the last quarter of this year, as stimulus kicks in to lift growth in major economies. Uncertainties remain high, though -- on the pandemic, tensions between the U.S. and China and tensions between the city and central government. However, in the longer term, there are upsides. The city’s economy has proved to be highly resilient in the past.”
--Qian Wan Bloomberg Economics
To navigate a way out, the government will need to shake up the economy by playing to its strengths in health care and financial services, along with a renewed focus on high-end manufacturing that would offer new opportunities, according to Christopher To, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Directors.
Yet such solutions seem a long way off for those struggling to keep their businesses alive now.
Back at the gym, while demonstrating the flowing movements and quick arm-and-leg attacks of Wing Chun, Lam worries that things may never return to the way they were, for him and for Hong Kong.
“I won’t be able to go back to the past where I have my own center,” Lam said. “I will continue to roam around with my students.”

412,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",How Alibaba’s Lazada Turned Produce Dumped In Virus Crisis Into a Business,"(Bloomberg) -- Follow Bloomberg on LINE messenger for all the business news and analysis you need.
Farmers in Cameron Highlands, a cradle of Malaysia’s farming industry, dumped hundreds of tons of produce in March after Covid-19 lockdowns shuttered wholesale markets and restaurants across the nation. They also gave  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) a chance to crack a difficult arena.
Lazada Group SA, the Southeast Asian subsidiary of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., opened a virtual store to link farmers and homebound Malaysians. The uptake surprised even the e-commerce giant: consumers bought an average of 1.5 tons of cabbages, carrots and spinach each day. On the fourth day, 3.5 tons of veggies were sold in less than half an hour. By the third week, about 70 tons had been delivered from farms to doorsteps across the country.
Fresh groceries -- now one of the top three categories on Lazada Malaysia -- weren’t even an option there three months ago. Before the novel coronavirus, Lazada had dedicated grocery arms only in Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines; after the outbreak, it’s expanded to Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. It’s keen to maintain that momentum, backed by 30 fulfillment centers across 17 cities in the region.
“Covid-19 is a catalyst of digital transformation in Southeast Asia,” Lazada Group Chief Executive Officer Pierre Poignant said in an interview. “When consumers build a habit, it doesn’t easily go away. E-commerce will become a way of life.”

Demand for fresh groceries has surged globally, but the spike in Malaysia opened a window in particular for China’s largest online commerce company into a lucrative market after years of building one of the region’s largest delivery networks. Since March, more agricultural entrepreneurs, fisheries and local businesses have started to pivot brick-and-mortar business to e-commerce, according to Lazada Malaysia Chief Operating Officer Shah Suriye Rubhen. The festive period of Ramadan, in a country where more than half the population is Muslim, has also galvanized demand and farmers have responded by increasing their assortment of goods on offer.
“Local SMEs are realizing that digitizing their business is the way forward to remain sustainable in the long-term, diversify their revenue stream, and market to the increasingly growing internet economy,” Shah said.
Alibaba’s unit may have scored in Cameron Highlands, but the wider Southeast Asian market remains heavily contested.

Lazada, started in 2012 by Rocket Internet before Alibaba eventually bought full control of the company, was the first e-commerce outfit to serve six countries in Southeast Asia. But its fiercest rival Shopee, a unit of Singapore’s Sea (NYSE:SE) Ltd., has expanded aggressively in the past year and overtaken Lazada as the most visited website in 2019, according to research firm iPrice Group.In Indonesia, the largest and most promising market in the region, Alibaba-backed Tokopedia ranks as the top e-commerce company based on web traffic, followed by Shopee, Bukalapak and Lazada. Blibli is the online grocery leader, while “Shopee, Tokopedia and Lazada are playing fast catch-up,” said Roshan Raj, a Singapore-based partner at research firm RedSeer Consulting.
It’s not just the e-commerce giants -- the resurgence in online grocery has attracted new entrants from adjacent industries. Singapore’s Qoo10 Pte was particularly swift to act when the government ordered bubble tea shops to temporarily shut along with other non-essential services, offering DIY bubble tea kits. Even meal delivery firm Foodpanda started grocery delivery.
At home in Singapore, Lazada’s Lazmall, where brands sell directly to consumers, has recently attracted big names like  Under Armour  Inc (NYSE:UAA). in Singapore and Thailand,  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). and 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co. in Indonesia and department store chain Robinsons, which is shutting one of its three Singapore outlets in August.
“There are brands that I would not have imagined would come to e-commerce,” Poignant said.
The 41-year-old Frenchman, a co-founder who took the helm last year, says Lazada is interested in grocery deals, including acquisitions and joint ventures, in Southeast Asia. “We are very open to that,” he said, adding the company isn’t in concrete discussions at the moment. His firm last month teamed up with Indonesia’s Rumah Sayur Group to source vegetables from 2,500 farmers in West Java.
Lazada acquired Singaporean e-grocer RedMart in 2016. It struggled to meet demand and had to temporarily suspend new grocery orders in April to make adjustments. Poignant said changes made to RedMart helped the company serve 50% more customers each day a month later.
“Southeast Asia’s e-commerce market is likely to move from a subsidy game to a quality game,” said Lai Chang Wen, CEO of Singapore-based Ninja Van, which helps e-commerce clients deliver more than a million packages daily in the region. “This shift will be pivotal and have a lasting impact.”
Read more: Alibaba Bets on Frenchman to Lead High-Stakes Southeast Asia Expansion
Poignant argues Alibaba’s technologies will help differentiate Lazada, starting with live-streaming. He said Lazada is the only player in Southeast Asia that allows consumers to immediately buy items they see on a stream. By the end of June, Lazada plans to host more than 1,000 daily sessions, up from 4,000 per week now. In April, some 7,000 new live stream accounts were created, up 70% from the pre-pandemic era.
Alibaba’s artificial intelligence technology is another asset. Lazada has more than 100 people working on personalizing its experience, part of Lazada’s 9,000-strong workforce across six countries.
For the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, Lazada is the single most important piece of its globalization strategy. It aims to serve 300 million Southeast Asians by 2030, up from 65 million now, according to Poignant.Underscoring that ambition, Alibaba last week struck a deal to buy half of Singapore’s AXA Tower, valued at S$1.68 billion ($1.2 billion). Poignant says the 50-story landmark, already home to 3,000 Lazada staff, has very good feng shui. The cylindrical structure was inspired by a stack of coins and originally built as the country’s Treasury Building in 1986. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong once had an office in the building, Poignant added.
“Southeast Asia is an absolutely critical market for Alibaba,” he said.

The memorandum, which was seen by Reuters, also said the administrators and the ministry had agreed that the objective of SAA's bankruptcy protection process was to have a restructured SAA or a new company with no reliance on public finances.
A public enterprises ministry spokesman confirmed the memorandum was an authentic document.
The administrators were not immediately available for comment.
SAA's administrators, appointed in December to try to rescue the firm, have said previously that a wind-down or liquidation of the loss-making airline were likely outcomes.
Senior officials at the public enterprises ministry have criticised the administrators for not coming up with a ""business rescue plan"" for SAA sooner and recently hired an aviation consultancy to advise them.
The ""interim period"" during which the administrators will not sell assets without consulting the ministry lasts until June 30 at the latest, the memorandum said.
SAA has not made a profit since 2011 and has received bailouts worth more than 20 billion rand ($1.1 billion) over the past three years. It is running low on cash after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to halt all commercial passenger flights and the government told the administrators it would not provide further funding.

The planes had been initially set for delivery from 2020 to 2023, according to an Azul securities filing.
Azul said the agreement was a step to shore up its business amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which also led it to reduce its April capacity by 90% in comparison to the same month in 2019.

415,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2020 05:42PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for May 14,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Stocks ended sharply lower today with the dour assessment of the economy from Fed Chief Jerome Powell hanging like a dark cloud over Wall Street from the opening bell.
Bulls will be hoping that tomorrow employment data will show continued improvement to counter the nervousness about the reopening of local economies across the country.
Along with the weekly unemployment figures, there will be earnings from the chip equipment sector and yet more insight from Fed officials.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Jobless Claims Expected to Dip From Last Week
While the numbers of newly unemployed are still increasing, those long the market will be looking for the trend of diminishing gains to continue.
The Labor Department will issue its report on weekly jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to come in at 2.5 million, down from about 3.17 million the week before.
This week Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts revised their peak estimate for the U.S. jobless rate to 25%, up from 15%.
2. Applied Materials to Report
Tech stocks have lost some of their momentum in trading this week. But tomorrow investors will get some numbers from the semiconductor sector that could give investors more clarity.
Chip equipment maker Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) will report earnings after the bell.
On Monday B. Riley FBR boosted its price target on the stock to $56 from $53, but was cautious on upcoming results.
“(W)e expect AMAT to follow ASML, (KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC)) and (Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX)) in noting a constructive (calendar 2020) outlook overall, but we suspect the spending view could tick down from $57.5B toward $52.5B to $55.0B to account for selectively reduced forecasts and potential for others to drift into (2021) as (Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)) warned,” analyst Craig Ellis said in a research note, according to Briefing.com.
Applied Materials is expected to report a profit of 94 cents per share on revenue of about $4.1 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The company withdrew its guidance due to the Covid-19 pandemic on March 23.
3. More From the Fed Heads
It’s been an exciting week for Fed followers and there’s more to come tomorrow as two more Fed officials will be speaking.
At 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT) Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari will participate in discussion on “Our Economy and Health in Crisis”.

At 6:00 PM ET (22:00 GMT), Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan will participate in a panel discussion and Q&A with Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson.

418,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 05:18PM ET</span>","Tepper Piles on to Bank Woes, Calling Them ‘Tough’ Investments","(Bloomberg) -- Bank stocks took a beating on Wednesday, tumbling to the lowest since early April, after Appaloosa Management’s David Tepper told CNBC that lenders make for “tough” investments at the moment.
The billionaire’s remarks followed a grim outlook on the economy from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, which weighed on the sector. Analysts have also expressed concern that banks will cut dividends, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) saying  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS).’s dividend is most at risk in a bear case, and Atlantic Equities downgrading  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. due to the looming specter of a lower dividend. On Tuesday, Fed Governor Randal Quarles said the Fed could curtail Wall Street banks’ ability to pay dividends by cranking up the amount of capital they need to maintain due to the pandemic.
The KBW Bank Index closed down 4.7%, with CIT Group (NYSE:CIT) Inc.,  Capital One  Financial (NYSE:COF) Group and Wells Fargo -- which shed 6.3% to close at the lowest since June 2009 -- among leading decliners. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). were among relative outperformers, though both declined more than 3%. Regional banks underperformed as well, with the KBW Regional Banking Index sliding 5.5% while the S&P 500 fell 1.8%.
Banks are particularly sensitive to economic upheaval and credit issues and have underperformed since concern about Covid-19 began surfacing. Both KBW bank indexes have tumbled more than 40% since Feb. 20, when fear about the pandemic started to intensify, versus a 16% drop for the S&P 500.
Even so, there are some who see reasons to like banks at the moment.
Earlier, Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo wrote that a meeting with President Donald Trump’s former economic adviser Gary Cohn, who was also a top Goldman Sachs executive, reinforced his view that the largest banks are better-positioned for customer benefits from government programs, reallocating resources and leveraging scale from technology.
Mayo said the main positive takeaway from talks with Cohn was that government stimulus to stem the effects of the Covid-19 crisis may be “infinite,” with potential for “wave after wave of support for the economy and unemployed workers.”
And Fundstrat analyst Vito Racanelli wrote that he sees opportunity in “quality regional banks that should come out of this crisis with their profitability and business outlook intact for the long term.”
“Financial stocks remain the bleeding edge of the bear market, even as some areas of the market, notably technology and growth stocks, have recovered nicely,” Racanelli said. “If there is an economic recovery, and I think there will be, then banks will eventually recuperate, too.”
He highlighted Little Rock, Arkansas-based Bank OZK (NASDAQ:OZK) as a “well-run bank with a profitable and well-positioned geographic footprint and whose shares are cheaper than they’ve been in a long while.” Bank OZK fell 5.8% on Wednesday and has dropped 32% since Feb. 20.

(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) is advising employees to work from home through at least June 30, it said in a memo on Wednesday, noting that the bank is unlikely to return to business as usual the next day.
""It is too early to say exactly when our operations will return to a more normal model,"" Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell said in the memo to employees. The bank's operating committee decided this week on the tentative date, he added.
Roughly 200,000 of the San Francisco-based bank's 265,000 employees have been working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic. Those still reporting to the office primarily include employees working from bank branches or operations centers. 
The bank had already cautioned workers that its coronavirus-related policies would likely stay in place even after governments loosen lockdowns. States including Georgia and Texas have started non-essential businesses, and hard-hit New York is preparing to ease business restrictions in some regions as soon as this week. 
Before July, Wells Fargo executives may consider minor changes to current policies, like allowing customers to use teller windows at branches that have been converted to drive-through only during the pandemic, or resuming some operations in other countries where conditions have eased, the memo said. 
When employees do head back to the office, the workplace will look drastically different from before. The bank plans a phased-in return to the office to reduce density, with heightened cleaning and safety policies. 
Last month the bank launched an on-site nursing service at 56 of its largest U.S. sites to screen for coronavirus symptoms such as a fever.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA said on Wednesday that it is working with European regulators to speed up access to a potential coronavirus vaccine in Europe after its chief executive suggested Americans would likely get the vaccine first.
The company said in a statement that it is currently in talks with the European Union and the French and German governments to expedite regional vaccine development.
Sanofi, whose Pasteur division has an established track record of producing influenza vaccines, has teamed up with British rival GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc last month to come up with a candidate it hopes will be ready next year. The companies have received financial support from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the U.S. Health Department.
Given the support from BARDA, doses produced in the United States are expected to go to U.S. patients first, a prospect that has raised concern in Europe.
""The U.S. government has the right to the largest preorder because it’s invested in taking the risk,"" Sanofi CEO Paul Hudson (NYSE:HUD) said in an interview with Bloomberg News on Wednesday. According to Bloomberg, Hudson said that the United States expects to get its doses of the vaccine first.
""We are very encouraged to see the mobilization of the EU Commission over the past weeks, exploring similar measures that could expedite both vaccines development and access to the European population,"" Sanofi said in its statement.
The company said that remainder of its vaccine manufacturing capacity will cover Europe and the rest of the world.

New York (Reuters) - Wall Street's three major indexes closed lower for the second day in a row after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned on Wednesday of extended economic weakness due to the coronavirus pandemic and called for Congress to agree on additional fiscal support.
While the indexes closed above their session lows as they pared losses in the final minutes of the day, investors appeared to price in a deeper economic downturn than they had previously expected, fearing Powell's call for additional stimulus would go unanswered. 
While Powell pledged in a webcast to use the U.S. central bank's power as needed, he suggested that it might not be enough to avoid deep economic damage without more fiscal support.
""He's saying if you want to avoid a slow recovery and long-term economic damage you need a strong fiscal response, effectively placing that responsibility back over to governments instead of central banks,"" said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Jersey City, New Jersey.
And divisions among Republicans and Democrats appear to have dimmed the prospects for additional fiscal support from Congress, according to Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW). 
Market participants said they were relieved by Powell's indication that the Fed would not push interest rates below zero but some seemed taken aback by his downbeat view on the economy. 
Schwab's Kleintop said Powell's tone was more pessimistic than in the recent past. ""The market took away that maybe there's more bad news out there than they'd been pricing in,"" he said. 
Powell's comments followed a sharp selloff in equities on Tuesday after a warning from leading U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci that the virus was not yet under control. Fauci's comments prompted concerns about how the economy would emerge from weeks of virus-related lockdowns.
The depth of Wednesday's decline was due to the combination of Fauci's comments and Powell's warning, TD Ameritrade's Cruz said: ""The biggest implication is that some of the economic activity we've lost may never be recovered.""
Another negative factor was a decision by an independent board overseeing billions in federal retirement dollars that it would indefinitely delay plans to invest in some Chinese companies.
""It adds to the tension ahead of an announcement Trump said could come this week on the Phase One (U.S.-China) trade deal,"" said Schwab's Kleintop. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 516.81 points, or 2.17%, to 23,247.97, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 50.12 points, or 1.75%, to 2,820 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 139.38 points, or 1.55%, to 8,863.17.
Investor bets on a swift recovery had helped the three main U.S. stock indexes climb about 30% from their March lows. 
But as officials around the world and in parts of the United States began easing lockdown rules with a view to restarting local economies, fears of a second wave of COVID-19 infections have diminished those hopes.
Energy stocks (SPNY) dropped 4.4% on Wednesday, showing the steepest percentage loss among the 11 major S&P sectors. Interest rate-sensitive bank shares <.SPXBK> also shed 4.4%, tracking a fall in U.S. Treasury yields. 
Wall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe volatility index (VIX), rose for the second day. It gained 2.24 points to 35.28 after touching its highest point since May 4. 
 Royal Caribbean  Cruises Ltd (N:RCL) shares tumbled just under 5% after it launched a $3.3 billion bond offering, pledging 28 of its ships as collateral and forecast heavy losses for the first quarter.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 6.36-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 4.31-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted two new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 34 new highs and 93 new lows.

Under French law, Toulouse-based Airbus cannot disclose restructuring plans internally before consulting trade unions through a formal exercise not expected before the end of May.
But people close to the company said senior staff would be attempting to read between the lines of Faury's weekly internal briefing to gauge his job plans.
""Over the last few weeks, Airbus has implemented a number of financial, operational and social measures in order to adapt to the severe health and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis,"" an Airbus spokesman said.
""The company will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the future of Airbus in cooperation with its social partners.""
A meeting with unions is scheduled for Thursday to discuss progress on furlough schemes, French union sources said. More temporary furloughs could be announced in the coming week.
One insider said any restructuring plan would involve forced redundancies and cutbacks were expected to be deep, though others cautioned it was too early to talk of specific numbers.
SENIOR JOBS 
The company has also initiated an ""executive population"" review, reflecting Faury's resolve even before the crisis to arrest sharp growth in Airbus's senior ranks, sources said. 
That stems in part from an in-house merger between Airbus and former parent EADS in 2014 that left an overhang of top jobs and a headquarters lifestyle that is being steadily wound down.
It has not said what sacrifices if any will be made by the company's board.
Reuters reported last month that Airbus could carry out a restructuring comparable to its 2007 Power8 shake-up which saw 10,000 job cuts split between permanent and temporary posts.
For now, Airbus is relying on government-backed furlough schemes in France, Germany and Britain to reduce staff costs after earlier asking employees to take 10 days' leave.
But it is also taking a deeper look at fixed costs after announcing plans to cut jet output by at least a third, with such costs harder to absorb when output is falling.
It also faces an ageing workforce with an estimated 37% of its 135,000 staff due to retire within a decade as a generation recruited to help launch its A320 jet approaches pension age - to be only partially replaced in a leaner, more digital age.
Research spending has been frozen across the board except for the in-demand A321XLR, a key product in its longer-term battle against rival Boeing (N:BA).

Britain's Daily Telegraph reported earlier that Airbus could cut 10,000 jobs within days, based on a comparison with Boeing (N:BA) which is cutting 10% or about 16,000 of its workforce.

425,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>","Goldman Sachs Now Sees U.S. Jobless Rate Peaking at 25%, Not 15%","(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). economists revised their forecasts to reflect a gloomier outlook for the U.S. labor market, though also the potential for a faster recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Analysts David Mericle and Ronnie Walker estimate that the unemployment rate will peak at 25%, up from a previous forecast of 15%, as “more workers will lose their jobs and a larger share of them will be classiﬁed as unemployed,” according to a research note late Tuesday. The rate would then remain near 10% at year-end, near the highs of the last recession, they wrote.

Goldman Sachs revised the figures following last week’s monthly jobs report showing a record contraction in payrolls in April and a 14.7% unemployment rate, the highest since the Great Depression era. A jobless rate of 25% would be in line with estimates of the peak during the Depression.
Despite expectations for a bigger hit to the labor market, the analysts see relief in sight for the world’s largest economy, as some indicators point to a slow resumption of activity and companies are starting to ease back to business. Reopening still presents one of the largest risks, though, with second waves of infections possible along with a renewed tightening of restrictions, they said.
The new forecast also includes a deeper hit to quarterly gross domestic product, with an annualized second-quarter decline of 39% instead of 34%.
But the recovery is also seen as faster than before with a 29% gain in the third quarter, suggesting a more “V-shaped” or immediate recovery path for the economy. They had previously estimated a 19% jump.

Investing.com –  Stocks on Walll Street tumbled Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell 's stark warning about the state of coronavirus-ravaged economy prompted investors to pull their bullish bets.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.17%, or 516 points, the S&P 500 slumped 1.75%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 1.55%.
Underscoring the severe impact of the pandemic, Powell said the scope and speed of the economic downturn are ""significantly worse"" than any recession since World War II and warned the economic outlook was highly uncertain.
""We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and in employment, and already the job gains of the past decade have been erased,"" Powell said in prepared remarks. ""This reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words, as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future.""
Against rising pressure to cut rates to below zero from President Donald Trump, Powell all but shut the door on negative rates, which he said had yet to prove an effective policy tool.
The sobering update from Powell comes as investors continue to assess efforts to reopen the economy against the risk that a rushed reopening could trigger a second wave of infections, sending the country back into a nationwide lockdown.
Top diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci warned this week that the U.S. could face more ""suffering and death"" if states start to reopen too quickly.
Downside in the broader market was led by energy, paced by a 1.9% decline in oil prices despite an unexpected draw in weekly U.S. inventories.
Financials, meanwhile, continued their weak start to the week, led by banking stocks as the United States 10-year yield slipped on weaker economic data and bearish remarks from Powell.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were down more than 3%.
The Labor Department said on Wednesday, its producer price index for final demand fell 1.3% last month, wider than economists' forecasts for a 0.5% decline.
Technology stocks, meanwhile, also contributed to the selloff, led by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), but Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) proved exceptions to the selloff.
The day of red on Wall Street comes as big-name fund managers continue to debate whether the market has run up too fast.
David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, told CNBC that the market is ""pretty full,"" while Bill Miller, founder of Miller Value Partners said the broader market is trading around levels matching an average over the last five years."

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's main stock market index tumbled to a two-week low on Wednesday and the loonie fell against the U.S. dollar as hopes ebbed for a quick economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis and a major wealth fund blacklisted some Canadian oil companies.
Norway's $1 trillion wealth fund, which operates under ethical guidelines set by that country's parliament, said it was excluding companies such as Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd (TO:CNQ) and  Suncor Energy  Inc (TO:SU) for producing excessive greenhouse gas emissions.
The focus on environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) is ""weighing on the energy space in Canada,"" said Ben Jang, portfolio manager at Nicola Wealth.
The Toronto Stock Exchange's energy sector fell 5.4%, while the S&P/TSX composite index (GSPTSE) was down nearly 3% at 14,440.27, its lowest since April 27.
The decline for the index came as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned of an extended period of weak growth and stagnant incomes due to the coronavirus pandemic, pressuring U.S. stocks, which fell for a second straight day.
Investors have also had to contend this week with worries that the premature lifting of lockdowns could lead to additional outbreaks of the virus, and renewed U.S.-China trade tensions.
""The traditional thinking of buying the dip has become more and more in question,"" Jang said.
Canada and the United States appear likely to extend a ban on non-essential travel until June 21 amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, sources in both nations said.
The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell nearly 2% to $25.29 a barrel, while the Canadian dollar weakened 0.2% to 1.4098 to the greenback, or 70.93 U.S. cents. The loonie touched its weakest intraday level since last Thursday at 1.4107.
The Bank of Canada is due to release on Thursday its annual financial system review, which will assess the main vulnerabilities of the Canadian financial system. Since March, the central bank has slashed interest rates to near zero and introduced for the first time a large-scale asset purchase program.

Canadian government bond yields were little changed across much of the curve on Wednesday, with the 2-year (CA2YT=RR) up less than 1 basis point at 0.281%.

429,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",Companies explore suburbs as social distancing complicates return to NYC,"By Herbert Lash
NEW YORK (Reuters) - With a mass return to offices looking like wishful thinking in New York and other cities even as businesses start to reopen as the coronavirus outbreak is contained, companies are exploring real estate options in the suburbs. 
Some are enquiring about flexible leases, all of which suggests that a back-to-the-suburbs trend already in place before the coronavirus outbreak could accelerate at least for a few years, according to anecdotal evidence and real estate analysts. 
Six-feet social distancing will limit mass transit usage and create bottlenecks at elevators despite landlord efforts to speed the process. Densely populated cities, especially in Asia, that are skyscraper friendly, constrained by geography and mass transit-dependent have already encountered difficulties in reopening.
Many brokers say leasing is almost at a standstill and without strong data it is hard to draw firm conclusions about suburban satellite offices, although there are telltale signs. 
James Ritman, a managing director at brokerage Newmark Knight Frank in Stamford, Connecticut, 35 miles northeast of New York, has received one to three inquiries a day in the past week by companies ready to lease space or contemplating such a move. 
Some are groups are looking at spaces, others are in the fact-finding stage. ""They're gathering data,"" Ritman told Reuters. 
""All this demand, all this activity that is coming out of New York, is 100% based on the virus, the fact that there is an uncertainty surrounding New York City with mass transit, with buildings and spaces that are typically pretty dense,"" he said.
Jonathan Wasserstrum, founder and chief executive of SquareFoot in New York, has seen a notable pick-up in searches for leases under three years.
""We're seeing a higher percentage of people who want more shorter-term leases,"" he said. ""In times of uncertainty you want flexibility.""
The days of packed elevators are over, said Dennis Donovan, principal at Wadley Donovan Gutshaw Consulting in Bridgewater, New Jersey, which advises corporations on where to locate their businesses. ""Buildings that don't have fast and smart elevators are going to be at a huge disadvantage.""
Touchless technologies will proliferate and buildings with sophisticated ventilation systems will be in demand, he said. 
But an increased emphasis on the suburbs will not lead to a big drop in employment or office vacancies in New York or other gateway cities, Donovan predicted. Plus tenants are obliged to meet lease payments.
PEDALING BACK TO WORK 
Transit-dependent cities in Asia such as Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai that are already reopening offices or soon will face trouble coming back on line, said Jacques Gordon, global strategist at LaSalle, a unit of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc in Chicago.
In bicycle-friendly Europe, workforces in Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Stockholm were encouraged to pedal back to work. 
""The people who returned to work in our Munich office last week relied heavily on bikes to get to work,"" he added.
While a migration to the suburbs now makes sense, within two or three years a highly skilled workforce and world-class entertainment and cultural venues will lead companies back to New York, Gordon said. 
Others disagree that a move back to suburbia is happening. 
""It is all hearsay at the moment,"" said a broker at a well-known brokerage who declined to be named. ""There are no stats to support it until spaces are listed and leases are signed.""
If short-term space in the suburbs is leased, it is highly unlikely companies will sublease their office space and increase availability in New York, this broker said.
""They will de-densify their New York locations to make a safer work environment for the employees that can get to their Manhattan offices,"" he said.
Jamie Hodari, chief executive and a co-founder of Industrious, a flexible workspace provider, said management will err on the side of caution for the first few weeks of reopening buildings and as people get accustomed to waiting for elevators.
Landlords have detailed plans to ensure tenant safety, said Bob Savitt, founder and president of Savitt Partners, owner of almost 3 million square feet of Manhattan properties.

""Everybody's waiting. Every building in New York is in the same position, they all have to wait,"" said Savitt. Even so, he added, ""Not all companies will be coming back 100% when (New York Governor Andrew) Cuomo says it's OK.""

Price-gouging is not usually illegal but can be in certain states if there is an emergency, like during a hurricane or the current pandemic.
In a blog post, Brian Huseman, a vice president of public policy at Amazon, noted that different states had different definitions of gouging and that some fight gouging using consumer-protection statutes.
""The disparate standards among states present a significant challenge for retailers working to assist law enforcement, protect consumers, and comply with the law,"" Huseman wrote.
A group of 32 U.S. state attorneys general wrote to Amazon in March, and to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), urging that they did more to stop gouging. In March, some sellers on Amazon notoriously charged $400, or more, for a box of small bottles of Purell hand sanitizer.
In response to the price-gouging criticism, Huseman said Amazon had removed more than a half million items from stores, suspended nearly 4,000 selling accounts in the U.S. store, and given information to federal prosecutors and state attorneys about sellers that Amazon suspects put excessively high prices on products in high demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Huseman argued for a law that would come into force if a national emergency is declared, be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission and the states, and which would define gouging.

Investing.com – The Dow plunged on Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell warned of a protracted road to recovery for the economy at a time when many are concerned that reopening too quickly could trigger a second wave of Covid-19 infections.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.32%, or 550 points, the S&P 500 slumped 2.19%, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 2.08%.
Underscoring the severe impact of the pandemic, Powell said the scope and speed of the economic downturn are ""significantly worse"" than any recession since World War II and hit back against calls to cut rates below zero, which he said had yet to prove an effective policy tool.
""We are seeing a severe decline in economic activity and in employment, and already the job gains of the past decade have been erased,"" Powell said in prepared remarks. ""This reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words, as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future.""
As efforts to reopen the economic continue, New York state is dealing with an illness potentially related to the novel coronavirus that has caused inflammation in children.

444,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>","Tesla, California county reach deal to reopen U.S. plant next week","By David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc and officials in California have resolved their acrimonious clash over safety procedures at the automaker’s sole U.S. assembly plant with a deal that allows production to resume as early as Monday, county officials said.
The county said the automaker could take additional steps ahead of next week after Chief Executive Elon Musk had vowed to defy authorities, saying Monday he was resuming production despite the prohibition. On Tuesday, he also won the backing of President Donald Trump.
In a tweet, Alameda County said that following talks with Tesla it agreed that the electric carmaker can take steps ""in preparation for possible reopening as soon as next week."" 
Tesla did not immediately comment Wednesday but around the same time the county issued its statement, Musk tweeted: ""Life should be lived.""
Tesla's sole U.S. electric vehicle assembly plant is in Fremont, California, which is in Alameda County.
The county said it would work with police in Fremont ""to verify Tesla is adhering to physical distancing and that agreed upon health and safety measures are in place for the safety of their workers as they prepare for full production.""
On Monday, Musk said production was resuming in Fremont, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested, it should be him.
On Tuesday, Musk won Trump's backing. ""California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!"" Trump wrote on Twitter. The White House did not immediately comment on the announcement.
Tesla fell 3.3% in afternoon trading to $782.43.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra told CNBC that ""conversation is going on between Tesla and the county. But at the state level, we're ready to enforce if we find that anyone is violating the state orders issued by the governor.""
On Tuesday, employee parking lots at Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, were packed with cars. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.
At the Fremont factory's outbound logistics parking lot, where only a dozen Tesla cars were parked last week, hundreds of Tesla vehicles were seen on Tuesday.
The company had sued Alameda County challenging its decision that the plant should stay closed.
A county health official on Friday said the county had asked all manufacturers, including Tesla, to delay operations by at least another week to monitor infection and hospitalization rates.
Tesla on Saturday released a plan to keep workers returning to the factory safe.
The measures, which include temperature screenings, the installation of barriers to separate work areas and protective equipment for workers, are similar to those set up by Detroit-based automakers General Motors (NYSE:GM), Ford and Fiat Chrysler. Those automakers are set to resume at most U.S. auto plants starting Monday.
Trump is eager for the U.S. economy to reopen and for Americans to return to work.
Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory's closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from Trump.
Last month, Musk was on a call with Trump and other chief executives to discuss the reopening of the U.S. economy in which Musk said he wanted to be able to resume production by May 1 or earlier, a person briefed on the call confirmed. Details of the call were reported earlier by the Washington Post.
Musk's fight with local authorities has gotten the attention of those who scout sites for new factories and corporate offices, as well as economic development officials hungry for more jobs.
Since the disagreement between Tesla and Alameda County gained national attention, officials from such states as Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Utah and Oklahoma have pitched Musk about considering their state. Analysts estimate it would take Tesla 12 to 18 months to move production.

The Fremont factory employs more than 10,000 people, according to the automaker.

Investing.com – Amazon and Etsy are sidestepping the selloff on Wednesday as analysts continue to bet the surge in e-commerce will likely benefit these platforms, but Google and Facebook are likely set for short-term pain as advertisers rein in spending.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) were up 0.41% and 1.6% respectively. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) were both down more than 2%.
With consumers spending more time at home, e-commerce platforms - like Amazon, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Etsy among others - are seeing ""robust"" customer demand growth, Canaccord said. This trend could likely continue amid an ongoing relocation of discretionary spending as ""consumers spend less on travel and entertainment and instead shift those dollars towards making their homes more functional and comfortable,"" it added.
The brokerage also singled out meal kit and food delivery companies such as Blue Apron (NYSE:APRN) and Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) and ""stay at home"" companies such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) that will likely see incremental demand as a result of the pandemic.
But not all online platforms will benefit from the current pandemic.
Advertising names - Facebook, Google, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Snap (NYSE:SNAP) - are seeing ""muted demand in the near term, but the pandemic could accelerate digital adoption over time,"" Canaccord said."
447,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 02:05PM ET</span>","Conde Nast lays off nearly 100 U.S. employees, plans furloughs for others","NEW YORK (Reuters) - Magazine publisher Conde Nast, which owns Vogue, GQ and The New Yorker, is laying off a broad group of nearly 100 employees based in the United States as the coronavirus pandemic has sharply reduced ad revenue, according to an internal memo distributed on Wednesday seen by Reuters. 
""Not all teams will be impacted equally by these actions. That doesn’t mean some teams are more valuable to us than others,"" Conde Nast CEO Roger Lynch said in the memo. ""We tried to identify specific areas where we could bring down our costs without limiting our growth priorities.""
The cuts reflect industry-wide efforts to reduce costs by newspaper publishers like  Gannett Co . Inc. (N:GCI) and  Tribune Publishing Co . (O:TPCO), which also slashed salaries and cut jobs as ad revenues plummeted during the spread of coronavirus. 
So far, at least 36,000 media workers are estimated to have been laid off or furloughed amid the pandemic, according to the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT). 
Lynch said in a memo that less than 100 of Conde Nast's approximate 2,700 employees in the United States would also be temporarily furloughed. There will also be ""a handful"" of employees on reduced work schedules. 

In April, Conde Nast announced in a separate memo that employees earning more than $100,000 would receive 10% to 20% pay cuts. Lynch also said that he would reduce his salary by half in an effort to save costs.

448,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",SBA Backs Off Legal Threat Against Firms That Didn’t Need Loans,"(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration said firms that took loans that they didn’t need from a small business aid program will be allowed to repay the money without legal consequences, reversing an earlier threat that the government could pursue them criminally.
New guidance issued Wednesday for the Paycheck Protection Program by the Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department also said that companies that took loans of less than $2 million will automatically be determined to have done so in good faith because they’re less likely to have access to other resources.
The SBA will review all loans above $2 million to check whether firms properly certified they needed the money. If the SBA determines the company shouldn’t have gotten the money, the loan won’t be forgiven and if the borrower returns it, no further action will be taken, according to the new guidance.
Assuming that loans of less than $2 million were taken in good faith will allow SBA to focus its resources on reviewing larger loans given the massive size of the program, the agencies said.
Last month, following a backlash after large firms swooped in and collected millions from the PPP program -- which was intended to cast a lifeline to small firms that didn’t have access to capital markets -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had said that firms could face criminal charges for taking loans they didn’t need.
Meanwhile, borrowers who commit fraud in taking relief loans are already being prosecuted. The Justice Department last week brought the first criminal case related to the program when it charged two New England businessmen with fraud and alleged that their applications falsely claimed employees they don’t have.
The PPP program allows loans of as much as $10 million that can be become grants if proceeds are spent mostly on payroll for two months after they are received. It’s meant to keep workers employed and firms ready to re-open when state stay-at-home orders are lifted.
After firms such as  Shake Shack Inc  (NYSE:SHAK). and the Los Angeles Lakers got loans at the expense of mom-and-pop shops, SBA and Treasury issued guidance April 23 saying companies with “substantial market value and access to capital markets” would be unlikely to qualify. Borrowers had to certify on their applications that “current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations” of the business.
Companies had been given until May 7, later extended to Thursday, to return loans without any penalty. (Shake Shack and the Lakers did return the money). But there was confusion about eligibility, and some firms said they returned their loans “out of an abundance of caution” even if they believed they qualified for it.
The SBA and Treasury haven’t disclosed how many companies have returned or canceled loans and in what amounts. Public companies have reported returning 61 loans worth $411 million as of Wednesday morning, according to data compiled by FactSquared.

Discussions with labor groups have begun, though the number of positions to be eliminated hasn’t yet been decided, according to the person, who asked not to be named disclosing private information.
Airbus executives will thrash out details of the cuts on a call next week, Britain’s Daily Telegraph newspaper said earlier, citing people it didn’t identify. The measures may match a 10% workforce reduction at Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co., suggesting more than 10,000 of the European group’s 134,000 staff may go, it said.
The company declined to comment on internal meetings.
“Over the last few weeks, Airbus has implemeted a number of financial, operational and social measures in order to adapt to the severe health and economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis,” the planemaker said in a statement. “The company will continue to take all necessary measures to ensure the future of Airbus in cooperation with its social partners.”
Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Faury has warned that Airbus faces tough decisions on permanent job cuts after temporarily laying off thousands of staff across plants in France, Germany, Britain and Spain.

It’s not clear whether recent extensions to government furlough programs will influence the company’s thinking or if it plans to move ahead now to slim down the payroll after slashing plane production by about one-third.
A final decision on redundancies may delayed by negotiations with Airbus’s unions, the Telegraph said.

Boston-based Haven said https:// on Wednesday Gawande was taking the new role to focus on company strategies, and form policies related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Chief Operating Officer Mitch Betses will manage day-to-day operations, while Haven looks for a new CEO, the company said. 
Besides Gawande, Haven's board of directors include JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon, Todd Combs, an investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway, and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon. 
Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan formed Haven in 2018 to address the rising healthcare costs in the United States. The companies had said they would use high-tech tools such as data analysis to improve care and reduce costs for employees and their family members. 
Haven has not made any other public announcements since unveiling its name in 2019. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported on May 8 that Gawande was planning to step down, said the company has launched pilot projects to test health-benefit approaches.
The initial announcement in 2018 to form the company shook the shares of health insurance companies such as UnitedHealth Group Inc (N:UNH) and  Cigna Corp  (N:CI) that manage large corporate benefits on worries that Amazon would disrupt the traditional insurance and drug benefit businesses.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury and Small Business Administration clarified Wednesday that businesses that seek less than $2 million in emergency relief under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) will be considered qualified unless proven otherwise.
The government agencies said the ""safe harbor"" should reassure smaller businesses they will not be penalized for taking on the loans. They added that the government would not pursue penalties for any companies that improperly received such loans if the companies pay the money back.
The guidance is aimed at reassuring smaller businesses considering the emergency relief that they will not end up facing a costly or complex audit or penalty for failing to meet some of the program's terms.
Some larger companies have faced a backlash for seeking funds under the emergency loan program, which requires businesses to certify that economic uncertainty driven by the coronavirus pandemic may cause the business to go under without emergency assistance.
The new guidance adds that businesses seeking loans above $2 million may still qualify for the program, although those larger loans will be reviewed by the SBA for compliance. 
However, the government also granted some leeway to larger companies, saying that firms that receive loans that end up not qualifying can simply pay the funds back. If so, the companies will not face ""administrative enforcement or referrals to other agencies"" by the SBA.

Royal Caribbean, which was forced to suspend its cruises globally and cut about 26% of its U.S. workforce, said the health crisis has dented its first-quarter net income by about $453 million. 
The cruise operator's shares, which have sunk over 72% this year, fell 4% in early trading. 
The company expects to report a preliminary first-quarter net loss of $1.44 billion compared to a profit of $249.7 million a year earlier, as it prepares to write down the value of its Silversea Cruises unit and several ships by $1 billion to $1.3 billion.
Preliminary total revenue for the three months ended March 31 fell 16.7% to $2 billion. 
The company will use the new private note offering to repay a $2.35 billion 364-day term loan agreement with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
Earlier in May, rival  Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd  (N:NCLH) had raised over $2.2 billion through debt and equity offerings, giving it the much needed funds to survive for at least the next 18 months. The company used two of its ships and two private islands as collateral for the debt offering.
Royal Caribbean declined to specify which ships it had pledged for its debt offering. It had vessels with a net book value of about $22.7 billion as of Dec. 31, including the world's largest cruise ship - Symphony of the Seas.

459,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Bank Stocks Sputter Even After Powell Downplays Negative Rates,"(Bloomberg) -- Jerome Powell’s warning that the U.S. economy faces unprecedented risks tanked bank stocks even after the Federal Reserve head pushed back against negative interest rates.
The Fed chairman said policy makers weren’t looking to follow other central banks into negative rates policy, batting down growing speculation in the futures market. However, shares of financial companies still fell as much as 5% on Wednesday, outpacing the broader S&P 500 Index’s 2% drop, after Powell cautioned that the economy’s recovery from the coronavirus “may take some time” to gather momentum.
Powell’s caution on the recovery outweighed the relief financial stocks may have enjoyed from policy makers downplaying negative rates, according to Miller Tabak + Co. The ensuing risk-off sentiment, along with an increase in tensions with China drove down shares in cyclical sectors such as energy, automobiles and consumer durables. Tech and health-care stocks had the smallest declines, continuing a trend of outperformance.
“A very weak economy is bad for the banks even if we do not see negative interest rates,” said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak. “Investors are worried about buying stocks in a broad manner due to the economy, so they continue to put money in the stocks of companies that seem recession proof in this unique recession.”
State Street’s SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF, ticker KRE, tumbled as much as 6.8%.
Investors had been speculating that the Fed might lower rates into negative territory to cushion the virus outbreak’s economic blow. While Powell stopped short of ruling the tool out as an option, he said the policy is “not something that we’re considering.” Traders of fed funds futures pushed bets on a negative policy rate into next year after Powell’s comments.
Commercial banks are charged interest on their deposits at the Fed in a negative rate environment, weighing on their profitability. But despite Powell’s push back on the policy, concerns over an extended economic downturn are dragging down financials and real estate stocks, according to Evercore ISI.
“Banks/REITS have the same issues to deal with which is the potential for an extended period of very high unemployment that leads to a bankruptcy,” wrote Evercore strategist Dennis DeBusschere in a note.

The pilot restaurants, all in southeast England including Harrow, Dalston and Tooting in London, will offer a limited menu via Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats.
Orders are capped at a maximum of 25 pounds ($31) as McDonald's adjusts to smaller teams and social distancing regulations in its kitchens.
""We are asking all our employees to adapt to how our restaurants now work, and will only reopen at a pace that enables them to work safely,"" said Paul Pomroy, McDonald's CEO for the UK and Ireland.
From May 20, the group, which has more than 1,450 restaurants across the UK and Ireland and employs more than 135,000 people, will move to the next phase of its reopening plan, with a further 30 pilot restaurants in the UK and Ireland, offering service through the Drive-Thru lane.
It hopes to have all its Drive-Thrus open by early June.

Additional safety measures the group has implemented include the use of contactless thermometers, with employee temperatures checked on arrival at work, perspex screens in key locations in the kitchen and service areas and protective equipment, including gloves and face coverings.

""It's difficult to have more than two players in the food delivery area, there will be global consolidation"", Paulo Passoni, managing investment partner in Softbank (OTC:SFTBY)'s Latin America Fund, said in a webcast hosted by Brazilian digital broker XP (NASDAQ:XP) Inc. 
He spoke a day after reports from Reuters and other media that  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), partly owned by SoftBank, was in talks to buy online food delivery company Grubhub Inc.
SoftBank's Latin America Fund is also a shareholder in Rappi, founded in Colombia. In addition Softbank is a shareholder in Chinese ride hailing company Didi, whose Didi Eats unit has had high growth in Mexico, Passoni added.
Passoni said the novel coronavirus pandemic has made him ""more comfortable"" with SoftBank's portfolio in Latin America, as most of its stakeholdings are experiencing higher demand thanks to social distancing measures and growing digitalization of Latin American economies. 
Digital wallets and online banks are booming, Passoni said, because most e-commerce and delivery companies do not accept cash. SoftBank's Latin America fund has a stake in Brazilian digital bank  Banco Inter SA  (SA:BIDI4).

469,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Europe nears crisis plan for public stakes in key companies - sources,"By Pamela Barbaglia, John O'Donnell and Jan Strupczewski
LONDON/FRANKFURT/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU officials are seeking to finalise a plan for public stakes to be taken in key European companies to shield them from the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The European Union is looking to take decisive, unified action to support corporates after plans to help struggling southern states became mired in dispute and led to some politicians questioning the future of the European project.
On May 5, after weeks of negotiations, France called for ""an equity fund, either to recapitalise or to acquire shares in strategic companies that need capital, especially for those operating in European strategic value chains"", according to a proposal submitted to the EU commission and seen by Reuters.
One favoured option is the creation of a central ""solvency support"" scheme, funded by member states, to direct investments into companies deemed systemically important, according to the three sources familiar with the discussions.
Another could see European companies issue convertible bonds to the European Investment Bank, the EU's lending arm, that could later turn into an equity stake, said two of the sources.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission declined to comment.
While all member states have largely embraced the idea of such investment, its governance has proved a stumbling block along traditional fault lines, said the sources who declined to be named as the negotiations are confidential.
Italy and France want the new scheme to prioritise support for companies in countries worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic and economic slump, and with fewer financial resources at their disposal, according to the sources.
But German officials have asked for more visibility on the benefits that Europe's largest economy will get from ploughing a large chunk of the cash into the scheme, they said.
Much of the detail surrounding any scheme to protect companies - and not just states - is yet to be finalised. A broad announcement on it is expected in the coming days as part of a trillion-euro plan for a recovery fund, the sources said.
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS
The plan to take stakes in companies is inspired by previous proposals backed by France and Italy to strengthen Europe's ""strategic"" industries. 
Last August, EU officials examined the creation of an EU sovereign wealth fund to invest in European champions in sectors where Europe lags behind global rivals such as technology, according to an internal document seen by Reuters that mentioned stepping up competition with U.S. giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as well as China's  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).
This plan stalled in the autumn, and the wealth fund never materialised. But the broad idea of the bloc investing in major companies was revived by Italian and French officials after the coronavirus hit Europe as a way to overcome the stalemate on debt mutualisation, the sources said.
It was also championed by internal market commissioner Thierry Breton as a way to protect systemically important businesses in Europe and deter any unwanted takeover or stake-building from outside actors.
Concerns over the vulnerability of some European companies grew in April when it emerged that Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had amassed stakes in four European oil majors, including France's Total and Italy's  ENI  (MI:ENI). 
Another method of investing in companies being examined by EU officials is by making greater use of an agency that takes small stakes in companies, the European Fund for Strategic Investment, to bolster businesses struck by the pandemic, one source said.
Since it was set up in 2015, the fund has made roughly 1.9 billion euros of small investments in companies specialising in life science, renewable energy and digitalisation.
The 27-member bloc is also looking at using its central budget to give guarantees to the European Investment Bank that would, in turn, hand out loans to companies struggling in the slump, another source said.
That would lower the risk for other private investors or a national development bank, which could then grant further credit or take a stake in the company. Such aid would be directed at countries worst hit by the crisis, the person added. 
EUROPEAN UNITY?
While the idea of public stakes in companies has won broad backing, some experts remain set against it.
""I do not favour the recovery fund taking stakes in companies. I do not favour this French model of sponsoring industry,"" said Lars Feld, chairman of the German government's council of economic experts that advises the chancellery, finance ministry and economy ministry on policy.
The nature of the scheme - whether permanent or temporary - is also a key point of contention, the sources said.
Germany wants certainty that any temporary measure would grant an immediate payback when assets are sold, one source said, depending on how much each member state has contributed to the scheme.
France and Italy hope that the scheme can be beefed up over time to build European champions and protect key industries, said one source.
Despite the divisions, negotiations are progressing amid pressures from German, Italian and French industry lobby groups which recently called for a unified European effort to support businesses in trouble.

""No European company should fail because of lack of support,"" they said in a joint statement.

The six, led by the top Republican on the committee Representative Jim Jordan, wrote officials at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to argue that lawful mergers should be allowed to continue without ""artificial intervention or delay.""
In April, David Cicilline, chair of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel, made a long-shot call for a moratorium on mergers in the next coronavirus stimulus package and a ban on deals that are not directly related to companies about to fail.
Two of the most popular Democrats, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, said they would propose legislation to stop mergers for companies with more than $100 million in revenue while the United States struggles economically during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The six Republican lawmakers argued in their letter that dealmaking had already slowed to its lowest level in five years, that the agencies are able to review deals despite the new coronavirus forcing many officials to work from home and that stopping dealmaking could make it harder for companies to access capital.
""A broad ban on M&A activity would deny American entrepreneurs and companies the managerial expertise that comes with strategic partnerships, expertise that will enhance
recovery and help avoid business failures and an onslaught of bankruptcy filings,"" the letter said.
The letter was addressed to Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, and Ian Conner, competition director at the Federal Trade Commission.
Delrahim told CNBC on Wednesday that the idea of a moratorium on big corporate mergers was ""misguided."" 
In addition to Jordan, it was signed by Representative James Sensenbrenner, the top Republican on the antitrust subcommittee, as well as Representatives Ken Buck, Matt Gaetz, Kelly Armstrong and Gregory Steube.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street bonuses for 2020 could fall by as much as 25%-30% due to the deep cuts to revenues recorded by banks and hedge funds earlier this year as a result of the novel coronavirus, according to a report published Wednesday by compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc.
While most compensation is expected to be down, 2020 is likely to be a year with ""wide, wide variations in incentive outcomes between stronger and weaker competitors,"" according to the report by Alan Johnson, whose predictions are closely watched by financial professionals.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has led to widespread shutdowns in the U.S. economy, causing gross domestic product to decline at a 4.8% annualized rate in the first quarter and forcing some 33.5 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits. 
For Wall Street professionals, most of whom are working from home, bonuses make up a significant percentage of their annual pay, and many have been fearing big cuts. https://reut.rs/3dxqHa6
Workers in the commercial and retail divisions of many large banks could see the largest year-over-year declines in their incentive pay of up to 30%, as those banks have had to set aside billions for loans that could potentially go bad in this economy.
Investment bankers in advisory roles could receive 20%-25% cuts to incentive pay, while their investment bank colleagues who work in underwriting would see smaller declines of 10%-15%.
Johnson writes that this is because investment banking advisory revenues were down in the first quarter of the year, with most deals stalled, while debt underwriting flourished as corporations sought to build up their cash. 

The report also finds that asset managers could receive 20%-25% reductions in bonuses, while hedge fund workers could see 15%-20% declines.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - While  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) employees fret about their jobs and pay, Germany's largest lender is trying to track down several hundred former staff to claim share payouts it has been holding in Jersey.
The loss-making bank began transferring the assets, which are now worth a total of around $2 million, to a government body on the island last month as part of efforts to streamline its sprawling global network and cut costs.
The assets, which are in the form of stock as well as accrued dividends, have been held for years by the outpost, which was the central depository for awards for Deutsche Bank employees globally, excluding those in Germany and the United States.
Jersey court documents show that over the past year Deutsche Bank has used resources including LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), 192.com, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and the investigative group Kroll to hunt down the ex-staffers.
Although the documents show the effort has had some success, 274 ""lost shareholders"", some of who could lay claim on up to 50,000 pounds ($61,460), have yet to be found.
Deutsche Bank said it was hard to speculate on why the former employees had not been located. The relatively low value of their assets partly reflects an 80% drop in Deutsche Bank's share price over the past decade to record lows.
Employees, mainly those in senior roles, were given shares as part of their remuneration and in 1998, during a period of rapid global growth, Deutsche Bank began depositing these in Jersey, where at one stage it employed more than 100 staff and generated revenue of close to 30 million euros ($33 million).
However, in 2018, Fabrizio Campelli, then in charge of wealth management and now on Deutsche Bank's board, struck a deal with Bermuda-based Butterfield Bank to take over the business in Jersey, Guernsey and the Cayman Islands.
Although the Jersey administrator normally charges individuals a 500 pound fee to collect assets it stores, Deutsche Bank is paying 75,000 pounds upfront so that its former employees will be off the hook.
But the clock is ticking. If the ex-Deutsche Bank staff do not come forward within 15 years to claim their assets, then ownership will automatically transfer to Jersey.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets reversed early indications of a rebound to open lower Wednesday, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell downplayed the prospect of cutting official interest rates below zero and warned of the risk of long-term damage to the economy from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Powell said that while he expected the economy to recover once the U.S. had brought the virus under control, he had an increasing sense that the recovery will take ""longer than we would like.""
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 150 points, or 0.6% at 23,610 points. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% while the Nasdaq Composite held up better, rising 0.4% as investors shovelled yet more money out of traditional economy stocks and into those perceived as better bets in the post-Covid-19 environment. Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) stock, PayPal  (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock and Netflix  (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock were all up by more than 2%.
Powell said in a teleconference Q&A with the Peterson Institute of International Economics that data concerning the effectiveness of negative rates was “very mixed”.
“For now, it’s not something that we’re looking at. We think we have a very good toolkit,” Powell said, although he acknowledged that the Fed may yet have to do more in future.
Powell's comments set his institution up for more criticism from President Donald Trump, who urged the Fed to cut below zero on Tuesday via his Twitter feed. However, opinion at the central bank seems solidly behind Powell, in as much as none of the seven colleagues on the Federal Open Markets Committee to have spoken this week have supported the idea.
""Powell and others on Fed were open to (negative) rates in 2018 before they spent a year examining the tradeoffs of neg rates,"" Diane Swonk, chief economist with Grant Thornton and an adviser to the Fed, said via Twitter. ""The Fed put a lot of thought into this before rejecting it as an effective tool. Never say never but Fed did not take this decision lightly.""
Among individual stocks, Grubhub fell 3.5% after CNBC reported that the company had rejected an all-share offer from Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER). The food delivery company's stock had risen nearly 30% on Tuesday in reaction to reports of talks between the two on a merger. 
Bank stocks tumbled, more unsettled by Powell's comments about the risks to the economy - and consequently the risk of more bad loans - than reassured by the prospect of rates not being cut further. Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 2.7%, while JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 1.6%.
Elsewhere,U.S. crude prices also reversed gains as Powell's comments hit the outlook for oil demand from the U.S. economy. Front-month prices fell 1.2% to $25.46 a barrel. "
486,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Thyssenkrupp, Fincantieri in talks to form warship champion-source","By Christoph Steitz, Tom Käckenhoff and Sabine Siebold
FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF/BERLIN (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) is exploring several strategic options for its warship unit, ranging from combining it with Italy's Fincantieri (MI:FCT) to creating a national champion with German peers, a person familiar with the matter said.
The talks are aimed at creating economies of scale for the division, Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS), which builds submarines and surface ships and operates in a highly fragmented sector driven by political decisions, the source said.
As part of the deliberations, the steel-to-car parts conglomerate is in talks with shipbuilder Fincantieri about a 50-50 joint venture to create a European champion with combined sales of 3.4 billion euros ($3.7 billion), the person said.
Under that scenario Fincantieri, which also builds cruise ships and is majority-owned by the Italian government, would bring in its defense activities, which the source said accounted for 1.6 billion euros of sales last year.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment.
Fincantieri declined to comment on concrete talks. A spokesman added: ""The consolidation of the European defense industry remains desirable and the long-standing cooperation with Germany's naval industry to build submarines represents a concrete opportunity to talk about future scenarios of consolidation"".
Thyssenkrupp is also in early discussions to merge TKMS with smaller German rivals Luerssen and German Naval Yards (GNYK) to create a national powerhouse in a bid to keep critical defense technology in the country and safeguard jobs, the source said.
One option under discussion includes Luerssen buying a stake of just over 50% in GNYK in a first step, with Thyssenkrupp possibly becoming involved at a later stage, two people familiar with the matter said.
""That's one scenario under discussion,"" one of the people said.
GNYK declined to comment. A spokesman for Luerssen reiterated earlier comments that consolidation made sense and was a requirement to strengthen international competitiveness.
Thyssenkrupp might also decide to keep the division, which generated 1.8 billion euros of sales and 1 million of adjusted operating profit in the last fiscal year, and develop it further on its own, the source said.

489,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>","Sony braces for lowest profit in four years, hit broadly by coronavirus","By Makiko Yamazaki
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Sony  Corp (T:6758) expects operating profit to drop at least 30% this financial year to its lowest in four years as the company anticipates a hit to demand for its TVs, cameras and smartphone image sensors from the coronavirus outbreak.
Sony (NYSE:SNE) has halted production at some plants and experienced supply-chain disruptions as governments around the world imposed lengthy restrictions on movement and business activity to contain the virus. 
Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said the consumer electronics business such as TVs ""has been hardest hit right now, but the impact will expand to other businesses as well."" 
The electronics and entertainment company reported a 57% fall in operating profit for the January-March quarter to 35.45 billion yen ($331 million), missing a 73.77 billion yen average of analyst estimates polled by Refinitiv.
The company did not provide precise forecasts for the current year which started in April, but Totoki said current calculations showed that profit was likely to drop ""at least about 30%"" from 845.46 billion yen in the previous year.
The forecast profit of less than 600 billion yen would be the lowest since the year that ended in March 2017, when earthquakes knocked out factories in southern Japan that produce image sensors.
Totoki said profitability at Sony's image sensors business, a key growth driver, could deteriorate as the coronavirus outbreak could cause a shift away from high-end smartphones with multiple-lens cameras that often use the group's advanced image sensors.
Sony controls 51.5% of the world's $15 billion image sensor market, according to data provider  Gartner  (NYSE:IT), supplying most global smartphone makers including Apple Inc (O:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.
The impact from the outbreak already reduced group operating profit by 68.2 billion yen for the year ended this March, Sony said.
One bright spot for Sony was its gaming business, which reported a narrower-than-expected profit decline for the year that ended in March. The business had a positive impact of 2.8 billion yen from the coronavirus outbreak, as consumers locked down at home looked for entertainment and downloaded more gaming software.
Sony is scheduled to launch its PlayStation 5 (PS5) during the year-end holiday shopping season, seven years after its previous generation games console. 

Sony reiterated the year-end timing for the PS5 launch, denying media speculation that the coronavirus would impact production and cause a major delay. The company has nevertheless been forced to announce delays to major games titles such as The Last Of Us Part II.

It said on its website that, as part of a number of measures aimed at reducing the risk, all passengers aged six and up would from May 18 need to wear a mask that covered mouth and nose.
The COVID-19 pandemic and measures such as travel restrictions to curb its spread have thrown the airline industry into crisis, grounding flights and prompting lay-offs. Most of SAS' flights are currently suspended.

Earlier on Wednesday, the European Commission gave non-binding recommendations as part of wider proposals to salvage the ailing tourism sector, saying passengers flying in the union should wear masks but not requiring airlines to leave seats empty to improve social distancing.

491,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>","MUFG puts oil sands, Arctic drilling on 'restricted transactions' list","By Aaron Sheldrick
TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group (T:8306) said on Wednesday it has put oil sands extraction and drilling for crude oil and gas in the Arctic on its ""restricted transaction"" list, potentially a further tightening on financing fossil fuels by Japanese banks.
The biggest Japanese bank by assets, a major lender to fossil fuels as well as to renewable energy projects, has been tightening its policies on fossil fuels in recent years, especially in restricting loans to coal power.
It said in a statement it recognised oil sands development and Arctic drilling for gas or oil have ""impacts on ecosystems, indigenous communities and other factors"" that must be considered before approving loans or other financing.
This means any lending or other financing such as underwriting bond and equity issues is subject to increased due diligence beyond standard reviews, the bank said. It will assess the environmental and social impact of projects before approving them, MUFG said.
Tar sands developments have been labelled as the dirtiest projects for extracting oil due to the emissions they cause, while Arctic drilling is a source of concern because of the fragile environment in the North Pole and receding sea ice due to climate change.
""MUFG's recognition of tar sands and Arctic oil & gas as high risk sectors deserve some credit, but the newly adopted policies fail to establish clear no-go zones for financing,"" Hana Heineken (OTC:HEINY), a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network in San Francisco told Reuters.
The bank is financing Arctic drilling as well as the long-delayed Keystone XL oil pipeline project to transport tar sands crude from Canada to the United States, Heineken said.
The bank's policies on palm oil plantations, which environmentalists and others say cause deforestation that contributes to climate change were also criticised by Heineken.
Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411) said last month it will stop financing new coal power projects and end all loans for coal by 2050.
MUFG, Mizuho and Japan's other biggest bank - Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Financial Group (T:8316) - were among the world's five biggest lenders to coal power and mining over the last five years, according to Refinitiv SDC Platinum data.

Following the global criticism over its support for building coal-fired plants in countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam, and the rollout of new stations at home, Japan's government is reviewing the policy, Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said in February.

493,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Latin America's airlines pray for bailouts to avoid Avianca's fate,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Avianca Holdings (NYSE:AVH) had known since late March that the Colombian airline's cash pile would only cover a few months of expenses while its entire fleet sat grounded because of aggressive anti-coronavirus lockdowns.
In those conditions, Sunday's bankruptcy filing was hardly a surprise. What was surprising was the absence of one key stakeholder: the Colombian government.
That stands in stark contrast to countries like France, Germany and the United States, which made protecting their airline industries an early priority of the crisis. At stake for Avianca, the world's second-oldest airline, are 20,000 jobs, mostly in Colombia.
But Bogota's mostly hands-off approach is hardly an exception among the Latin American governments, which have largely ignored the industry's clamor for bailouts.
In public, LATAM Airlines Group (SN:LTM), Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes (SA:GOLL4),  Aeromexico  (MX:AEROMEX) and Avianca (CN:AVT_p), among others, say they are actively negotiating government rescue packages. But behind the scenes there is growing concern about when results may materialize and if it will not be too little too late.
""It is not coming fast enough,"" said one airline source, who requested anonymity to not affect his carrier's negotiations.
Avianca's own numbers paint a grim picture for a carrier that recently showed enough promise to draw interest from United Airlines (O:UAL), which sought a close business partnership. At the start of the year, Avianca was worth $470 million - it is now worth $17 million, two pennies a share.
By the end of March, after a week on the ground, Avianca had $304 million in available cash with almost no money coming in and mounting expenses. By May, it would have used more than half of that just to make two months of payroll and settle a debt payment.
As the debt deadline approached, its chief executive Anko van der Werff publicized Avianca's need. It was to no avail.
""In Latin America we have not seen as much (government) help as in other regions,"" said Gonzalo Yelpo, legal director at ALTA, a regional airline industry group.
Analysts warn that the crisis could be particularly hazardous for carriers in the region, who lost money in recent years while most others basked in profits. ALTA has warned of a ""bankruptcy pandemic.""
""The starting point is worse for Latin American airlines,"" said Maurício França, of L.E.K Consulting, which estimates Brazil's airlines lost 11 billion reais ($1.89 billion) between 2014 and late 2019.
Avianca's bankruptcy could start to turn the tide, but it's unclear how fast.
On Monday, Colombia said it would consider rescue loans for Avianca.
On Tuesday, Peru said it was considering helping carriers, including foreign airlines. But that comes too late for Avianca, which is shutting down its Peru operation and laying off 1,000 employees there.
In Brazil, airlines have been deadlocked on loan negotiations for weeks. Chile said ""direct aid"" was not on the table for LATAM, its largest carrier.
In Argentina and Mexico, left-wing governments have suggested they will not rescue big companies, although taxpayers directly own Aerolineas Argentinas, complicating the politics.
AIR TRAVEL GROUNDED
Avianca faced a perfect storm with its home base in Colombia and hubs in El Salvador, Ecuador and Peru.
Those four countries shut down all commercial air travel to protect their fragile healthcare systems. But it left Avianca grounded.
Avianca's closest rival, LATAM, did not suffer to the same extent because it can still fly in Chile and Brazil, its main markets.
Now Avianca, which had agreed to buy more than 100 Airbus jets before 2029, faces an uphill path to recovery. It agrees it neither needs nor can afford those aircraft.
In the short-term, Avianca says it expects spending to significantly outpace its revenue, signaling that it ""may eventually need a substantial new infusion of capital.""
Panama's  Copa Holdings SA  (N:CPA), similarly grounded with nowhere to fly, is about a third smaller than Avianca and has said it was burning through $85 million a month.
Even at that rate, Avianca would have cash for less than four months. Almost two months have already gone by.
Making things worse, the coronavirus pandemic is at an earlier stage in Latin America than in the United States, Europe or Asia, pushing back any likely economic reopening.
""The shutdown in Latin America was in a way tighter and stronger,"" said an industry source. ""And now there's bigger reluctance there on reopening the markets.""

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to edge higher Wednesday, rebounding after Tuesday’s losses, as investors balance worries about a potential second wave of the coronavirus with the likelihood of more fiscal measures to prop up the economy.
House Democrats have proposed another coronavirus relief bill, this time totaling $3 trillion, which includes funding for state and local governments and more direct stimulus payments for Americans during the Covid-19 pandemic. Senate Republicans have, however, said they won't support it.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 17 points, or 0.6%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 70 points, or 0.8%. The Dow futures contract rose 161 points, or 0.7%.
All the major indices on Wall Street fell around 2% on Tuesday after leading U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci warned lawmakers that a premature lifting of lockdowns could lead to additional outbreaks of the deadly coronavirus.
This comes after a new outbreak of the virus in not only Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic started, but also the northeast city of Jilin and the South Korean capital, Seoul.
In the corporate sector, Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) has struck a licensing agreement with five generic drugmakers to make remdesivir in 127 countries, ensuring the antiviral drug, which has helped shorten the recovery time of some hospitalized Covid-19 patients, can be delivered worldwide.
The banking sector will also be in focus after President Donald Trump suggested the Federal Reserve should look at negative interest rates.
Financial institutions have had to put aside billions to help cover potential loan losses in the first quarter, amid fears that the economic downturn caused by the Covid-19 outbreak will make it harder for borrowers to repay their debts. Negative interest rates will not help.
The attention will now turn on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who is sure to be asked about the subject while he’s a guest at a streaming event held by the Peterson Institute of International Economics at 9 AM ET (13:00 GMT).
Oil futures were mixed Wednesday, ahead of the official U.S. weekly oil inventories data, due later Wednesday, with crude stockpiles expected to continue their downward trend, albeit slightly.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Easyjet  (L:EZJ) and Lufthansa's (DE:LHAG) Germanwings on Wednesday lost their challenge against an EU ruling ordering Italy to recover illegal state aid granted to airlines serving Sardinia.
The European Commission has in recent years struck down deals granted by regional authorities to attract budget airlines to secondary European airports, saying that these gave them an unfair advantage.
EU competition enforcers in their 2016 decision said a Sardinian scheme to develop air transport was illegal state aid as the beneficiaries were the airlines and not the main Sardinian airport of Alghero, Cagliari-Elmas and Olbia.
EasyJet, Germanwings and Spanish low-cost airline Volotea subsequently took their case to the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe's second-highest, citing legal errors in regulators' decision.
The court rejected their arguments.
""The operators of the Sardinian airports were not the beneficiaries of the aid but merely intermediaries between the autonomous region and the airlines, which must therefore reimburse it the public aid,"" judges said.
The airlines can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union, Europe's highest, on points of law.

The cases are T-607/17 Volotea v Commission, T-716/17 Germanwings v Commission, & T-8/18 easyJet Airline v Commission.

498,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Tesla's California fight heats up competition for jobs,"By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk's fight with local authorities over the reopening of its California plant has gotten the attention of those who scout sites for new factories and corporate offices, as well as economic development officials hungry for more jobs.
The different speeds at which states are reopening their economies amid the coronavirus pandemic are becoming a factor as company executives consider where to locate operations, site selection and state economic development officials said. 
Since the disagreement between Tesla and Alameda County gained national attention, officials from such states as Texas, Nevada, Georgia, Utah and Oklahoma have pitched Musk about considering their state. Analysts estimate it would take Tesla 12 to 18 months to move production.
The Fremont factory employs more than 10,000 people, according to the automaker.
""All you have to do is look at Elon Musk's tweets to see that at least at the highest level of some businesses, people are definitely paying attention to how states have handled this situation,"" said Pat Wilson, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development, in a telephone interview.
New site selection projects have slowed amid the COVID-19 outbreak. But deals are still being closed and work has largely moved to the virtual world thanks to drones, laptops and Zoom meetings - dubbed ""armchair site selection"" by Darin Buelow, principal with Deloitte Consulting and leader of the firm's global location strategy. 
""That county has created an opening for others to come in and recruit,"" said Mark Williams (NYSE:WMB), president of South Carolina site selection firm Strategic Development Group. ""We need to get an idea of, if we have a problem do they have our back? 'Our back' could mean helping when a tornado comes through or dealing with some kind of labor issue."" 
Williams' firm has helped Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd, BMW and auto suppliers choose plant sites.
Industry officials said one outcome of the crisis could be a push by both domestic and international firms to bring more production closer to the U.S. market to reduce supply chain risks, said Greg Burkart, practice leader for site selection at consulting firm Duff & Phelps. 
In late April, Georgia announced deals for a $727 million battery plant by South Korea's SK Innovation Co Ltd and an Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) warehouse. 
States are taking advantage of Tesla's troubles in California to promote themselves.
Officials in Tennessee, which is home to auto plants for Nissan, Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and General Motors Co (NYSE:GM), cited the state's long track record in the sector.
""Would Tennessee be interested in another automaker coming to our state? Absolutely,"" Bob Rolfe, the state commissioner in charge of economic development, said in a telephone interview.
Richard Cortez, the county judge of Texas' Hidalgo County, on the border of Mexico, on Monday reached out to Musk on Twitter, saying his county was available immediately to accommodate Tesla and invited the billionaire CEO for a visit. 
In February, Musk teased the idea of a plant in Texas when he tweeted ""Giga Texas?"" in reference to the gigafactory terminology the company uses. 
Mike Kazmierski, CEO of the Economic Development Authority in Western Nevada, said he wondered about the ultimate fallout in California. Kazmierski helped land Tesla's battery plant near Reno.
""You don't know how much of what's going on between Elon Musk and the officials in California is posturing and how much of it is real,"" he said.

Beyond tension over reopening, site selection experts said the damage done to state budgets could be a factor as businesses choose where to locate operations.

499,By Investing.com,"<span>May 13, 2020 05:36AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Tui Tries to Reinvent the Holiday as Covid Reinvents Travel,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Day by day, the evidence mounts that the effects of the coronavirus on some parts of the economy will be not only long-lasting, but permanent.
Europe’s biggest tour operator Tui (DE:TUIGn) said on Wednesday it wants to “reinvent the holiday” in response to Covid-19 getting busy 'reinventing' the travel industry.
But what does reinvention mean?
According to CEO Fritz Joussen’s statement,  “new destinations, changed travel seasons, new local offerings, more digitalization.""
The last of those, in particular, means bad news for Tui staff, around 8,000 of whom now face the axe in the wake of the group’s update for its fiscal first half. 
But what to make of the rest of it? New destinations? Tui’s catalogue already covers the globe. ‘New local offerings’? The group’s traditional selling point has been facilitating affordable and reliable access to places so distant that travellers value the support a tour operator offers. Will they need  Tui’s help to ‘discover’ what have so far been less desirable places closer to home?
‘Changed travel seasons’? Unless it can change school holiday timetables at the same time, the impact will be confined to older customers, whose willingness to travel at any time is being hit particularly hard due to their vulnerability to the virus.
Investors were unimpressed, pushing the stock down 3.4% on a day when the German Dax lost 1.6% and the Stoxx 600 lost 1.4%.
As a large employer, even after the planned 8,000 job cuts, Tui can be confident of generous government support – it already has a €1.8 billion bridge loan from the German government. Additionally, the company’s cash burn is being eased by the adoption, where possible, of refunding disappointed customers with vouchers rather than money.
But with the summer program all but done for (bookings are now down 36% on the year, and the delivery of any services remains at the mercy of national lockdown measures) it’s still hard to put a positive spin on what the company calls “unquestionably the greatest crisis the industry and Tui has (sic) ever faced.”
The best thing one can say is that, unlike haircuts and after-work socializing, demand will be more pent-up than permanently lost, allowing for a rebound when consumer confidence returns. Winter bookings in the U.K., Tui’s second-most important market, are up 8% from a year earlier, as optimists look for a change of scenery to break the monotony as soon as possible.
However, it’s hard to make an argument for an old-style incumbent like Tui leading the rebound, even when it does come, unless it can magically guarantee and demonstrate industry-leading standards of safety. That seems too remote a hope to make the stock attractive, even at today’s bombed-out levels."

LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Global stocks and oil prices fell on Wednesday as fears about a second wave of coronavirus infections gripped financial markets.
Investors, many facing steep losses due to the pandemic-driven shakeout in assets over the past few months, have also had to contend with renewed U.S.-China trade tensions.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s index of global shares was down 0.3%. The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped 1.6%. Banks acted as the drag after a number of negative updates.
Shares in  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) fell 4.4% after it was reported that top managers will waive one month of fixed pay in an effort to cut costs, while fellow German lender Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and the Netherland's ABN Amro slumped following first quarter losses.
""Earning season is largely behind us and we have entered the phase two of COVID-19 as deconfinement of economies begins, and that is creating a lot of uncertainties on a daily basis, which is weighing on markets,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""We don't think this is the start of a new correction. Markets went too far, too fast and this is the consolidation.""
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan erased an early decline and rose 0.3%. U.S. stock futures, the S&P 500 e-minis, reversed earlier gains to fall 0.2%. 
Oil markets, which have plummeted this year due to a combination of a collapse in demand and a supply glut, lost further ground.
Treasury yields also inched lower amid caution before a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and rising speculation the United States could one day adopt negative interest rates.
Leading U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci on Tuesday warned lawmakers that a premature lifting of lockdowns could lead to additional outbreaks of the deadly coronavirus, which has killed 80,000 Americans and brought the economy to its knees.
Fauci's comments hammered Wall Street stocks overnight, underlining fragile investor sentiment which has in recent sessions swung between optimism over some easing in lockdowns globally and anxiety about a fresh spike in virus cases.
The mood was further soured by proposed legislation by a leading U.S. Republican senator that would authorize President Donald Trump to impose sanctions on China if it fails to give a full account of events leading to the coronavirus outbreak.
Stock markets have rebounded sharply in recent weeks as the spread of the novel coronavirus slowed in some countries in Asia and Europe, while parts of the U.S. economy and Europe began to reopen after weeks of lockdowns. However, some investors worry that a rush to re-open factories and shops may be premature.
The New Zealand dollar slumped to a six-month low after the country's central bank doubled its quantitative easing programme and said it has asked commercial banks to be ready for negative interest rates by year's end.
The U.S. dollar nursed losses as traders braced for Powell's speech, which will cover economic issues and may offer hints on whether negative rates are a viable policy option.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes traded at 0.6606%. The two-year yield stood at 0.1629%, above a record low of 0.1050% hit on Friday.
In Europe, the German 10-year government bond yield, which had risen around 8 basis points since May 4, changed direction and fell around 3 bps as demand for the safe debt increased.
The Italian 10-year government bond yield, which is the proxy for riskier peripheral European bonds, rose 2 bps.
Trump on Tuesday again pushed the Fed to adopt negative rates, a hot topic in financial markets since last week when U.S. money markets started to price in a chance of rates below zero.

Oil futures fell as worries about the virus overcame hope that output cuts would put a floor under prices. U.S. crude fell 1.6% to $25.36 a barrel. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 2.6% to $29.19 per barrel.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Aston Martin  (L:AML) posted a deep first-quarter loss after sales dropped by nearly a third due to the impact of the coronavirus crisis, though the luxury car maker said production of a crucial sport utility vehicle was on track. 
Aston Martin, popular for being James Bond's carmaker of choice, suffered a torrid time since it floated in October 2018, seeing its share price tumble from 19.00 pounds ($23.00) to around 40 pence.
Dire conditions forced the company to bring in Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll to invest in the firm, while Aston said it will continue to review future funding and refinancing options to boost liquidity. 
The pandemic hit demand and forced factories around the world to suspend production. However, Aston resumed operations as its Welsh plant last week but not at its other site located in southern England as yet. 
""We were obviously fairly significantly hit by COVID-19, starting with China in January but more clearly in what we saw as it came across towards Europe and the United States,"" Chief Executive Andy Palmer told Reuters. 
The company posted a pre-tax loss of 119 million pounds ($146 million), compared with a loss of 17 million pounds last year, and said it could no longer provide an annual outlook. Its full-year loss in 2019 came in at 104 million pounds. 
Shares were down 5% at 36 pence, as of 07:35 GMT on Wednesday. 
The carmaker said production of its DBX SUV, which is key to boost volumes and appeal to new buyers including more women, was on track and had a strong order book. 
The luxury brand, which has seen core retail sales slump by an annual 31%, has furloughed staff, introduced additional safety measures and cut the pay of its senior management as part of measures to handle the crisis caused by the pandemic. 
Stroll, who hopes to pursue a turnaround partly by sharing Formula One technology with the firm's range of road cars, leads a consortium that took a 25% stake in the company earlier this year as part of a capital raise worth 536 million pounds. 

""Given the ongoing uncertainties, as is prudent, the company continues to review all future funding and refinancing options to increase liquidity,"" the company said on Wednesday.

Investing.com - European stock markets sold off Wednesday, following overnight losses on Wall Street amid concerns that the reopening of economies could result in a second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.8% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 1.9%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was down 1.1%.
Overnight the major indices on Wall Street all fell around 2% after leading U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci warned lawmakers that a premature lifting of lockdowns could lead to additional outbreaks of the deadly coronavirus.
U.K. transport minister Grant Shapps Wednesday acknowledged the difficulties surrounding reopening an economy, saying there was no perfect way to do so, but the latest growth figures will certainly focus the U.K. government’s mind: Britain's economy shrank by a record 5.8% in March from February, the largest quarter-on-quarter fall since the end of 2008. The second quarter is certain to be considerably worse.
In corporate news, AP Moeller - Maersk (CSE:MAERSKb) stock slumped 4.5% after the world’s largest container line said the fallout from Covid-19 will drive volumes down by as much as 25% this quarter. In banking, Germany's Commerzbank (DE:CBKG) and Dutch-based ABN Amro both slumped after they reported big increases in bad loan provisions, while  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) decided it couldn't keep its planned job cuts on hold any longer. Deutsche Bank stock fell 4%, while ABN stock fell 6.1%.
Luxury car maker  Aston Martin  (LON:AML) fell over 7% after posting a hefty first-quarter pretax loss as sales dropped by nearly a third.
On a more positive note,  Sage Group  (LON:SGE) gained 0.6% after the company, which supplies software to small and medium sized businesses, reported a 5.7% increase in organic revenue growth and a 3% rise in organic operating profit.
Oil futures sold off Wednesday, following the stock markets lower amid concerns about the potential hit to already tepid demand of a second wave of the coronavirus.
Adding to the negative tone was the American Petroleum Institute saying late Tuesday that its measure of stockpiles showed a build of 7.6 million barrels, well above expectations of a rise of 5 million barrels.
The official U.S. weekly oil inventories data are due later Wednesday, with crude stockpiles expected to continue their downward trend, albeit slightly.

507,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 02:54AM ET</span>",World’s Biggest Container Shipper Warns of 25% Slump in Volumes,"(Bloomberg) -- A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S said the fallout from Covid-19 will drive volumes down by as much as 25% this quarter, as the world’s largest container line braces for an historic slump in demand.
Copenhagen-based Maersk said the coronavirus pandemic has already “had a significant impact on the activity level.” The company now sees the global container market contracting this year, compared with a previous forecast for growth of somewhere between 1% and 3%.
The bleak signal from Maersk follows a warning from the World Trade Organization last month that the pandemic could result in the worst collapse in international trade flows since World War II.
Maersk said that global container trade fell 4.7% in the first quarter, with Covid-19 hitting both the supply chain and demand.
“Covid-19 and the subsequent country lockdowns have led to a severe downturn in production and demand in most parts of the world,” Maersk said. “While some countries are slowly beginning to open up, others are still only in the early stages.”
Though the global outlook is grim, Maersk managed to deliver growth in its operating profit. After earlier reporting preliminary Ebitda of $1.4 billion, Maersk delivered $1.52 billion by that measure, according to Wednesday’s report.
“It’s not unrealistic that they might at least get somewhere near” the $5.5 billion Ebitda outlook that was announced before 2020 guidance was suspended, said Per Hansen, an investment economist at Nordnet. Still, the second quarter “will be weighed down by high waves and huge uncertainty.”
Maersk’s revenue increased slightly to $9.57 billion, which was better than the $9.36 billion estimated by analysts.

Global trade flows are being disrupted on an unprecedented scale as both producers and consumers get hit by lockdowns that have wiped out demand. As a result, the industry has had to idle about 13% of its fleet worldwide, according to data compiled by Alphaliner.

511,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>",For Hire: Central Europe's business services firms spy a chance in crisis,"By Michael Kahn, Anna Koper and Alan Charlish
PRAGUE/WARSAW (Reuters) - As the COVID-19 pandemic wipes out jobs and empties offices across the world, companies in Central Europe that provide remote, lower-cost services for multinationals are emerging as winners in the new business order.
From Prague and Warsaw to Bucharest, these firms have long provided outsourced or offshored business services such as software development, administration, payroll handling and research for big European and American customers. Now they are bucking the global trend by expanding and hiring.
""In a time of crisis, more business is shifting here,"" said Roman Pavlousek, who runs a finance service centre for global industrial manufacturer Atlas (NYSE:ATCO) Copco in the Czech city of Brno. ""This is happening."" 
Indeed, more than 90% of business services companies in the Czech Republic have continued to recruit during the pandemic, with 12% winning extra work from the Asia-Pacific region, according to a survey by the Czech branch of the Association of Business Services Leaders trade body.
While service centres in Asia can offer lower costs, Central and Eastern Europe offers geographical and time-zone proximity to western Europe and North America, with a deep pool of multi-lingual workers, business leaders told Reuters. 
The region has drawn a host of big names, from Air France-KLM's BlueLink International to  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM). It also boasts expertise in automation, robotics and artificial intelligence - areas where corporate decision makers are increasingly looking to expand, the leaders said.
In Poland, emerging Europe's biggest economy, business services companies have also kept the ""For Hire"" sign out as they continue to bring in new employees.
Iwona Dudzinska, managing director at Citibank Europe's service centre in Poland, said the crisis had not slowed its growth plans.
""We are hiring around 100 people every month and conducting recruitment online,"" she told Reuters.
'ALL ABOUT TIMING'
The business services sector has grown from almost nothing 25 years ago to an industry employing nearly 750,000 workers across Central and Eastern Europe, and it is rapidly expanding, said Romek Lubaczewski, a partner at PwC, who predicted a short-term bump in the road for the sector. 
""It is all about timing,"" he added. ""This crisis has shown that more things can be done remotely and this will benefit the region in the medium to longer term.""
Lubaczewski lives in the bustling university town of Krakow, whose 85,000 employees in the sector makes it Europe's biggest business services centre hub.
 Pepsico  (NASDAQ:PEP), Shell (LON:RDSa),  State Street  (NYSE:STT) and other international companies have set up shop in the southern Polish city, tapping into a multinational workforce able to deliver complex services in numerous languages.
""When you are sitting in a country that doesn't speak English, central Europe holds a massive advantage,"" Lubaczewski added. 
The novel coronavirus pandemic has devastated global economic activity due to government-imposed lockdowns aimed at containing an outbreak that has led to more than 4.2 million infections and over 285,000 deaths.
The Czech report from the Association of Business Services Leaders found that most companies see new business opportunities arising from the crisis as customers restructure, cut costs and look for new ways to do business.
""The opportunities we are talking about lay in the fact we are in the business of centralizing activities, finding synergies and running efficiencies,"" said Pavlousek, who runs Atlas Copco's services centre. 
RISK MODELLING
Pawel Michalik, managing director of ING Tech Poland, said the pandemic would result in multinationals looking to outsource or offshore services in new areas.
""This is something that will affect the entire industry, and it will definitely have a positive impact on business service centres in the region,"" he told Reuters.
""Banks may be more willing to outsource certain services such as risk modelling and regulatory reporting,"" he said. ""We launched such services last year in Warsaw and we will probably develop them faster than we originally planned."" 
The region's business services sector has been able to adapt to the requirements of national lockdowns better than most industries around the world.
Given the digital nature of their work, two-thirds of the sectors employees in Poland were able to work from home even before the COVID-19 pandemic. Now with far more than that number away offices, companies aim to keep many workers at home even once the crisis passes, according to the national Association of Business Services Leaders.
A widely expected increase in digitalization and a smaller emphasis on face-to-face contact by companies around the world, even after the pandemic, will further benefit Central Europe as a services hub, business leaders and analysts said.

""It's going to be a chance for more companies to move work here as they are closing down their main operations in other more expensive countries,"" said one worker at UBS in Krakow. ""It's happening, it's going to accelerate.""

512,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 13, 2020 02:09AM ET</span>","Tesla Can Reopen California Plant With New Measures, County Says","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. can begin preparing for a restart of its only U.S. car plant as soon as next week, a California county said, a boon for the automaker that had threatened to flaunt authorities’ orders to keep the factory shut.
Health officers for Alameda County said on Twitter late Tuesday that a reopening can happen if Tesla adopts extra recommendations to battle the coronavirus in its safety plans. Tesla had sent Alameda a new plan for meeting criteria to reopen on Monday.
The health department said it held “productive discussions” with Tesla and reviewed its safety and prevention plans, and will allow additional approved activities for local businesses including Tesla on May 18, provided data shows progress with containing the virus.
Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had said Monday that Tesla would restart production at the plant in Fremont and flout county officials who had ordered the company to keep the factory closed. Earlier on Tuesday, he thanked President Donald Trump for endorsing his reopening of the factory.
“California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,” Trump wrote in a tweet Tuesday. “It can be done Fast & Safely!”
The county and six other San Francisco Bay area municipalities had decided in late April to extend their restrictions on businesses through the end of May to battle the spread of the coronavirus. While California Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week he would let manufacturers in parts of the state reopen starting May 8, he also said local authorities could keep stricter measures in place.
Overnight, Musk sent an email to employees: “Just wanted to send you a note of appreciation for working hard to make Tesla successful. It is so cool seeing the factory come back to life and you are making it happen!!” he wrote in the message seen by Bloomberg News.
When asked on Twitter how Monday went at the factory, Musk replied Tuesday: “Great.” Tesla’s shares fell 0.2% in New York trading Tuesday. The stock has almost doubled this year.
Two workers who have returned to work at the plant said they were required to watch a safety-training video. One said the company handed out masks and had put up plexiglass stations in the break room. Another said plastic curtains hang from the ceiling as barriers to keep workers separated from one another, and that the carmaker is taking employees’ temperature using thermal scanners.
Musk’s emailed words of encouragement to staff followed tweets in which he claimed Tesla would move its headquarters and future programs to Nevada or Texas and may even cease manufacturing in California. To follow through on those threats, the CEO would have to uproot many of the roughly 20,000 employees the carmaker has in the San Francisco Bay area. About half of the company’s headcount is at the factory.
He wrote Saturday that Tesla would decide whether to keep manufacturing in Fremont based on how Tesla is treated in the future.
After prevailing in a defamation suit and emerging mostly unscathed from a court fight with the Securities and Exchange Commission last year, Musk is waging another legal battle. This time, he’s tangling with health officials over measures to contain a virus that he downplayed starting in January.
Musk has claimed Covid-19 isn’t all that viral a disease, called panic about it “dumb” and theorized fatality rates are overstated. He’s also promoted the antimalarial drugs President Donald Trump embraced that haven’t proved effective and wrongly predicted that new cases would be close to zero by the end of April.
What Bloomberg Opinion Says
Reopening a for-profit plant — and potentially endangering workers — for the sole purpose of making money isn’t a situation where morality should trump the law. And it should go without saying that it would create a truly terrible precedent if corporations could just ignore laws that they consider to be in violation of their corporate interests.
--Noah Feldman, columnist

Tesla’s standoff with California has come to represent the tense debate playing out in states and counties across America over how fast businesses should be allowed to reopen. The nation’s top infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci, warned against reopening the economy too soon during a Senate hearing Tuesday, saying that doing so risks new coronavirus outbreaks throughout the U.S.
Trump’s supportive Twitter post followed words of encouragement that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin offered to Musk on Monday.
“He’s one of the biggest employers and manufacturers in California,” Mnuchin told CNBC. “California should prioritize doing whatever they need to do to solve those health issues so that he can open quickly and safely.”
Kimbal Musk, a Tesla director and Elon’s brother, shared a story on Mnuchin’s remarks with his more than 107,000 followers. “Only California and @GavinNewsom⁩ could make me a Trump fan,” he wrote.

Companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) are now expected to report a decline of 46.7% in second-quarter earnings, down from a drop of 44.9% forecast the week before.
For the third quarter, analyst expectations are now set for a 35.1% fall in earnings versus 32.7% a week ago.
While many governments in Europe have announced or started to adopt strategies to gradually ease lockdowns to contain the epidemic, there is little hope the economy will bounce back, let alone return to normal, before the first quarters of 2021.
The last three quarters of 2020 are expected to see STOXX 600 earnings fall by 16.4%, before bouncing back to 27.9% for the first quarter of next year.

Following a three-year spell of tumbling profits, Nissan will announce its restructuring plan on May 28, its latest attempt to slash costs after a strategy of aggressive selling to chase market share has pummelled its bottom line.
The Japanese automaker plans to slash fixed costs in areas that include marketing and research, Bloomberg reported, citing unnamed sources. It added that the company's board has not yet reviewed the plans.
Most automakers are preparing for a big financial hit from the coronavirus, but Nissan's sales and profits were falling even before the outbreak, forcing it to roll back the aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn.
Phasing out Nissan's lower-cost Datsun brand, which has been struggling in Asian and Russian markets, and closing down an additional vehicle production line are also among measures being considered, the report said.
A Nissan spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
Since Ghosn's arrest in Japan on charges of financial wrongdoing in 2018, Nissan has struggled to turn around its ousted leader's aggressive growth strategy, which has left the company with a cheapened brand and underutilised vehicle plants that have drained its finances.

Reuters has reported that the automaker has acknowledged that it must become a smaller, more efficient automaker, and that it aims to restore dealer ties and refresh lineups to regain pricing power and profitability.

Despite itself also being hard hit by the collapse in travel due to the COVID-19 virus, Qatar Airways can help and would be willing to provide the injection if asked. 
The Qatari flag carrier owns a 9.99% stake in Cathay and previously expressed interest in increasing its share. Cathay’s two other main shareholders are Swire Pacific (OTC:SWRAY) and Air China (OTC:AIRYY), holding 45% and 29.99% stakes respectively.

516,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 12:30AM ET</span>","Mitsubishi halves SpaceJet development budget, reconsiders U.S. variant","(Reuters) - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) said it was halving the annual development budget for Japan's first regional jet in half a century, the M90 SpaceJet, as the coronavirus pandemic squeezes profits.
Japan's leading heavy machinery maker also said on Monday that it would review proposals to offer a shorter variant of the aircraft, the M100, in the lucrative U.S. market 
""We have to reconsider how we move forward,"" Mitsubishi Heavy Chief Executive Officer Seiji Izumisawa said during a press briefing to announce the company's latest results. 
The SpaceJet budget this business year will be around half of the 141 billion yen it spent in the year that ended March 31, he said. 
Built by the Mitsubishi Aircraft Corp subsidiary, the first 90-seat SpaceJet is slated for delivery to Japanese carrier ANA Holdings (T:9202) from April, eight years after the aircraft was originally slated to go into operation. 
Mitsubishi Heavy, Japan's leading aerospace company and partner to  Boeing Co  (N:BA), posted an operating loss of 29.5 billion yen on Monday after racking up a 263 billion yen deficit from impairment losses and development costs at its regional jet unit, triple the previous year.
The decision to dial back spending on its regional aircraft program comes as the coronavirus pandemic severely curtails air travel and raises questions over the viability of airlines around the world. 
Any halt to the SpaceJet program could end Japan's ambition to establish its aerospace industry as more than a parts supplier.
""This immediately raised questions whether MHI may kill the M100 program. To do so will squander MHI's once-in-a-lifetime chance to become a real global power in commercial aviation,"" Scott Hamilton, an analyst at Leeham Co, said in a blog.
The cut to development spending by Mitsubishi Heavy, which has agreed to buy Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF) Inc's (TO:BBDb) regional jet program for $550 million, comes after Boeing last month pulled out of a $4.2 billion deal to buy the bulk of Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial jet unit. 

The U.S. planemaker said the Brazilian regional jet maker had failed to meet conditions for closing the deal. Embraer accused Boeing of scuppering the agreement because of financial problems resulting in part from the coronavirus pandemic.

Air passengers numbered 16.72 million in April, Xiong Jie, a spokesman of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told an online news conference. That compared with a decline of 71.7% on the year in March, when passengers numbered 15.13 million. 
China's tourism sector showed encouraging signs of recovery over the May Day holiday with 115 million trips made, many by car and by younger people emerging from weeks of virus lockdown measures.
More than 30% of capacity has returned in the Chinese domestic market in the last two months, aviation data provider Cirium said on Tuesday.
But the number of passenger flights in China has not yet recovered to 60% of the levels seen in past years, Jin Junhao, another CAAC official, sadi during Wednesday's conference. 
China faces a growing risk of second-wave infections as the health authority reported a few clusters in the central city of Wuhan and the northeast, spurring reimposition of tough movement curbs in some parts of affected cities.

SEOUL (Reuters) - More than a hundred shoppers waited in line to enter a store of French luxury brand Chanel in Seoul on Wednesday, as they rushed to buy products in the hope of beating price increases expected to kick in later in the week.
This came even after more than 100 new COVID-19 cases linked to nightclubs in Seoul have brought fears of a second wave of infections in a country held up as a coronavirus mitigation success story.
With some arriving as early as 5 a.m., the shoppers wearing face masks snaked around the Lotte Department Store in downtown Seoul ahead of the opening at 10:30 a.m., while store workers issued numbered tickets online to keep order. 
Lee Ji-yeon, 54, said she arrived at the store about 7:30 am and that her future son-in-law is waiting at another department store to buy a Chanel bag for her daughter as a wedding present. There are several months ahead of the wedding, which has been pushed back from November to March because of the virus.
""We've been to the Chanel store several times before and agonising whether to buy it or not. But since the prices are going to increase, we decided to buy it now,"" Lee said. 
Many South Koreans gift luxury bags for weddings. Also in line was a man who said he would buy a Chanel bag for his girlfriend as a present for a wedding, which has been pushed back from April to late this year because of the virus. 
""I wanted to buy before price rises. It is burdensome to buy it during the economic downturn, but I would not be able to buy it later because prices would rise every year,"" he said, asking not to be identified.

Chanel public relations in Seoul said its headquarters in France raised prices on Monday, and that prices will increase in all of its markets.

Investing.com – Asian stocks were mixed on Wednesday morning, but mostly continuing their retreat from Tuesday. 
Investors continued to exercise caution as a second wave of COVID-19 cases emerged in China and South Korea. 
South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.05%, reversing earlier losses, by 10:51 PM ET (3:51 AM GMT). The country’s statistics office reported the biggest month of job losses in more than two decades. 
The number of jobs in April fell by 476,000 from the same month in 2019. 
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index also reversed earlier losses to gain 0.08%.  
Meanwhile, Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 0.81% and the ASX 200 slipped 0.78%. China’s Shanghai Composite was down 0.19% and the Shenzhen Component was down 0.39%. 
Chinese e-commerce giant Tencent is due to release its first quarter earnings later in the morning. China will also release April industrial production and retail sales data on Friday. 
The U.S. Federal Reserve also had their say, with several regional presidents making speeches ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s address later in the day. 
The Fed could increase the amount of capital that Wall Street Banks need to maintain during the COVID-19 epidemic, curtailing their ability to pay dividends, Governor Randal Quarles said on Tuesday.  
St Louis President James Bullard said in a video speech that continued shutdowns ran the risk of a depression. Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari remained hopeful of a “gradual, muted recovery” from the outbreak, whereas Dallas President Robert Kaplan suggested that economy will need more fiscal stimulus if the jobless rate continues to rise. 
Meanwhile, some investors remained wary of a quick recovery. 
“Markets’ positive take on the recovery, after unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, will be put to the test,” Alexander Kraemer, head of cross-asset strategy at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY), told Bloomberg. 
“Market participants await confirmation that the economy will indeed start to return to normalcy” in the second half of the year. "

""The framework around the development of an IR has made our goals there unreachable,"" Sands Chairman Sheldon Adelson said in the press release. 
The move comes after the casino operator in January expressed its bullishness on Japan and put on magic shows and Broadway musical numbers to drum up enthusiasm for the industry at an exhibition in Yokohama. 
Japan wants to build several integrated resorts - Las Vegas-style complexes that include casinos, shopping arcades and conference centres - although a bribery scandal has hardened public opposition to the plans. 
The government has authorised licences for three integrated resorts and has been expected to receive bids officially from interested cities in 2021. 

Potential bidders include Yokohama, Tokyo, Osaka - Japan's three largest cities - and smaller cities including Nagasaki and Wakayama.

Canadian Natural (NYSE:CNQ) Resources Ltd (TO:CNQ),  Cenovus Energy  Inc (TO:CVE),  Suncor Energy  Inc (TO:SU), and  Imperial Oil Ltd  (TO:IMO) were excluded from the fund due to ""unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions"", Norges Bank said in a statement https://www.norges-bank.no/en/news-events/news-publications/News-items/2020/2020-05-13-spu.
The decision was based on recommendations from the Council on Ethics, the fund's ethics watchdog, because of the companies' carbon emissions from production of oil to oil sands, the central bank said.
Carbon emissions became a criterion for exclusion from the fund four years ago, and in 2017 the Council on Ethics recommended ""a small handful"" of firms be blacklisted for producing too much greenhouse gas emissions in either the oil, cement and steel sectors.
Norges Bank also excluded three other companies - Egypt's ElSewedy Electric Co, Brazilian iron ore miner Vale SA (SA:VALE3), and Brazilian power holding Eletrobras (SA:ELET6) - for causing severe environmental damage.
Vale declined to comment, while the four Canadian firms did not respond to requests for a comment after market hours. Eletrobras and ElSewedy could not immediately be reached.
The central bank said it took a long time to sell shares of several of the blacklisted companies in a reasonable manner due to the ""market situation, including liquidity in individual shares.""
The fund, formally called the Government Pension Fund Global and set up in 1996 to save petroleum revenues for future generations, has grown to almost three times Norway's annual gross domestic product, far exceeding original projections.

522,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>",Uber approaches Grubhub with acquisition offer: sources,"By Greg Roumeliotis, Akanksha Rana and Lisa Baertlein
(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc is in negotiations to buy online food delivery company Grubhub Inc in an all-stock deal, according to people familiar with the matter.
A merger could give Uber Eats' money-losing restaurant delivery service a leg up on market leader DoorDash at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has upended Uber's core business of shuttling people from place to place.
Uber and Grubhub are still haggling over the deal's stock exchange ratio, and there is no certainty that they will reach an agreement, the sources said.
The potential acquisition suggests that the Silicon Valley disruptor is doubling down on its fastest-growing service in a scramble to adapt to what is likely to be a long business interruption.
""This would be an aggressive move by Uber to take out a major competitor on the Uber Eats front and further consolidate its market position,"" Wedbush analysts said in a client note. 
It could turn the crowded ""U.S. meal delivery market into a two-horse race,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said. 
Shares of Grubhub closed up 13.6% at $60.39, while Uber's gained rose 2.4% to $32.40.
An Uber spokesman said the company does not respond to ""speculative M&A."" Grubhub, in a statement, did not confirm the talks but said ""consolidation could make sense in our industry.""
Experts say consolidation is long overdue in the space, where demand from worried, home-bound consumers is surging. 
DoorDash had a 42% share of meal delivery sales in March 2020, versus 20% for Uber Eats and 28% for Grubhub, data from analytics firm Second Measure showed.
""If you can't beat 'em, eat 'em,"" said Jesse Reyes, chief executive of J-Curve Advisors, who advises venture capital and private equity funds.
FEEDING FRENZY?
The value of the deal was undisclosed.
Grubhub had a market capitalization of about $4.3 billion, while Uber was valued at nearly $55 billion as of Monday's close, according to Refinitiv data.
Bloomberg News first reported on the deal talks earlier on Tuesday.
Uber ""can wait a bit longer and probably get them cheaper. But it could be that you have a lot cats circling the same bowl,"" Reyes said.
Uber Eats' first-quarter revenue soared more than 50% to $819 million after restaurants across the country shuttered their dining rooms to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
The service, available in more than 6,000 cities worldwide, has been a drag on Uber's bottom line since its 2014 inception due to heavy spending on customer promotions and driver incentives. 
Uber in January sold its Indian food business to local rival Zomato and earlier this month closed Eats operations in eight countries.
Last week, Grubhub said the restaurant industry was facing enormous challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, and vowed to use nearly all of its second-quarter profits to help drum up business for its restaurant partners.
Those comments came amid growing concern from lawmakers and the restaurant industry about the negative influences of so-called ""gig economy"" companies.
Democratic U.S. Representative David Cicilline, of Rhode Island, who chairs the House Antitrust Subcommittee, said the deal underscores the need for the merger moratorium that he and his colleagues have been calling for.
""Uber is a notoriously predatory company that has long denied its drivers a living wage. Its attempt to acquire Grubhub - which has a history of exploiting local restaurants through deceptive tactics and extortionate fees - marks a new low in pandemic profiteering,"" he said.
Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, said Grubhub and other big delivery platforms continue to increase rates, control valuable customer data, and use sophisticated techniques and discounts to funnel customers to their own websites instead of those of their partner restaurants.
""Further consolidation of the industry poses significant concerns,"" Rigie said.
Antitrust experts said the deal, if signed, would likely win approval from regulators.
""I think this deal is doable. It does not seem to me to be an excess of concentration,"" said Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel. ""Probably the restaurants will not like it and will express concern but I don't think that will carry the day.""
Other experts told Reuters they expected a lengthy review.

523,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Neiman Marcus creditor calls for deal with Saks Fifth Avenue - letter,"By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - Hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management LP asked Neiman Marcus Group's independent directors on Tuesday to explore a combination with rival department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, challenging the company's plan to reorganize under bankruptcy protection.
A lawyer for Mudrick, which holds portions of Neiman Marcus's roughly $5 billion of debt, wrote in a letter to the directors that a sale or merger with Saks would result in better financial recoveries for creditors than the company's current plan to restructure and hand control to senior lenders.
Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] filed for bankruptcy last week after prolonged store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in plunging sales. 
The letter, reviewed by Reuters, suggests that combining the two luxury retailers would create between $2.8 billion and $4.7 billion of value. That could ultimately be achieved by Neiman Marcus using bankruptcy proceedings to permanently close at least 22 stores in nearby or overlapping locations to its rival. That and other cost savings could boost the combined retailer's earnings, the letter said.
Saks owner Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Co in 2017 explored a Neiman Marcus takeover but did not ultimately pursue it, Reuters previously reported. Hudson's Bay has remained interested in Neiman Marcus, according to sources familiar with the matter, but has not yet made a formal bid for the company.
Representatives for Mudrick, Neiman Marcus and HBC declined to comment.
Hudson's Bay was taken private in March by shareholders that include Chief Executive Richard Baker, and it is also grappling with financial fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. 
Neiman Marcus Chief Executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck told Reuters in an interview last week that the company is focused on reorganizing and that a deal with Saks is not at the top of its priority list, though he did not rule it out. 
Neiman Marcus has negotiated a plan with most of its creditors to cancel about $4 billion of debt in exchange for handing control of the company to senior lenders led by Pacific Investment Management Corp, Sixth Street Partners and Davidson Kempner Capital Management.
PIMCO and Sixth Street declined to comment while Davidson Kempner could not immediately be reached. 
These investment firms are also providing a $675 million financing package to aid the company's operations while it navigates bankruptcy proceedings, which a federal judge approved on an interim basis over Mudrick's objection. 
The lenders hold the lion's share of Neiman Marcus's senior debt, giving them significant sway over whether the company's reorganization plan is approved. Their agreement would likely be needed before Neiman Marcus attempted to explore a sale in lieu of the current plan. 
An auction could also be time-consuming while Neiman Marcus is struggling. Neiman Marcus expects to burn through hundreds of millions of dollars in cash through at least the end of July.

Mudrick's letter said other creditors are hamstrung in agitating for a sale given they have signed a so-called restructuring support agreement associated with Neiman Marcus's bankruptcy case. The company's executives could be concerned about losing their jobs in a merger, and Neiman Marcus's private equity owners are keen to move on from their failed investment, the letter said.

SGX Nifty 50 Index futures for May delivery rose 2.5% as of 9:34 a.m. in Singapore. The package amounts to 10% of the nation’s gross domestic product, Modi said in a televised address to the nation, without giving details. The figure includes more than 5.5 trillion rupees of measures already unveiled by the government and the central bank.
The headline number of the package at 10% of GDP is impressive, Mahesh Nandurkar, a strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) Financial Group Inc. wrote in a note Tuesday. “The incremental package would be 5%+ of GDP” and part of that could be restatement of the existing government schemes, the note added.
Before Tuesday’s announcement, the government had committed less than 1% of GDP, lower than many major economies, to contain the damage from the pandemic, even as economic data deteriorated and virus infections increased in an already fragile economy.
India’s key stock indexes posted their worst losses on record in March as the world’s second-most populous nation went into lockdown, and have since rebounded by about 20% from those lows.
The Reserve Bank of India has since March injected more than $50 billion into India’s economy, or more than 3.2% of GDP, while Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had offered $22.5 billion of aid on March 26.

525,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>","Musk, Texas governor talk about potential Tesla move to Lone Star state","By Brad Brooks
AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas Governor Greg Abbott said on Tuesday that he spoke with Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA), in recent days about a potential move of the company's electric vehicle assembly plant to the Lone Star state.
Abbott's remarks came just came three days after Musk threatened to move Tesla's headquarters and future operations to either Texas or Nevada, after officials in the California county where Tesla's only U.S. vehicle factory is located said the plant could not reopen because coronavirus lockdown measures remained in place.
Abbott said during an interview with the Wichita Falls CBS affiliate that he thinks Texas is a perfect fit for Tesla (O:TSLA). A spokesman for Abbott confirmed to Reuters the governor spoke with Musk over the weekend. 
""I've had the opportunity to talk to Elon Musk and he's genuinely interested in Texas and genuinely frustrated with California,"" Abbott said. ""We've just got to wait and see how things play out."" 
Abbott did not provide details of the conversation. John Wittman, the governor's communications director, said there was not yet any discussion of incentives to entice Tesla away from California.
Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Musk last Thursday had told employees that limited production would restart at the Tesla factory in Fremont, after California Governor Gavin Newsom said that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen under an easing of coronavirus containment measures. But officials in Alameda County, where Fremont is located, said its own lockdown measures had not been lifted and the factory could not yet reopen.
Musk on Saturday tweeted: ""If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future."" 
President Donald Trump weighed in on Tuesday, tweeting that California should let Tesla get back to work.
On Monday, Musk said production was resuming at the factory in defiance of the county order and that if anyone had to be arrested, it should be him. On Tuesday, employee parking lots that were deserted on Friday were packed with cars. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.
Musk is no stranger to Texas. His SpaceX spacecraft manufacturer has a launch site in the southern tip of the state near the village of Boca Chica. 
Richard Cortez, the top executive in Hidalgo County just to the west of the SpaceX launch site, urged Musk in a letter to consider the area for Tesla, saying the region's heavy presence of automotive plants straddling the U.S.-Mexico border could quickly meet the electric car maker's needs. 
Cortez, in an interview with Reuters, underscored that manufacturing plants in his county have never been under any orders to close because of the coronavirus pandemic. 

In addition to its vehicle plant in California, Tesla has a battery plant in Sparks, Nevada, and a factory in Buffalo, New York, that produces solar panels and other energy generation and storage products.

(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) is offering its employees voluntary buyouts over the next two weeks, according to a document seen by Reuters on Tuesday, citing the sharp decline in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic for ""severe dislocations"" in its business.
The Houston-based company last week posted a $2 billion quarterly loss and has slashed capital spending drastically to shore up its balance sheet amid the worst oil-and-gas-industry downturn in 40 years. Occidental said that if spending cuts are not met, it will have ""serious potential consequences"" to the company, the document said.
Energy companies worldwide, including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa), have slashed capital expenditures and oil output to reckon with the collapse in fuel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Interested employees can submit a resignation offer to Occidental through May 26, specifying the number of months of base salary that they will accept for voluntary separation, according to the document. Employees can amend or withdraw offers unless the company has already accepted them by then, the document said. Offers not accepted will expire automatically on June 12.
Occidental declined to comment. 
Occidental has been swiftly cutting expenses to deal with its debt-laden balance sheet following the collapse in oil prices. The company took on a heavy debt load in order to buy Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) last year for $38 billion, a bet on continued growth of U.S. shale oil production. 

It cut its 2020 capex budget on three separate occasions this year, most recently to $2.5 billion from an original plan of $5.3 billion.

527,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",Billionaire Anil Agarwal Explores Buyout of India’s Vedanta,"(Bloomberg) -- Billionaire Anil Agarwal plans to take Indian commodities giant Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) Ltd. private as the tycoon continues to simplify his investments.
The businessman is proposing a price of 87.5 rupees ($1.16) per share to buy the 49.9% he doesn’t own of the company from minority investors, a 9.9% premium over Monday’s closing price, his holding company said in a statement Tuesday. The announcement confirmed an earlier story by Bloomberg News.
Vedanta shares have fallen more than 40% this year, giving the company a market value of about $4.4 billion. Taking the company private is the “next logical step” in its simplification process and will provide more financial flexibility, Vedanta said in the statement.
“Due to the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, we have accelerated the strategy in this challenging environment,” Agarwal said in the statement. “The proposed transaction will transform the group’s credit profile while offering a fair exit price to minority shareholders.”
Vedanta is working with JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co on the plans and the bank is helping the company raise financing for the deal.
Agarwal’s Volcan Investments Ltd. has in the past taken his London-listed Vedanta Resources Ltd. private as the entrepreneur sought to simplify the corporate structure of his resources group. He had said at that time that a London listing was no longer necessary for the company thanks to “the maturity of the Indian capital markets.”
India Tycoon’s $1 Billion Oil Unit Stake Sale Said to Stall
A self-made billionaire, Agarwal has been a prolific dealmaker in the past few years as he sought to grow his metals-to-oil-and-gas empire into a resources conglomerate like BHP Group (NYSE:BHP). Until last year, he was the largest shareholder of  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) Plc, triggering speculation that Agarwal was planning to push for a major change, such as a takeover or breakup. In the end, the tycoon decided to exit his investment because his returns were “achieved even sooner than expected.”
Last year, investors expressed concern over corporate governance at the Mumbai-listed company when its subsidiary Cairn India Holdings Ltd. bought an economic interest in Anglo American from parent Volcan Investments for $200 million. That led to fears that the parent would use more of the company’s cash to serve its funding needs. Vedanta subsequently unwound the trade around the time Agarwal exited his stake in Anglo American.
“Vedanta trades at a huge discount to its intrinsic value given that there were some corporate governance issues which met with serious objections from large institutional shareholders,” Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president at IIFL Securities Ltd. “Possibly he wants to get a fair multiple and he is thinking of withdrawing it because of the sheer low market cap which he gets.”
Agarwal’s fortune has been built on a series of ambitious acquisitions: In 2001, he bought control of then government-owned Bharat Aluminium Co. in one of the first tests of India’s efforts to offload state holdings. He followed that up with the purchase of another government entity, Hindustan Zinc Ltd. He successfully bid for what was India’s largest iron ore producer Sesa Goa Ltd. in 2007 and for Cairn India, despite having no oil and gas experience.

FREMONT, California (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday urged that Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) be allowed to reopen its electric vehicle assembly plant in California, joining CEO Elon Musk's bid to defy county officials who have ordered it to remain closed.
""California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!"" Trump wrote on Twitter. 
On Monday, Musk said production was resuming at the automaker’s sole U.S. vehicle factory, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested, it should be he.
Musk tweeted ""Thank you!"" in response to Trump on Tuesday.
Tesla shares were up 1.1% at $820.44 in late trading.
At Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, employee parking lots that were deserted on Friday were packed with cars on Tuesday. Trucks could be seen driving in and out of the factory grounds.
About a dozen workers, some masked, some not, were seen standing by a red food truck on the factory grounds.
At the factory's outbound logistics parking lot, where only a dozen Tesla cars stood on Friday, hundreds of Tesla vehicles were seen on Tuesday.
The company, which on Saturday sued Alameda County, where the plant is located, over its decision that the plant should stay closed, did not comment on Trump's tweet.
Late on Monday, county health officials said they were aware Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.
A county health official on Friday said the county had asked all manufacturers, including Tesla, to delay operations by at least another week to monitor infection and hospitalization rates.
Scott Haggerty, the Alameda County supervisor for the district where Tesla's factory is located, told the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) on Saturday that the county had been working to permit Tesla to resume operations on May 18 - the same day other U.S. automakers have been permitted to resume production in other states.
Haggerty on Tuesday accused Musk on Twitter of misrepresenting what he had told the newspaper.
Tesla on Saturday released a plan to keep workers returning to the factory safe.
The measures, which include temperature screenings, the installation of barriers to separate work areas and protective equipment for workers, are similar to those set up by Detroit-based automakers General Motors (N:GM), Ford (N:F) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU).
Trump is eager for the U.S. economy to reopen and for Americans to return to work.
He has sparred with California for years over a series of issues, including immigration, vehicle fuel-efficiency standards, funding for high-speed rail and numerous environmental issues. Trump has met with Musk on several occasions during his presidency.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he had spoken with Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder’s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week.
States and cities around the United States are experimenting with ways to reopen their economies safely after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work. 
Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory's closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from Trump.
Tesla also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin. Its lawsuit on Saturday alleged that Alameda County had violated California's constitution by defying Newsom's orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.
Newsom's office did not immediately comment on Tuesday. 

In the past, Musk has discussed opening a second U.S. factory outside California. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.

530,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 07:06PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. airlines tell crews not to force passengers to wear masks,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - The top three U.S. airlines have told their flight attendants not to force passengers to comply with their new policy requiring face coverings, just encourage them to do so, according to employee policies reviewed by Reuters.
 American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) have told employees that they may deny boarding at the gate to anyone not wearing a face covering, and are providing masks to passengers who do not have them, the three carriers told Reuters.
Inside the plane, enforcement becomes more difficult. 
""Once on board and off the gate, the face covering policy becomes more lenient. The flight attendant's role is informational, not enforcement, with respect to the face covering policy,"" American told its pilots in a message seen by Reuters explaining its policy, which went into effect on Monday.
""Bottom line to the pilots: a passenger on board your aircraft who is being compliant with the exception of wearing a face covering is NOT considered disruptive enough to trigger a Threat Level 1 response,"" referring to some kind of intentional disruption by a passenger that could cause the captain to divert the flight.
American spokesman Joshua Freed said: ""American, like other U.S. airlines, requires customers to wear a face covering while on board, and this requirement is enforced at the gate while boarding. We also remind customers with announcements both during boarding and at departure."" 
A United spokeswoman also said that any non-compliance by travelers would be addressed at the gate and that flight attendants had been counseled to use their ""de-escalation skills"" on the aircraft and to reseat any passengers as needed.
Delta said it had a similar policy.
'ENCOURAGE THEM TO COMPLY'
All three airlines offer certain exemptions for young children or people with medical conditions or disabilities, and when people are eating or drinking.
""If the customer chooses not to comply for other reasons, please encourage them to comply, but do not escalate further,"" American told flight attendants in a message on Friday that it provided to Reuters. 
""Likewise, if a customer is frustrated by another customer’s lack of face covering, please use situational awareness to de-escalate the situation,"" it said.
U.S. travel demand has fallen by about 94% in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, prompting carriers to slash their flying schedules to roughly 30% of normal this month. With fewer planes in the skies, some are flying near capacity.
Global airlines body IATA came out last week in favor of passengers wearing masks onboard, as debate intensifies in the United States on the role that government agencies should play in mandating new safety measures for flying before a vaccine is developed.
While major U.S. airlines have individually mandated facial coverings, the Federal Aviation Administration has declined to implement the requirement, and it is not clear if the agency has the authority to compel passengers to wear face masks.
In a statement on Tuesday, the FAA said it would continue to engage in discussions about protecting the health and safety of flight crews and the traveling public and was ""lending aviation expertise to federal public health agencies and airlines as they issue guidance for crew members, including health monitoring, screening protocols and aircraft cleaning.""
Several airline union groups have called for a federal mandate on measures including masks, social distancing and cleaning. 
""Airlines are implementing policies on the fly with essentially no coordination or direction from the federal government,"" said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, representing nearly 50,000 flight attendants at 19 airlines.

""We need federal requirements that mitigate risk during this pandemic and put the safety of crews and the traveling public first.""

531,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 06:36PM ET</span>",A $460 Billion Japan Fund Hunts for Bargains in Emerging Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- For Japan’s Asset Management One Co., the sell-off in emerging-market bonds is overdone and the time is ripe to hunt for some bargains.
The $460 billion money manager is bullish on debt in developing nations, particularly in Mexico. That’s even as Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings have all recently downgraded Mexico’s sovereign rating. It is also overweight on Polish bonds.
“We are very positive about emerging markets as a whole and there is more chance to raise profits by investing in EM bonds this fiscal year in the situation where yields in developed economies are falling,” said Yusuke Ito, a Tokyo-based fund manager at Asset Management, said in an interview.
Asset Management’s bullish call is at odds with global heavyweights such as  Goldman Sachs Group  (NYSE:GS) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. which are trimming risk exposure within their developing-nation debt portfolios amid warnings of a surge in sovereign defaults. Ito says EM bonds will be bought back as global investors reassess economic fundamentals.
“Emerging countries have been hit hard even as their economic fundamentals remain pretty good,” he said. Past crises have seen EM economies raise interest rates to protect their currencies, but this time they have room to lower rates and support their economies, Ito said.
The extra yield offered by developing-nation sovereign bonds over Treasuries has fallen to 572 basis points after surging above 700 basis points in late March, according to a JPMorgan index.
Ten-year notes in Mexico and Poland yield 6.02% and 1.46%, respectively, compared with minus 0.005% in Japan.
“Mexico’s economic fundamentals tend to be underestimated,” Ito said, adding that the nation’s economy is versatile and its industries are competitive.
His comments come after Mexico’s economy suffered its deepest contraction in over a decade during the first quarter.
Italian Debt
The financial-market turmoil triggered by the virus outbreak has driven Japanese funds in general to diversify or take more risks in their foreign-investment portfolio to safeguard returns.
Asset Management One is retaining its overweight position on Italian bonds as they offer a larger spread over German bunds than their Spanish or French peers, which are also popular among Japanese investors, Ito said.
That’s even as UniCredit SpA estimates foreign asset managers and hedge funds’ exposure to Italian government bonds may be around the lowest since December 2018.
Italy’s 10-year yield is climbing for a fourth straight month in May. While weak government finances have continued to weigh, a recent German court ruling that threatens to restrict the European Central Bank’s debt-buying program -- the market’s single-largest source of support -- is adding to investors’ woes. The ECB has still pledged to continue doing everything necessary to revive inflation.
“Europe’s political solidarity often gets highlighted in a crisis, but it’s important that we are seeing a solid commitment from the ECB,” Ito said. It is “most efficient” to keep Italian bonds overweight, he said.
However, Asset Management will be forced to remove Italian bonds from its portfolio if the nation’s sovereign rating falls into the sub-investment grade category and its debt is excluded from broader indexes, Ito said.

532,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 06:25PM ET</span>",Resurgent Wall Street disconnected from reality on the ground,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - With the U.S. economy facing its potentially deepest economic decline in nearly a century, Wall Street is pulling further and further ahead from Main Street.
Trillions of dollars of fiscal and monetary stimulus to dampen the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the U.S. economy and financial markets have sent stocks soaring off their lows, while the worst of the fallout on growth and employment has yet to be felt. 
The following graphics illustrate the disconnect that has developed between the stock market and the reeling U.S. economy. 
The staggering 20.5 million jobs lost in April put the U.S. unemployment rate at 14.7.
(Graphic: S&P 500 surges; disconnect with real economy IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qmypmnqnovr/Pasted%20image%201589207731279.png)
The S&P 500 (SPX) tumbled more than 2% on Tuesday as investors weighed the risk of a second wave of infections against hopes for a reopening of the economy led by easing stay-at-home restrictions. Still, the benchmark has recovered around 30% since hitting March lows, even as wages decline and personal expenditures flatline.
Wall Street has also pulled far ahead of analysts' forecasts for S&P 500 profits.
(Graphic: US stock market shoots ahead of earnings IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/nmopanbnlva/Pasted%20image%201589207916688.png)
Global stocks tell the same story, with the MSCI World index recovering strongly even as global purchasing managers' indexes decline.
(Graphic: Stock market valuations belie real economy IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/yzdpxojoxvx/Pasted%20image%201589208310826.png)
The rebound on U.S. stocks has occurred even as economic indicators come in below economists' expectations.
(Graphic: Stocks disconnected from economic data IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvezxokpr/economic%20surprises.jpg)
Dour economic news in recent weeks has been repeatedly shrugged off by investors, helping Wall Street recover from deep losses that in February ended an 11-year bull market. However, even after its rebound since March 23, the S&P 500 remains down 15% from its record high.
A report from the National Federation of Independent Business on Tuesday showed small business sentiment  slid in April to its lowest level since March 2013. Small businesses are being hit disproportionately hard by prolonged shutdown, and the following graphic shows that while the survey respondents' forward view of the economy improved, sales expectations tumbled.
(Graphic: Small business sentiment IMAGE link: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/bdwvkrqwmpm/nfib.jpg)
A nearly 8% jump in average hourly earnings in Friday's employment data suggests that the millions of jobs recently lost were mostly low-paying. In a potential silver lining, the data also indicated the vast majority of recent job losses were temporary rather than permanent.
(Graphic: Average earnings and hours IMAGE link: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-STOCKS/azgvomzkxvd/earningshours.jpg)
""With 72% of jobs lost being reflected as temporary layoffs, workers should be able to be more seamlessly rehired as the economy reopens. But the longer this pandemic goes on, the more likely that what was temporary becomes permanent,"" BofA Global Research analysts warned in a research note.
Recent data also shows the prime-age workforce is shrinking because of the pandemic, with women taking the biggest hit.
(Graphic: U.S. workforce participation IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkrlezpm/Labor%20force%20participation%20April.jpg)
While many investors are optimistic about the timeline for a U.S. economic recovery, others remain more cautious about how quickly the economy will return to normal, and about whether the worst is over on Wall Street. 
The recent disconnection between economic data and the direction of the stock market reflects broad uncertainty about short-term effects of the coronavirus-related lockdown and investors' willingness to bet the economy will begin to bounce back as quarantines are lifted in stages across the country. 
""My big worry for the market is we have a potential weak spot coming for the market in late May or mid-June because there is going to be this anxiousness that everything should pick up right away,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) in Chicago. ""Right now, we are trading a lot on optimism, let’s be honest. Optimism meeting reality is what is going to happen there.""

The steel-to-submarines group said earlier its operating loss could swell to 1 billion euros ($1.08 billion) in the April to June quarter due to the coronavirus crisis, sending its shares down as much as 13.5%.
In a sign of just how tight the group's financial situation has become, Thyssenkrupp also said it secured a 1 billion euro credit line from German state-owned bank KfW to tide it over until it receives cash from the sale of its elevator division, expected by the end of September.
The ministry spokeswoman told the Rheinische Post: ""On the subject of Thyssenkrupp, the same applies as to all companies: We have put up a historical protective umbrella for companies to give them the best possible support during the corona(virus) crisis and to maintain Germany's economic strength.""
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has agreed a stimulus package worth over 750 billion euros to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, with the government aiming to take on new debt for the first time since 2013.

534,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",The $30 Billion Battle to Fuel Australia’s Post-Covid Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- Never let a crisis go to waste -- Australia’s clean energy industry is championing former White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel’s catchphrase to push for a renewable-powered economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
But their plan to fast-track a pipeline of solar and wind projects in the sun-kissed nation and inject as much as A$50 billion ($32 billion) into the economy faces a formidable opponent in a government-backed fossil fuel industry, which counters that there’s at least that much in natural gas expansion projects awaiting the green light.
Early signs suggest Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s center-right government will be reluctant to cut its strong ties to the resources sector and commit whole-heartedly to de-carbonization, even after one of the worst wildfire seasons on record brought climate change to the fore in one of the world’s biggest per-capita polluters.
The government may find itself increasingly out of step with the rest of the world -- a recent survey led by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz showed strong support among policymakers globally for climate-friendly measures to lead the post-Covid recovery. That movement is being led by the European Union. The region is pushing through a Green Deal strategy that will set out more ambitious targets for greenhouse gas emissions, despite attempts to slow its progress by member states more reliant on fossil fuels.
“Let’s turn this moment of crisis into a moment of opportunity,” John Grimes, head of the Smart Energy Council, a body that promotes the solar and storage industry, said in an interview. “Australia stands out as a global laggard on climate change. For us to flip that and become a global leader would send a huge message to the world.”
Australia has some of the best solar and wind resources on the planet, according to the Clean Energy Council, a Melbourne-based lobby group that proposed the fast-tracking of renewable projects. That comes as Energy Minister Angus Taylor calls for a “gas-fired recovery” to power a revival of the dormant manufacturing base.
The gas industry’s contribution to the economy cannot be underestimated. Australia vies with Qatar for the mantle of the world’s top liquefied natural gas exporter, and the start of several large facilities over the past decade played a major role in the country dodging recession in the wake of the global financial crisis.
However, gas’s potential to drive the recovery could be more limited this time around. The nation’s main oil and gas companies, Woodside (OTC:WOPEY) Petroleum Ltd. and Santos Ltd., have both deferred investment decisions on export-focused growth projects, and are unlikely to progress them until there’s a sustainable recovery in oil prices.
Australia’s manufacturing sector has long complained that the high cost of domestic gas makes it uncompetitive in global terms. With prices down sharply due to this year’s oil market rout, policymakers in Canberra see an opportunity to rebuild fuel-intensive industries such as chemicals and fertilizer production.
The government’s plan is to streamline the environmental approvals process to bring on new resources for the domestic market, such as the Narrabri gas project in New South Wales. Narrabri’s developer Santos has already secured preliminary agreements with industrial customers such as Malaysia’s Perdaman, which plans to build a new ammonium production facility nearby.
In Grimes’s view, the government has “an ideological blind spot” when it comes to clean energy. He questioned the logic of investing in gas when solar and wind already offer a cheaper, greener alternative.
His view is backed by prominent economist Ross Garnaut, who has been leading calls for a de-carbonized economy for more than a decade. Garnaut’s 2019 book “Superpower” argued that Australia’s natural advantages in renewable power give it the potential to be an economic giant in a post-carbon world.
“The costs of accelerating the transition are very low for Australia, and if we do it right, those costs will be negative,” Garnaut told a clean energy summit on May 6. In a zero-emissions world, Australia would be “the natural low cost place” to manufacture aluminum.
Developing so-called green steel, made using hydrogen from renewable power rather than metallurgical coal, could also help to arrest years of decline in that industry, according to a report this week by the Grattan Institute think tank, which identified a A$65 billion export opportunity in green steel production.
“Combine low cost Australian iron oxide with low cost Australian renewable energy and you have globally competitive iron metal,” said Garnaut.

However, the clean energy industry faces its own challenges. Investment in the sector tapered off in 2019, after surging in the two years prior, as policy uncertainty and grid constraints combined to stem the flow of capital. Failure to adopt policies that encourage more renewables into the system means potential gains in energy productivity are being lost, according to a Monash University study.
As the country slowly emerges from its Covid-19 hibernation, the question is whether its leaders have the political will to take a greener path to recovery.
“Federal support is greatly needed if Australia is to make significant improvements in energy productivity,” said Mita Bhattacharya, a senior lecturer in economics at the Monash Business School. “Continuing high dependence on fossil fuels is hampering Australia’s ability to transition to a low carbon dioxide economy.”

In a letter, the officials asked for a state-by-state breakdown of the number of Amazon workers, including those at Whole Foods, who have been infected or died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The letter, led by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, was joined by states including Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington. 
The same group of attorneys general had written to the company in March asking it to improve its paid-leave policy.
On Tuesday, they asked for assurance that Amazon would not retaliate against workers who raise concerns about health and safety issues with management, the media, co-workers or relevant government agencies.
In a statement, Amazon said it is committed to ensuring a safe workplace and has implemented over 150 changes, including distributing face masks to warehouse workers. 
""We’ll continue to invest in safety, pay, and benefits for our teams who are playing an invaluable role in getting items to communities around the world,"" an Amazon spokesperson said on Tuesday. 

In recent weeks, Amazon has fired at least four workers for raising concerns about workplace safety. The company has previously said the workers were let go for violating internal company protocol.

(Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) said on Tuesday it led an investor group making a $43 million investment in Slice, an online delivery platform for local pizza shops across the country.
KKR's investment comes amid a surge in demand for online shopping and delivery services because of the stay-at-home orders and economic shutdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pizzerias, restaurants and other retail shops have been closed to in-person visitors, and have relied on online orders to generate sales.
Slice will use the cash to enhance its online ordering, marketing, payments and other services, which serve more than 12,000 pizza shops across all 50 states, KKR said.
""Slice comes at it from a foundational perspective providing services to allow independent pizza stores to compete with the big four pizza corporations,"" said Jake Heller, co-head of KKR's Technology Growth team in North America.
Venture capital firm GGV Capital and other early investors in Slice also participated in the KKR-led funding round. Slice's valuation following the deal was not disclosed, but the latest investment brings the total amount the company has raised to $82 million, sources said.

538,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",S&P 500 tumbles on fears of virus resurgence in economic reopening,"By Sinéad Carew
New York (Reuters) - The S&P 500 dropped 2% on Tuesday as investors took profits following a warning from the top U.S. infectious disease expert that premature moves to reopen the nation's economy could lead to novel coronavirus outbreaks and set back economic recovery. 
The index suffered its first decline in four sessions as investors weighed the potential for a second wave of virus infections against hopes that easing of stay-at-home restrictions could ignite a recovery in the U.S. economy, which has been severely damaged by the virus. 
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress that the virus, which has already killed 80,000 Americans, was not yet under control and that there would not likely be a treatment or vaccine in place by late August or early September.
""There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control and ... could even set you back on the road to try to get economic recovery,"" Fauci said of premature steps.
And reports of new clusters of coronavirus infections in countries such as China, South Korea and Germany where lockdowns had been lifted appear to have added to worries.
Optimism about an economic recovery and massive stimulus measures have helped the S&P 500 climb about 34% to Tuesday's intraday high from the March 23 low of the pandemic-driven selloff.
""It goes back to science versus the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has been supportive of the market ... What's going to win here?,"" said Phil Blancato, chief executive of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York.
""From the science viewpoint if we open too quickly, we'll just go back to where we were. But if we don't open at all, we have this economic malaise.""
With concerns about potential for declines, participants like Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas, were anxious to lock in their profits. 
""People are very nervous about how the reopening is going to go,"" he said. 
Wall Street's three major averages closed around their session lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 457.21 points, or 1.89%, to 23,764.78, the S&P 500 lost 60.2 points, or 2.05%, to 2,870.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 189.79 points, or 2.06%, to 9,002.55.
The Cboe Volatility Index, known as Wall Street's fear gauge, ended 5.47 points higher at 33.04. It was the biggest one-day point gain for the VIX in more than three weeks.
Among the S&P's 11 major sectors, real estate was the biggest percentage decliner with a 4.3% drop. 
Industrials and financials were the next biggest laggards with respective declines of 2.8% and 2.7%.
Tuesday's data showed that U.S. consumer prices dropped by the most since the Great Recession in April, due to a plunge in demand for gasoline and services including airline travel as people stayed home during the coronavirus crisis.
But prices for food consumed at home rose 2.6% in the largest advance since February 1974, leaving some investors anxious about the prospect of stagflation, if consumers cannot keep up with price increases for essentials. 
""What happens if the cost of essential goods get more expensive and you're not earning enough money. That could become really problematic,"" said Ladenburg Thalmann's Blancato. 
Helping to drag down the financial sector was a 7.8% drop in BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), after its top shareholder PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) said it planned to sell its entire 22% stake in the world's largest asset manager.
Online food delivery company GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) Inc surged 29% after a person familiar with the matter said Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc was in advanced talks to buy the company in an all-stock deal.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.65-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 91 new highs and 42 new lows.

On U.S. exchanges 11.28 billion shares changed hands compared with the 11.36 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

Investing.com – Wall Street fell on Tuesday as optimism in tech stocks faded on rising worries that some states lifting restrictions too soon could spark a second wave of infections and inflict further economic damage.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.89%, or 457 points, the S&P 500 slipped 2.05%, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.06%.
Investor optimism over the reopening of the economy remained cautious as White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress that the virus is not under control yet and raised concerns that some states are reopening businesses too soon, which may lead to further Covid-19 outbreaks.
The warning comes as data from the White House coronavirus task force showed a spike in new infections in the past week, NBC reported, citing leaked data.
Investor sentiment was also hit by renewed U.S.-China jitters after lawmakers introduced a bill that would grant the President Donald Trump permission to hit China with sanctions if the country does not cooperate with the investigation into the Covid-19 outbreak.
With concerns mounting over a second wave of coronavirus infections, investors seemingly reined in their bullish bets on technology, prompting FAANG to turn negative and end the day in the red.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 1.90% even as Citigroup upgraded its price on the tech giant to $1,600 from $1,400.
Healthcare, which had proved resilient in recent sessions on signs of progress on a potential coronavirus vaccine, was pressured by a fall in Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), the front runners in the race to find Covid-19 treatments.
Financials, mostly banks, came under pressure as President Donald Trump exacerbated worries about a negative interest rate environment after calling on the Federal Reserve to deliver deeper interest rate cuts. Over the past few months, the Fed has cut rates to within a quarter-point of zero and policymakers stressed that negative interest rates were not a proven cure for economic crises.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) were down more than 3%.


Trump has been a vocal critic of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and expressed frustrations that the central bank had upped rates too quickly and subsequently trimmed rates too slowly.
Investors will look to Powell's virtual conference slated for Wednesday at 9:00 AM ET for clues on monetary policy. The Fed chief is expected to deliver an economic update, but may take the opportunity to push back against the idea of cutting rates below zero.
The call on the Fed to cut more comes as the central bank got its historic corporate bond-buying program underway -- a move announced in March to avert a credit crisis.
On the economic front, investors continued to digest further evidence the U.S. economy is in crisis as core inflation, which excludes food and energy, recorded consecutive month-on-month declines for only the second time in the series' 63-year history. The last time was 1982, ING said.

The move, which sent shares down nearly 12% on the Nasdaq, comes as the coronavirus pandemic has badly hurt the retail credit and debit card sales processed by the company and its competitors, such as Cielo SA (SA:CIEL3) and  PagSeguro Digital  Ltd (N:PAGS). 
""This year will be very different from what we were anticipating in late 2019,"" Piau told employees in a letter. ""As a nation, we will face difficult times that will affect every Brazilian and business of all sizes.""
Still, he said card transaction volume has recovered a bit in April and early May.
Piau said the company will keep its belt tightened on expenses. ""We have been very diligent in managing costs and expenses, as well as capital expenditures in order to support our profitability,"" he added.
The company said nearly 90% of its workforce is working from home, including most salespeople.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) & Co's analysts said in a note to clients that the layoffs may be important to the company's future. ""We think Stone's highly intensive customer service model leads to much higher personnel expenses than its peers,"" they wrote. StoneCo's workforce grew by 66% last year and personnel accounts for 40% of its total expenses.
The crisis caused by the coronavirus comes amid fierce competition among Brazilian card processors, which led to a price war.
StoneCo made its debut on the Nasdaq in a highly sought-after initial public offering in October 2018, with shares priced at $24, around the same level where they closed on Tuesday.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian lenders want the government to provide up to $2 billion to set up a ""bad bank"" at a time when their heavy pile of soured debt is expected to double in size due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. 
The banks have proposed that the government set up an asset reconstruction company (ARC) to initially buy non-performing loans worth up to a total of 1 trillion rupees ($13.3 billion), the banking industry sources told Reuters.
The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has drafted the proposal and sent it to the government and the Reserve Bank of India for their approval, according to the two bankers plus a third banking industry source. They asked not to be named as the discussions are confidential.
""The government needs to put in anywhere between 100 billion rupees to 150 billion rupees ($1.3 billion-$2 billion) to form the ARC where the bad loans can be transferred,"" said the first source.
The IBA, finance ministry and central bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Indian banks are already grappling with a bad debt pile of 9.35 trillion Indian rupees, equivalent to about 9.1% of their total assets, as of Sept. 30 last year.
The government and bankers are worried that the share of bad loans may double with the economy grinding to a halt during the nationwide lockdown.
The ARC, likely to be named National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd, will be set up for an initial period of 10 years, two of the sources said. A non-performing loan must be worth at least 5 billion rupees to qualify to be bought, they added. 
The ARC would pay the lenders at least 15% of the present net value of the loans it buys in cash, while the remaining would be paid in the form of security receipts, the two sources said. 
The receipts can be redeemed by the banks once the account has been settled or sold to other investors in the secondary market, the people added. 
Additionally, a separate asset management company and an alternate investment fund would also be created in which banks and other private companies could participate by managing the stressed assets to secure better valuations, the sources added.
""The initial discussions have been encouraging but the plan will succeed only with the government's blessings,"" said the first source.

The U.S.-based restaurant chain said it would reopen 30 restaurants in the UK and Ireland, offering services through the drive-through lane from May 20. Meanwhile, it will open 15 pilot restaurants in south-east England on Wednesday but offer services only through delivery via Uber (NYSE:UBER) Eats.
McDonald's said https:// it would cap spend in their drive-throughs at 25 pounds ($30.70) per car, while also encouraging customers to opt for contactless payment methods.
It also said the restaurants would have reduced menu and hours and that service may not be as quick as pre-pandemic levels because of reduced staffing and social distancing measures in kitchens.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in a televised address on Sunday, announced a limited easing of restrictions, including allowing people to exercise outside more often and encouraging some people to return to work.
Coffee chain  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) said on Monday it would begin a phased reopening of 150 of its drive-thru locations and some takeaway-only stores in the United Kingdom, starting Thursday onwards.

552,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",U.K. Employers Told to Protect Staff From Virus or Be Prosecuted,"(Bloomberg) -- U.K. employers have been told they face prosecution if they fail to comply with rules designed to keep staff safe from coronavirus as they return to work.
“Employers have a duty to keep employees safe in the workplace -- that is absolutely enshrined in law,” Business Secretary Alok Sharma said at a press briefing from Downing Street on Tuesday.
The government is trying to encourage people who can’t work from home to return to their workplaces from Wednesday as it seeks to reopen the economy. That effort depends partly on people believing that it’s safe to go back amid the threat of a second wave of the virus. Sharma has been working with labor unions and business groups to set guidelines for employers.
Sarah Albon, who runs the Health and Safety Executive, said firms that breach Covid-19 rules could ultimately be prosecuted. “Inspectors can require businesses to do certain things,” including issuing enforcement notices requiring them to take action, she said. “Breach of those kind of enforcement notices is essentially a criminal offense, and we can prosecute people who fail to do the right thing.”
Maximum penalties for breaching U.K. health and safety rules include unlimited fines or prison.

Investing.com – The Dow fell on Tuesday as the rally in tech stocks cooled and worries that some states are lifting restrictions too soon weighed on sentiment.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.62%, or 151 points, the S&P 500 fell 0.65%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.22%.
Investor optimism over the reopening of the economy remained cautious as White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress that the virus is not under control yet and raised concerns that some states are reopening businesses too soon, which may lead to further Covid-19 outbreaks.
The warning comes as data from the White House coronavirus task force showed a spike in new infections in the past week, NBC reported, citing leaked data.
As the toll of U.S. coronavirus deaths topped 82,000, with as many as 1.4 million infected, investor focus on drugmakers' efforts to find Covid-19 therapies and vaccines has intensified.
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) and  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA), the front runners in the race to find Covid-19 treatments, gave up some of their gains from a day earlier, keeping a lid on gains in the broader healthcare sector.
Technology, meanwhile, pared gains to trade roughly unchanged, with the bulk of FAANG turning negative.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) fell 0.58% even as  Citigroup  upgraded its price on the tech giant to $1,600 From $1,400.
Financials, mostly banks, came under pressure as President Donald Trump exacerbated worries about a negative interest rate environment after calling on the Federal Reserve to deliver deeper interest rate cuts.
Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) were down more than 2%.


Trump has been a vocal critic of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and expressed frustrations that the central bank had upped rates too quickly and subsequently trimmed rates too slowly.
The call on the Fed to cut more comes as the central bank got its historic corporate bond-buying program underway -- a move announced in March to avert a credit crisis.
On the economic front, investors continued to digest further evidence the U.S. economy is in crisis as core inflation, which excludes food and energy, recorded consecutive month-on-month declines for only the second time in the series' 63-year history. The last time was 1982, ING said.

554,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",U.S. federal court to consider payout suit brought by RBS whistleblower,"By Michelle Price and Sinead Cruise
WASHINGTON D.C./LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. Second Circuit Appeals Court will on Tuesday consider arguments by an ex-Royal Bank of Scotland employee who is suing the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission for a bounty he says he is owed under a whistleblower program.
The suit brought by former RBS (LON:RBS) risk manager Victor Hong could result in a landmark ruling if the court finds the agencies broke the law, or force them to reconsider his case or produce documents that may shed light on how they handled it.
In February, Hong filed a petition with the court alleging the agencies flouted the law ""in bad faith"" when assessing whether he was due a payout for helping federal probes into the British bank's mis-selling of mortgage bonds in the run-up to the 2007-08 financial crisis. 
In August 2018, RBS agreed to pay $4.9 billion to end the probes, which were led by the Justice Department. No portion of that fine has ever been deemed eligible for a reward under the whistleblower program, public records show.
Hong has asked the court to compel the SEC and the Justice Department to produce all records relating to the RBS settlement and to deem it eligible for a potential tipster reward, according to the filings, which Reuters has reviewed. 
The Justice Department and SEC have not said publicly why the RBS settlement was deemed ineligible. The SEC declined to comment while the Justice Department did not immediately provide comment.
In a Jan. 30 filing the Justice Department asked that the court dismiss the petition against the agency on the grounds that the SEC was ""the only appropriate respondent"" but the court has yet to grant that request.
REWARDS
Established by the 2010 Dodd Frank Act after the financial crisis, the whistleblower program has resulted in more than $2 billion in penalties and $450 million in rewards, SEC data shows.
Currently, the SEC can reward tipsters whose original information leads to a penalty exceeding $1 million with rewards of between 10% and 30% of the fine. 
It may also pay a reward in related enforcement actions brought by other agencies provided the settlement was based on the same information the tipster originally gave the SEC.
In a March filing, the SEC said it had not considered Hong's argument that the Justice Department settlement was a related enforcement action but could do so if the court were to return the case to the SEC for review. 
The court will consider that option on Tuesday, or it may require the agencies to produce documents on how they handled the case, or conclude that the agencies breached Dodd Frank and force them to process Hong's reward claim.
A former managing director of risk management at RBS' U.S. operations, Hong resigned two months into the job after discovering billions of dollars of mortgage bonds had been mispriced.
He first approached the SEC and Justice Department offering information in December 2007, according to the filings. 
He later met with Justice Department officials in December 2014, and provided testimony and documents, according to the filings which include copies of subpoenas, Hong's formal SEC tip, and emails with Justice Department officials.
The filings suggest Hong's information also ""significantly"" contributed to the success of a separate $5.5 billion settlement RBS agreed with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) in 2017 on behalf of housing finance giants Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) which had bought mortgage bonds from RBS. 
He has asked the court to deem that settlement a related action eligible for a reward. The FHFA did not immediately provide comment.

The SEC may deny claims for a range of reasons, including that the tip did not offer new information or prompt any action.

Sweden's government has launched a package of measures, including loans, guarantees and the partial payment of wages for workers put on short-time work by their employer, aiming to head off a spike in unemployment and to keep companies from going under during the crisis.
But it has said that such money should only be available to companies that do not pay a dividend. 
Volvo had already shelved plans for an extra shareholder payout.

564,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",Italy considers share voting changes to keep companies at home,"By Giuseppe Fonte and Elvira Pollina
ROME (Reuters) - Italy is considering incentives to discourage listed companies from moving abroad and help long-standing Italian shareholders ward off hostile bids, a draft decree seen by Reuters shows.
The scheme, which has still to be finalised, would allow Italian firms to adopt a share scheme that gives investors greater voting sway than warranted by their actual holding, strengthening their control over companies.
Big Italian companies have moved to a holding structure with a legal base in the Netherlands in recent years. In the cases of  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) and  Ferrari  (MI:RACE), this has allowed the Agnelli family, the controlling shareholder, to tighten its grip on the carmakers through a multiple voting share scheme.
Allowing a similar structure in Italy could help the government of the 5-Star Movement and the centre-left PD party make the Milan stock exchange more attractive to many family-led companies, who are reluctant to open up their share capital to outside investors for fear of losing their influence.
""There have been cases in which the decision of Italian listed companies to move abroad was also motivated by the possibility of availing oneself of a legal framework in favour of multi-voting shares,"" a report attached to the draft said.
The draft decree, which was seen by Reuters on Tuesday, would allow the by-laws of listed companies to include a provision for the creation of special shares which would grant a maximum of up to three votes per share.
Such incentives, which would need to be approved by a certain number of minority investors, are part of a 55 billion euro ($60 billion) stimulus package that Rome aims to approve on Tuesday or Wednesday to help its economy cope with the impact of the prolonged coronavirus lockdown.
Existing legislation prohibits listed Italian companies from issuing multiple-voting shares, except in the form of the so-called 'loyalty share scheme' that confers an additional voting right to long-dated shareholders of at least 24 months.
Beverage group  Campari  (MI:CPRI) said last year it planned to move its registered office to the Netherlands.
Meanwhile broadcaster  Mediaset  (MI:MS), controlled by former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's family, is reorganising its domestic and Spanish businesses under a Dutch-based entity to include an enhanced loyalty share scheme.

565,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",The Fed Is Buying ETFs But Mostly Still Hawking a Placebo,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- For financial markets, March 23, 2020, is a day that will go down in history.
On that day, the S&P 500 Index fell to 2,191.86, easily wiping out all the gains since President Donald Trump was sworn into office. It also marked what as of now appears to be the turning point in the coronavirus crisis. Not because of any epidemiological breakthrough, mind you, but rather because the Federal Reserve announced an array of programs in conjunction with the Treasury Department that went above and beyond the response to the 2008 financial crisis. Most notably, the central bank unveiled a facility to buy U.S. corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds tracking that market.
Since then, investment-grade bond issuance has rewritten the history books. Encouraged by the Fed’s backstop, the final week of March catapulted supply to a record $260 billion, only to be topped by April’s $285.6 billion onslaught. The first full week of May brought an additional $93 billion to market. Credit spreads are wider than they were before the pandemic, but on average remain 160 basis points tighter than their March 23 peak.
Remarkably, this all happened without the Fed buying a single corporate bond.
This seven-week period of all talk and no action will end Tuesday, with the New York Fed announcing that its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility will begin buying eligible ETFs invested in corporate debt. It will be the first Fed program using the $454 billion in total equity funding from the federal stimulus law to actually get off the ground.
Make no mistake, that’s a milestone in and of itself. These $750 billion corporate credit facilities are new terrain for the central bank, as opposed to purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities that are old hat from the last downturn. To get the program started in less than two months, while juggling several others, is impressive.
Still, it’s worth stepping back to say that the Fed is still mostly offering financial markets a placebo at this point. For better or worse, investors have mostly turned around the fortunes of risky assets entirely on their own.
Consider the Fed’s Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which would buy debt directly from issuers, rather than on the secondary market. The central bank said only that it would start up “in the near future.” Currently, there’s almost no need for it, given the record-breaking barrage of bond sales. According to the term sheet, any eligible bonds or syndicated loans will be subject to a 100-basis-point “facility fee.” The central bank will also only purchase debt due in four years or less, which might be an unappealing option to many companies that are looking to extend maturities over the coming decades. Just on Monday,  PayPal Holdings Inc  (NASDAQ:PYPL). and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co. priced 30-year securities, joining a broader trend in the credit markets.
Relatedly, the terms for the Fed’s Municipal Liquidity Facility are also seen as overly constraining. As Bloomberg News’s Amanda Albright and Danielle Moran reported, even states and localities with top credit ratings would pay an extra 150 basis points above an overnight indexed swap rate to borrow. The Bond Dealers of America, in an April letter to the central bank, suggested a pricing penalty of benchmark index rates plus 10 basis points for double-A borrowers. Some state finance officials were taken aback:
Ben Watkins, Florida’s director of bond finance, said he was surprised by the pricing levels released by the Fed, thinking originally they were going to be lower. He said the rates may deter eligible issuers from tapping the facility and support the view of the Fed as a backstop if the market isn’t working properly.
“From an issuers perspective the first thing we ask ourselves is: ‘What is the cheapest source of funding?’ and that is what you go to every time,” Watkins said.
The question for bond traders is whether they’re comfortable being the cheapest source of funding for strapped cities and companies at this point in the coronavirus crisis. If the Fed’s facilities truly are meant as a last resort, rather than an additional source of large-scale buying power, is that consistent with the current yield levels in credit markets?
I contemplated this question of “buy the rumor, sell the news” in a column two weeks ago. Since then, the largest ETF tracking the investment-grade market, known by its ticker LQD, has only fallen further. It declined on Monday to the lowest level since April 8, the day before the Fed widened its corporate-bond buying facilities to include “fallen angels” and high-yield ETFs. It jumped in early trading on Tuesday. The largest muni ETF (ticker: MUB) is also lower than it was a month ago, with some $2.5 billon of deals considered “day to day” in a sign that issuers are skeptical of market conditions.
“We’re no longer in a market of panic, so participants can decide on a relative value basis whether they want to own investment-grade corporates or not,” David Schawel, chief investment officer at Family Management Corp., told Bloomberg’s Molly Smith and Katherine Greifeld. The same appears to be the case for munis.
And yet, according to an agreement with BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK)., the secondary-market credit facility will buy corporate bonds and ETFs in three stages: a “stabilization” phase, an “ongoing monitoring” phase and a “reduction in support” phase. It’s odd to think that a market with back-to-back months of record supply needs any sort of stabilization.
All this feels somewhat circular. The markets aren’t panicked because the Fed has said it will provide a backstop. But so far, it hasn’t had to do much in the way of support. Current pricing and the details of its facilities suggest borrowers may not need — or want — the central bank’s help. Therefore, the backstop could be much smaller than anticipated. The idea that the Fed will suddenly “turbocharge credit” seems misplaced.
In the long run, a light touch from the Fed is probably ideal. But those buying into the red-hot debt markets now should recognize that they’re on their own and understand the central bank’s efforts for what they are — a last resort. If companies and municipalities are flocking to the Fed’s facilities, something has probably gone wrong.

566,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>","Electric car sales in Europe jump, but still just 4% of market","By Edward Taylor
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Registrations of electric cars in Europe jumped 57.4% in the first quarter of 2020, but still only accounted for 4.3% of total registrations, auto industry data showed on Tuesday, as carmakers struggle to meet tough new anti-pollution rules. 
Overall sales of passenger cars in the European Union, United Kingdom and countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) fell by 52.9% in the same period, when many showrooms were closed due to lockdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic, the ACEA auto association said. 
With economies facing deep recessions and consumer confidence plunging, analysts fear it could get harder to persuade drivers to embrace change. Of the 3,054,703 new cars registered in the first three months of the year, 52% were petrol powered and 28% were diesel, the ACEA data showed.
In Germany, Europe's largest car market, showrooms have been open since late April, but demand is massively down and inventory levels unusually high in what is usually the strongest sales period, German dealership association ZDK said.
Demand is down by at least 50% from a year earlier, according to more than half of the 1,357 dealers polled by ZDK. 
Shifting more electric cars will be made harder by the backlog of unsold combustion-engined vehicles.
""There are between 750,000 to 1 million unsold cars sitting in German dealerships, the vast majority of them are conventional petrol and diesel cars,"" ZDK spokesman Ulrich Koester said.
Electric car sales in the EU, UK and EFTA countries reached 130,297 in January-March, ACEA said. 
Germany extended its lead over Norway in terms of new electric car registrations, with a 63.3% rise. Sales in France jumped 145.6%, while Norway's declined 12.4%.
Carmakers need to sell more electric vehicles after EU lawmakers in December 2018 ordered them to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 40% between 2007 and 2021, and then by a further of 37.5% by 2030, or face fines.
Average emissions from new cars should not exceed 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre by 2021. In 2018, the latest year for which statistics are available, the total was 120.4 grams per kilometre, according to the European Environment Agency.
Analysts at PA Consulting have forecast that, based on 2018 fleet average emission levels, manufacturers would need to sell more than 2.5 million extra electric cars, or a sales increase of 1,280% by 2021.
Carmakers are readying new electric and hybrid models to try to meet the targets. 
Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p) said in March 2019 it planned to launch almost 70 new electric models by 2028, starting with its ID3 model which is set to hit showrooms in summer. 
BMW (DE:BMWG) has said it plans to offer 25 electrified models by 2023, with more than half being fully electric and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) plans to offer 12 electrified models by 2021, including both hybrid and full electric vehicles of all types.
However, a lack of charging infrastructure will continue to hamper sales, and electric car sales will not overtake petrol and diesel models in the five largest Western European markets until 2030, forecasters at LMC Automotive have said. 

The ACEA statistics showed quarterly sales of plug-in hybrid cars rose by 126.5% to 97,913 vehicles, with Germany again leading the way with a 258% leap to 26,419 cars.

567,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","Boeing sees zero orders again in April, MAX cancellations mount","By David Shepardson and Ankit Ajmera
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) recorded zero orders for the second time this year in April and customers canceled another 108 orders for its grounded 737 MAX plane compounding its worst start to a year since 1962. 
The company said on Tuesday it delivered just six planes last month, bringing the total to 56 for the first four months of 2020, down 67% from a year earlier, as it battles the biggest crisis in its history.
The global aviation sector has been among the worst hit as lockdowns enforced worldwide to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus have decimated demand for air travel and forced airlines to hold back from taking delivery due to a severe cash crunch.
For Boeing, which delivered four 787 Dreamliners, one wide-body 777 jet and an older version of the 737 MAX in April, the outbreak worsened a crisis following the second of two fatal crashes that led to the grounding of the 737 MAX last year.
Boeing had its worst year for orders in decades in 2019, leading to the first halt in 737 production in 20 years in January and the departure of Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg in December last year.
As demand for air travel dried up, Boeing has said it would cut its 160,000-person workforce by about 10%, and has raised $25 billion in a bond offering to boost liquidity to prepare for a years-long industry recovery.
Boeing said on Tuesday the 737 MAX cancellations in April were from customers including China Development Bank Financial Leasing Co (HK:1606) and  General Electric 's (N:GE) aircraft leasing unit GECAS.
This was in addition to the 150 737 MAX orders scrapped in March by customers such as Irish leasing company Avolon and Brazil's GOL (SA:GOLL4).
Boeing's gross orders stood at 49 aircraft for the year as of April, with a negative order total of 255 planes after cancellations.
After further accounting adjustments representing jets ordered in previous years but now unlikely to be delivered, Boeing's adjusted net orders sank to a negative 516 airplanes.
European rival Airbus SE's (PA:AIR) deliveries also tumbled 80% to just 14 aircraft in April, compared with a year earlier.

Airbus' gross orders for the year as of April were 365 aircraft. Following 66 cancellations, net order tally was 299 airplanes, up from 290 in March. (https://reut.rs/3bkWpFj)

569,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco’s Stock Trades on a Different Planet,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Don’t worry if you missed Saudi Aramco’s earnings call: There wasn’t one. Now the sticklers and bores among you might raise a hand and suggest that, what with the global pandemic, oil crash and assorted what-have-yous, it might be advisable for the biggest oil major in the world to spare an hour for an update. But honestly, does it really matter? I mean, look at this:
Shares in Saudi Arabian Oil Co., to give the company its full name, closed on Tuesday 2% below where they floated in December. You remember December, right? Possibly it’s the last time you had a haircut or felt completely safe getting on a plane.
It just so happens that on the same day Aramco (SE:2222) released its first-quarter results, BP (NYSE:BP) Plc’s new CEO Bernard Looney was quoted in a Financial Times interview saying he couldn’t rule out the possibility Covid-19 had ushered in peak oil demand. Now that’s BP, you might say, which is a fraction the size of Aramco and has just announced a big peak-oil-demand-ish long-term strategy.
Certainly, the numbers just released by Aramco adhere to the usual Ozymandian scale. Free cash flow of $15 billion for the quarter is roughly the same as BP’s for the past three years. Return on capital of 26%, down significantly from a year ago, is what the oil majors used to earn at the height of the supercycle. While balance-sheet pressure has driven BP’s dividend yield north of 10% and pushed rival Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc to cut its dividend, Aramco is sitting on net cash.
That other Big Oil stalwart,  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM)., has tried to stick to its guns on investing heavily for long-term oil and gas growth. But its stock has suffered enormously as a result. Aramco’s status as Bigger Oil, low costs and state backing make it much easier to maintain a similar strategy and outlook — but then so does having a stock that exists in a bubble.
While Aramco’s first-quarter results are robust, it’s worth remembering the worst of Covid-19 from an oil-market perspective hit in April, at the beginning of the current quarter. The Saudi-Russian price war, in which Aramco is a front-line combatant, also only got underway toward the end of the first quarter and then got subsumed in the pandemic.
Aramco’s crude oil production averaged 9.8 million barrels a day in the first quarter. Guidance suggests it could drop to an average of 9.1 million this quarter, running below 7.5 million in June. Brent crude, meanwhile, has averaged $27 so far this quarter versus $51 in the last. More than usual, the latest numbers are a sepia-tinted snapshot of the past.
Things have moved on in a few short months. Why else has Saudi Arabia imposed austerity measures and decided to cut production even further than promised in June? As I wrote here last month, the government’s take from Aramco might fall by half this year — and that’s only one way in which Saudi Arabia’s world is changing. Why else are reports emerging of the acquisition of Saudi Basic Industries Corp. being restructured (again)? The latter, by the way, would surely have come up on the earnings call, if only there had been one (there were no details in the report).
Since the end of February, average daily volume in Aramco’s shares has been all of 0.3% of the float — 0.3% of 1.5% of shares outstanding. Lock-ups entitling retail investors to bonus shares expire in about three weeks; it will be interesting to see if that has any impact. But Aramco’s IPO was stage-managed precisely to shield the stock from the outside world. Given what’s happened in the outside world, a call might just spoil that.

570,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 10:18AM ET</span>",The planes in Spain parked neatly on the plain,"By Elena Rodriguez
TERUEL, Spain (Reuters) - Dozens of passenger jetliners belonging to European carriers stand idled in neat lines in what has become a giant aeroplane parking lot amid the flat farmlands of eastern Spain.
Teruel Airport specialises in the storage and maintenance of aircraft, and business has boomed since coronavirus lockdowns globally forced airlines across Europe to ground fleets for several weeks. No end is in sight for many.
Planes showing the markings of commercial airlines including British Airways, Lufthansa and Air France stand parked, buffeted by the spring wind blowing across the plain.
""Teruel's climate is dry - semi-desert with more than 250 days of sun per year,"" said airport manager Alejandro Ibrahim.
""Also there is very little air traffic congestion which makes it the ideal place for plane preservation and maintenance."" 
The airport currently hosts 95 wide-body aircraft, including eight of the world's largest passenger airliners - the Airbus A380. The number of planes arriving per week to be parked in the airport has doubled since the start of the global pandemic.
Two Air France Airbus A380s arrived on April 25, the first ever to be hosted at the airport. Eight of this model are now parked on the lot.
The airport, owned by the local government, has not increased its rates since the beginning of the crisis, Ibrahim said.
Built on the site of an aerodrome used during Spain's 1936-1939 Civil War, it has a view of distant mountains. 
Global aviation is facing a battle to survive, with most flights grounded since March due to travel restrictions to contain the pandemic. Airlines across Europe, including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, have sought state rescues.

The sudden stop to air travel has led to airlines struggling to find space to store their planes. In Europe, some airlines have grounded their entire fleets and are storing their aircraft by parking them in airports, including on now-unused runways.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets turned negative on Tuesday as President Donald Trump renewed his pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further, hitting financial stocks in particular.  
By 10:10 AM ET (1410 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 97 points, or 0.4%, at 24,319 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite were both slightly down.
""As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates, the USA should also accept the “GIFT”. Big numbers!"" Trump tweeted. 
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 1.0% while Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) stock fell 0.9% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock fell 0.8%, reversing early gains, amid fear that even lower official interest rates will squeeze their profit margins as has been the case in other countries where the strategy has been tried, such as the euro zone and Japan.
Bank stocks had opened marginally higher, reassured by comments from three Federal Reserve officials in the last 24 hours downplaying the benefits of negative rates. Speculation that the Fed may cut the fed funds target range to below zero has increased in recent days as markets have moved to price in a slower, flatter recovery that charts more like a Nike-style swoosh than a V. There were fresh signs of the near-term deflationary impact on the economy from the pandemic earlier, as consumer prices fell by 0.8% in April, their biggest drop in over a decade.
The mood was in any case cautious, amid lingering concerns that the rushed reopening of the U.S. economy may lead to a second wave of infections and lockdowns later in the year.
“Some U.S. states that are relaxing restrictions are not always those that should, being earlier on the recovery curve, either having peaked later or still increasing,” analysts at Sanford C Bernstein wrote in a note to clients. “We believe multiple U.S. states will struggle with further relaxing requirements as disease trends will start heading the wrong way. Modelling the pandemic forward suggests even moderately elevated Rt =1.05 will lead to unacceptable disease rates come the fall.”
The U.S. Senate is due to hear testimony from top scientists later Tuesday on the risks of reopening the economy. One of the scientists testifying will be Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases. The  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) cited an email from Fauci on Tuesday saying that a premature opening ""risks needless suffering and death.""
Against that backdrop, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock rose 2.1% after CEO Elon Musk reopened the company's production facility in Fremont before getting the approval of local authorities, who still have an extensive lockdown order in place.
Elsewhere, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) stock fell 5.3% while PNC Financial  (NYSE:PNC) fell 2.0% after the latter said it intends to offload its 22% stake in the asset manager. 
In other markets, U.S. crude futures rose over 5% as four of the world's biggest exporters, including Saudi Arabia, pledged additional combined output cuts of more than 1.2 million barrels a day from next month, accelerating the rebalancing of an oversupplied market."

Some passengers complain airlines have not been upfront about their ability to get a refund, while others say airlines have tried to get consumers to accept vouchers first before eventually cancelling flights. 
The department has been granting airlines waivers to cancel some additional flights and denying others. The department cited ""the continued lack of demand for passenger air service"" in announcing the new ability to suspend more flights.
Airlines can submit lists of up to 5% of required destinations they believe are no longer reasonable for them to continuing serving. The government will ensure each U.S. destination currently receives service will continue to be served by at least one carrier.
The airline group said last week it is complying with all legal obligations to refund tickets.
""If air carriers refund all tickets, including those purchased under the condition of being non-refundable ... this will result in negative cash balances that will lead to bankruptcy,"" the group told Congress.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Lack of financing for the buyers of Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA (SA:PETR4) refineries may extend the delay in the sale process, three people with knowledge of the matter said. 
Petrobras, as the company is known, had already extended the deadline for delivery of binding offers for the eight largest, first lot of refineries from early April to early June, following a plunge in oil prices. 
Petrobras referred to the latest filing postponing the bids, in which it didn't´t give a new firm deadline. But at the time, sources with knowledge of the matter said the bidders were given additional 30 to 60 days to deliver the binding offers.
Now, the groups interested in acquiring the refineries are facing tougher financing conditions for their bids, that may be worth more than $10 billion. 
Banks are more reluctant to finance deals in the refining business due to uncertainty over fuel demand.
Ultrapar Participações SA (SA:UGPA3), Raizen - a joint venture between  Cosan  (NYSE:CZZ) SA and Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa), United Arab Emirates' state investor Mubadala Investment Company and China's Sinopec (NYSE:SHI) presented non-binding offers in the first phase of the sale process. 
So far, Petrobras has not changed is still officially keeping the deadline and committing to a sale this year, but the lack of financing may force the company to postpone it again. 
Field visits for due diligence in the refineries have also become more difficult due to the risk of the spread of the novel coronavirus, adding to reasons for another extension in the long-awaited sale process.
Earlier this year, before the pandemic, U.S. major  Exxon Mobil  Corp (N:XOM) was in talks to join one bidder group, two people with knowledge of matter said. But the company reported a loss in the first quarter and cut expenses and expansion projects. Exxon declined to comment. 
Petrobras has faced challenges in its bid to reduce debt, which was at $87.1 billion at the end of 2019, after oil demand plunged amid worldwide social distancing measures and lockdowns.
Earlier in April, the company scrapped its 2020 debt reduction target due to market volatility.

Transport Minister Saksayam Chidchob set the deadline amid rising public sentiment against a state-backed loan for the national carrier, which was already facing financial trouble before the coronavirus outbreak, having reported losses since 2017.
“If (the plan) is not finished in May, then we cannot proceed,” Saksayam told reporters, adding that the proposal must address all of the 23 risk areas highlighted by the airline, and present a clear strategy for handling the new coronavirus, growing revenue, and managing expenses.
The carrier is seeking a 58.1 billion baht ($1.81 billion)loan, guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance, according to preliminary plans seen by Reuters and approved at the end of April by a state-enterprise committee, chaired by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.
Thai Airways is now coordinating with the Transport Ministry’s policy office on the rehabilitation plan, Saksayam said without elaborating.
The airline, which booked losses of 12.04 billion baht in 2019, last week asked the Stock Exchange of Thailand to allow it to delay submission of its January-March financial statements until August, citing difficulty in gathering information due to the pandemic. 
“Oppose the use of taxpayer money to rescue Thai Airways endlessly, especially without a clear rehabilitation plan,” student activist, Tanawat Wongchai, posted on Twitter.
“Use the money to develop education, Thais will benefit. But use the money to rescue Thai Airways when people are suffering, what do Thai people get?” Tanawat said in a post, which was retweeted 8,100 times.
Thailand, which has reported a total of 3,017 cases of the coronavirus and 56 deaths, faces the loss of 10 million jobs as the outbreak drags on, with many people still waiting for government aid.

“The (Thai Airways) plan needs to be clear because the money is from public taxes … especially when the country needs to use budget for managing the virus and assisting the public,” the transport minister said.

BlackRock will also take a seat on the board of directors of the new stock exchange, which has raised $135 million since it was founded in January 2019 due to discontent among financial firms over what they saw as excessive exchange fees for trading and related services such as market data. 
MEMX said it will offer substantially lower fees than the incumbent exchanges; fewer, less complex order types; and a basic market data feed. 
""It's very meaningful, BlackRock being such a large asset manager, being able to represent their investors and really represent the buy-side,"" MEMX Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Kellner said in an interview. ""It really rounds out our boardroom.""

LONDON (Reuters) - EasyJet (L:EZJ) founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou is offering 5 million pounds ($6.2 million) for any information that leads to the cancellation of its order for 107 Airbus (PA:AIR) jets as he steps up his campaign to oust the budget airline's management.
Haji-Ioannou, whose family owns a third of easyJet's shares, has argued for a decade that the airline's fleet expansion would destroy shareholder value and he has intensified his push for management changes since the coronavirus decimated air travel.
He has ordered a special shareholder vote on May 22 to try to remove the airline's chief executive, chairman and two other directors. He would need over 50% of the votes to succeed and a number of big investors have said they will back management.
In a statement on Tuesday, Haji-Ioannou said he was looking for tips or information from easyJet insiders about any suspicious dealings with Airbus, such as lavish entertainment or unexplained wealth.
The European planemaker agreed in January to pay $4 billion in fines after reaching a plea bargain with prosecutors in Britain, France and United States over alleged bribery and corruption stretching back at least 15 years.
EasyJet issued a statement on Tuesday rejecting any suggestion it had acted improperly, as it did on April 27 after Haji-Ioannou called the shareholder vote.
""As we have previously stated, the board firmly rejects any insinuation that easyJet was involved in any impropriety. EasyJet has maintained the highest standards of governance and scrutiny in respect of its aircraft procurement processes,"" it said.
EasyJet said it had hired an external auditor to review the fleet selection process that led to the 4.5 billion pound Airbus order in 2013 and the auditor's report confirmed that robust procurement processes had been followed.
SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY
Haji-Ioannou said on Tuesday he would pay 10,000 pounds for any tips that help his campaign, as well as the 5 million pound reward if they lead to the order being cancelled.
""If you are a current or past hard-working easyJet employee, or anyone else who has seen anything suspicious by anyone inside easyJet in their dealings with Airbus, you could get a reward from Stelios worth up to 5 million pounds,"" he said.
EasyJet has said it has sufficient liquidity for a prolonged grounding of its planes due to the coronavirus pandemic and that the Airbus contract is vital to its future as the new jets are needed to replace older aircraft.
Some shareholders agree. Three of the company's bigger shareholders, who collectively own about 15% of the stock, have said they will back the current management in the vote. EasyJet also said on Tuesday that investor advisory groups ISS, Glass Lewis and PIRC have recommended shareholders back management.
Haji-Ioannou said on Tuesday that easyJet's Airbus order puts the future of the company at risk as it cannot afford to pay the planemaker when it is has no revenue and it won't need the planes after the pandemic because air travel will slump. 
Haji-Ioannou, who founded easyJet in 1995 but stepped down from its board in 2010 in protest over its expansion plans, also noted that the airline had not yet announced any job cuts. 
Rivals such as Ryanair (I:RYA), British Airways (L:ICAG) and Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) have all said they will need to make thousands of layoffs to weather the coronavirus crisis and cope with a smaller market afterwards.

584,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",EU signs contract with Philips on ventilators,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Dutch electronics giant Philips signed a contract with the European Commission to supply medical ventilators to EU hospitals, the company and EU officials said, in a deal that comes as most EU countries reached the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Other companies have signed similar contracts with the European Union as part of a joint procurement scheme the Commission launched in March on behalf of 25 EU states.
But no ventilator has yet been delivered under the scheme.
Last week, Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides told EU governments at a video conference that a new contract had been signed with Philips ""which has a production capacity of 15,000 units per week"", according to officials who participated in the online meeting.
Ventilators have proved to be crucial tools during the coronavirus pandemic in assisting breathing for patients critically ill with COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the novel coronavirus. However, many European hospitals did not have enough during the outbreak in March and April, when intensive care units were overstretched.
Despite EU efforts at coordination, member countries have often moved alone in buying ventilators and other crucial gear. Some have even restricted the export to neighbours of medical equipment and drugs during the pandemic.
NO ORDERS YET
""I can confirm that Philips has signed framework contracts with the European Commission to supply ventilators under an EU joint-procurement agreement,"" a spokesman for Philips told Reuters.
At the beginning of April, Philips reached a similar deal with the United States, committing to selling 43,000 hospital ventilators throughout the rest of the year for a total sum of $647 million.
Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump said the country had acquired so many ventilators that it would send some machines to countries who needed them most.
Asked about the contract with Philips, a spokesman for the European Commission confirmed agreements had been signed with the Dutch firm and others, but declined to name the other companies that won the EU tender because procedures were not yet completed. He also declined to comment on the price.
Under the scheme, the EU executive commission negotiates prices with suppliers and signs framework contracts. After that, governments can place orders.
The EU joint procurement for ventilators was launched on March 17 and the first contracts were signed in April, but the Commission was not aware of any order having been placed yet by an EU government, the commission spokesman said.
The coronavirus outbreak reached its peak in most EU countries at the beginning of May, the head of the EU disease control agency said last week - a trend confirmed by reduced pressure on intensive care units in many EU states.
However, as governments begin easing their lockdowns and let economic activity restart, public health officials have warned of the need for vigilance against the risks of new waves of contagion.

(Reuters) - American International Group Inc (N:AIG) faces a crucial test on Wednesday, when shareholders are to vote on whether the board of directors has adequately addressed their concerns about executive pay.
Investors offered relatively weak support for AIG's pay proposals in the prior two years during the era of Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault, who joined the U.S. insurer in May, 2017 with a lucrative package and has argued that paying top dollar is the only way to recruit and retain top talent.
Two influential proxy advisory firms, which scrutinize proposals and suggest how shareholders should vote, offered cautious approval of AIG's executive pay this year, saying the board engaged with a significant portion of investors and made enough changes to warrant a ""yes"" vote. 
They noted, however, that the company's stock performance has been poor, that Duperreault is rewarded more than peers and that AIG has room to improve structural issues with executive compensation.
""Cautionary support for the say-on-pay proposal is warranted,"" Institutional Shareholders Inc said in its analysis. AIG made ""meaningful improvements,"" but its compensation remains a ""high concern"" because of a misalignment between performance and pay.
Glass Lewis & Co also ""cautiously"" recommended approving AIG's pay proposal because of steps it took to engage with shareholders and restructure compensation packages, despite giving the company an ""F"" grade in pay-for-performance.
An AIG spokesman declined to comment on the reports.
Both firms had opposed AIG's pay packages in 2019 and 2018. Just 55% and 62% of voting shareholders threw their support behind the proposals in those years, respectively - far below the norm of 90% or more for U.S. stock issuers.
Executive compensation was a fiery issue for AIG after it received a $180 billion taxpayer bailout in 2008 while still paying executives tens of millions of dollars and funding lavish client events. The money AIG spent to hire Duperreault and the amount it has been putting toward him and other executives with few strings attached re-ignited the debate among investors.
In 2019, AIG held 32 meetings with stockholders representing 54% of outstanding shares to discuss their concerns. The company had reached out to an even wider swath of stakeholders, offering consultations with top executives or directors.
The board made some changes in response to criticism that performance metrics were subjective or vague, that they did not align closely enough with performance or that they were too short-term in nature.
For instance, AIG reduced equity grants and introduced a ""vesting cap"" that limits rewards executives can receive when the insurer does worse than its peers. It also made changes to prior awards to reflect AIG's slumping stock price.
The board, led by independent Chair Douglas Steenland, awarded Duperreault $19.4 million for 2019. That was a 7.6% decline from his pay in 2018.

AIG's total shareholder return for the three years ending in 2019 was -5.47% compared with 8.12% for a major insurance index, according to ISS.

586,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 07:09AM ET</span>","Expect a ‘Record-Breaking’ Russell Reconstitution, BofA Says","(Bloomberg) -- This year’s Russell reconstitution -- when Russell indexes with trillions of dollars benchmarked to them adjust members -- is set to be more significant than usual with the coronavirus pandemic making sizable changes to equity markets, according to Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
“Expect record-breaking changes post COVID-19,” strategists including James Yeo and Savita Subramanian wrote in a report Monday about the annual process. “The February-March sell-off -- and the subsequent rally -- driven by COVID-19 has significantly reshaped the equity markets, and turnover will likely be higher than usual.”
The rebalance often fuels one of the highest-volume stock-trading days of the year in the U.S., as investments that track the Russell indexes buy and sell to mimic the benchmarks. According to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Russell estimates there are around $9 trillion in assets linked to the Russell indexes, more than $900 billion of which are in passive vehicles. Speculators and arbitrageurs often buy stocks ahead of the changes, so sometimes the expected stock moves occur well before the actual reconstitution date -- June 26 this year. The “Rank Day,” when the preliminary lists of index components is determined, was May 8.
The reconstitution comes amid a backdrop of high volatility, with markets roiled as investors try to cope with the effects of coronavirus on public health and economies around the world. Growth stocks have been outperforming value shares, while technology giants soar.
The Russell 1000 Growth Index is expected to skew toward megacap stocks more than ever, and the number of stocks in the Growth index is expected to plunge to a record 421 from 533, while the Value index is likely to see membership rise to an all-time high of 843 from 721, BofA said.

It’s the Nasdaq index, the home of the country’s tech giants, which has been dominant. It is currently on a winning streak of six days, the longest since December, and is actually up 2.5% since the start of the year, benefiting from a preference for Internet-focused companies that have escaped the worst of restrictions on Main Street business.
Investors are likely to receive a stark warning about the dangers of reopening businesses too early when Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, testifies before a Senate committee later Tuesday.
Fauci told the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) that the U.S. risks ""needless suffering and death"" if the economy reopens too soon.
In the corporate sector, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is likely to remain in the spotlight after CEO Elon Musk said the electric carmaker would restart production in California in defiance of a county lockdown order.
The airline sector will also be in focus after Boeing (NYSE:BA) Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told NBC that he doesn’t expect traffic levels to rebound significantly by September, and a major U.S. carrier is likely to go out of business this year.
The market will get the latest numbers on retail inflation, with the April consumer price index due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). Economists expect that the CPI fell 0.8% in April to an annual rate of 0.4%.
Oil futures pushed higher Tuesday, helped by Saudi Arabia’s decision Monday to voluntarily increase the extent of its production cuts by an additional million barrels a day. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates also followed the Saudi lead.

588,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>","Ryanair cools on Airbus, moves back towards all-Boeing fleet","By Conor Humphries
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair plans to move back towards an all-Boeing fleet by cancelling leases for Airbus A320s for its Lauda subsidiary and likely replacing 30 Airbus jets at the Austrian airline with Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters. 
Ryanair's (I:RYA) purchase in 2018 of Airbus operator Lauda was pitched as a way to diversify the fleet of the budget airline group, which had until then exclusively flown Boeing jets and currently has over 450 737s.
O'Leary, whose expansion plans have been curtailed by the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX, said in March last year he was in early talks with Airbus about an order for 100 A321s and that Ryanair wanted to have a dual Boeing-Airbus fleet. 
But on Tuesday, O'Leary said he currently viewed talking with Airbus as a waste of his time. 
""We would not initiate talks with Airbus until such time as Airbus wants to initiate talks with us,"" he said in an interview. 
""Until they need an order from the Ryanair Group, frankly we are wasting our time talking to Airbus,"" he added, without elaborating.
Instead, Ryanair planned to ""significantly reduce the scale of the Lauda fleet,"" said O'Leary, who is known for his brinkmanship in negotiations. 
""We have (Airbus) aircraft that are due to be delivered over the next 12 months and we will cancel almost all of those deliveries,"" which are from leasing companies, he said. 
Assuming talks with Boeing about compensation for delays in the delivery of 210 737 MAX jets - and on a possible new aircraft order - go to plan, then Ryanair will probably replace Lauda's 30 Airbus jets with Boeing, he added.
""As long as we can reach an acceptable outcome with Boeing, the Boeing orders we have in place would readily replace - I think Lauda will have a fleet of about 30 Airbus aircraft - we would probably replace those Airbus with Boeing over the next couple of years.""
In February, Ryanair said it was planning to increase Lauda's fleet from 23 to 38 Airbus A320s by the summer of 2020.
Ryanair is also in talks with unions at Lauda about pay cuts and a new labour agreement. 
O'Leary said the Austrian union was refusing to engage and if this did not change by the end of May, Lauda's home base in Vienna would close, with Ryanair Boeing jets replacing the Lauda Airbus planes. 
O'Leary said the talks with Boeing on compensation and a possible new order had accelerated, but would likely not be concluded by a deadline of May 18-19 and may not conclude until the MAX returns to service, which he said was likely to happen in August or September.

O'Leary said the MAX grounding could delay Ryanair's plan to fly 200 million passengers by 2020 ""by a year or two.""

The comments came as the United States has recorded more than 1.35 million infections and over 80,000 deaths, according to Reuters' figures, while worldwide the number is nearly 4.2 million infections and more than 285,000 deaths. 
""If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines to 'Open America Again,' then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country,"" the newspaper https://nyti.ms/3dGbm6n quoted Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, as saying in an email. 
""This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal."" 
Fauci said the danger of trying to open the country prematurely was his major message for the Senate Health Education, Labor and Pensions committee at the meeting, the paper said late on Monday.
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner told Fox News the United States had crossed 9.30 million virus tests, with more than 394,00 done on Monday.

The rise in infections has put pressure on U.S. efforts to boost testing capacity with health officials, including Fauci, having flagged the challenge of testing those in greatest need.

592,By Investing.com,"<span>May 12, 2020 05:39AM ET</span>","StockBeat: The Worst Is Past, for Vodafone at Least","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- The worst is past – for  Vodafone  (NASDAQ:VOD), at least.
The U.K.-based telecoms giant issued a confident update Tuesday as it presented its results for the fiscal year, sending its shares up as much as 9%, their best intra-day gain since the initial rebound from the March panic.
By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT) Vodafone (LON:VOD) shares were up 8.3% at 122.42 pence, their highest in nearly seven weeks. The FTSE 100 was up 0.6% and the Stoxx 600 was up 0.2%, by comparison.
There was enough to like about the figures, which showed the company finally emerging from a disaster in India and a frantic period of portfolio reshuffling. As the latter slows down, it can concentrate on squeezing the most value out of a new, Europe-heavy portfolio that seems well positioned from the Covid-19 pandemic fallout.
Already in the fourth quarter, revenue in Spain and Italy conspicuously came in ahead expectations, as locked-down populations and businesses increased their data consumption. But it’s not just about giving more Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and gaming capacity to couch-bound consumers. Vodafone’s strong array of corporate customers should mean it capitalizes in future on businesses’ need to improve their arrangements for extensive and long-term remote working, specifically through the provision of wide-area networks (WAN).
Already in the latest quarter, revenue in Spain and Italy, two countries particularly hard hit by Covid-19, revenue fell less than expected, allowing the company to report organic revenue growth of 1.6%.
A solid revenue picture gave it the confidence to keep paying a dividend. That in itself is something of an achievement at present, a far cry from the wailing and gnashing of teeth that accompanied new CEO Nick Read’s decision to cut the precious payout last year. With underlying free cash flow of at least 5 billion euros in the coming year, and with net debt in the middle of its target range of 2.5 to 3 times adjusted EBITDA, there are no immediate risks of any further cuts.   
Read and his team also promised another 1 billion euros over the next three years, hinting heavily that much of it will come from store closures and cutting out middlemen in the distribution business.
Finally, Vodafone said it’s still on track to unlock the value in its European towers business, a move which generated billions of euros in Italy when it spun off its towers there into Inwit. That deal should happen within a year, the company said on Tuesday."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Aircraft lessors may need to start taking back some planes in the second half of the year, the CEO of BOC Aviation Ltd (HK:2588) said, adding that the pandemic-hit aviation market could take until 2023 to fully rebound.
One the world's biggest aircraft lessors, BOC Aviation said it still has 100% of its fleet on lease after reaching three-month partial payment deferral deals with many customers.
""We are prepared to move planes around when we have to. We haven't got to that point yet as of today,"" Chief Executive Robert Martin told Reuters in an interview. ""But we have to expect there will be some friction in the market, probably over the third and fourth quarter.""
In times of financial strain, lessors may agree with carriers to take back some of the planes leased out, though they may also seek to forcibly reclaim them in some cases.
Global airlines are facing a battle to survive, with most flights grounded since March due to travel restrictions to contain the novel coronavirus, although some countries have begun to ease curbs.
BOC Aviation expects airline traffic could rebound fairly quickly to 80% of 2019 levels once travel restrictions are lifted, but the last 20% might take until 2023, said Martin, an industry veteran of more than 30 years.
The pandemic has spurred the Singapore-headquartered lessor into a flurry of deals this year - an estimated $5.5 billion of purchase and lease-back agreements with major carriers such as Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and United Airlines Holdings (O:UAL).
The deals were agreed on more favourable pricing terms for BOC Aviation than would have been achieved in a stronger aviation market, raising the credit quality of its client portfolio, Martin said. As of Dec. 31, the portfolio had a net book value of $16.8 billion.
Other airlines signing purchase and lease-back deals with BOC Aviation included  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (HK:0293) and European budget carrier  Wizz Air Holdings PLC  (L:WIZZ), he said but added he did not expect more such deals this year.
BOC Aviation remains confident in the future of  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX, noting that its deal with Southwest includes 10 of the aircraft, Martin said.
""On the 737 MAX, Boeing are telling us they will start production this month at a very low level, maybe two a month,"" Martin said.

A Boeing spokeswoman declined to comment on the rate but noted Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith said on an earnings call last month that production would begin at a slow pace, rising to 31 a month in 2021.

April was part of a non-working period in Russia, ordered by President Vladimir Putin to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, bringing the economy grinding to a halt as factories and businesses were forced to suspend operations and citizens asked to self-isolate. 
People rushed to buy passenger cars in March, with sales jumping 22.7%, expecting prices to rise after a fall in the rouble in the wake of lower oil prices and the coronavirus outbreak, analytical agency Autostat said last month.

595,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","Vodafone keeps dividend as pandemic hits roaming, but boosts data","By Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) -  Vodafone  (L:VOD) kept its dividend on Tuesday, bucking a corporate trend to cut or scrap payouts due to the coronavirus crisis, as the world's second-biggest mobile operator met expectations with a 2.6% rise in full-year core earnings.
The British company said a drop in international travel due to the virus pandemic had hit its revenues from roaming calls and that it expected customer spending to suffer from the economic downturn caused by the health crisis. 
However, it also said it was seeing a surge in data usage and improvements in retaining customers thanks to the speed and reliability of its networks. 
Core earnings reached 14.9 billion euros ($16.1 billion) in the year ended March 31, with group revenue up 3% to 45.0 billion euros, driven by business in Europe.
Shares in the group, which have fallen 19% in the last 12 months, were up 4.7% to at 118.22 pence at 0800 GMT.
Chief Executive Nick Read cut Vodafone's dividend a year ago, relieving immediate pressure on its balance sheet. 
This time, the group kept its full-year payout at 9.00 euro cents a share. Rival BT Group (L:BT) last week suspended its dividend.
Vodafone, which has 65 million mobile contract and 25 million broadband customers in Europe, said roaming in Europe fell by 65% to 75% in April as the pandemic curbed travel.
It said some of its small business customers had requested payment deferrals and some of its larger enterprise customers had sought to delay projects.
However, the pandemic has caused an upsurge in demand for data as customers are forced to work from home and use technology to stay in contact with friends and family.
Vodafone said mobile data had increased by 15% and fixed-line usage by as much as 70% in some markets.
The rate of customer churn, or switching to rivals, fell 4-5 percentage points as mobile companies had to close retail stores, Vodafone said, adding the rate of new gross consumer additions reduced by around 40%. 
The company said that, given the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, it was not able to provide adjusted core earnings guidance for the current financial year.
But it said that, based on an assessment of the global economy, it could be flat to slightly down, compared with a rebased 14.5 billion euros for 2019-20.

It did provide guidance for free cash flow before spectrum costs, which underpins its dividend, saying it would be at least 5 billion euros.

The Cajun-inspired fast food company, which said last year it planned to open 1,500 restaurants in China over the next decade, open its first outlet in the financial hub of Shanghai on Friday. 
""It will have a temporary effect,"" Korhan Kurdoglu, vice chairman of restaurant operator TFI Tab Foods Investments (TFI), said of the coronavirus, which has infected 4.2 million people worldwide after emerging in China last year. 
TFI is the partner of Popeye's owner Restaurant Brands International (NYSE:QSR) Inc's (TO:QSR) in China. 
Popeye's opening comes after the number of new coronavirus cases has dropped sharply in China, allowing businesses to reopen and consumers to stream back onto the streets while many other countries are locked down.
Although concerns remain about the possibility of new outbreaks. 
Kurdoglu said the pandemic did not have much of an impact on their supply chain or its opening plans, as it was also able to lean on TFI's other China franchise, Burger King, that has 1,300 restaurants in the country. 
Raphael Coelho, chief executive of Popeyes China, said the company planned to expand gradually into cities near Shanghai, such as Nanjing, Hangzhou and Suzhou, rather than open throughout the country at the same time. 
""All these cities are 200 to 250 kilometers away from Shanghai so that creates a cluster,"" said Coelho. ""We want to go deep on this type of clusters where you have better supply chain efficiencies, operation controls and you also benefit from this scale of marketing penetration.""
He also said the company was seeing a good build-up of demand ahead of its opening, based on a mini programme it opened on social media app WeChat through which it can collect orders and recruit members. 
""We have close to 15,000 members already,"" he said. 

Founded in New Orleans in 1972, Popeyes now has more than 3,000 restaurants in 25 countries and regions around the world.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded in tight ranges Tuesday, as investors weighed up the benefits of reopening economies with the possibility of a second wave of Covid-19 victims.
At 3:55 AM ET (0755 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% higher, France's CAC 40 fell 0.08%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index was up 0.3%.
France's economic downturn is easing as the country emerges from a lockdown imposed in mid March, although activity remains mired at levels far below normal, the central bank said on Tuesday.
The euro zone's second-biggest economy was operating 27% below normal levels in April, a little better than the 32% gap seen in the second half of March, the Bank of France said, summarizing responses from its monthly business climate survey.
This comes as countries around the world gradually ease restrictions in an effort to restart their economies.
However, the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, the country widely seen as having handled the crisis the best in Europe, reported that the ""reproduction rate"" - the number of people each person infected with the coronavirus goes on to infect - had risen to 1.1 in the wake of the relaxation of national guidelines.
Any rate above 1 means the virus is spreading exponentially, and this will be seen as a worrying outcome.
This follows the discovery of five new cases in Wuhan in China, where the pandemic originated, as well as a new outbreak in South Korea, whose aggressive testing and contact tracing had kept infection rates low during the virus' first wave.
In corporate news,  Vodafone  (LON:VOD) stock climbed 5.8% after the world's second-largest mobile operator met expectations with a 2.6% rise in full-year core earnings. However, it did not give a current year outlook due to the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus.
On the flip side, TV and stereo maker  Bang & Olufsen  (CSE:BO) dropped nearly 10% after saying it will ask shareholders to approve a 400 million crown ($57.99 million) rights issue to help it through the coronavirus crisis.
 AIB Group  (LON:AIBG) fell 2.7% after saying its performance for the first quarter of the year worsened, and warning  it would have to take large credit provisions. 
German insurance giant Allianz (DE:ALVG) slid 2.8% after reporting a big virus-related hit to its property and casualty arm and also suffering outflows of nearly $50 billion from its asset management arm PIMCO. Industrial giant Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) slid 10% after detailing another big loss in its fiscal second quarter and the promise of an even bigger one in the current quarter.
Oil futures edged higher Tuesday, continuing to be helped by Saudi Arabia’s move Monday to voluntarily deepen its production cuts.

The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, is to begin to fly 1,000 flights per day on July 1, up from a skeleton service of 30 flights per day it is currently operating, it said in a statement. 
That will allow it to cover 90% of its pre-crisis network but fewer frequencies, it said. 
This month CEO Michael O'Leary said Ryanair was likely to go from 40% of normal flights in July to 50% in August, but with at least half of the seats likely to be empty due to ""anaemic demand"". 
As part of its COVID-19 response, Ryanair will require all passengers to fill out a form detailing the length of their planned visit and where they will stay, information that will be provided to EU governments to monitor quarantine measures. 
Britain, one of Ryanair's three largest markets, plans to quarantine for 14 days after arriving in the country, a move that industry leaders on Monday said would worsen an already grave situation for the aviation sector.

602,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 03:27AM ET</span>",Saudi Aramco’s Profit Drops 25% After Oil Price Plunge,"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia’s state-controlled oil giant stayed on track to pay shareholders $75 billion this year despite reporting a 25% drop in first-quarter profit, after a price war with Russia and the coronavirus sent prices crashing.
 Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), the world’s most valuable company, will pay a dividend of $18.75 billion for the first three months of 2020, according to a statement, though it didn’t specify if it was still committed to the full-year sum.
The dividend is crucial for the kingdom’s government, which holds about 98% of the company and is facing its worst financial turmoil in decades.
Aramco’s income declined 25% year-on-year to 62.48 billion riyals ($16.6 billion) and refining swung to a loss before earnings and tax. Aramco continues to forecast between $25 billion and $30 billion of capital spending this year but expenditure for 2021 is under review, it said.
“The Covid-19 crisis is unlike anything the world has experienced in recent history and we are adapting to a highly complex and rapidly changing business environment,” Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said. “Aramco has demonstrated resilience during economic cycles and has an unparalleled position due to a strong balance sheet and low-cost structure.”
Saudi Arabia and Russia have called a truce in a crude-price war that erupted in March, with the former announcing a surprise cut on Monday that will see its output in June fall to the lowest in 18 years. Aramco also moved to prop up energy markets last week by raising prices for its customers.
Even so, efforts to contain the pandemic by shuttering swaths of the world economy continue to weigh on crude, which has crashed more than 50% this year.
Aramco has slashed spending as it focuses on protecting the promised shareholder payouts this year.
“We retain significant flexibility to adjust expenditures and have considerable experience in managing the business through times of adversity,” Nasser said. “This resilience will enable us to continue delivering on our commitments to our shareholders.”
The Dhahran-based company said in March that it would limit capital expenditure to $30 billion in 2020, down from previous plans to spend as much as $40 billion. As well as the dividend, major spending commitments include the first installment of a $69.1 billion acquisition of a stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp. Aramco is buying 70% of the chemicals maker from the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund.
The share price of Aramco, which listed in Riyadh in December, rose 0.8% to 31.15 riyals by 10:15 a.m. local time. It is down 12% for the year, compared with a 55% drop in benchmark Brent crude. The company’s market value has declined from a peak of over $2 trillion to about $1.6 trillion.

Airlines globally added a net 600,000 seats to reach a total of almost 30 million, up about 2% from the previous week, OAG senior analyst John Grant wrote in a report. That’s still a long way off the weekly capacity of about 110 million seats this time last year, but it is an encouraging sign nonetheless.

Some markets are still on a downtrend as travel restrictions are kept in place to contain the coronavirus, which has infected more than 4 million people and killed nearly 290,000. Seat capacity on South Asian airlines dropped 14% this week and is 72% lower than in January, but it could bounce back as India considers restarting flights following a nationwide lockdown, Grant said.

European markets were set to open lower with EUROSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) off 0.52% and FTSE futures (FFIc1) down 0.22%. E-Mini futures (ESc1) for the S&P 500 slipped 0.68%.
The central Chinese city of Wuhan reported five new cases on Monday, casting doubts over efforts to lower coronavirus-related restrictions across the country as businesses restart and individuals went back to work. 
""Markets have been torn between optimism on the tentative re-opening of some economies and caution on the still grim economic data,"" said OCBC Investment Research in a Tuesday markets note.
""Any recovery in equity markets is likely to be fragile for now, as markets will watch for cracks in the financial system and elsewhere in the economy as virus infections climb."" 
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) stumbled more than 1%, snapping two straight sessions of gains. 
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was among the hardest hit (HSI), down 1.78% followed closely by Australia (AXJO), off 1.24%. South Korea's KOSPI (KS11) faltered 0.85%. 
China's blue-chip CSI300 index (CSI300) was off 0.5% after the country's factory prices fell at the sharpest rate in four years in April, worse than analysts' expectations.
As countries around the world gradually ease restrictions in an effort to restart their economies, investors are becoming anxious about a second wave of infections.
Germany's Robert Koch Institute reported that the ""reproduction rate"" - the number of people each person infected with the coronavirus goes on to infect - had risen to 1.1. Any rate above 1 means the virus is spreading exponentially.
The worrisome news follows a fresh outbreak in night clubs in South Korea and record number of new cases in a day in Russia.
“The re-opening of the global economy will likely follow the shape of activity in China. Businesses there have restarted operations but are not necessarily at capacity,"" Bob Baur, Chief Global Economist at Principal Global Investors.
“While businesses have mostly restarted, China’s households stay cautious. Restaurants are open, but seats are empty. Vehicle sales bounced off the bottom but are well below normal. Households in the U.S. and Europe will surely mirror this wary attitude even as activity picks up.”
Fund managers expect equity markets to stay the course through June and avoid retesting March lows given the massive monetary stimulus provided by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks.
Late on Monday, the Fed said it would start purchasing shares of exchange-traded funds that invest in bonds, one of several tools to improve market functioning in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Markets are also keeping a wary eye on China's trade relations with the United States as well as Australia.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he opposed renegotiating the U.S.-China ""Phase 1"" trade deal while Australian media reported that China has suspended imports from four abattoirs in an escalation of tensions.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars slipped on Tuesday as risk sentiment was knocked and in part due to new Chinese restrictions on Australian beef exports.
On the policy front, investors will be looking to comments from Fed officials. James Bullard and Patrick Harker are due to make remarks at 1300 GMT and 1400 GMT, respectively, ahead of a highly anticipated speech from chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday.
The euro (EUR=) slipped below $1.08 for the first time in almost a week and the Japanese yen nursed an overnight loss of about 1% to sit at 107.39 per dollar, the bottom end of a range it has kept since mid April.
In commodity markets, oil prices climbed following an unexpected commitment from Saudi Arabia to deepen production cuts in June. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) futures climbed to a high of $30.11 a barrel and were up 0.2%, or 6 cents, at $29.69 at 0447 GMT, reversing some of the previous session's losses. The benchmark fell $1.34 on Monday.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude (CLc1) futures were up 0.91%, or 23 cents, at $24.37 after touching a high of $24.77.

Spot gold XAU= was barely changed at $1,696.6 an ounce.

610,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 12, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>",Europe Funding Costs Ease Along with Stress in Italian Bonds,"(Bloomberg) -- European funding costs have eased for the first time since a surprise German court ruling last week against the European Central Bank’s bond buying.
Three-month Euribor, the rate at which banks lend to each other, ended a three-day rising streak on Monday. Funding costs are coming down thanks to the cooling of Italian bond yield spreads, which spiked after the constitutional court threw doubt on the ECB’s pandemic emergency purchase program (PEPP).
Although the link between interbank funding markets and bonds isn’t direct, the court ruling was a blow for Italian banks, who hold significant amounts of so-called BTP government debt and are among the lenders contributing to Euribor, according to Rishi Mishra, an analyst at Futures First.
“A question mark on the PEPP was a question mark on BTPs and potentially on the Italian banks,” he said.
The June FRA-OIS spread, a gauge for future funding costs, widened modestly, but implies that stress should ease in the near term. Funding costs still remain above the level seen before the central bank expanded its long-term cheap loan program, aimed at bringing them down.
Funding costs will continue to ease if the ECB is able to continue its asset-purchasing program, Mishra said. That doesn’t mean they are on a one-way track downward, given the potential for more tightening if another crisis blows up bond yields again.
“There is much uncertainty about systemic risk in the euro zone so I wouldn’t rule out another flare-up (and therefore Euribor spiking again),” said Antoine Bouvet, a senior rates strategist at  ING Groep  (AS:INGA) ."
611,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 11, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>",Oil Crash Claims First Victim in China Offshore Bond Market,"(Bloomberg) -- A Hong Kong-listed oil explorer became the first casualty of the spectacular oil price slump in China’s offshore bond market, after defaulting on a dollar note.
MIE Holdings Corp. failed to deliver an interest repayment of about $17 million for its 13.75% dollar bond due 2022 after a 30-day grace period expired Monday, according to a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. This triggered cross defaults on other loan facilities, it said. Potential loan repayment demands, unfulfilled repayment obligations and possible breaches on loans and notes amount to over $287.3 million, it added.
MIE is the latest energy firm to stumble under a debt load. Across Asia, commodity firms from Vedanta (NYSE:VEDL) Resources Ltd. to oil refiner Shandong Qingyuan Group Co. are showing stress after a historic slump in oil prices. Oil is down about 60% this year with little clarity over when global consumption will be back to pre-virus levels.
“MIE was already in distress for the past one to two years, so the default came as no surprise,” said Leonard Law, analyst at Lucror Analytics. “The crash in oil prices was the hammer blow for the company as it meant they would not be able to recover.”
MIE Holdings, which has an interest in an oilfield in the Jilin province, saw its cash and equivalents shrinking to $2 million as of end 2019 from $6.7 million in the previous year, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.
“The company is experiencing increasing liquidity pressure due to the significant decline in revenue and cash flow caused by recent plunge in crude oil prices,” MIE said.
Trading in the Hong Kong-listed shares has been suspended since April 1. The stock has plunged 45% this year.

612,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 10:30PM ET</span>","Potbelly settlement with activists includes twist: stock, not cash, for outlays","By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Sandwich maker Potbelly (NASDAQ:PBPB) Corp on Monday promised to reimburse activist shareholders' expenses with stock not cash, creating a situation that lawyers call an outlier for now but which they said could find traction in tough economic times.
The two sides reached a settlement that looks routine for the times with two board seats going to the activist group led by Vann Avedisian while the company's directors keep their jobs. 
Buried in a regulatory filing, however, is a twist that discloses Potbelly's plan to issue 130,000 shares as ""reimbursement for all documented out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses (including attorney’s fees and other legal expenses)."" Traditionally reimbursements are made in cash, with some activists even asking companies to pay lawyers and others directly to avoid any whiff of conflict.
Monday's settlement may be the first ever to repay expenses with stock, say lawyers and industry analysts, and it comes as Potbelly is among millions of restaurants forced to close dining rooms and offer free delivery to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
""It is unusual to have expenses reimbursed in stock rather than in cash,"" said Aneliya Crawford, a partner at law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, which often advises activist investors.
Crawford and other lawyers agree this ""unorthodox arrangement"" was likely fueled by Potbelly's need to preserve cash. Last week the Chicago-based company, which is worth roughly $73 million, said it lacks the necessary staff to prepare earnings on time and is renegotiating its debt covenants with lenders. Last month it had to return $10 million in government funds designed for small businesses to make payroll and rent payments.
Potbelly was advised by law firm Sidley Austin while Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft represented the investors. Neither firm responded to requests for comment.
Lawyers also noted some investors might worry the reimbursement in stock is tough to value at a time Potbelly's stock has been falling and that it would dilute their holdings and strengthen the dissidents' hand.
Many companies try to cap the amount of stock owned by activists during their negotiated standstill period.
For Potbelly, however, there may have been no other option, lawyers and investors said, noting its stock price has fallen by more than half in the last year and that restaurant chains have been especially hard hit by the pandemic.
The issuance involved less than 1% of Potbelly's outstanding shares.

Several lawyers said that although the reimbursement arrangement is an outlier now and that most companies would prefer to pay back, issuing stock is now an option that executives could ask activists to take as part of an agreement.

(Reuters) - A special committee of WeWork board members filed a motion in Delaware on Monday to prevent it from being disbanded, as it pursues legal action against majority owner SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) over an abandoned $3 billion tender offer for the office space-sharing start-up. 
It is the latest salvo in a heated legal dispute between the two sides. WeWork's special committee, which represents minority shareholders in the company including its co-founder Adam Neumann, is contesting SoftBank's decision to walk away from the tender offer agreed last year.
In the motion, WeWork's special committee, filed a ""status quo order"" which would preserve the committee's authority pending the outcome of the legal case between WeWork and SoftBank. A judge in Delaware court last month set the trial date for the case for early January.
According to the special committee's motion, the board of the We Company, WeWork's parent, held a meeting on April 29 at which the company's counsel recommended the appointment of two temporary board members who would form a new committee to adjudicate the existing special committee's authority.
The WeWork board voted six to two to approve retaining a search firm to identify independent directors, according to the filing. 
This comes after lawyers for SoftBank last month wrote to WeWork's board to request that it confirm the special committee is not authorized to act on behalf of WeWork.
Representatives for SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment on the motion. 
WeWork's special committee was formed last year to consider financial rescue packages for WeWork and is comprised of Bruce Dunlevie, a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital, and Lew Frankfort, ex-CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach.
SoftBank, which owns a majority stake in WeWork, and its Vision Fund have four of eight board seats at WeWork. 
Neumann, who attracted criticism for his management of the company before being forced out in September, had negotiated the right to sell $970 million of his shares as part of the tender offer. Some $450 million of the tender offer was allotted to current and former employees.
Neumann filed a similar lawsuit against SoftBank last week for terminating the tender offer as well as a motion to consolidate his case with the special committee's.
A ruling on the motion to consolidate the cases is expected next week, according to people familiar with the matter. 

(This story corrects paragraph 9 to show SoftBank and its Vision Fund have 4 board seats at WeWork, not SoftBank has 5 board seats).

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday said production was resuming at the automaker's sole U.S. vehicle factory, in California, defying an order to stay closed and saying if anyone had to be arrested it should be him.
The move comes as states and cities around the United States experiment with ways to safely reopen their economies after the coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses and forced tens of millions of Americans out of work.
Musk over the weekend threatened to leave California for Texas or Nevada over his factory's closure. His move has highlighted the competition for jobs and ignited a rush to woo the billionaire executive by states that have reopened their economies more quickly in response to encouragement from U.S. President Donald Trump.
In an email on Monday, Tesla referred to an order on Thursday by California's governor allowing manufacturers to resume operations and said that as of Sunday, previously furloughed employees were back to their regular employment status.
""We're happy to get back to work and have implemented very detailed plans to help you keep safe as you return,"" according to the email seen by Reuters and titled ""Furlough Has Ended And We Are Back To Work in Production!""
Musk in a tweet said production was resuming on Monday, adding that he would join workers on the assembly line. ""If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,"" he wrote.
Health officials in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is based, late on Monday said they were aware that Tesla had opened beyond the so-called minimum basic operations allowed during lockdown, and had notified the company it could not operate without a county-approved plan.
In a statement, officials said they expected a proposal from Tesla later on Monday and ""hope Tesla will likewise comply without further enforcement measures."" The statement did not specify consequences and said officials would not comment further.
The county's lockdown order says violations are punishable by fine, imprisonment or both. 
A spokeswoman for the Fremont Police Department on Monday said her office was enforcing the lockdown order at the direction of the health department and had been advised that the county is working with Tesla directly.
Separately on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said California should do whatever is necessary to help the electric carmaker reopen its only U.S. vehicle factory if it wants to keep the company in its state.
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Monday said he spoke to Musk several days ago and that the Tesla founder’s concerns helped prompt the state to begin its phased reopening of manufacturing last week. 
“I have not only known that company but I have known its founder for many, many years,” Newsom said in his daily coronavirus press briefing. “I have great reverence for their technology, for their innovative spirit, for their leadership.”
Tesla, which also has a vehicle plant in Shanghai and is building another in Berlin, on Saturday sued the county, alleging it had violated California's constitution by defying Newsom's orders allowing manufacturers to reopen.
Musk has discussed opening a second U.S. factory outside California in the past. In a tweet in February, he solicited comments on potentially opening a factory in Texas.
Since his threat to leave California on Saturday, officials from Texas, Georgia, Utah, Oklahoma and Nevada have reached out to Musk on Twitter, encouraging him to relocate to their state.
A Texas official said his county was available immediately to accommodate Tesla and invited the billionaire CEO for a visit.
""We have a motivated, pro-business governor,"" Richard Cortez, county judge of Texas' Hidalgo County, said on Monday. ""What we no longer have is a shelter at home mandate.""
Musk in response tweeted: ""Note is much appreciated.""

617,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 11, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Indian Billionaire Behind IndiGo Weighs Virgin Australia Bid,"(Bloomberg) -- The biggest shareholder of Indian budget carrier IndiGo is considering a bid for Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd., joining a score of suitors seeking to capitalize on Asia’s first airline casualty from the coronavirus pandemic.
Rahul Bhatia, who owns the Indigo holding through InterGlobe Enterprises Ltd., is evaluating data of the Australian airline founded by Richard Branson and is finalizing a strategy, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. No decision has been made, the person said, asking not to be identified as the matter was confidential.
IndiGo denied an earlier report it plans to bid for Virgin Australia. The proposal is being prepared by InterGlobe Enterprises, and not by IndiGo, the person said.
Virgin Australia has attracted at least 20 potential buyers as its administrator, Deloitte, races to sell the airline within two months of its collapse. Deloitte is seeking indicative bids by Friday and binding offers in June, targeting a deal by the end of that month.
Virgin Australia collapsed owing A$6.84 billion ($4.5 billion) to more than 10,000 creditors, overwhelmed by a near-halt in revenue as the coronavirus shut down travel.
Virgin Australia reported seven consecutive annual losses before it folded. According to the Australian Financial Review, the Indian proposal aims to relaunch the airline in its original form as a low-cost carrier to return it to profit.
At the time of its first flight from Brisbane to Sydney in 2000, Virgin had just two aircraft and one route. Under Chief Executive Officer John Borghetti, who took over in 2010, the airline transformed itself into a full-service carrier, selling business-class seats across its domestic network. Borghetti went head-to head against his old employer, Qantas Airways Ltd.
The huge investment required for the battle, and a capacity war with Qantas, spawned almost endless losses. Borghetti’s successor Paul Scurrah, who took the helm in 2019, was in the middle of a turnaround plan to reduce debt and costs when the coronavirus emerged and swamped any hopes of a recovery.
A plan to operate Virgin as a low-cost carrier may run into opposition in Australia. Such a strategy would hand almost all the corporate and business-class market to Qantas, which itself owns budget carrier Jetstar. The head of Australia’s competition watchdog, Rod Sims, has already called for Virgin to return as a full-service carrier. The government also said it wants the country to have two competing airlines.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he opposed renegotiating the U.S.-China ""Phase 1"" trade deal after a Chinese state-run newspaper reported some government advisers in Beijing were urging fresh talks and possibly invalidating the agreement.
Trump, who himself has considered abandoning the pact signed in January, told a White House press briefing he wanted to see if Beijing lived up to the deal to massively increase purchases of U.S. goods.
""No, not at all. Not even a little bit,"" Trump said when asked if he would entertain the idea of reworking Phase 1. ""I'm not interested. We signed a deal. I had heard that too, they'd like to reopen the trade talk, to make it a better deal for them.""
The Global Times tabloid reported on Monday that unidentified advisers close to the talks have suggested that Chinese officials revive the possibility of invalidating the trade pact and negotiate a new one to tilt the scales more to the Chinese side.
The Global Times is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party. While not an official party mouthpiece, the Global Times' views are believed at times to reflect those of its leaders.
NEW SOYBEAN PURCHASES
Hours after the report was published, Chinese importers on Monday bought at least four cargoes, or about 240,000 tonnes, of U.S. soybeans on Monday for shipment beginning in July, and additional sales are possible, two traders familiar with the deals said on Monday.
The purchases were the latest in a recent string by China, which U.S. officials say has also begun implementing other parts of the trade deal regarding intellectual property protections.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office did not respond to repeated queries on the Global Times article.
Under the Phase 1 deal signed in January, Beijing pledged to buy at least $200 billion in additional U.S. goods and services over two years while Washington agreed to roll back tariffs in stages on Chinese goods.
Trump, who has blamed China's early handling of the new coronavirus outbreak in its central city of Wuhan for thousands of U.S. deaths and millions of job losses, said last week he was ""very torn"" about whether to end the Phase 1 trade deal. Those comments came just hours after top trade officials from both countries pledged to press ahead with implementing the agreement.
'TSUNAMI OF ANGER' 
Rising U.S.-China tensions over the coronavirus outbreak have cast the trade deal and proposed talks on a Phase 2 deal into doubt.
The Trump administration asserted there was evidence the new coronavirus came from a Wuhan laboratory, an allegation that China has rejected. On Monday, a new source of tension opened up, with reports that the administration is planning to issue a warning that computer hackers tied to the Chinese government are attempting to steal information from U.S. researchers.
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The Global Times said malicious attacks by the United States have ignited a ""tsunami of anger"" among Chinese trade insiders after China made compromises in the Phase 1 pact.
""It's in fact in China's interests to terminate the current Phase 1 deal,"" a trade adviser to the Chinese government told the Global Times, citing the weakening U.S. economy and upcoming U.S. presidential elections. ""The U.S. now cannot afford to restart the trade war with China if everything goes back to the starting point.""
Clete Willems, a former White House trade adviser who took an active role in the U.S.-China negotiations, said China had followed through on the majority of the structural provisions in the Phase 1 deal, including new rules to protect intellectual property.

""I don't think we're at the point where we should give up on the deal. It has yielded positive results thus far,"" said Willems, who is now with the Akin Gump law firm in Washington.

California’s biggest oil producer will delay submitting its quarterly report to regulators until next month and ditched its guidance for the rest of this year because of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, the company said Monday in a filing. Tumbling demand for its crude forced the company to shut in the equivalent of 5,000 barrels a day of oil production.
“In the event the company is not successful in restructuring its balance sheet, there is substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern,” the Los Angeles-based explorer said.
California Resources has struggled to manage its debt since its spinoff from Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). in late 2014, during the early stages of a crash in crude prices. As recently as late March, the company was said to be seriously considering bankruptcy, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The shares have lost nearly three quarters of their value this year alone. Colony Capital (NYSE:CLNY) Inc., the hedge fund founded by Tom Barrack Jr., announced a $320 million deal last year to back California Resources.

(Reuters) -  Caesars Entertainment Corp  (O:CZR) missed quarterly revenue estimates on Monday as it shuttered its casinos amid nationwide lockdowns to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The gambling industry, which counts on air travel and large groups of people in close proximity, is one of the hardest hit from the restrictions imposed to check the health crisis.
""Our first-quarter performance reflects the significant revenue declines we experienced as a result of the closures and stable year-over-year labor costs in March,"" Chief Executive Officer Tony Rodio said in a statement.
He said the company was taking aggressive steps to strengthen its financial position, which included furloughing 90% of its employees in North America.
Caesars said almost all its casinos worldwide have been closed since March 17 and warned of an estimated daily cash burn of $9.3 million. As of March 31, it had more than $2.6 billion in liquidity.
SunTrust analyst Barry Jonas said investor focus is squarely on Caesars' current cash burn rate and the phased property reopening strategy.
The company said it would implement a phased reopening of its properties in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, Council Bluffs and Lake Tahoe.
In the first quarter, casino revenue fell 11.5% to $958 million. Net revenue fell 13.6% to $1.83 billion and missed analysts' average estimate of $2.04 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
Net income attributable to Caesars was $189 million in quarter ended March 31 compared with a loss of $217 million a year earlier.

On a per share basis, its loss rose to 36 cents per share from 32 cents per share a year ago.

(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) on Monday named insider Brett Hart as president of the airline, succeeding Scott Kirby (NYSE:KEX) who is due to take over the reins as chief executive next week in the midst of the airline industry's biggest crisis.
Chicago-based United had announced in December that Kirby would succeed Oscar Munoz as CEO under a transition the airline had hoped would secure a growth path after some tumultuous years.
But as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed air travel demand in the past two months, airlines including United have shifted their focus to survival.
""More than ever, United needs - and as CEO, I will need - an experienced, level-headed strategist who can help us continue to make smart decisions and aggressively manage this crisis,"" Kirby said in a memo to employees seen by Reuters. 
Like Kirby, Hart will temporarily waive his salary, a measure that several top airline leaders are taking in an effort to cut costs.
Hart joined United from Sara Lee in 2010 as general counsel and served as acting CEO for six months when Munoz received treatment for a heart transplant. Under his current role as chief administrative officer, Hart was responsible for matters ranging from legal and environmental affairs to corporate real estate, government affairs and corporate communications.
Under the leadership transition effective May 20, Munoz will take on the role of executive chairman. The role of chief administrative officer will not be replaced.

With House lawmakers away from Washington, the earliest possible vote would be Friday, and that schedule could slip into the next week.
The centerpiece of the Democrats’ virus relief plan is almost $1 trillion in to aid state and local governments. It’s also likely to include another round of cash payments to individuals following up on the $1,200 most people received from a March stimulus bill. Also under discussion are expanded unemployment benefits, money for Covid-19 testing, food stamp funding, rental assistance and student loan forgiveness.
Democrats have been debating among themselves for weeks about the contents of the legislation, with more moderate members arguing for a smaller bill with a more realistic chance of passage in the divided Congress and progressives seeking to use the bill to showcase plans to expand health insurance and climate change policies.
An expansive bill has little chance of getting Senate approval and President Donald Trump’s signature as drafted. Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have been saying there’s no need to rush another stimulus until the effects of the last bill can be evaluated.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, working with Senate Democrats, has been advocating a massive aid package to get the economy restarted.
“Speaker Pelosi and I agree, the bill should be big and it should be bold,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor Monday, warning that a second Great Depression without more stimulus. “Now is not the time for timidity”
In addition to voting on the stimulus legislation, Hoyer told Democrats they would be voting on rules changes to permit members to cast proxy votes for colleagues, and allow remote committee work.
When the stimulus legislation and the rules changes are brought to the House floor for votes, Hoyer told members the process probably will take most of that day as health precautions will continue to be in place.

Investing.com - Cannabis producer Tilray reported a wider-than-expected loss as a surge in costs offset revenue that more than doubled in the first quarter of the year, driven by stronger international medical sales.
Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) rose about 2% in after-hours trading.
In the first quarter of the year, Tilray reported  a loss of $1.70 a share, much worst than consensus estimates for a loss of $0.49 a share. Revenue rose 126% to $52.1 million topped estimates of $54.55 million.
The jump in revenue was driven by ""cannabis sales, which experienced meaningful increases across all channels with the exception of bulk, and the inclusion of the Manitoba Harvest acquisition for a full quarter in 2020 compared to a partial quarter in the prior year,"" the company said.
The miss on the bottom line comes as product costs jumped to $37.2 million from $17.3 million, weighing on margins, which fell 200 basis points to 21%.
""As evidenced by our International medical sales in the quarter, we expect this segment to demonstrate continued growth and positively impact margins. During and since the first quarter, we took significant steps to drive efficiencies across our business, enabling us to realize annualized cost savings of approximately $40 million compared to fourth quarter 2019 run rates. While the positive impact of these actions are not fully reflected in this quarter’s results, they will become more clearly evident over the course of this year,"" it added.
The international medical cannabis division produced sales that exceeded Canada medical sales by 43% in the quarter.
Total cannabis kilogram equivalents sold increased 92.4% to 5,794 kilograms from 3,012 kilograms in the first quarter of 2019, but the average cannabis selling price per gram decreased to $5.28 (C$7.16) compared to $5.60 (C$7.54) a year earlier amid a shift in product and channel mix.
""To date, the (c)ompany has not experienced any material Covid-19 impacts related to its ability to serve patients and consumers around the world with medical cannabis products, adult-use cannabis products in Canada, and Manitoba Harvest hemp products,""  Tilray said."

PARIS (Reuters) - At an Hermes (PA:HRMS) store on one of Paris's swankiest streets, shop assistants greeted customers through face masks on Monday with sanitiser gels and a polite refrain: ""May I refresh your hands?"" 
As France began to exit its strict coronavirus lockdown, many of its luxury brands also opened their doors, giving sanitary protocols a makeover and testing people's appetite for splurging after a shutdown that has rocked economies worldwide. 
At Louis Vuitton's store on Paris's grand Place Vendome square, which sells everything from 645 euro ($700) cocktail shakers to jewellery worth hundreds of thousands, a few local clients kept business ticking over. 
""It's a friend's birthday and we're buying her a wallet,"" said Paris resident Hajar. ""It'll be the first time we've seen each other in two months.""
At the Hermes shop on the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, there was even a semblance of business as usual.
A shop assistant discreetly kept count of the number of people milling around at any one time - around 50 at one point in early afternoon, across two floors.
And one shopper said she had been told to make an appointment if she wanted to discuss buying a pricey ""Kelly"" handbag. 
""They always make things difficult at Hermes,"" said Blessing Williams (NYSE:WMB), a 23-year-old model from Nigeria who lives in Paris. She still came away with a pair of sandals. 
But travel restrictions and the resulting dearth of international tourists will remain a major drag for months to come on luxury shopping capitals such as Paris, or Milan, where fashion firms are set to reopen stores on May 18.
Depending on the brand, foreign tourists usually make up between 35% and 55% of luxury labels' revenue in Europe, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Flavio Cereda. 
HANDBAGS IN QUARANTINE
In Germany, where small stores have been open for three weeks, well-heeled shoppers looking for luxury are still few and far between, suit maker Hugo Boss said last week.
The plush changing cabins at Vuitton's Vendome shop, now regularly disinfected, were a lot less busy than usual on Monday, assistants said on Monday. 
A nearby Chanel store was quieter than before the crisis too, staff said. Hermes boss Axel Dumas, mingling with employees at the Faubourg Saint-Honore shop, declined to comment on how the first few hours of trade had gone.
Despite signs of recovery in China, the industry's biggest market, global sales of luxury goods are expected to slump by up to 50% this year, the consultancy Bain forecast last week.
For now, brands are focused on easing into new hygiene routines, including making the use of face masks compulsory. 
At Vuitton in Paris, owned by the LVMH (PA:LVMH) conglomerate, clothes that are tried on are set aside to be steamed, and handbags are put in a 48-hour quarantine.
Cleaning protocols for other items vary, depending on how close they come to people's faces or the materials involved. 
Christian Dior, another LVMH label, and Chanel, a privately owned group, have also erected plexiglass shields by the tills.

Investing.com - The broader stock market finished flat today as worries about more virus infections after lockdown measures are eased dented sentiment.
Tomorrow investors will get more numbers on the inflation picture and there will be a host of Federal Reserve member comments to parse.
In commodities, the oil market will get a measure of U.S. stockpiles.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. CPI Expected to Fall
The market will get the latest numbers on retail inflation tomorrow.
The Labor Department will release the April consumer price index (CPI) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that the CPI fell 0.8% in April to an annual rate of 0.4%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is expected to have fallen 0.2% last month to an annual rate of 1.7%.
J.P. Morgan said today that investors should set aside worries about a surge in inflation sparked by stimulus from the Federal Reserve for the time being. Economies will go through a deflationary period before reflation, which won’t begin until the fourth quarter at the earliest, it said.
2. Lots of Fed Speak Scheduled
There are a host of Federal Reserve board members speaking tomorrow.
At 9:00 AM ET, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will both be giving speeches.
Kashkari has been less bullish on the economic recovery than those in the White House. Last week he said that the jobless rate will likely continue to climb and could get as high as 24%.
Over the weekend, Kashkari stressed that the recovery would be “slow and gradual” and that a robust recovery would require the development of a vaccine.
At 10:00 AM ET, Philly Fed President Patrick Harker and Fed Governor Randal Quarles will be speaking.
3. API Inventories on Tap
Oil prices settled lower today as concerns about new cases of Covid-19 globally canceled out the bullishness of Saudi Arabia cutting its output by an extra 1 million barrels per day.
Tomorrow the American Petroleum Institute will release its measure of U.S. oil inventories after the bell.
The API snapshot showed a rise of 8.4 million barrels last week.
A report from private consultancy Seevol on Monday suggested that stocks at the U.S. national hub of Cushing, Okla. had fallen by 2.17 million barrels last week."
631,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 04:35PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Brazil bank Banrisul aims to sell card business, close to hiring JPMorgan - sources","By Tatiana Bautzer and Carolina Mandl
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled bank Banrisul (SA:BRSR6) is in talks to sell its card business, as its controlling shareholder, the state of Rio Grande do Sul, struggles with a sharp drop in tax revenue, two sources with knowledge of the matter said.
The lender is expected to hire JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) over the next days to sell the business, added the sources, who asked for anonymity to disclose private discussions.
JPMorgan and Banrisul did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
The bank had filed for an initial public offering of its card unit two years ago, but gave up on the transaction in November 2018. At the time, the bank expected to reach a 2.5 billion-real ($432 million) valuation.
There is no clear indication so far of how exactly Banrisul plans to use the proceeds of the sale. Immediately after the Reuters report, shares of Banrisul extended gains to up to 3%. But they soon reversed course and were down 3.2%, at 11.96 reais, near market close. 
Banrisul Cartoes SA, the subsidiary that the bank plans to sell, had net income of 272 million reais ($47 million) last year, a 5% increase over 2018. To be able to get the same amount expected for the IPO, Banrisul would have to find an investor that would pay 10 times earnings, a difficult task amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
Last year, Banrisul Cartoes' credentialed retailers had 29.5 billion reais in transactions with debit and credit cards, 10% above the previous year.
Due to a sharp drop in tax revenue, the state of Rio Grande do Sul is delaying payments to its civil servants. Tax revenue dropped 15% in March and is expected to fall 30% in April. State employees receive their salaries up to 45 days late.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 closed barely higher, eking out a nominal gain on Monday as investors weighed new spikes in coronavirus infections with expectations that an economy crippled by mandated shutdowns will soon be re-opened for business.
Technology and healthcare shares provided the biggest lift to all three major U.S. stock indexes and led the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its sixth consecutive advance. 
The blue-chip Dow lost ground.
The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average remain within 20% of all-time highs reached in February, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is within 10% of its closing record. 
Indeed, despite bleak recent economic data, including Friday's 20.2 million drop in U.S. payrolls, Wall Street has gained in recent weeks as investors look beyond pandemic to recovery.
""Investors have been buying equities given the realistic expectation that massive fiscal and monetary stimulus will reignite economic and profit growth,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""There is still a fair amount of optimism in the markets, but this could be quelled if coronavirus cases re-emerge."" 
But a surge of new coronavirus infections in Germany and South Korea suggested early efforts to lift restrictions could be premature, even as businesses around the world, shuttered by social distancing restrictions, begin re-opening their doors. 
""There's really no playbook for a health crisis like the world is now experiencing,"" Carter added. ""With no playbook, there's much less certainty and markets are more likely to vacillate.""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 109.33 points, or 0.45%, to 24,221.99, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 0.39 points, or 0.01%, to 2,930.19 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 71.02 points, or 0.78%, to 9,192.34.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, four closed in the black, with healthcare (SPXHC) enjoying the largest percentage gain.
First-quarter earnings season is nearing the final stretch, with 440 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 67.5% have beaten Wall Street estimates, according to Refinitiv data.
In aggregate, S&P 500 earnings are seen to have dropped by 12.1% in the first quarter, compared with a year ago.
Drug distributor  Cardinal Health  Inc (N:CAH) jumped 6.7% as the pandemic boosted third-quarter sales.
Chesapeake Energy Corp (N:CHK) slid 12.2% after it said bankruptcy is among the options under consideration as the shale driller copes with plummeting oil and gas prices.
Marriott (O:MAR) missed first-quarter profit margins by a wide margin as bookings plunged. The hotel operator's shares lost 5.6%.
Shares of  Under Armour  Inc (N:UAA) plunged 9.7% after the athletic wear company forecast a 50% to 60% drop in the second quarter as many of its stores remain shuttered.
Packaged food company  General Mills  (N:GIS) said it expects to surpass its fiscal 2020 sales expectations as consumers stock their pantries amid lockdowns, sending its stock up 1.8%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.68-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.20-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted 18 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 104 new highs and 10 new lows.

Investing.com – The Dow closed in the red on Monday, but well above session lows, as a rise in healthcare and technology stocks helped offset weakness in financials as fears of a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections reined in recent optimism over a quicker economic recovery as states continue to lift restrictions. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.45%, or 109 points, but had been down about 270 points at the lows of the day. The S&P 500 edged up 0.01%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.78%.
Healthcare stocks were among the biggest gainers of the day, led by Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), up 4%.  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) was up 13%.
Both companies lead the pack of drugmakers in the race to produce potential Covid-19 therapies and vaccines, which would support the long road to global economic recovery at a time when many are concerned that the lifting of restrictions may trigger a second wave of infections.
South Korea and Germany have reported an increase in infections after lifting restrictive measures to contain the virus.
In a speech following the closer, President Donald Trump hailed the sharp increase in Covid-19 testing across the nation. Testing in the U.S. increased 100% to 300,000 per a day, double the number of tests three weeks ago.
A rise in FAANG stocks, meanwhile, also helped the broader market's comeback from session lows as investors continued to bet that companies sporting solid balance sheets and resilient demand are seemingly better set up for the economic uncertainty ahead.
Chip stocks were also in demand, powered by a jump in shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) following a price target raise on Wall Street.
Nvidia rose more than 3% after Needham boosted its price target on the stock to $360 from $270 on expectations that increased demand for gaming and an uptick in data center spending will boost performance.
The rise in tech helped keep a lid on losses after banking stocks came under pressure as some fear a longer-than-expected economic recovery could increase credit losses for banks. Expectations that the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate could turn negative by April next year also weighed.
JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) fell 2.8%, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) slipped 4.2% and  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) was down 4.9%.
Lower interest rates weigh on a bank's net interest margin, the difference between the interest income generated by banks and the amount of interest paid out to their lenders.
On the earnings front,  Under Armour  (NYSE:UAA) slumped about 9.4% after reporting that first-quarter sales fell 23% as the Covid-19 pandemic forced the retailer shuttered its stores. 
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) fell 5.5% after missing first-quarter earnings estimates as the pandemic has halted travel and tourism demand."

The company said it intends to use the proceeds to support its portfolio of global leisure, holiday and travel businesses that have been affected by the impact of the coronavirus.
Shares of Virgin Galactic, which have gained 69% this year, were down 3.1% at $19.54 in afternoon trade.

The company, which aims to offer the first commercial space flight later this year, said in April it would keep running as a critical infrastructure business during the pandemic.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc sued local authorities in California on Saturday as the electric carmaker pushed to re-open its factory there and Chief Executive Elon Musk threatened to move Tesla's headquarters and future programs from the state to Texas or Nevada.
Musk has been pushing to re-open Tesla's Fremont, California, factory after Alameda County's health department said the carmaker must not reopen because local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect.
In a blog post on Saturday, Tesla said the county's position left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure Tesla and its employees can go back to work.
The company said it had worked out a thorough return-to-work plan that includes online video training for personnel, work zone partition areas, temperature screening, requirements to wear protective equipment and rigorous cleaning and disinfecting protocols.
The company said it had informed health authorities in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is located, about its restart plans, but claimed the acting official did not return calls or emails.
Alameda County's Public Health Department, which earlier on Saturday said it had been ""communicating directly and working closely with the Tesla team,"" did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla filed a lawsuit against the county in San Francisco federal court on Saturday, calling the continued restrictions a ""power-grab"" by the county since California's governor had said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen. 
The company said Alameda was going against the federal and California constitutions, as well as defying the governor's order, the lawsuit said. 
Alameda County is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May, with only essential businesses allowed to reopen. The county said it does not consider Tesla an essential business. County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. 
The outspoken Musk also took to Twitter on Saturday to complain and threatened to leave the state. 
""If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future,"" he tweeted, referring to the San Francisco Bay area facility that is Tesla's only U.S. vehicle factory.
Alameda County said on Saturday that it has been working with Tesla to develop a safety plan that ""allows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees"" that work at the factory and that it looks forward to coming to an agreement on a safety plan very soon. 
Fremont Mayor Lily Mei expressed concern about the potential economic implications of continuing the shelter-in-place order without provisions for manufacturers such as Tesla to resume. Mei on Saturday urged the county to work with businesses on ""acceptable guidelines for re-opening.""
Musk had told employees on Thursday that limited production would restart at Fremont on Friday afternoon.
Tesla last year built nearly half a million vehicles at the Fremont plant and moving the entire production facility would be a massive undertaking. 
Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, on Saturday estimated it could take the company 12 to 18 months to relocate production.
The threat to relocate the facility comes as Tesla aims to ramp up production at Fremont of its Model Y sport utility vehicle, which it expects to generate record demand and profit margins.
Musk, who sparred with California officials in March over whether Tesla had to halt production at Fremont, had criticized the lockdown and stay-at-home orders, calling them a ""serious risk"" to U.S. business and ""unconstitutional.""

Tesla shares have risen 127% since March 18, their recent closing low, including a 16.8% gain in the last trading week to close at $819.42 on Friday.

638,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 02:15PM ET</span>",More countries likely to have credit ratings cut: S&P Global,"LONDON (Reuters) - Governments around the world are likely to face more credit rating cuts as the economic cost of the coronavirus continues to take its toll, S&P Global said on Monday.
S&P has reviewed 90 countries, over two-thirds of those it rates since early March, either downgrading or cutting the outlook in almost half of the cases. 
It now has 25 countries on negative outlooks - effectively a downgrade warning - compared to just six on positive outlooks and 104 on stable outlooks.
""We think more negative rating actions are likely,"" two of S&P's senior analysts wrote in a new report, estimating that the average government deficit this year would be around 6.3%. 
""Over the medium to long term, we could see negative rating pressure build up, even for some of the ratings we affirmed, if we see the effects of the pandemic becoming structural and likely to have longer-term negative implications that would make recovery of fiscal profiles slower than expected.""

639,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 11, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Trump in ‘No Rush’ on Aid After 20 Million Jobs Lost,"(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump declared Friday he’s in no hurry for Congress to pass more stimulus measures to help the economy, hours after the Labor Department announced an unprecedented 20 million jobs were lost in April.
“We’re in no rush,” Trump said while meeting with about two dozen House Republicans, who spent an hour taking turns complimenting and congratulating the president for his response to the coronavirus outbreak that’s cratered the economy.
Congressional Democrats, Trump said, “want things, and we’re happy with what’s gone on -- we got what we needed. But at the same time, we want to do what’s right for the country.”
Trump signed a $2.2 trillion stimulus into law in late March that’s provided payroll support to small businesses, $1,200 direct payments to families and boosted unemployment checks for millions of people out of work. The small business program’s initial $350 billion was retopped with $310 billion last month. But Democrats have said the federal government needs to assist states facing huge budget shortfalls, as well as directing more aid to struggling families and small businesses.
The earlier rounds of stimulus were passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis, as Congress anticipated massive job losses from the social-distancing practices Americans adopted to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, has said the next relief package should be “big and bold,” but she faces a divide in her party between between liberals who want an expansive package and moderates in tightly contested districts who want to compromise with Republicans.
Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, described talks about a next round of stimulus as “in a lull right now” in remarks on Friday following the jobs report.
“We just had another big infusion. We put all this money in, which is fine,” Kudlow told reporters at the White House. “It’s well worth it. Let’s see what happens.”
Jared Kushner, a Trump adviser and the president’s son-in-law, told Fox Business Network that the president is “looking at a lot of ideas,” holding discussions with his economic team and has various plans that can be put in place.
“We’ve seen a lot of data -- some, obviously, is encouraging -- and we want to see the results of the tremendous and historic programs that we put in place before we decide what we want to do in the next step,” Kushner said in the interview.
Republicans face divisions over how to proceed.
Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who faces a difficult re-election contest in November, said Friday on Twitter that Congress should “act now” to provide state and local aid and prevent furloughs of government employees.
Trump and some Senate Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have said they oppose aid to states with large pension obligations or other financial problems that predate the coronavirus outbreak. McConnell has suggested states be allowed to declare bankruptcy, a proposal met with outrage from Democrats and some Republicans who say the financial consequences would be devastating.
Republicans are seeking their own new coronavirus measures, including liability protections for businesses that bring workers back to the job.
And Trump seeks new tax cuts, including reducing or eliminating payroll taxes and capital gains taxes, which he says will encourage hiring and investment. He’s also proposed restoring deductions for business entertainment at restaurants, to benefit the restaurant industry, and expanding write-offs for businesses’ capital expenses.
Most of those measures are at least regarded skeptically by Democrats, if not outright opposed, and will require concessions to Pelosi and her allies.

643,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Pandemic could rip 105 billion pound hole in small company finances,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's smaller companies could be saddled with up to 105 billion pounds ($129 billion) in ""unsustainable"" debt by March next year that will need recapitalising, a financial services body told the Bank of England on Monday.
TheCityUK, which promotes Britain's financial services sector, said in a letter to BoE Governor Andrew Bailey that businesses will require full-scale recapitalisation to alleviate the hit to employment from the pandemic, which is set to trigger the UK's worst economic downturn in 300 years.
TheCityUK is assessing the likely demand for fresh capital, how much of it the private sector could provide, and explore ways with government and the BoE to plug any shortfall.
The main focus is on unlisted small and medium sized firms that all together employ 16 million people and generate turnover of over 2 trillion pounds. Many have had to close during a nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of the coronavirus and even when they reopen demand is still expected to be depressed by the economic impact of the virus.
A preliminary analysis showed that the level of unsustainable debt in the sector could be between 90 billion pounds and 105 billion pounds by March 2021, TheCityUK said.
""Our preliminary work suggests our main focus should be forbearance and restructuring and the recapitalisation of companies using equity or equity-like instruments,"" it said.
Some 10 billion to 20 billion pounds of the unsustainable debt could be in the form of government-backed loans now being provided to SMEs, TheCityUK said, in an indication of size of stakes that could potentially end up in public hands.
TheCityUK said it will set out options in June for further discussion with the government and the central bank.
""We hope our work will provide a firm foundation and a transparent evidence base to support rapid action if and where needed,"" it said.

647,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 11, 2020 12:18PM ET</span>",Gold ETFs Luring Record Amounts of Cash Despite Risk-Asset Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are continuing to pour cash into gold exchange-traded funds, with 2020 inflows already exceeding any full year on record even as stocks post their biggest earnings-season rally in six years.
ETFs tracking the precious metal, seen as a safe haven during economic downturns, have attracted $14.5 billion in less than five months, topping the $11.7 billion that flowed into the funds in 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The biggest contributor to the gains is State Street’s SPDR Gold Share ETF, ticker GLD (NYSE:GLD), which saw its best month of inflows since 2009 in April and has taken in an additional $1.4 billion in May. BlackRock’s iShares Gold Trust, ticker IAU, is just shy of its yearly record with $3.7 billion in inflows so far this year.
“There is still skepticism in the market,” said Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs for WallachBeth Capital. “I think investors are using it as a hedge just in case equities do pull back.”
Money continued to flow into the funds as U.S. stocks rallied more than 30% from their March lows. Unprecedented stimulus and lower interest rates to mitigate the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic has stoked demand for risk assets, including equities.
The Federal Reserve has allocated $2.3 trillion of credit through nine programs so far, backed by $215 billion of Treasury funds, sparking worries of currency debasement. Some investors are also concerned that the stock rebound will fade as economic data paints an increasingly dreary picture of the pandemic’s impact, with 20.5 million jobs lost in April, and President Donald Trump reignites threats of tariffs on China.
Last week, gold holdings in ETFs rose to more than 3,000 tons, an all-time high, as year-to-date inflows already surpass the volume added during 2019.
Gold ETFs are typically used in a buy-and-hold fashion, whereas gold futures and options usually attract speculative investors. So the gold ETF flows show investors are concerned about the inflation risk the pandemic has caused in the long run.
“We haven’t seen inflation in a long, long time, but the Fed just continues to say they will keep rates low as long as they don’t see inflation,” said Sandy Villere, portfolio manager at Villere Balanced Fund. “All the money that is sloshing around and the ridiculous amount of jobs that have been lost, those jobs could come right back and then you have an extreme amount of stimulus. With all that cash in the economy, you could see some form of overheating.”

The government plans to introduce a quarantine period for most people arriving from abroad to try to avoid a second peak of the coronavirus outbreak, but has not given a clear indication of when it will be introduced or for how long it will last.
The measures might result in the continued grounding of planes, airport and airline bosses said in a letter to government, adding they did not know whether this was an intended outcome of the move as there had been no consultation with the sector.
""An open-ended quarantine, with no set end-date, will make an already critical situation for UK aviation, and all the businesses we support, even worse,"" said the letter, signed by industry associations for airlines and airports as well as the chief executives of easyJet (L:EZJ) and Heathrow Airport.
""People will simply choose not to travel to and from the UK ... In short, passenger travel cannot restart."" 
easyJet has grounded its fleet in response to travel restrictions and low demand, but some airlines are beginning to restart flights.
Earlier on Monday, Wizz Air's (L:WIZZ) chief executive told Reuters he needed more details on British quarantine plans before being able to assess its impact after seeing strong demand for the routes it has started operating. The the boss of British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) has also raised concerns about the quarantine plan.
The letter said there was no clarity on the scientific advice underpinning the proposals, its geographic scope or whether it only applied to air travel. The foreign minister said that ports and airports were included in the proposals, and France has said it would be excluded from the measures.
The letter added that aviation needed ""a road-map to normality"" and any quarantine should be as short as possible, saying other measures could be used instead.
""We are working at pace with Government to agree a set of new, effective health protocols guided by the science (such as face masks and temperature checks) and which can be implemented at UK airports and onboard as soon as possible,"" it said. 
Asked about support for the aviation sector in parliament on Monday, Johnson said that companies had access to schemes designed to support businesses more broadly.
""We will do everything we can to ... keep Britain flying and get Britain flying again,"" he said.

649,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 12:10PM ET</span>",Spanish banks reopen branches with staff gradually returning to work,"By Jesús Aguado
MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish banks such as BBVA (MC:BBVA) and Santander (MC:SAN) are reopening branches and letting staff return to work, although employees at their headquarters will still mainly work remotely as the country starts to ease lockdown measures.
BBVA, one of the first banks in Spain to move staff out of Madrid to protect against the coronavirus outbreak, on Monday said about 200 employees at its corporate centre in critical functions would return to their offices this week.
""They include a part of the global markets team in the trading room of CIB (Corporate and Investment Banking) and infrastructure/operational employees in the engineering area, among others,"" it said in a statement.
However, BBVA said 98% of BBVA's HQ employees in Spain - around 7,000 people - would continue working remotely. 
At Santander, the euro zone's second-biggest lender in terms of market value, almost all its workforce at the corporate centres in Spain - around 10,000 people - are still working from home, a source with knowledge of the matter said. 
Spain has so far reported nearly 27,000 deaths, one of the highest fatality rates in the world, with about half of Spain's 47 million people progressing to the so-called Phase 1 of a four-step plan to relax the lockdowns on Monday.
BBVA reopened 250 branches in Spain between this and last week and by the end of this week, 3,300 employees from the branch network in Spain will be working onsite, 21% of the total workforce.
The bank has drafted a return-to-work plan based on five principles, focused on safety for all employees returning gradually to their normal workplaces.
""The only employees to return to work will be those who have not tested positive, are symptom-free, and are neither in quarantine nor part of a high-risk group,"" it said.
BBVA also said it would follow an approach that included serology testing and PCR virus detection.
Santander reopened 189 offices on Monday, around 60% of its 1,900 branches in Spain, the source said. Santander declined to comment.
State-owned  Bankia  (MC:BKIA) also aims to gradually increase the number of employees currently working at branches to 60% of its total workforce over the next weeks, a spokeswoman said. She expected around a third of the current 1,900 employees at its headquarters in Madrid to return to work in about four weeks.
""The de-escalation at the HQ starts on May 18 but with employees having to sit 2 metres apart from each other, this allows us to reach a third of our regular workforce there.""
Caixabank, the country's third-largest lender, which kept open 90% of its network, expects by the end of May to have 75% of its staff working in branches compared to 50%. Working remotely will remain the preferred option at its HQ, it said.

On Monday, Sabadell (MC:SABE), the fifth biggest bank by assets, reopened 146 branches bringing the total to 1,441, with around 65% of the lender's staff working from home, it said.

650,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 11, 2020 12:09PM ET</span>",Johnson’s Call to Get Business Moving Draws Alarm and Confusion,"(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s call to get Britain back to work should have been music to the ears of desperate business owners. Instead, there was mostly confusion as the country figures out how to do it.
With every day of lockdown making it harder to salvage a stricken economy, companies are looking at how to keep workers apart on factory floors and on building sites. It comes after Johnson told people who can’t do their job from home to return to their workplace, though to avoid public transportation, maintain social distancing and wear a face covering in enclosed spaces.
Yet the response from business groups and unions wasn’t encouraging as concerns remain over the threat of the coronavirus. Some have told members to stay put until safety issues have been addressed, undermining the message that the U.K. is about to emerge from its economic stupor.
Britain has recorded almost 32,000 deaths, the most in the world after the U.S. A study of fatalities by the Office for National Statistics published on Monday found that low-skilled construction workers, security guards, bus drivers and chefs were among the most at risk.
Seeking Clarity
Johnson’s government is already under fire for being slow to act on the virus threat. Now the complaints are of mixed messages, unclear guidance and rules that don’t apply to the entire country.
Scotland broke with London last month on how to manage a return to normal business, setting out its criteria in documents while the U.K. government balked at making any public statements. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who runs the administration in Edinburgh, said the “stay at home” message would continue in Scotland.
The government has promised to provide detailed guidelines to different types of companies on how to adapt to make sure they are “Covid secure.” The papers are expected to be released later today, Johnson said. A separate document outlining arrangements for public transport is promised for Tuesday.
Without more information on how to keep staff safe, it would be foolish for any business leader to encourage non-essential staff to return, said Richard Burge, chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. “My strong and unequivocal advice to London businesses is not to change your plans” for now, Burge told the body’s 2,000 members earlier.
Mitigating Risk
Businesses are clamoring for advice on everything from whether factory workers can be less than two meters apart to what standard of protective equipment they should buy, and how to procure it without causing shortages in the National Health Service.
Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. said it has no plan to bring forward a restart to production at the country’s largest car plant from early June. Honda Motor Co. expects to announce a date for its Swindon assembly plant not before Wednesday, said a person familiar with the company’s plans.
The situation is bleaker for pubs and restaurants, where social distancing is harder to enforce. Johnson said some hospitality venues might be able to open doors to customers from July.
“They’re obviously going to be bigger ones like hotels and it’s going to be a bit of a disaster for us,” said Chix Chandaria, 51, who owns the Wine Parlour bar in Brixton, south London. “We’re hoping we can reopen the business, but we won’t be able to if we have to let our team go because we have no income.”
Retailers took issue with the government’s plan to allow smaller stores to open first. British Retail Consortium Chief Executive Helen Dickinson said stores should reopen when they can do so safely, not based on their size.
Shops in local areas are likely to reopen first, and that’s bad for stores in city centers that need lots of shoppers as they have the highest rents to pay, said Alistair McGeorge, non-executive chairman of New Look Retailers Ltd, the fashion chain.
“I worry about city centers in the long term as there will be fewer travelers and fewer office workers as more people work from home,” said McGeorge.
New Era
Companies have spent the lockdown trying to redesign office plans and manufacturing processes to keep their employees at a safe distance. What they can’t do is prevent infections while traveling to work in crowded public transport or eliminate every risk on site.
Even if no one falls sick, some managers worry the tiniest lapse in health guidelines will leave them exposed to costly litigation.
“It’s vital that the guidance is clear so that companies can plan how to return safely,” said Jonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors. “As people with ultimate legal responsibility, directors need to have confidence that it’s safe, and that if they act responsibly they won’t be at undue risk.”
There was some signs that Britain’s workforce was heeding Johnson’s “back-to-work” message as the week began. Traffic was noticeably busier and there were more pedestrians on the street as people took on board the government’s advice to avoid public transport where possible.
However, London Bridge Station, where peak hour commuters regularly have to queue to get onto the subway, was almost empty and workers tried to respect social distancing rules. The Jubilee underground line was quiet, with people spread out, as was the District line heading west to the City financial district.
Building Sites
Construction workers were back on site at Admiralty Arch, a luxury hotel project. In the City, piling was underway at 40 Leadenhall Street, an office project nicknamed Gotham City.
Some workers from utility firms and construction firms were ignoring the social distancing advice and huddling outside the sites, and use of masks was still the exception rather than the rule.
Almost three-quarters of major building sites in England and Wales were already open last week, operating at reduced productivity, said industry group BuildUK. Weston Homes said Monday it was reopening construction sites valued at 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) in England’s southeast.
Aware of Britain’s stringent laws on workplace health, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers urged members to “refuse to work” where safety is compromised.

Americans saw better than 50-50 odds of higher stock prices over the next year for the first time since data collection began in 2013, according to results of a monthly New York Fed consumer survey collected in April and published Monday. At the same time, expectations for growth in earnings, total household income and consumer spending all fell to the lowest levels in the survey’s seven-year history.
The results highlight the disparate impact the coronavirus pandemic is having on the stock market and the labor market. The S&P 500 Index of shares in large U.S. companies has mostly stabilized about 14% below February’s record high -- thanks in part to the U.S. central bank’s aggressive efforts to pump liquidity into financial markets -- while more than 33 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment insurance benefits over the last seven weeks.
In the survey, nearly 32% of respondents said they expected their own financial situations to be worse a year from now, marking the highest level in seven years of data. In February, that number was just 10.5%.

653,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Toyota to cut North American output by 29% through October,"By Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) -  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp plans to slash production in North America by nearly a third through October due to the coronavirus crisis and expects it will take some time for output to return to normal, a person familiar with the matter said.
Toyota will build about 800,000 vehicles, including its RAV4 SUV crossovers and Camry sedans, at plants in the United States, Canada and Mexico from April through to the end of October, the person told Reuters. 
That's down 29% from the Japanese automaker's output in the same seven months of 2019 and 32% lower than its forecast in January for production during the period.
The source declined to be identified because the information is not public.
A Toyota spokeswoman declined to comment on production plans. 
The drop in Toyota's production highlights the pain for carmakers around the world due to the fallout from the virus. Besides weak demand, problems with procurement and social distancing measures at plants are also expected to hit output.
Analysts expect a slow and patchy recovery from the pandemic to curtail spending while social distancing may also curb the need for some to commute, dampening the need for new cars.
Toyota is gradually resuming output at its seven North American sites from Monday. 
Its production in many countries ground to a halt in mid-March as governments locked down economies, forcing factories to close as workers were unable to commute.
The source said Toyota plans to keep May production at less than 10% of last year's levels - after zero output in April - before ramping up to normal levels in July. 
By September, monthly vehicle production will be outpacing levels the previous year, as Toyota catches up with lost output.
North America is a major production centre for Toyota with the United States alone accounting for about 14% of its global output in 2019, making it the carmaker's third-largest factory hub after Japan and China.

Toyota announces its full-year financial results on Tuesday.

654,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>","As U.S. meat workers fall sick and supplies dwindle, exports to China soar","By Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump ordered meat processing plants to stay open to protect the nation's food supply even as workers got sick and died. Yet the plants have increasingly been exporting to China while U.S. consumers face shortages, a Reuters analysis of government data showed.
Trump, who is in an acrimonious public dispute with Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, invoked the 1950 Defense Production Act on April 28 to keep plants open. Now he is facing criticism from some lawmakers, consumers and plant employees for putting workers at risk in part to help ensure China's meat supply. 
""We know that over time exports are critically important. I think we need to focus on meeting domestic demand at this point,"" said Mike Naig, the agriculture secretary in the top U.S. pork-producing state of Iowa who supported Trump's order.
Processors including Smithfield Foods, owned by China's WH Group (OTC:WHGLY) Ltd, Brazilian-owned JBS USA and  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) temporarily closed about 20 U.S. meat plants as the virus infected thousands of employees, prompting meatpackers and grocers to warn of shortages. Some plants have resumed limited operations as workers afraid of getting sick stay home. 
The disruptions mean consumers could see 30% less meat in supermarkets by the end of May, at prices 20% higher than last year, according to Will Sawyer, lead economist at agricultural lender CoBank.
While pork supplies tightened as the number of pigs slaughtered each day plunged by about 40% since mid-March, shipments of American pork to China more than quadrupled over the same period, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. https://tmsnrt.rs/2YLF1XN
Smithfield, which China's WH Group bought for $4.7 billion in 2013, was the biggest U.S. exporter to China from January to March, according to Panjiva, a division of S&P Global Market Intelligence. Smithfield shipped at least 13,680 tonnes by sea in March, Panjiva said, citing its most recent data. 
Smithfield, the world's biggest pork processor, said in April that U.S. plant closures were pushing retailers ""perilously close to the edge"" on supplies.
The company is now retooling its namesake pork plant in Smithfield, Virginia, to supply fresh pork, bacon and ham to more U.S. consumers, according to a statement. The move is an about-face after the company reconfigured the plant last year to process hog carcasses for the Chinese market, employees, local officials and industry sources told Reuters.
The Virginia facility currently serves export markets like China and domestic customers, according to Smithfield. Most U.S. pork processors routinely export products to more than 40 international markets, company spokeswoman Keira Lombardo said. 
The virus infected about 850 employees at another Smithfield pork plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Across the U.S. industry, about 5,000 infections and 20 deaths occurred, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
""That tragic outcome is all the worse when the food being processed is not going to our nation's families,"" said U.S. Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut. ""That is what the Defense Production Act is all about: protecting America's national interests, not China's.""
Pork processor Fresh Mark resumed making bacon and ham for global customers at a Salem, Ohio, plant it shut in April over coronavirus cases.
""If we start having a shortage in America, I think it should stay here,"" said Bruce Fatherly, a maintenance worker at the plant and member of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.
Fresh Mark said exports are a small part of its business. 
WHOLE HOGS
The supply concerns could not have been foreseen when Trump signed a deal in January to ease a trade war he started with Beijing two years earlier. China promised to increase purchases of U.S. farm goods by at least $12.5 billion in 2020 and $19.5 billion in 2021, over the 2017 level of $24 billion.
The White House declined to comment. The USDA and U.S. Trade Representative's office did not respond to requests for comment.
China increased its purchases because of its dire need for protein after a pig disease called African swine fever led to the death of half the country's herd over the past two years. Beijing lifted a nearly five-year ban on U.S. chicken imports in November and also waived retaliatory tariffs on meat shipments to help boost supplies.
Year-to-date, about 31% of U.S. pork has been exported, totaling about 838,000 tonnes, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. One-third of that volume went to China, accounting for more than 10% of total first-quarter production, the industry group said.
Carcasses, which include most of the pig, were the top product shipped to China in January and February, according to USDA. Loads also include feet and organs that many Americans do not eat.
Exports to China set a record for the period from January to March, and shipments to all destinations in March set a record for any month, according to USDA.
JBS, which produces pork, beef and chicken, told Reuters it reduced exports to focus on meeting U.S. demand during the pandemic. About 280 employees at a JBS beef plant in Greeley, Colorado, have been infected with the virus, and seven died, union officials said. 
""I think we need to take care of our country and our needs first,"" said Kim Cordova, president of the local United Food and Commercial Workers International Union that represents plant employees.
Tyson Foods did not respond to requests for comment about exports. 
Suppliers like Tyson have limited meat products for retailers because of plant closures. Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co and Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST), meanwhile, restricted shoppers' meat purchases.
U.S. farmers, who struggled financially during the trade war with Beijing, say they still need importing countries, including China, to buy their pork. Prior the pandemic, they grappled with an oversupply of hogs. 

""There's enough meat for all channels if we could get these plants back up and rolling,"" said Brian Duncan, a hog farmer and vice president of the Illinois Farm Bureau.

Jozsef Varadi, the chief executive of budget Hungarian carrier Wizz, said on Monday that one option to lower the impact of any quarantine would be to make exemptions for those travellers who had recently tested negative for the virus. 
Britain has announced a new restriction with a 14-day quarantine requirement on most people arriving into the country by air, saying more details including the timing of the programme would come shortly.
Varadi said that it would be logical for the government to allow exemptions to the rule if passengers had had a verified negative test for coronavirus in the days prior to travelling, as happens in other countries where Wizz flies which have quarantine rules. 

""We need to understand what it means and what waivers or exemptions will be permitted, we don't know yet,"" Varadi said in an online interview.

Despite optimism that the U.S.-China trade-war truce will broadly hold, last week was a losing one for both stocks and currencies, while local bonds were little changed. And the list of uncertainties in the week ahead is likely to ensure caution remains in the driving seat.
China’s central bank said on the weekend it will resort to “more powerful” policies to counter the hit that the developing world’s biggest economy has suffered from the Covid-19 outbreak. As distressed-debt levels rise across emerging markets, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa called for African countries to be allowed a two-year moratorium to provide them with the fiscal space to fight the fallout from the pandemic.
“After an initial bounce in activity after the opening of lockdowns, several factors are likely to restrain the recovery: high debt, corporate defaults, inefficient labor markets, de-globalization and China-U.S. tensions,” David Hauner, a London-based strategist at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC)., wrote in a report. “The experience with the opening up in China implies caution for risk appetite in the rest of emerging markets.”

While a number of countries are moving toward easing restrictions, the impact of lockdowns is likely to weigh on markets for some time yet. China, Mexico and the Philippines reported economic contractions last quarter.
“The state of national lockdowns, securing new sovereign finance, disbursing announced stimulus and the full horror of disruption as seen through corporate results will continue to drive markets,” said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer in Dubai.

658,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>","Under Armour warns 2nd quarter revenue could more than halve, shares tank","By Nivedita Balu
(Reuters) -  Under Armour  Inc (N:UA) (N:UAA) forecast on Monday a 50% to 60% drop in second-quarter revenue as most of its stores remained closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, sending the athletic apparel maker's shares down about 11%. 
The Baltimore-based company also reported bigger-than-expected loss for the first quarter and revenue that missed Wall Street estimates. 
About 80% of Under Armour's business around the world remained closed since April, Chief Financial Officer David Bergman said, even as most of its own stores and wholesale operations in Asia have already reopened.
""Although we do anticipate that our business will gradually reopen in the coming weeks and months, we believe there will be a number of challenges ahead for us,"" Bergman told analysts.
Bergman cited uncertainty how much consumers will spend once stores reopen and a threat of deep discounts retailers may offer to woo shoppers back.
Last month, the company temporarily laid off about 600 staff at its U.S.-based distribution centers, extended store closures, and withdrew its forecast for the year. 
Several retail and department stores, including Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney that are on the brink of bankruptcy, that sell Under Armour merchandise were also closed during the last few weeks of the quarter. 
The brand was already struggling with competition from the likes of  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and  Lululemon Athletica  (O:LULU) which have been able to attract more shoppers with their new launches, limited edition products and ad campaigns. 
""Under Armour's brand position in North America was stressed going into the crisis, but performance in the region in Q1 was even worse than we expected, given that stores were open until mid-March,"" Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman said.
In North America, its biggest segment which accounted for about 65% of total sales in the quarter, revenue slumped 28% to $609 million. 
Overall, net revenue fell about 23% to $930.2 million in the first quarter ended March 31. 
Under Armour reported a net loss of $589.7 million, or $1.30 per share, compared with a profit of 5 cents per share, a year earlier. 
Analysts had forecast revenue of $949 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Exluding one-time items, Under Armour reported a loss of 34 cents per share, compared with analysts' expectations of a 19 cent loss.
The company expects to reduce its originally planned operating expenses for the year by about $325 million.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened the week in negative mood, as concerns about the persistent risk of renewed outbreaks of the coronavirus prompted fears that the rally in recent weeks may have gone too far, too fast.
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 207 points, or 0.9% at 24,124 points. The S&P 500was down 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%. 
The mood was overshadowed by reports suggesting multiple White House staff had either contracted or been exposed to the Coronavirus, including vice-president Mike Pence. Negative earnings reports from hotel operator Marriott and concern about Tesla's falling sales in China also weighed. Tesla  (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock opened 3.4% lower.
The catastrophic labor market report for April, which showed that over 20 million American jobs were shed last month, may have been shrugged off initially, but a weekend of reflection appears to have made investors more skeptical of the narrative that an early reopening of the economy will bring a swift rebound.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts are now predicting the S&P 500 could fall by some 18% over the next three months.
""A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,” Goldman Sachs chief equity strategist David Kostin wrote in a weekly note to clients. 
The AAII investor sentiment survey at the end of last week had showed only 23.7% of investors were still bullish about stocks at their current levels, a decline of nearly seven percentage points from the previous week. That compared to nearly 53% of respondents who were bearish. 
Against that backdrop, bank stocks weakened as investors gave more credence to speculation that U.S. interest rates could dip below zero next year.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) stock fell 4.8% and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) stock fell 3.0%.
Airline stocks also fell sharply against a backdrop of United Airlines Holdings  (NASDAQ:UAL) canceling a proposed sale of new debt at the end of last week (the stock was down 6.8%), while Boeing  (NYSE:BA) stock fell 3.5% after Qantas pushed back the timeline for taking delivery of the new aircraft it had ordered.
Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) stock fell 5.8% after the hotel operator warned that room occupancy had not meaningfully rebounded in Greater China since lockdowns were lifted there. First-quarter earnings and revenue fell short of expectations that had already been sharply revised down.
Elsewhere, U.S. crude oil futures rose 1.0% to $25.05 after Saudi Arabia said it will voluntarily cut output by another 1 million barrels a day to under 8 million b/d. The international benchmark Brent fell 1.5% to $30.52 a barrel. WTI's outperformance was helped by a consultancy report suggesting that the storage bottleneck at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub is easing. Seevol said its data showed crude stocks at Cushing fell 2.17 million barrels last week, their first drop since March."

Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). says pessimism will soon get the upper hand and send the S&P 500 Index down almost 20% in the next three months.
Fiscal and monetary support over the past few weeks of the coronavirus pandemic successfully warded off a financial crisis, but a return to economic normalcy is still a long ways away and investors have gotten ahead of themselves, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, wrote in a report.
Financial, economic and political risks darken the outlook for domestic equities, Goldman warns. The bank cites the lack of flattening in the U.S. infection curve outside of New York, what promises to be a lengthy re-start process, a 50% hit to buybacks in 2020 and the risk of higher corporate taxes and de facto consumption taxes if U.S.-China trade tensions bubble up again.
“A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,” Kostin wrote. Goldman says the S&P 500 will probably drop to 2,400 over the next three months before it rebounds to 3,000 by year end.The index slumped 0.5% Monday to 2,914 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York.
Kostin notes that large swaths of the investor community have failed to cash in on the S&P 500’s 31% surge since its trough on March 23. He points out that most mutual funds have underperformed since the bear market low, with long/short and macro hedge funds posting single-digit returns as a group, and investors may face pressure to chase the rally.“The ‘fear of missing out’ best describes the thought process,” Kostin said.
But he warns that it’s a risky move. Even with measures of the breadth of the recent rally improving in recent days -- potentially signaling more buy-in on the idea the gains will last -- Goldman Sachs’ sentiment indicator has barely improved since mid-March.“Skepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,” the strategist writes.
Kostin is pessimistic on the outlook for corporate profits, citing frozen growth plans and capital expenditures will drop 27% this year. He points out that the only encouraging driver for earnings is the swelling federal deficit, which in effect acts as substantial support for demand.Caution on equities may also be warranted in the face of stretched valuations -- to the extent that anything about 2021’s bottom-line outlook can be discerned.
The benchmark U.S. stock gauge trades at 19.5 times the buy side’s estimate of next year’s earnings, Kostin concludes, the highest level since 2002.

The court reached the decision with the consent of prosecutors and the defense, the spokesman said.
The deal was contingent upon Perring making a payment to a charitable organization to the tune of a low five-digit thousand euro figure.
Perring confirmed that he had authorised his German counsel to make the payment to charity. ""The payment has been made,"" he said in response to a Reuters inquiry.

(Reuters) - U.S. hotel operator Marriott (O:MAR) missed already lowered estimates for first-quarter profit by a huge margin on Monday, as bookings plunged due to coronavirus-led lockdowns that kept a quarter of its hotels closed.
In line with Holiday Inn-owner IHG's announcement last week, the company said its bookings in Greater China improved in April as the world's second-largest economy gradually reopened for business.
But Marriott's shares, down 42% this year already, dipped another 4.5% as the company reported a 90% slump in the industry's closely-watched revenue per available room indicator in April.
""As the pandemic moved around the world, we saw global RevPAR fall sharply,"" Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson said. ""These are extremely challenging times, but I am confident that we will be able to successfully navigate through them.""
The COVID-19 pandemic has led thousands of holiday makers and business travelers to cancel bookings and stay at home to contain the spread of the deadly virus.
For the first quarter, Marriott reported a 22.5% decline from a year earlier in revenue per available room to $84.51.
Its worldwide development pipeline, however, still totaled nearly 3,050 hotels and about 516,000 rooms. More than 230,000 rooms in the pipeline were under construction as of the end of the first quarter.
Sorenson said occupancy at Marriott hotels in Greater China reached 25% in April, up from less than 10% in mid-February 2020, and said that was evidence of the resilience of travel demand. 
Marriott's total debt jumped by about 12% to $12.23 billion in the quarter and the company said it had net liquidity of about $4.3 billion as of May 8.
Net income fell to $31 million, or 9 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $375 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Marriott earned 26 cents per share in the quarter.
Revenue slumped 7% to $4.68 billion.

Analysts on average had expected Marriott to earn 80 cents per share on revenue $4.03 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The treatments, ide-cel and bb21217, are part of a class of drugs called CAR-T therapies that involve drawing white blood cells from a patient, processing them to target cancer cells, and infusing them back into the patient.
The companies will continue to equally share profits and losses in the United States, bluebird said.
Separately, bluebird reported a first-quarter net loss of $202.6 million compared with a loss of $164.4 million a year ago, and unveiled a business review to extend its cash runway into 2022 as the COVID-19 pandemic causes future uncertainty.
The company also said it was going to reduce the investment in building a U.S. commercial organization, and that its Chief Executive Officer Nick Leschly will decline nearly 100% of his salary for the next 12 months.
Shares of bluebird were up 8% at $64.40 before the bell, while Bristol Myers shares were down 1% at $60.36.

The state-owned airline is one of only a few to have maintained some scheduled passenger flights through the pandemic. Earlier this month, it said it would start rebuilding its network in anticipation of governments easing travel restrictions.
Qatar Airways expects to fill between 50% and 60% of seats on flights over the coming weeks as it reopens more routes and increases the frequency of flights. 
""There are still a lot of people stranded around the world, (and) people who want to go and visit their loved ones,"" Akbar al-Baker told Reuters by phone.
But Baker said he would be ""very surprised"" if travel demand recovered to pre-pandemic levels before 2023/2024. 
He also said many business travellers may never return, having become accustomed to working remotely, while job losses and business closures would also have an impact.
Qatar Airways will reduce flights to some destinations and its fleet will become 25% smaller, with some aircraft grounded and others returned to lessors, Baker said.
It plans to nearly triple its network by June 30 to about 80 destinations, mostly in Asia-Pacific and Europe. It flew to 165 cities before the pandemic.

The airline also said it would give away 100,000 return economy class tickets to frontline healthcare workers around the world as a thank you for their efforts in fighting the virus.

672,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 11, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>","Goldman’s Dividend Most at Risk, Morgan Stanley Analyst Says","(Bloomberg) --
Goldman Sachs’s dividend is most at risk in Morgan Stanley’s worst-case look at whether big banks are likely to slash payouts as regulators around the world push lenders to preserve capital during the unfolding Covid-19 crisis.
Goldman doesn’t have “much wiggle room to absorb a doubling of credit losses that we estimate in our bear case,” analysts led by Betsy Graseck wrote in a note, as the bank’s “regulatory capital is pretty much sitting on top of its required minimums” under new rules set to take effect in October 2020.
Concern about banking regulators and Congress targeting dividends started to surface in March, when many big U.S. banks voluntarily halted share buybacks as part of an effort to conserve capital and bolster lending to clients hurt by the pandemic and as European lenders suspended dividend payments. Plus, U.S. politicians from both parties may be hoping to score points against Wall Street, which is worried it’s destined to be cast as a villain.
For now, Graseck expects America’s largest banks can maintain dividends for one simple reason: They have enough capital. But if Morgan Stanley’s bear case plays out, then “investors should be prepared for dividend cuts.”
Potential reasons for cuts include a rising likelihood of a severe economic downturn or regulatory pressure, particularly if the Federal Reserve finds it difficult to predict the direction of the economy, she said, while mounting political pressure might force banks to lower dividends for non-financial reasons. There may also be a “domino effect,” she said. “If one large cap bank cuts, that could create additional pressure for others to follow suit.”
Big bank stocks fell in pre-market trading on Monday, along with U.S. futures, as investors weighed the latest moves to relax pandemic restrictions. Goldman slipped 1.5%, while JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC). were both down 1.7% and  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). shed 2.5%.
No bank that Graseck covers other than Goldman would breach its regulatory capital ratio minimum in Morgan Stanley’s worst case, though Citigroup, BofA and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. would all come within about 50 basis points of required minimums.  Northern Trust  Corp (NASDAQ:NTRS). and  State Street  Corp (NYSE:STT). face the least risk of cutting dividends, as they have more than four percentage points of capital above regulatory minimums and positive earnings, even in Graseck’s bear case.  American Express  Co (NYSE:AXP)., Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), and BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp. also screen high.
Last week, Wells Fargo slipped after Atlantic Equities analyst John Heagerty downgraded the stock, saying the specter of a dividend cut looms over the bank. Last month, Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) Ltd. tumbled to the lowest in decades after slashing its dividend. On Invesco’s conference call, chief executive officer Martin Flanagan said the decision to cut was taken with the “understanding that the environment could weaken,” adding that “we’re not thinking we’re seeing a snapback going forward.”

COVID-19 has seen car factories shut, pushing down British output by 14% so far this year, and closed dealerships, leading to a sales decline of 43%, due to lockdown measures which have restricted people's movements since mid-March.
The company, which employs around 600 people at several locations in Britain, supplies Jaguar Land Rover, Ford and Nissan (OTC:NSANY). Arlington's operations include making bespoke thermostats and the assembly of vehicle systems.
""The financial issues faced by the Group have been compounded by coronavirus,"" said joint administrator Allan Graham (NYSE:GHM) in a statement.
""New car registrations have fallen dramatically and the complexity of supply chains in the sector have led to a sudden halt to manufacturing.""
Restructuring acquisitions, including a German business bought last year, and uncertainty around Brexit and tariffs have also contributed to problems, according to joint administrators Duff & Phelps.
Other subsidiaries of Arlington International Group, which operates in countries such as France, Germany and China, are not affected by the restructuring in Britain.
""The UK Group has longstanding and deep-rooted relationships with its customers and I am confident that the restructured business will be a key supplier to the automotive industry moving forwards,"" said Arlington International CEO Mark Franckel.

That would cover more than half of the impact from a slump in demand for travel amid the pandemic, which Deutsche Bahn estimates at 11 billion to 13.5 billion euros through 2024, a proposal by Deutsche Bahn and the German transport and finance ministries showed.
The travel sector has been among the hardest-hit by the global outbreak, and while trains have not been halted in Germany, Deutsche Bahn says the number of passengers on long-distance routes is at only around 10-15% of normal levels.
The rail operator is also putting on ice plans for a stock market flotation of its international passenger transport business Arriva and slashing costs in Germany by up to 5 billion euros, the document said.
The document also includes a proposal for Deutsche Bahn to issue 3 billion euros in regular bonds this year instead of initially planned hybrid bonds, for which financing conditions would be less favourable in the current environment.
A first tranche of the government injection worth 4.5 bln euros is to be transferred in the coming weeks, though the European Commission still needs to approve the proposal, which might raise competition issues for the EU railways sector.
A finance ministry spokesman said on Monday no decisions have been taken on how to help Deutsche Bahn to deal with the pandemic impact.

675,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>","BA owner says burning cash, quarantine plan will make it worse","By Sarah Young
LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG (LON:ICAG) has exhausted every avenue to shore up its finances and is burning through cash, its CEO said on Monday, as the aviation industry warned of the fresh damage it would suffer if Britain quarantines international arrivals. 
Willie Walsh told parliament's transport committee IAG would have to review plans to resume flying in July if the government pressed ahead with plans to introduce a quarantine on most people coming into the country by air as part of measures to prevent a second peak of the coronavirus pandemic. 
While Walsh said IAG was not in a position where it had to ask for a specific bailout from the government, he added the quarantine plan would add to the pressure on the group. 
""We've probably exhausted every avenue that I can think of at this stage to shore up our liquidity. The cash has been reducing significantly and that will be the case as we go through May, June and July,"" he said. 
""The announcements yesterday of a 14-day period (of quarantine) for coming into the UK, it's definitely going to make it worse,"" he said, forecasting demand for ""minimal"" capacity under such rules. 
Questioned by UK lawmakers over a British Airways plan to lay off up to 12,000 people, or 30% of its workforce, Walsh told lawmakers that aviation was facing the deepest crisis in its history. 
""The industry has changed and anybody who believes that we're going back to the way things were in 2019 misunderstands the scale of the challenge that is being faced,"" he said.
He suggested job losses could follow at IAG's other airlines, Iberia and Vueling in Spain and Ireland's Aer Lingus, saying that Iberia management would be doing ""everything they possibly can to right-size Iberia"". 
Global aviation is facing a battle to survive, with most flights grounded since March due to travel restrictions to contain the pandemic. 
Britain's new quarantine rules risk derailing any recovery for UK-based airlines, and the industry urged the government to come up with an alternative plan. 
Heathrow Airport, which during normal times is Europe's busiest airport but saw passenger numbers plunge 97% in April, called for common international standards to enable passengers to travel freely between low risk counties once the virus is under control. 
That would allow borders to be re-opened, it said. 
Meanwhile, budget airline easyJet (LON:EZJ) said any quarantine requirements must be short-lived and replaced by a targeted regime allowing low-risk passengers to travel easily.
Walsh said that IAG was working with regulators to implement a common system across Europe of measures to be taken at airports and onboard aircraft to stop the disease spreading. 
He said that he believed the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) would publish a draft document on safety measures later this week. 
CALLS FOR CLARITY 
Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, easyJet and other UK carriers, said quarantine measures would lead to the industry requiring additional government support. 
The industry body has already asked for Britain's job retention scheme to be extended beyond June, and requested a temporary suspension of some taxes airlines pay, such as air passenger duty. 
Bosses complained there was lack of clarity over how long the new rules would last and how often they would be reviewed. 
""It's inevitable that consumers will be confused by the message, they will not be certain as to when they should book their holidays,"" Manchester Airports Group Chief Executive Charlie Cornish told BBC television.
Some destinations will be at an advantage, as travellers from France will be exempt from the quarantine rules, while airlines said the new rules wouldn't be applied to arrivals from Ireland.
Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab told BBC Radio there would be exemptions from the rules but did not give details. He said the government was aiming to bring in the quarantine from the end of the month. 

Critics have asked why it was not brought in sooner and how it will be put into practise, given passengers could fly to France and then cross into Britain via ferry or train.

677,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Planemaker ATR to cut output as coronavirus hits demand: CEO,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Franco-Italian turboprop maker ATR on Monday became the latest aircraft manufacturer to prepare for production cuts due to the coronavirus crisis, with its chief executive telling Reuters a decision on the extent would be taken in the coming weeks.
The aircraft manufacturer, co-owned by France-based Airbus (PA:AIR) and Italy's Leonardo (MI:LDOF), saw its deliveries fall last year to 68 aircraft, from 76 in 2018, Stefano Bortoli said.
Last year's deliveries were the lowest since 2012 as the aircraft market headed into a downcycle even before the coronavirus crisis, with the traditionally volatile market for nimble short-haul turboprop aircraft already feeling the pain.
ATR sold 79 aircraft in 2019, however, up from 52 in 2018.
ATR dominates the market for 50-70-seat turboprop aircraft which are economic on short flights, but is exposed to the relatively weak credit profiles of many regional airlines compared to larger groups, bankers and leasing firms say.
Bortoli declined to give delivery targets for 2020 but said ATR would follow other aircraft manufacturers in reducing planned production after seeing demand and its own ability to make deliveries hit by the epidemic and widespread lockdowns.
""Of course we are going to reduce; we will see later how much,"" Bortoli said in an interview.
Data from flight-tracking service Flightradar24.com supplied to Reuters shows a marked drop in the number of ATR test flights since the start of the year, suggesting lower production.
Deliveries have been hampered in part by rules restricting the arrival of inspection teams into France, where the company has its final assembly line, Bortoli said.
The coronavirus crisis has driven a number of turboprop operators into bankruptcy or administration including ATR user Air Mauritius.
Bortoli, however, said a new cargo version of the benchmark ATR 72-600 turboprop will go into service as planned later this year with launch customer FedEx (N:FDX).
Cargo demand has been rising during the crisis as the grounding of most passenger aircraft removes key capacity for freight usually carried in their cargo holds.
Analysts say regional jets, which compete with turboprops in some markets, are expected to benefit from the reluctance of airlines to take risks on larger planes after the crisis.
But Bortoli said he expected turboprops to hold their own as regional economies lead the way out of the crisis. Demand for tuboprops has traditionally been tied to regional development.
""The first flows will be domestic flows which includes regional ones...that operate essential services,"" he said.
Turboprops do best when oil prices are high as they save fuel on short routes, but Bortoli predicted a demand-led slump in oil prices would correct itself as the crisis eases.
Industry sources say ATR has declared 'force majeure' on aircraft deliveries, meaning it is at the mercy of events outside its control, and informed airlines that any delays are ""excusable,"" restricting the amount of compensation.
Bortoli declined to comment on contractual details.

Parent Airbus has said its contracts do not include a force majeure clause.

Since the U.K. introduced lockdown measures in March to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, bicycle seller Halfords Group Plc has been in the stock market’s fast lane.
The shares have more than tripled in that period, and in doing so have been the best performers on the 616-member FTSE All-Share index. Gains were extended on Monday after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Britons who are unable to work from home to return to their place of employment and encouraged the use of bicycles and walking over public transport.
The government said over the weekend that it will spend 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) to promote more cycling and walking. It plans to issue vouchers for bike repairs and bring forward the trials of e-scooters to next month from next year.
“Halfords is the market leader in bicycle sales,” Peel Hunt analyst Jonathan Pritchard wrote in a note. “With the stores looking better than ever in the bikes section, there’s no reason to believe that it shouldn’t take its share of what will clearly be a bumper couple of years for bike and accessories sales.”
Peel Hunt raised its price target on Halfords to 250 pence from 150 pence, the highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg. The shares surged as much as 26% in London.
Halfords isn’t the only stock that’s benefiting from the interest in cycling. Shares in Dutch company Accell Group NV, which sells its bikes and related products in more than 80 countries, surged as much as 21% on Monday.

At 07:05 AM ET (1105 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 18 points, or 1.6%, lower, Nasdaq 100 Futures down 22 points, or 0.3%. The Dow futures contract fell 144 points, or 0.6%.
Wall Street posted its first winning week in three last week, overlooking Friday’s 20.5 million job losses which sent the unemployment rate soaring to 14.7 per cent, by far the worst number seen since the Great Depression. 
Leading the gains have been the country’s tech giants. The Nasdaq 100 index is now just over 5% off its all time high, despite the grim economic news.
Boosting the general optimism of late has been the idea that the American economy is reopening - California, Michigan, and Ohio, three of the important states for U.S. manufacturing, have taken steps to allow factories and some businesses to resume work.
However, the news out of South Korea, earlier Friday, of a new spike in cases has prompted concerns as the East Asian nation has been praised globally for its efforts in curbing the virus.
The United States has seen 1.3 million infections and nearly 80,000 deaths in the pandemic, the most in the world by far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, although aggregate numbers for Europe are still higher.

682,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>","Under virus pressure, Saudi Aramco may cut government payout","By Saeed Azhar and Hadeel Al Sayegh
DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi oil giant Aramco (SE:2222) may cut its dividend to the Saudi government, but is likely to maintain payouts to minority shareholders as a plunge in crude prices shrinks first-quarter profits, analysts said.
Saudi Arabian Oil Co., as the company is formally known, pledged an annual dividend of $75 billion for the first five years to attract investors to its initial public offering in December last year.
Since then, global movement restrictions to contain the novel coronavirus have destroyed fuel demand and the oil market has been rocked by the impact of surplus supplies, as Riyadh and Moscow in April pumped flat out in a battle for market share.
When it reports its first-quarter results on Tuesday analysts expect Aramco to report lower earnings and a decrease in cash flows. Some also predict a cut in payments to the Saudi government, possibly by half.
That would add to the economic burdens on Saudi Arabia from the oil market crash. [L8N2CT06X]
""We are forecasting a cut of 50% in dividends to the government due to the lower oil prices and production,"" Yousef Husseini, equity analyst at EFG-Hermes, said. 
By contrast, the 1.7% of shareholders who bought into last year's stock market listing are likely to see their dividend protected as Aramco, in common with other giant oil companies, seeks to retain shareholders made nervous by the twin shocks of the coronavirus crisis and the climate crisis.
Aramco paid a dividend of $73.2 billion in 2019 and has said it plans to declare a cash dividend of $75 billion in 2020, of which 1.7% will go to minority shareholders. Analysts expect the 1.7% portion - which amounts to $1.3 billion - to be untouched.
ExxonMobil (N:XOM),  BP  (L:BP) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) have maintained their quarterly payouts, but Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) cut its dividend for the first time since World War II to conserve cash.
SABIC ADDS TO PRESSURE
Another pressure on Aramco is a deal to buy a 70% stake in petrochemicals maker SABIC. (SE:2010)
Reuters reported on Sunday the company was seeking to cut the cost of the $69 billion acquisition, according to two sources. It needs to pay $25 billion this year to the kingdom's sovereign wealth fund, according to the payment terms.
""I expect they will be able to cover most of this with debt financing - as per the original plan - and any balance can easily be covered with cash,"" Husseini said. Aramco had $60 billion in cash as of end 2019 and about $7 billion debt is expected in 2020. 
Global benchmark Brent crude (LCOc1) dropped some 65% in the first three months of the year, before OPEC+ agreed to cut oil supply by a record 9.7 million barrel per day from May 1 to offset the virus impact on demand and shore up prices.
Aramco had a negative gearing of minus 0.2% at the end of 2019, but given the new realities, Aramco will probably need to borrow this year and could see its gearing - net debt divided by balance sheet capital - climb nearer to the levels of other oil majors, analysts said. They did not give any Aramco debt forecast.     
A mean estimate by analysts at Egyptian investment bank EFG-Hermes, Saudi Arabia's Al Rajhi Capital and Dubai-based Arqaam Capital forecast Aramco would report net income of $17.8 billion for the quarter, compared with $20 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. 
They also expect revenues of $63.8 billion in the first quarter, compared with $85 billion in the fourth quarter.

""Aramco is now facing the same challenge as any other big oil player, striking the right balance between capex (capital expenditure), dividends and debt load,"" Dmitry Marinchenko, senior director at Fitch Ratings, said.

State-owned Aramco is weighing pushing out payments for the 70% holding in the petrochemicals maker and reducing the size of the initial installment to the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Aramco is also weighing whether it’s possible to reduce the $69.1 billion price tag, one of the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The talks are in early stages and it’s unclear whether an agreement will be reached, the people said.
The company is seeking to preserve cash as it confronts a historic rout in crude prices and a burgeoning list of spending obligations. It reaffirmed a commitment to pay $75 billion in dividends this year, while in March it pledged to cut capital expenditure to save cash.
Saudi Arabia announced a slew of austerity measures on Monday to cope with the coronavirus pandemic and oil-price rout. The kingdom will triple value-added tax and cut a cost-of-living allowance for government workers as part of a $27 billion plan to boost revenue and reallocate spending for health care and to aid businesses.
Aramco’s shares fell 0.8% to 30.90 riyals as of 1:17 p.m. in Riyadh.
Third Restructuring
The Sabic deal has already restructured from the original terms. Under the current agreement from October, Aramco is set to pay a third in cash, down from half previously. The deadline for paying the rest was extended by four years until September 2025. The initial pact involved Aramco paying 123.4 riyals ($32.85) a share for Sabic, whose share price has slumped to 73 riyals since that was agreed in March 2019.
A representative for Aramco said it doesn’t comment on rumor or speculation. A representative for Sabic said the matter is between the oil producer and the PIF. A representative for the sovereign wealth fund didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
On Sunday, Reuters reported that Aramco is looking to restructure the deal, citing people familiar with the matter.
Raising Cash
The acquisition of Sabic is a key part of Aramco’s strategy of moving downstream from oil production into chemicals. It will also serve as a way to help the PIF raise cash to fund its investment plans. With crude prices down more than 50% since the start of the year, Aramco is looking at alternatives to raise funds.
The company has hired JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. to review the potential multibillion sale of a stake in its oil pipelines, people familiar with the matter said in April.
Aramco is set to report its first-quarter results on Tuesday, giving investors an insight into how March’s oil-price war has impacted earnings.

688,By Investing.com,"<span>May 11, 2020 05:32AM ET</span>",StockBeat: The Coronavirus Pandemic Is Even Hitting the Undertakers," By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- You could be forgiven for thinking that the coronavirus pandemic would be good for business at the U.K.'s only listed provider of funerals, but you'd be wrong.  
 Dignity  PLC's quarterly results on Monday did nothing to provoke an inappropriate smile, as the company warned that underlying operating profit fell 2% in the first quarter, despite gains in market share and a 1% increase in registered deaths across the U.K., as government restrictions on gatherings hit its ability to provide higher-margin services. It now expects free cash flow to fall below the threshold where excess cash can be transferred from the cover pool for its securitized bonds to serve general corporate purposes. Fortunately, as it has already suspended its dividend, shareholders won't notice any impact.
Dignity (LON:DTY) shares have been one of the worst-affected stocks in London since the pandemic struck: they've fallen over 60% from their pre-lockdown high and - conspicuously - have completely missed out on the rebound since April. Dignity stocks rose 2.4% on Monday, for once outperforming the midcap FTSE 250 index, which was up only 0.1%. 
The company has seen its revenue drivers undermined everywhere: average revenue generated per funeral fell 2% as the proportion of people opting for simple services rose sharply at the expense of its full-service funerals, which naturally generate more income and better margins. It has been unable to provide limousines to clients in recent weeks, while the sale of memorials has suffered as government orders put cemeteries off-limits to all except those actually attending a funeral.
While simple services were only 20% of all services a year ago, they accounted for 60% in the last three months. Subsequent events have given no reason why this trend should change any time soon.
The undertakers were naturally too discreet to say explicitly that the more uncertain outlook for household income was having an impact on spending choices, but the hard truth remains that a part of funeral expenses are discretionary, and consumer discretionary spending is suffering badly at a time when millions are losing their jobs or are on reduced wages. 
Another point to jump out from the report was Dignity's suggestion that the pandemic may well do nothing for its long-term outlook. In as much as the virus is preying largely on the old and vulnerable, it is largely accelerating deaths that would have occurred within the next few years in any case. The comment is worth quoting in full:

689,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>","Virus hits Asian energy, exporters hardest, as analysts cut outlook","(Reuters) - Concerns that extended factory lockdowns and social distancing rules will dent company profits prompted analysts to cut forecasts for Asian companies' 2020 earnings by around 5.4% over the last month, Refinitiv data showed.
The reductions take the total cut in earnings estimates to 14.8% so far this year.
The companies most affected are those reliant on exports and on energy, following a collapse in oil prices and in fuel demand because of lockdown restrictions and border closures.
Graphic - Change in Asian companies profit estimates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzynzlpw/Change%20in%20Asian%20companies%20profit%20estimates.jpg
In the last month, companies dependent on the energy sector faced a 17.8% cut in 2020 forecasts. 
Companies in export-reliant economies, South Korea and Thailand, were also hit hard as their profit forecasts were reduced by about 9% and 8.3% respectively.
Both economies shrank in the last quarter, with South Korea recording its biggest contraction since 2008 as self-isolation measures reduced consumption and global trade slumped.
The profit forecast downgrades followed poor first-quarter earnings results for many Asian companies, which reported a 19% year-on-year fall in bottom line, Refinitiv data found.
The consumer discretionary sector, which includes companies selling non-essential durable items such as televisions and automobiles, also faced big downgrades, the data showed.

Like most major carriers, KLM has grounded almost all its airplanes due to the coronavirus pandemic, but is still operating a small number of flights.
""Wearing facial protection during boarding and on board is mandatory for KLM passengers. Passengers must ensure that they carry the required facial protection with them,"" KLM said. Passengers without adequate facial protection may be refused boarding at the gate, it added.
The measure applies until 31 August 2020. Children under 10 years of age are exempt.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the body representing global airlines, has come out in favour of passengers wearing masks onboard, as debate intensifies over how to get airlines flying while respecting social-distancing rules following the coronavirus crisis.

Air France, the French subsidiary of Air France KLM, announced the same safety precautions on May 5, while Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Hungary's low cost Wizz Air (L:WIZZ) are among other European airlines to already have made it compulsory to wear face masks on flights.

691,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Wuhan, recovering from virus, weighs policies to help hometown automaker Dongfeng","By Yilei Sun and Brenda Goh
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's Wuhan city is considering steps to support its biggest local automaker Dongfeng Motor Corp, according to a draft policy document reviewed by Reuters, as the epicentre of China's novel coronavirus outbreak tries to revive its economy.
The potential measures include subsidies for new car buyers, new government orders for Dongfeng vehicles and a plan to make use of idled plants from Dongfeng's venture with  Renault  , according to the policy draft by the Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone, a part of the city government.
The proposal, dated April 28, underlines how far Wuhan is willing to go to help support Dongfeng, China's third-biggest state-owned car maker, a major employer and a banner name crucial to the city's reputation as one a major auto town.
It also illustrates the extent of the challenge facing Dongfeng, whose main listed company  Dongfeng Motor Group  Co (OTC:DNFGF) Ltd's (HK:0489) posted a 33% slump in sales in the first four months of this year from the same period last year.
The document did not put a cost on the policies, and noted they were subject to change after further government discussions.
Wuhan city government, Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone and Dongfeng did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dongfeng's joint venture partners Peugeot-maker  Peugeot  SA (PA:PEUP) and Renault (PA:RENA) declined to comment.
The push comes as China works to shore up its economy after country-wide lockdowns due to the pandemic, and as local authorities in other cities that rely heavily on vehicle manufacturing, such as Guangzhou and Changsha, have started to offer incentives to car buyers.
The city of 11 million where the virus first emerged late last year endured a 76-day lockdown, accounted for over 80% of China's more than 4,600 deaths from the epidemic, and suffered a 40.5% slump in first quarter gross domestic product from a year earlier.
Wuhan's factories produced 1.5 million vehicles last year and the city is also home to plants owned by Honda Motor (T:7267), Peugeot SA and General Motors' (N:GM) venture with SAIC Motor (SS:600104).
""All government departments should roll out real policies to support Dongfeng's development,"" Wuhan's Communist party secretary Wang Zhonglin said last month during a visit to Dongfeng's plant, describing the company as a ""locomotive"" of the city's industrial development.
""Wuhan will actively support Dongfeng's upgrade and accelerate pushing Wuhan auto industry's high-quality development,"" he said.
BUYING TAXIS, LAND
To help the automaker, the document proposed Wuhan's local authorities should consider a 10,000 yuan ($1,415) subsidy to local customers who buy a Dongfeng electric vehicle, according to the policy draft. A gasoline-fuelled car would attract a subsidy of up to 5,000 yuan.
Wuhan city's taxi fleets could also purchase 3,400 Dongfeng-made electric taxis, while the city would prioritize using Dongfeng-made utility-purpose vehicles, it said.
The document also proposed that the city should aid Dongfeng's joint venture with PSA and former partnership with Renault, both of which ran into difficulties last year as the world's largest auto market lost steam.
Under the plan, local authorities would buy land from Dongfeng PSA venture's Wuhan 1 plant, and would also support a move by Dongfeng's premium electric vehicle project to use plants idled after Renault last month exited a joint venture with Dongfeng.
Dongfeng Motor Group sold 2.93 million units last year, and had set a target before the coronavirus outbreak of 3.16 million units this year. It sold just 606,801 vehicles in the first four months of 2020.

Apart from its partnership with PSA, the company has a joint venture with Honda, which resumed production in March and the document said was going well. A separate partnership with Nissan Motor (T:7201) does not make cars in Wuhan.

Investing.com - European stock markets posted gains Monday, amid growing optimism as more countries start to reopen their economies.
At 3:45 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.5% higher, and France's CAC 40 rose 0.2%. The U.K.'s FTSE index gained 0.8%, making up for lost time as Friday was a holiday.
France, the second largest economy in the euro zone, is set to emerge cautiously from one of Europe's strictest lockdowns on Monday, while  the U.K., now the hardest hit country in Europe in terms of deaths, has announced tentative plans to lessen social distancing measures. 
This follows a number of European countries -- including Denmark, Norway, Spain, Italy, Austria and Germany -- which have also started to lift lockdown measures. 
The European economy has been hard hit by the measures taken by the various national governments to shut down their respective economies to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus.
European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said, a couple of weeks ago, that the euro-area economy could shrink by as much as 15% as a result of the pandemic.
In corporate news, Ericsson (BS:ERICAs) stock climbed 0.9% after lifting its forecast for 5G subscriptions globally to around 2.8 billion by 2025 from 2.6 billion seen previously, as a consequence of the coronavirus outbreak. German consumer products maker Henkel was flat after reporting hat the pandemic fueled robust sales of cleaning products in the first quarter, while payments company Wirecard stock rose 8.8% after the company appointed a new chief compliance officer. It's still fallen 30% since a report by KPMG into suspect accounting practices failed to clear management's name, however. 
On the flip side, easyJet (LON:EZJ) stock slumped over 7% after the U.K. government announced over the weekend plans to introduce a 14-night quarantine on incoming travellers.
Oil futures slipped back Monday, consolidating after recent gains had pushed the sector from the all-time lows seen recently.
At 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 2.2% lower at $24.20 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.1% to $30.32.
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,708.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0833, down 0.1%."

The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.5% by 0718 GMT, adding to slim gains made so far in May.
Britain's FTSE 100 (FTSE) rose 0.8% after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday the lockdown would not end yet but encouraged some people to return to work.
France is also set to cautiously lift coronavirus-induced restrictions. However, Germany saw a spike in cases just days after its leaders eased the lockdown. 
Germany's DAX (GDAXI) still rose as payments company Wirecard (DE:WDIG) jumped 10.8% after announcing a reshuffle of its management board amid allegations including accounting irregularities and disclosure violations, which it denied.

Italian shares (FTMIB) gained 1.2% in relief that Moody's (NYSE:MCO) spared the country of a rating downgrade on Friday, but DBRS Morningstar cut Italy's trend to ""negative"" from ""stable"", citing uncertainty over the economic repercussions stemming from the outbreak.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Corp (T:9434) on Monday forecast operating profit for the current financial year at 920 billion yen ($8.6 billion), largely unchanged from a year earlier, as it continues to generate cash amid the coronavirus-induced economic downturn. 
Japan's third-largest wireless carrier is a vital source of funds for highly leveraged parent SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), which is set to post a record annual operating loss next week as Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's tech investments curdle.
SoftBank Corp's expectation of lacklustre profit growth reflects how demand driven by the shift to teleworking to slow the spread of the virus is being offset by a drop in traffic by mobile customers in the retail network.
SoftBank Corp reported a 32% rise in operating profit in the three months ended March to 116.6 billion yen, undershooting the 127 billion yen average of four analyst estimates in a Refinitiv poll.
The telco is seen as a target for SoftBank Group's plan to raise up to $41 billion through asset sales to shore up its balance sheet, although analysts expect the parent to retain a controlling stake. It has already pledged part of its stake as collateral for loans. 
SoftBank Corp launched next-generation 5G services at the end of March but the industry faces new competition from e-commerce firm  Rakuten Inc  (T:4755), which has launched aggressively low-priced plans in an attempt to take share from the three incumbents.

The telco's shares closed up 1% ahead of the earnings in line with the benchmark index (N225). Its shares are flat year-to-date.

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Asian shares followed Wall Street higher on Monday as investors looked ahead to more countries restarting their economies, even as some reported an unwelcome pick up in new coronavirus cases.
European markets are also heading north, with EUROSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) and FTSE futures (FFIc1) up about 1%. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) opened softer but bounced as the Asia day wore on and was last up 0.5%.
Encouraging investors in Asia was further loosening of coronavirus restrictions in the region with New Zealand easing some curbs from Thursday while Japan plans to end a state of emergency for areas where infections have stabilised.
In Europe, millions of French people are also set to cautiously emerge from one of that region's strictest lockdowns on Monday.
That comes even as South Korea warned of a second wave of the new coronavirus as infections rebounded to a one-month high, while new infections accelerated in Germany.
Investors seemed determined to stay optimistic and MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) firmed 1.1%.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) climbed 1.5% to 20,485.00 points in afternoon trade. Earlier in the session, the index rose as much as 1.8% to hit its highest since March 6.
Chinese blue chips (CSI300) rose 0.1%. Chinese inflation and production data due this week will be closely watched for clues on how the pandemic has hit demand in the world's second-largest economy.
Wall Street had rallied on Friday after the April payrolls report proved dire but not quite as awful as analysts' worst fears.
""Just getting the worst jobs report in history out, is at the margins helpful for risky assets,"" said Alan Ruskin, head of G10 FX at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn).
""Since late March there has been an extraordinary divergence between the real economy and financial risk, with the latter helped by unprecedented policy accommodation,"" he added. 
""Markets know the real economy data is awful. We are less sure of how long markets aided by policy, can defy the real economy, if the growth improvement is slow.""
The bond market certainly seems to think any recovery will be slow with two-year yields (US2YT=RR) hitting record lows at 0.105% and Fed fund futures <0#FF:> turning negative for the first time ever. 
The rally in prices has come even as the U.S. Treasury plans to borrow trillions of dollars in the next few months to plug a gaping budget deficit.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to give a keynote speech on Wednesday and analysts suspect he will rule out taking rates negative, at least for now.
The decline in U.S. yields might have been a burden for the dollar but with rates everywhere near or less than zero, major currencies have been stuck in tight ranges.
The dollar was a shade firmer on the yen at 106.94  on Monday but well within the 105.97 to 109.37 band that has lasted since late March. The euro was a fraction softer at $1.0848 (EUR=) but above last week's low at $1.0765.

699,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 01:44AM ET</span>","All masks, no fireworks: Shanghai Disneyland in muted reopening after coronavirus closedown","By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Thousands of visitors streamed into Shanghai Disneyland on Monday for the first time in three months as the Chinese park became the first reopened by Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) after the coronavirus pandemic brought the Magic Kingdom to a standstill.
While Mickey Mouse joined familiar Disney characters welcoming the crowds, the Shanghai experience will not be as it was: Instead of parades and fireworks, there are mandatory masks, temperature screenings and social distancing for visitors and employees.
Among the crowd on Monday was Shanghai Disneyland passholder Kay Yu. ""I think (these measures) make tourists feel at ease,"" said the 29-year-old, who was wearing a Minnie Mouse hat and said he had woken up at 4 a.m. to make the trip to the park.
Disney's $5.5 billion China flagship is the first of its six resorts around the world to reopen after the pandemic that has now killed more than 280,000 people globally threw consumer service businesses around the world into turmoil. The reopening may provide a glimpse of how Disney can begin to recover from closures set to strip $1.4 billion from the company's profit.
But the limited scope of the reopening in Shanghai underlines the scale of that task: While it welcomed more than 10 million guests in its first year after opening in 2016, the park will now restrict visitor numbers to 20% of daily capacity, or about 16,000 people - far below a level initially requested by the Chinese government.
As well as scrapping parades and fireworks - replacing the latter with an evening light projection show - Disney has shut interactive children's play areas and indoor live theatre shows. 
Still, the vast majority of its rides as well as most of its restaurants and shows will be open, said Andrew Bolstein, the park's senior vice-president of operations. More might reopen in time to come depending on the situation and government regulations, he added.
Zhang Zhongyu, a 29-year-old passholder and visitor who works in importing, said the things he missed most about the park were the shows and the parade - two attractions that have been cancelled.
""I'm a little disappointed, but there's nothing we can do - thinking of the virus, you have to avoid guests gathering closely, it's understandable,"" he said.
'COMING HOME'
Visitors holding annual passes are being asked to reserve an entry time and day in advance, and tickets for the earliest days of Shanghai Disneyland's re-opening have been sold out.
Monday's guests, mostly parents with children or young couples, were greeted by waving park staff as they walked in, having been asked to show a green health code on their mobile phones before being allowed in. All wore masks.
Markers have also been added to areas where people might congregate, such as shops and entertainment areas, to tell visitors where and where not to stand, while audio announcements regularly remind guests to maintain social distance. Visitors on rides are also asked to sit well apart. 
""It's like a feeling of coming home, I feel extremely happy,"" said passholder Yu.
""For us fans it's very meaningful to be here on the first day of its reopening, and to be able to experience its reopening, it feels like a magical day.""
Still, the reopening comes after a weekend of unwelcome reminders that a second wave of the virus could happen, including the first confirmed case for more than a month in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the outbreak late last year. 
The number of new cases in China, where the epidemic first emerged late last year, has sharply dropped in recent weeks but sporadic outbreaks continue. Some 17 new COVID-19 cases were reported for the mainland on May 10, rising from a day earlier and marking the highest daily increase since April 28. 
Concerns about the virus weren't far from the mind of Shanghai Disneyland visitor Chen Xue, 31, who works in marketing and said she would have not come to the park if it were not for the social distancing measures.

""The virus is still not over and it has made me so incredibly anxious,"" she said.

The world's biggest cement maker announced the sale of its entire 85.7% stake to industrial group San Miguel Corporation (PS:SMC) in May 2019 and was expected to complete the transaction by the end of 2019.
The deal, which included four cement plants and one grinding plant, was subject to approval from the Philippines Competition Authority (PCC).
""The PCC did not issue an approval of the transaction within the required time period and consequently the agreement lapsed,"" LafargeHolcim said on Monday.
The collapse is a blow for LafargeHolcim, which was offloading assets to pay down debt and wanted to exit from what it has previously called the ""hyper-competitive"" South-East Asia market.
The Swiss company has also quit Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, where its businesses together with the Philippines operation were worth $4.9 billion.
LafargeHolcim also said three of its four plants in the Philippines that had been shut down due to the coronavirus crisis had now resumed operations.
The company did not say if it was seeking another buyer or hoping to resume the sale to San Miguel, which also has operations in food, beverages, packaging, fuel and power sectors.

Lafarge said in a statement it would focus on strengthening its operations in the Philippines.

701,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",Investors search for bargains in energy sector minefield,"By Lewis Krauskopf and April Joyner
(Reuters) - Investors are rummaging through battered energy stocks to play a potential rebound in oil prices, just weeks after crude futures traded below zero for the first time ever.
It's a high-stakes game. The months-long plunge in oil has dragged valuations in the sector to their lowest levels in decades, according to some measures, raising companies' allure to bargain hunters. Yet bankruptcies in the oil patch are expected to grow, and choosing the wrong stock could leave a portfolio with outsized losses.
""There is so much value there,"" said Hugo Rogers (NYSE:ROG), chief investment officer at private bank Deltec International Group. ""But you have to know what you're doing.""
Energy stocks have consistently underperformed over the last decade, even as U.S. crude oil production reached an all-time high of nearly 13 million barrels per day. A worldwide economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic further pounded oil prices that were already in decline after top exporter Saudi Arabia and its allies flooded the market with record levels of supply. 
Valuations for exploration and production companies, as measured by enterprise value to gross cash invested, stood near their lowest levels since 1995 in late April, according to Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).
Yet oil prices have risen from record lows in recent weeks as some countries and U.S. states begin to gradually reopen their economies, stoking hopes that greater oil demand will follow. 
U.S. crude traded at around $24 a barrel Friday, a marked rise from its record low on April 20, when it settled at minus-$37.63 a barrel. The S&P 500 energy sector index has risen 16% over the same period, dwarfing the 3.4% gain in the broader S&P 500. 
At the same time, oil prices below production costs have forced companies to curtail output, reducing the supply glut that has weighed on crude. 
North American oil companies have slashed production faster than expected, on course to cut roughly 1.7 million barrels per day by the end of June, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. state and company data.
""We believe we are at the inﬂection where investors will shift to focusing on the recovery from focusing on downside risks to commodity prices,"" Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note to investors. 
Baker Avenue Wealth Management owns shares of  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX),  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Energy & Exploration ETF after having swapped names within the sector to those that are ""higher quality and less leveraged,"" said King Lip, Baker Avenue's chief investment strategist.
""We think the sector overall will rebound as the global economy gradually emerges from the shutdown, therefore increasing demand and reducing the glut of oil,"" Lip said in emailed comments to Reuters.
Yet looming bankruptcies have made the energy industry a minefield, with U.S. shale producers, refiners and pipeline companies scrambling for cash and facing likely restructuring as they struggle under heavy debt loads. 
About half of the top 60 independent U.S. oil producers are in danger of restructuring and will need to find ways to boost their cash pile, according to energy lawyers at Haynes and Boone.
""You have to be selective,"" said Rogers, of Deltec. Supply cuts are likely to bring the market into balance next year, ""but in the meantime, some companies have to go bankrupt."" 
Among Rogers' holdings are natural gas producer EQT Corp (NYSE:EQT) and Cabot (NYSE:CBT) Oil & Gas Corp.
U.S. natural gas prices have trended upwards as the shutdown of excess oil production has also shut natural gas production. Natural gas hit a 25-year-low earlier this year.
A potential oil price reversal is another risk. Prices could be vulnerable if an anticipated global recession turns out to be deeper than expected, or if countries and U.S. states are forced to roll back reopening measures. 
Conversely, companies could again start pumping out oil if prices rise above the cost of production, estimated at around $35 per barrel.
""We are seeing oil prices come back up close to the marginal cost of production in a lot of markets,"" said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. ""There may be some more upside there, but not nearly as much as there was.""
Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities, reduced his energy holdings in response to the oil price war begun by Russia and Saudi Arabia in March. Though major oil-producing countries have since come to another agreement on production cuts, Massocca believes oversupply concerns will persist.

""If oil gets back above $35 a barrel...you'll start to see American production come back online, and that will serve to dampen any move higher in the commodity price,"" he said.

702,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 01:10AM ET</span>","U.S. landlords, retailers play hardball as mall rent collections plunge","By Uday Sampath Kumar and Medha Singh
(Reuters) - Tapestry Inc (N:TPR) Chief Executive Officer Jide Zeitlin has been negotiating lower rents for the company's  Coach  and Kate Spade stores for more than a month, using the brands' power to draw in U.S. mall traffic as leverage in tough talks with landlords.
The company, whose handbags have won it a place among the big names of the fashion world, is just one of a raft of major U.S. retailers seeking to lower rent bills to make sure they have enough cash to weather the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But with thousands of stores closed under strict lockdown measures and multiple national retail chains crumbling, mall operators' rent collections have collapsed, raising doubts about their future. 
Mall operators collected only 15% of April rent and trends are looking worse for May, according to CenterSquare Investment Management, which specializes in real estate. 
After a decade of change that has shaken up the U.S. retail landscape and driven some out of business, Zeitlin says mall rents need to fall anyway for retailers' brick-and-mortar strategies to make sense. 
But the talks are still ""challenging and difficult"" and he has a warning for his landlords: ""What they need to do is be really thoughtful about not killing the goose that lays the golden eggs,"" he told Reuters last week. Retail rents in the United States have increased by 2.6% a year over the past three years, and currently average $21.80 per square foot, according to real estate analytics company  CoStar Group  (O:CSGP). However, the coronavirus crisis has lead the firm to estimate retail rents falling anywhere from 8% to 13% in 2020. 
One of Coach's landlords is the United States' biggest mall operator- Simon Property Group (N:SPG), which reports first quarter results later on Monday. 
The company's outlook on the next few months will be more closely watched than ever before, as it begins to slowly reopen malls, while dealing with tenants that have either gone out of business or are nearing the edge. Simon and rival  Macerich Co  (N:MAC), which also reports this week, both own malls that count J.C. Penney & Co (N:JCP) as a tenant. Reuters reported on Friday the department store operator is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection with plans to permanently close about a quarter of its roughly 850 stores. 
""Here's the problem- a lot of the other smaller retailers can void their leases and have recourse to stop paying rent if those big anchor stores aren't there any more."" said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare. 
""90% of the malls in this country won't be here in year,"" Crowe said. 
Gap Inc (N:GPS), one of Simon's biggest tenants, said in April it would save about $115 million per month by ceasing paying rent for its stores in North America, many of which may not reopen even after the economy comes fully back on line. 
Graphic - Mall rents have surged over the last decade: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/xegvbkqlkpq/eikon.png
JUST PRETENDING 
While many are genuinely just trying to find a way through the financial mess left by the shutdowns, landlords and sector analysts say some retail names with significant financial backing are simply seeking to use the crisis to force their interests. 
CenterSquare's Crowe, who overseas some the of the firm's $200 million worth of U.S. real estate, said some of those big chains are using that leverage to play hardball in rent negotiations and warned of repercussions. 
Big national chains sign long-term leases and drive foot traffic to surrounding stores, giving them more leverage - and better deals - with landlords who are at risk of defaulting on their own debts. 
Jackson Hsieh of retail property group Spirit Realty (N:SRC) says he has received deferral requests for almost half of April's rents. 
Spirit owns just under 1,800 properties in 48 states. Its biggest tenants include  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD), Walgreens and Church's Chicken.

""We started to get requests from people who really didn't deserve a deferral,"" he says. ""Three investment grade companies asked for a deferral. I said if you don't pay, we'll default you and they paid.""

(Reuters) -  Stage Stores Inc  (N:SSI) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late on Sunday, the latest casualty of the coronavirus pandemic following the collapse of luxury store chain Neiman Marcus and apparel retailer J. Crew Group Inc.
The discount department store operator will seek bids for the business or any of its assets, while it also begins to wind down its operations, Stage Stores said in a statement.
The company listed both assets and liabilities between $500 million and $1 billion, according to a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.
""The increasingly challenging market environment was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which required us to temporarily close all of our stores and furlough the vast majority of our associates,"" Chief Executive Officer Michael Glazer said in a statement.
""Given the conditions, we have been unable to obtain necessary financing and have no choice but to take these actions.""
Houston, Texas-based Stage Stores was seeking to avoid bankruptcy by asking vendors for more time to pay bills and other concessions, Reuters reported last month.
The company shut all its 738 stores and three distribution centers in March, along with other ""non-essential"" retailers, as part of efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus throughout the United States.
Stage Stores said it now expects to reopen about 557 stores on May 15, about 67 stores in the second phase by May 28 and the rest by next month.
The company also said Chief Financial Officer Jason Curtis is leaving the company, effective May 22, to pursue a career with another retailer and that CEO Glazer would oversee the finance function.
Kirkland & Ellis LLP acted as legal adviser to Stage Stores and PJ Solomon was its investment banker. Berkeley Research Group LLC served as restructuring adviser.

The airline had expected to add three Boeing 787-9 jets to its fleet by the end of 2020 and to start taking delivery in August of the first of 18 Airbus A321neos due by 2022.
There is no longer a specific timeline for them to arrive because the market is too uncertain, a Qantas spokesman said, confirming a report on travel website Executive Traveller.

Saudi Arabia’s $320 billion Public Investment Fund is considering buying a minority stake in Reliance Industries Ltd.’s Jio Platforms unit, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private.
General Atlantic, the U.S. investment firm that helped fund Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc., is discussing a potential investment of about $850 million to $950 million in Jio Platforms, the people said. The deal could be completed as soon as this month, though no agreement has been finalized and plans may change, the people said.
Any new investment into Jio Platforms will add to the $8 billion deal run that Ambani has sealed in recent weeks.  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). in April agreed to pay $5.7 billion for a 10% stake in the digital unit, while Silver Lake Partners and Vista Equity Partners last week said they would invest about $2.25 billion in total.

Investors are betting on Jio’s access to India’s huge consumer market, and its potential to shake up traditional industries in the country -- from retail to education and payments -- with its technology. India is the only major open Internet market where foreign technology giants such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).Inc., Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc. can compete for market share.
The string of investments from technology giants and private equity firms will go toward slashing debt at Reliance Industries, which is controlled by Ambani. The outside money also helps set a valuation for Jio, which until recently has been largely owned by the billionaire’s conglomerate.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK) said it would prepay a total of $25 million in incentive compensation to 21 top executives to ensure they are motivated, even as it prepares to file for bankruptcy protection to tackle its nearly $9 billion debt pile.
The Oklahoma City-based company, co-founded by late wildcatter and outspoken natural gas proponent Aubrey McClendon, has been struggling with an unprecedented rout in oil and gas prices, as the coronavirus-driven economic downturn saps energy demand. Reuters reported last month that Chesapeake was in discussions to line up bankruptcy financing.
The move comes as investors are closely monitoring executive pay at struggling energy firms after Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) Corp and  Diamond Offshore  Drilling (NYSE:DO) changed incentive programs for their senior management teams in the days before filing for Chapter 11 last month to award them cash sums.
""The board and compensation committee, with the advice of their independent compensation consultant and legal advisors, determined that the historic compensation structure and performance metrics would not be effective in motivating and incentivizing the company's workforce,"" Chesapeake said in a regulatory filing published on Friday.
Executive officers, including CEO Robert Lawler, will earn half their incentive compensation based on their continued employment for a period of up to 12 months and half based on achieving certain incentive metrics, the company said.
In exchange for receiving their 2020 incentive compensation now in cash, the executives waived participation in the company's annual bonus plan and equity compensation awards in 2020. They will have to refund the incentive compensation if the targets are not met, Chesapeake said.
At the same time, the company's four highest-paid executives agreed to cuts in their 2020 incentive compensation. Lawler, Chief Financial Officer Domenic Dell'Osso, Executive Vice President of Exploration and Production Frank Patterson and General Counsel James Webb had their 2020 incentive compensation cut between 28% and 34%.
Moreover, Chesapeake added it would convert its annual incentive plan for other employees into a program that would pay ""cash retention payments earned on a quarterly basis over a 12-month period"". These payments are also contingent on continued employment, according to Chesapeake.
In an April 29 filing, Chesapeake had said Lawler would receive $15.4 million for 2019, of which $9.7 million was a bonus payment in shares and another $1.8 million was in stock options. Dell'Osso got $5.5 million, of which $3.5 million came in stock.

Chesapeake's stock has fallen by 91% this year. The company completed a reverse stock split in April to avoid being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.

712,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2020 08:09PM ET</span>","Big Oil Earnings Battered By Virus, But Worst is Yet to Come","(Bloomberg) -- Big Oil emerged from first-quarter earnings battered and bruised, but things are only going to get uglier.
Major oil and gas producers from Norway to the U.S. saw profit plunge in the opening three months of the year.  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). reported its first loss in over 30 years, Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) Plc cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War.
And that was only the result of the initial spread of the coronavirus. Things have got even worse since as a global pandemic caused an unprecedented oil-market slump. There are some signs of recovery on the horizon, but companies were united in their warnings that the current quarter will be tougher than the first.
A few key takeaways show which companies can endure another three months of pain, and those that will struggle:
Dividends in Play
Big Oil’s generous dividends have long been its main attraction to investors. But thanks to Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden they are no longer sacrosanct, after he slashed his company’s payout by two thirds.
“No CEO wants to have on their track record a cut to the dividend,” van Beurden told reporters, after doing just that. Now the taboo is broken, others may follow.
Exxon and  Chevron  said they remain unwavering in their commitment to the dividend. BP (NYSE:BP) Plc CEO Bernard Looney was more equivocal, saying his board would review the payout on a quarterly basis.
Eni SpA boss Claudio Descalzi refused to give guidance on his dividend until July, when the company will be able to evaluate the impact of cost-cutting measures.
Falling Output
Several CEOs said production shut-downs are already happening, whether mandated by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or motivated by low prices. That means most major companies will pump less oil and gas in the second quarter.
Output is already plunging in the U.S., and Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) plan to cut as much as 660,000 barrels a day by the end of June. Shell and BP are removing rigs from the Permian, with the latter taking $1 billion out of planned spending in its shale business.
BP said it has been contacted by Middle Eastern countries, Russia, Angola and Azerbaijan -- all members of OPEC+ -- to cut crude production. It has been instructed to cut 90,000 barrels a day from its Rumaila field in Iraq.
Kazakhstan will force international oil companies to slow production so the nation can meet its 390,000 barrel-a-day cut, people familiar with the matter said last month. That potentially affects Shell, Eni and Chevron.
It’s not even an OPEC+ member, but Norway’s decision to cut output contributed to Equinor ASA’s decision to scrap a 7% growth target for this year.
Vanishing Cash
For the five largest oil majors combined cash from operations plunged 29% from a year earlier to about $27 billion -- not enough to pay for dividends, interest payments, operating expenses and investments.
That was in a quarter where Dated Brent -- the benchmark against which most of the world’s oil shipments are priced -- averaged about $50 a barrel. Even with the recent recovery in prices, the marker has averaged less than $20 so far in the second quarter, according to BP data.
Companies have resorted to selling bonds and taking out new credit facilities to keep liquidity healthy. For some of them, there are questions about how long they can keep piling on debt.
BP’s gearing -- the ratio of net debt to equity -- shot up 5 percentage points to 36% in the first quarter. While Looney said part of that increase was the result of a temporary working capital build, he refused to give a timeframe for when it would get back to its 20% to 30% comfort range.
For Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber, debt wasn’t an issue. The company has “more than enough” capacity to borrow through a long downturn, and to pay the current dividend for two years at $30 oil, he said.
Buy or Sell?
After digesting first-quarter results, analysts are the most bullish on Total and most bearish on Exxon.
The French company’s finances look strong and its dividend safe, according to research reports. In contrast, the U.S. giant “is walking a tightrope” between shareholder payouts and investing for the long term, said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Fernando Valle.
With BP and Eni’s dividends also in a precarious position, according to analysts, the second quarter may prove to be even more dramatic than the first.

713,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2020 07:50PM ET</span>","World's second-oldest airline, Avianca, driven to bankruptcy by coronavirus","By Marcelo Rochabrun, Devika Krishna Kumar and Nelson Bocanegra
(Reuters) - Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p), Latin America's second-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday, after failing to meet a bond payment deadline, while its pleas for coronavirus aid from Colombia's government have so far been unsuccessful. 
If it fails to come out of bankruptcy, Bogota-based Avianca would be one of the first major carriers worldwide to go under as a result of the pandemic, which has crippled world travel. 
Avianca has not flown a regularly scheduled passenger flight since late March and most of its 20,000 employees have gone without pay through the crisis. 
""Avianca is facing the most challenging crisis in our 100-year history,"" Avianca Chief Executive Anko van der Werff said in a news release. 
While Avianca was already weak before the coronavirus outbreak, its bankruptcy filing highlights the challenges for airlines that cannot count on state rescues or on such rescues coming fast enough. Avianca is still hoping for a government bailout. 
""This isn't a surprise at all,"" said Juan David Ballen, chief economist at Casa de Bolsa brokerage in Bogota. ""The company was heavily indebted despite the fact it tried to restructure its debt last year.""
Avianca, the second-oldest continually operating airline in the world after KLM (PA:AIRF), had $7.3 billion in debts in 2019. The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York and said it would continue operations while it restructured its debts. 
The Colombian Association of Civil Aviators (ACDAC), a union representing many Avianca employees, said it supported the move.
Avianca already went through bankruptcy in the early 2000s, from which it was rescued by a Bolivian-born oil businessman, German Efromovich. 
Efromovich grew Avianca aggressively but also saddled the carrier with significant debt until he was ousted from the airline last year in a boardroom coup led by United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL). He still owns a majority stake in the carrier. 
United stands to lose up to $700 million in loans related to Avianca.
Efromovich told Reuters on Sunday that he disagreed with the decision to file for bankruptcy and that he was not involved in making it. 
LEAD-UP TO BANKRUPTCY
The management that took over after Efromovich's ousting was already focused on a cost-cutting reorganization dubbed ""Avianca 2021"" before this year's crisis. 
Warnings about its fragile finances abounded. Roberto Kriete, president of Avianca's board, said last year in a meeting with employees that the airline was ""broke."" 
Last month, Avianca's accounting firm, KPMG, said it had ""substantial doubts"" about the carrier's ability to exist a year from now. 
Avianca's shares closed at 88 cents on Friday in New York, from a high of more than $18 in 2014. 
Most pressingly, Avianca was facing a $65 million bond payment due on Sunday that analysts did not think the airline was in a position to meet. S&P downgraded the airline to CCC- status in the days leading up to that payment. 
Airline executives confirmed in a press call on Sunday night that they had not made the payment. 
Van der Werff had mounted a public relations campaign in recent weeks to secure emergency aid from Colombia's government, but none had materialized as of Sunday. 
Avianca has no certain date to resume operations, as its main hubs - Colombia, El Salvador and Peru - have all shut down air traffic to fight the coronavirus. The carrier faced backlash after it sold plane tickets for late May only to have to cancel them when Colombia extended its coronavirus lockdown. 
Avianca will also shut down its operations in Peru, which represents 5% of the airline's revenue, and will lay off hundreds of employees within the next 10 days. 
""In this time, we do not have liquidity to sustain a loss-making operation,"" Silvia Mosquera, Avianca's chief commercial officer, told reporters regarding Avianca Peru. 

Colombia's Avianca is the third of Efromovich's airlines to go through bankruptcy or out of business in recent years. Airlines Avianca Brasil and Avianca Argentina ceased to exist last year because of economic troubles in their markets.

714,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Tencent Weathers China Slowdown But a Deeper Threat Looms,"(Bloomberg) --
The Covid-19 pandemic likely barely dented Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) Ltd.’s growth, thanks to its dominance of online spheres from gaming to social media. Now that China’s industries are emerging from the worst of the outbreak, the bigger long-term threat may be the growing posse of challengers to its internet leadership.
The WeChat operator is expected to unveil 18% revenue rise when it reports earnings Wednesday, offering investors the earliest glimpse into how China Internet Inc. fared in the coronavirus-stricken first quarter. That’s down a tad from 20%-plus in prior quarters but still decent, thanks to its burgeoning cloud and finance services and a billion-plus entertainment-starved players confined to home. It’s why Tencent’s market value has surged more than $28 billion since Covid-19 first broke out, defying a global market rout and a record Chinese economic contraction.
But once the dust settles, Tencent will have to contend with a renewed challenge from giants like  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) Group Holding Ltd. and ByteDance Ltd., that are increasingly encroaching on its turf. Like in Silicon Valley years ago, when the biggest cash-rich players from Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). to  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). invaded each other’s territories, China’s largest tech corporations can now resume expanding beyond their mainstay businesses and developing services from advertising to gaming and payments in direct competition with Tencent.
“These large internet platforms are ambitious and they will try to leverage their scale to go into businesses which are not core to them. Over the years I have seen many of them try to do it, but so far none has succeeded at overtaking the incumbent,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling. “I think large companies will continue to focus on strengthening their core, while engaging in battles with their rivals on the fringe.”
TikTok operator ByteDance has been luring users and advertisers away and into its viral social networks. It’s also readying a foray into hardcore gaming. Alibaba-backed Ant Financial is creating its own version of a lite-app universe, taking a leaf from the book of Tencent’s WeChat. And even  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) Inc. -- a Groupon-like platform backed by Tencent itself -- has turned to live-streaming and virtual gifts to keep consumers glued to its app.
Their efforts coincide with a maturing of Tencent’s gaming business. Tencent’s marquee titles like Honor of Kings and Peacekeeper Elite picked up millions of new players during virus lockdowns -- yet not everyone’s a loyal patron. Its mobile game revenue for the first quarter may shrink sequentially due to weak performance from these aging hits, according to Bloomberg Intelligence citing Sensor Tower data. New releases from Alibaba’s gaming unit and Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI) Inc. jumped in sales in recent weeks, according to the analytics firm, trailing closely behind Tencent’s two offerings.
Longer term, ByteDance appears the more significant threat. It’s looking to exploit its social platforms to distribute games where players will splurge on virtual weapons and cosmetics, much as Tencent did more than a decade ago when it first entered the arena. ByteDance has built a gaming division with more than 1,000 people -- including hires from Tencent -- and is planning to launch two hardcore games this spring, Bloomberg News has reported.
Competition at home has spurred Tencent to increasingly look overseas for future growth. It’s taken Honor of King’s global edition to scores of new markets from Russia to the Middle East. International titles contributed 23% of Tencent’s online games revenue in 2019’s final quarter. It’s also planning to launch music app Joox to Africa’s most populous nations.
Tencent itself is exploring new markets. Taken together, fintech and cloud services are now Tencent’s fastest-growing division, making up more than a quarter of the company’s revenue in 2019.
Its fintech business took a surprising hit in the first quarter, after the brick-and-mortar stores that account for the bulk of WeChat payments shuttered nationwide to contain Covid-19. Ant Financial’s Alipay, meanwhile, is seeking to draw more merchants and transactions partially by replicating the lite-app model WeChat championed. Alipay’s own mini programs -- featured more prominently in a recent upgrade and used for everything from hotel booking to tax filing -- now have more than 600 million monthly active users, according to Ant Financial.
For cloud, the pandemic boosted Tencent’s nascent consumer-facing division as workers stranded at home had to rely on collaborative office software. But enterprise customers -- a more significant source of revenue -- were forced to delay their projects. Tencent’s cloud service revenues surpassed 17 billion yuan ($2.4 billion) in 2019, versus rival Alibaba’s 35.5 billion yuan. Alibaba said last month it will invest 200 billion yuan on cloud infrastructure such as data centers over the next three years.
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
The company’s social-ad business could continue to grow strongly, despite challenging industry conditions, on high demand and new inventory released in mid-February, but its fintech and business services segment could deliver slower growth as offline payments declined during the pandemic and some cloud computing projects were delayed.

715,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",UK retailers say bailout funds not sufficient to stop 'imminent collapse',"(Reuters) - British retailers have warned the government that its business bailout package of reliefs, grants and loans will not be sufficient to stop the ""imminent collapse of many businesses"".
The British Retail Consortium said in a letter to small business minister Paul Scully and finance minister Rishi Sunak that the crisis ""facing parts of the retail sector . . . must be addressed urgently ahead of the June quarter (rent) day"". 
Many businesses operate on small margins, have had little or no income coming in for several weeks and are at imminent risk, the letter said, adding that even after a lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus is lifted it will take these businesses a considerable time to recover.
The retailers also said that, while the income of furloughed staff is protected by the government, without further action on property costs the companies that employ them will be unable to continue since they cannot meet the costs of trading.
The consortium said that an ""intuitive stimulus could prevent"" this collapse.
The letter called for an urgent meeting with Scully and officials in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Treasury to agree how best to minimise economic harm and widespread job losses.

The letter was also signed by the British Property Federation and Revo, which represents the retail property sector.

716,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 10, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Johnson Starts to Ease U.K. Lockdown With Back to Work Plan,"(Bloomberg) -- Boris Johnson announced the “first careful steps” to lift the U.K.’s lockdown and restart the economy, setting out a “conditional plan” for getting more people back to work while controlling the spread of Covid-19.
Stressing there will be no immediate end to the lockdown, the British prime minister announced looser restrictions on movement from Wednesday, starting with unlimited outdoor leisure time for sports such as golf and tennis, and allowing people to drive to parks and beaches in England.
Johnson told people who cannot work at home -- such as those in the manufacturing and construction sectors -- to go to work. “Work from home if you can, but you should go to work if you can’t.”
But the premier also revealed plans to tighten the rules in key areas. Anyone flouting social distancing rules will face fines starting at 100 pounds ($124), an increase from 60 pounds. Fines will rise to a maximum of 3,200 pounds for repeat offenders.
“This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week,” Johnson said in a televised address to the nation on Sunday evening. “Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.”
The cautious approach will potentially further anger those members of Johnson’s Conservative Party who are pushing for a swift end to the lockdown that has so damaged Europe’s second-biggest economy. The government is caught between demands to get more people back to work and off the state’s furlough program, and the fear of triggering a new wave of infections that could require ministers to shut down the economy again.
‘Catastrophe’
In his address, Johnson said the country had avoided the “catastrophe” of the “reasonable worst case scenario” of 500,000 deaths from coronavirus because widespread adherence to lockdown rules had prevented hospitals from being overwhelmed. “It would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike,” he said.
The government plan includes:
Opposition politicians were quick to criticize the government’s new slogan emphasizing “stay alert” in place of “stay home.” The wording was unveiled on Sunday to try to strike a balance between urging people to go to work while still adhering to rules on staying two meters apart and avoiding unnecessary travel.
‘Vague’
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the messaging “vague and imprecise,” and said her administration would be sticking to its guidance for people to stay at home. “We are still at such a fragile stage in Scotland that the evidence shows it’s too soon to change our messaging,” she told reporters in Edinburgh.
The U.K. reported another 269 Covid-19 deaths on Sunday, bringing its total to 31,855, the most in Europe. That leaves Johnson with little room to maneuver as he charts a course out of the lockdown, especially after this government faced intense criticism over its response in the early days of the pandemic.
Researchers from Imperial College London, who are advising the government’s response, warned ministers last week deaths could top 100,000 if restrictions are eased too quickly, the Sunday Times newspaper reported.
On Sunday, Cambridge University statistician David Spiegelhalter criticized the government’s use of data in its daily press conference, calling it “number theater” that under reports cases and deaths. He estimated a minimum of 3.5 million people have contracted Covid-19, and said it’s “extraordinary” not enough testing has been done to provide an accurate picture.
Alert System
In his address, Johnson also unveiled a virus alert system, similar to how the government currently communicates terrorism threat levels. The five-level alerts range from one (green), which would enable life to return to normal, to five (red). The country is on the verge of improving from level four to three, he said, indicating that the infection rate isn’t increasing significantly.
Johnson said the government “must reverse rapidly the awful epidemics in care homes and in the NHS,” and said he would lay out further details of his roadmap to Parliament on Monday.
“Throughout this period of the next two months we will be driven not by mere hope or economic necessity. We are going to be driven by the science, the data and public health,” he said. “We have been through the initial peak -- but it is coming down the mountain that is often more dangerous.”

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's bourse resumed trading on Sunday after a two-month suspension with shares falling across the board, weighed down by investor fears the coronavirus pandemic will drag on the economy for months.
The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) decided to reopen the market after it was suspended on March 16 to halt further declines amid financial turbulence as the crisis unfolded. 
The bourse was one of only a few markets around the world to stop trading entirely, a move brokers said dented its creditbilty with foreign funds. 
After reopening, the bourse maintained a short trading session and reduced the daily price limit to 2.5% from the 5% limit that was introduced two days before the halt in trade.
The main ASE index closed 1.04% lower at 1650 points in thin trading which dealers and bourse officials attributed to a negative business outlook for the next few months before a slow recovery.
""The bourse mirrors the economy but we need a longer period for the market to return back to its balance,"" Amman Stock Exchange CEO Mazen Wathaifi told Jordan's Al-Mamlaka TV public broadcaster.
Jordan's aid dependant economy has been hard hit by the impact of the pandemic with a tight two-month lockdown to stem the spread of the virus that had hit revenues and sales of many listed companies.
The economy is forecast by the finance minister and World Bank to contract by 3.5% in 2020 compared to a government expectation before the crisis for 2.1% growth. This would be the first contraction since 1990. 
Market capitalisation has fallen to around 13.5 billion dinars ($19 billion), levels unseen since 2005. 
Twenty four leading shares dropped with only five shares rising as investors hurt by a central bank decision in March to freeze distribution of cash dividends sought liquidity.
""There were many shares that were offered at limit down and had no buyers. Many investors wanted to divest their shares to cash in,"" said Wajdi Makhamreh, an investment consultant
Arab Bank (AM:ARBK), which alone accounts nearly a quarter of the market's total capitalisation, fell 2.33 percent.
The market which has been hurt by lack of institutional fund activity and government incentives has in recent years seen average daily trading activity fall to around 4 million dinars. 
The absence of restrictions on foreign ownership has also increased the percentage of equity owned by foreigners to 50 percent of the market’s total capitalisation.
Dealers said there were no signs of any foreign funds divesting from bluechip banks and industrials.
The bourse also lifted curbs on use and sale of treasury stock and allowed brokers more margin trading to minimise risks in the event the market drops further, brokers said.

719,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Emirates to raise debt as it braces for most difficult months ever,"By Alexander Cornwell
DUBAI (Reuters) - Emirates, one of the world's biggest long-haul airlines, said on Sunday it will raise debt to help it through the coronavirus pandemic and may have to take tougher measures as it faces the most difficult months in its history.
The state-owned airline, which suspended regular passenger flights in March due to the virus outbreak that has shattered global travel demand, said that a recovery in travel was at least 18 months away. 
It reported a 21% rise in profit for its financial year that ended on March 31, but said the pandemic had hit its fourth quarter performance and it would tap banks to raise debt in its first quarter to lessen the impact on cash flows by the virus.
The airline, which has been promised financial aid from its Dubai state owner, did not say how much it expected to raise. 
""The COVID-19 pandemic will have a huge impact on our 2020-21 performance,"" Chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed said in a statement.
""We continue to take aggressive cost management measures, and other necessary steps to safeguard our business, while planning for business resumption.""
In an internal email sent to staff on Sunday and seen by Reuters, Sheikh Ahmed said the months ahead would be the most difficult in the airline's 35-year history.
""At some point, if our business situation doesn't improve, we will have to take harder measures,"" he said in the email.
Emirates Group, which counts the airline among its assets, said it will not pay an annual dividend to its shareholder, Dubai's state fund. Its cash assets stood at 25.6 billion dirham ($7 billion), it said.
Dubai Ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum said in the group's annual report released on Sunday that he was confident Emirates would emerge from the crisis strong, and a global leader in aviation. 
Dubai said in March that it would inject funding into the airline. Emirates said in the annual report that Dubai would financially support the airline if it was required.
An Emirates spokeswoman said Dubai's commitment to provide it with ""equity injections"" would allow it to ""preserve its skilled workforce."" It would also allow it to be ready to resume flights when possible and continue to operate cargo and other services, she added. 
HUB MODEL
The airline made a profit of 1.1 billion dirhams in the year to March 31, up from 871 million dirhams a year earlier, it said. However, it cautioned that the virus outbreak had hit its final quarter.
Revenue contracted 6.1% to 92 billion dirham as the number of passengers carried fell 4.2% to 56.2 million.
In March, Emirates also temporarily cut staff pay due to the coronavirus pandemic.
It is not clear when Emirates will resume normal flights. Rival Qatar Airways has said it would begin rebuilding its network from this month, while Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways plans to resume regular flights from June.
International connectivity is crucial for Emirates' Gulf hub model, which transformed Dubai six years ago into the world's busiest international airport. It does not operate domestic flights and most of its passengers transit through its hub. 
Emirates sister company dnata saw profit drop by 57% in the year through March 31 to 618 million dirhams, which the company attributed to investments in its catering and airport services divisions and weak demand in its travel business. 
Dnata has laid off some employees so that they could be eligible for unemployment schemes, Sheikh Ahmed said in the internal email.
Dnata is reviewing its operations in Australia after it was excluded from a government job protection scheme there due to its foreign state ownership.
Profit at the Emirates Group, which also includes dnata, fell 28% to 1.7 billion dirham. Revenue was down 4.8% to 104 billion. 
Unfavourable currency exchange rates cost the Group 1 billion dirham in profit, it said, while it saw some respite from cheaper oil prices.

On Thursday, Anadolu reported Turkish regulators had launched legal actions against London-based financial institutions over allegations they bought large sums of foreign currency and then defaulted on Turkish lira liabilities to weaken the currency.
Shortly after, the BDDK banking watchdog said it had imposed a lira transaction ban on the three banks as they had not fulfilled their Turkish lira liabilities in time. It said then the ban would be maintained until further notice and would include transactions with the banned banks' group banks operating in other countries.
UBS declined to comment on Thursday on the BDDK action and the Anadolu report. BNP and Citibank have not responded to Reuters' requests for comment.
On Sunday, Anadolu quoted BDDK Chairman Mehmet Ali Akben as saying the ban may be lifted if the banks fulfilled their lira liabilities, but that an investigation would still continue. 
""We will keep battling manipulation attempts in a determined way,"" Akben was cited as saying. ""If the banks in question then fulfil their liabilities, the transaction ban may be lifted. The investigation into whether the transactions of these three banks are exchange rate manipulation or not will continue and will be concluded,"" he said.
Akben also defended a separate decision on Thursday to describe activities that were to be regarded as financial manipulation and deceptive transactions.
Concern was raised that the BDDK action could allow punishment of news outlets writing about the lira and other financial developments.
""The relevant parties for the BDDK ruling in question are (concerning) manipulative banking transactions,"" Akben said. ""Our institution has no aim to limit or block news reports and analyses regarding financial markets and assets.""
He said the BDDK's actions during the coronavirus pandemic were aimed at limiting pressure on banks and providing them with more flexibility during this period, adding the regulations would go back to their previous state after the outbreak.
The BDDK's move on Thursday to impose a lira transaction ban followed a sharp selloff in the lira , which weakened to a record low of 7.2690 to the U.S. dollar. The currency later steadied after rebounding from its losses and stood at 7.0795 against the U.S. dollar at Friday's close.

""The difficult economic situation at Thyssenkrupp is being significantly intensified by corona. The company is in a serious situation,"" Merz said in the note dated May 8 and seen by Reuters.
Late last month the group secured about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in state aid to tide it over until it receives the money from the sale of its elevator division, two sources told Reuters.
In her note, Merz said restructuring moves, cost cuts and, above all, measures to increase sales that the group had planned to implement over the next two to three years needed to be implemented significantly faster due to the pandemic.
""Moving boundaries, thinking boldly, not ruling anything out - we really need to buckle down to the next plan,"" she added.
Merz said the longer the pandemic lasted the more it was eating up the expected proceeds from the sale of its elevators unit, adding management would discuss this with the supervisory board on May 18.
Thyssenkrupp in February agreed to sell its elevator unit to a consortium led by Advent and Cinven for 17.2 billion euros and to reinvest 1.25 billion euros of the proceeds in the business.
The closing, which Advent and Cinven said would take place by the end of September, could already happen over the summer, Merz said. Until then the group is bleeding cash, Merz said, adding that was why the company had talked to state-owned bank KfW about additional funds.
Thyssenkrupp is scheduled to publish second-quarter results on May 12. Merz said she did not expect industrial demand to recover soon.

The ratings agency said the relatively strong profits of the region's rated banks and loan-loss provisions will help them weather the double shock of the coronavirus pandemic and the collapse of oil prices.
The $36 billion shock that S&P estimates banks can absorb is about three times the agency's calculated normalised losses, ""which implies a substantial level of stress,"" it said.
S&P said it expected banks' profitability to suffer in 2020 due to the pandemic and low oil prices.
""This is because financing growth will remain limited, with banks focusing more on preserving their asset-quality indicators than generating new business,"" it said, adding it expected asset quality will deteriorate and cost of risk would rise.
S&P assumed COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, will be contained and non-oil activity will resume by the third quarter. If not, banks' profitability will suffer further and some will see losses, it said.
""In our view, the support measures enacted by GCC governments will at best delay this problem, in the absence of additional measures,"" it said, though it added banks' low cost base and potential new cost-saving measures next year could benefit them.
While some banks have taken measures to preserve their workforces, job cuts ""will probably come next year if the environment doesn't improve,"" S&P said.
S&P said Saudi banks are the most resilient, while Kuwait has the highest capacity to withstand higher cost of risk and Bahrain, Oman and UAE are the most vulnerable to such costs.

It added that the $36 billion figure is not evenly distributed. A few banks have more capacity to absorb losses than others, which is not correlated with the lender's size.

El Al, Israel's flag carrier, is seeking state-backed loans of $400 million to help it through the crisis as foreigners are barred from entering the country and incoming Israelis must enter quarantine.
El Al has suspended passenger flights until at least the end of May while about 6,000 of its workers are on unpaid leave until June 30.
El Al and the ministry have been at odds over demands El Al must cut jobs as part of a recovery plan, while shareholders are also resisting injecting new funds, a ministry spokesman said. 
Workers opposed to the layoffs plan to hold a protest at the time of the meeting outside the ministry.
El Al has presented a plan that includes an unknown number of layoffs, according to the ministry. Any layoffs would require approval by the airline's union which is yet to happen, an El Al spokesman said.
The spokesman for Kahlon said another key issue is a demand by the ministry that El Al's owners inject some cash into the firm.
""That's the core issue,"" he said. ""The problem is the owners don't want to pay.""
He rejected Israeli media reports that Kahlon was seriously considering dissolving El Al, which has twice delayed publishing fourth-quarter financial results.

The airline said last month it was in advanced talks with an Israeli bank to receive a loan that will be partly backed by government guarantees.

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) sued local authorities in California on Saturday as the electric carmaker pushed to re-open its factory there and Chief Executive Elon Musk threatened to move Tesla's headquarters and future programs from the state to Texas or Nevada.
Musk has been pushing to re-open Tesla's Fremont, California, factory after Alameda County's health department said the carmaker must not reopen because local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect.
In a blog post on Saturday, Tesla said the county's position left it no choice but to take legal action to ensure Tesla and its employees can go back to work.
The company said it had worked out a thorough return-to-work plan that includes online video training for personnel, work zone partition areas, temperature screening, requirements to wear protective equipment and rigorous cleaning and disinfecting protocols.
The company said it had informed health authorities in Alameda County, where the Fremont factory is located, about its restart plans, but claimed the acting official did not return calls or emails.
Alameda County's Public Health Department, which earlier on Saturday said it had been ""communicating directly and working closely with the Tesla team,"" did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla filed a lawsuit against the county in San Francisco federal court on Saturday, calling the continued restrictions a ""power-grab"" by the county since California's governor had said on Thursday that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen. 
The company said Alameda was going against the federal and California constitutions, as well as defying the governor's order, the lawsuit said. 
Alameda County is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May, with only essential businesses allowed to reopen. The county said it does not consider Tesla an essential business. County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. 
The outspoken Musk also took to Twitter on Saturday to complain and threatened to leave the state. 
""If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen (sp) on how Tesla is treated in the future,"" he tweeted, referring to the San Francisco Bay area facility that is Tesla's only U.S. vehicle factory.
Alameda County said on Saturday that it has been working with Tesla to develop a safety plan that ""allows for reopening while protecting the health and well-being of the thousands of employees"" that work at the factory and that it looks forward to coming to an agreement on a safety plan very soon. 
Fremont Mayor Lily Mei expressed concern about the potential economic implications of continuing the shelter-in-place order without provisions for manufacturers such as Tesla to resume. Mei on Saturday urged the county to work with businesses on ""acceptable guidelines for re-opening.""
Musk had told employees on Thursday that limited production would restart at Fremont on Friday afternoon.
Tesla last year built nearly half a million vehicles at the Fremont plant and moving the entire production facility would be a massive undertaking. 
Dan Ives, a Wedbush analyst, on Saturday estimated it could take the company 12 to 18 months to relocate production.
The threat to relocate the facility comes as Tesla aims to ramp up production at Fremont of its Model Y sport utility vehicle, which it expects to generate record demand and profit margins.
Musk, who sparred with California officials in March over whether Tesla had to halt production at Fremont, had criticized the lockdown and stay-at-home orders, calling them a ""serious risk"" to U.S. business and ""unconstitutional.""

Tesla shares have risen 127% since March 18, their recent closing low, including a 16.8% gain in the last trading week to close at $819.42 on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major U.S. airline trade group on Saturday said it backed the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checking the temperatures of passengers and customer-facing employees during the coronavirus pandemic.
Airlines for America, which represents the largest U.S. airlines including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), United Airlines, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), said the checks ""will add an extra layer of protection for passengers as well as airline and airport employees. Temperature checks also will provide additional public confidence that is critical to relaunching air travel and our nation’s economy.""
A U.S. official said Saturday no decision has been made on whether to mandate the checks, but said the issue is the subject of extensive talks among government agencies and with U.S. airlines and added a decision could potentially be made as early as next week.
One possible route would be for a pilot project or to initially begin temperature checks at the largest U.S. airports. Questions remain about what the government would do if someone had a high temperature and was turned away from a flight.
U.S. officials said the temperature checks would not eliminate the risk of coronavirus cases but could act as a deterrent to prevent people who were not feeling well from traveling.
TSA Administrator David Pekoske told employees during a town hall meeting Wednesday that no decision had been made regarding possible temperature checks of passengers at airports and that questions remained about where such checks might take place and which agency might perform them.
    ""It’s been a discussion that’s been ongoing for several weeks now,"" he said.
A TSA spokesman did not immediately comment Saturday.
Frontier Airlines said on Thursday it would begin temperature screenings for all passengers and crew members on June 1 and bar anyone with a temperature at or exceeding 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (38 C).
The move, the first among major U.S. airlines, followed the industry mandating facial coverings for all passengers and heightened cleaning procedures to address coronavirus concerns.
The airline group said having temperature checks performed by the TSA ""will ensure that procedures are standardized.""

The endorsement comes amid signs of a modest travel rebound from historic lows. On Friday, TSA screened 215,444 people at airport checkpoints, the first time the number topped 200,000 since March 26. But that is still a fraction of the 2.6 million screened on the equivalent day last year.

Last month the Italian government approved a package of emergency measures offering liquidity and bank loans to companies hit by the health emergency.
One of the measures allows medium-sized and large companies to ask SACE to guarantee new bank loans, provided the firms refrain from approving dividend payments for a year.
The credit agency said that banks had received 250 requests for state-guaranteed loans so far. It pledged to act quickly to ensure fresh funds were available for cash-starved companies, adding that once it received a request from a bank it could issue the guarantees within 48 hours.
SACE said it had already given the green light to requests for 30 million euros in loans.
The motorway and airport units of infrastructure group  Atlantia  (MI:ATL) and high-street retailer OVS (MI:OVS) are among companies to have expressed interest in such loans.
More than 30,000 people have died as a result of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy since the crisis started in February, the third highest death toll in the world. 
Rome, which shuttered all businesses not deemed essential until May 3, has forecast a full-year GDP drop of 8% this year, before a partial rebound of 4.7% next year.

    The megabanks - Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group (T:8306),  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial  Group (T:8316) and Mizuho Financial Group (T:8411) - along with the Development Bank of Japan, Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Holdings (T:8309) and others are set to agree, with some already having extended the loans, the person said, declining to be identified because the information is not public. 
All three megabanks declined to comment on the loan request, which was reported by the Nikkei business daily earlier. Mazda did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    
Mazda, like most other automakers, has reduced or halted production at factories around the world for the past few months as governments try to limit the spread of the new coronavirus.     
Mazda's car sales and balance sheet had been weak even before the virus slammed the brakes on demand, with its interest-bearing debt of 650 billion yen far exceeding its cash and cash equivalents, according to the Nikkei.    
Mazda is scheduled to announce its financial results for the year ended in March on Thursday.

The interim approval of its 'first day motions' from the Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, came a day after the company filed for bankruptcy protection, marking one of the highest-profile collapses yet among retailers forced to temporarily close stores in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Neiman Marcus filed for bankruptcy in a federal court in Houston, and said on Thursday it had reached agreement with creditors for $675 million of debtor-in-possession financing to aid operations while it attempts to reorganize.
The Dallas-based retailer plans to cede control to creditors in exchange for eliminating $4 billion of debt. Its debt currently totals about $5 billion.
The company has said it expects to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings in early fall with a $750 million package from creditors that provided its initial bankruptcy loan.
Founded in 1907 when the Marcus and Neiman families opened their first store in Dallas, the retailer expanded across the United States to become a fashion mainstay for celebrities and other wealthy customers seeking expensive handbags, clothing and the like.
Neiman Marcus changed hands among private equity firms over the past 15 years, eventually being sold in 2013 to Ares Management Corp (N:ARES) and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in a $6 billion debt-fueled buyout.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. brokers should not be forced to sign an agreement that could make them liable for breaches of a massive new industry trading database that they have no control over, a leading financial industry trade group told regulators on Wednesday.
Brokers must soon begin sending sensitive information derived from their clients' trades to a new database called the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) that the Securities and Exchange Commission tasked exchange operators and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) with building and operating.
But before they begin sending the information, the brokers must sign an agreement that limits the financial liability of the exchanges and FINRA, collectively called self-regulatory organizations (SROs), to $500 per reporting firm if there is a breach of that data. 
That puts the brokers on the hook for any security breaches of the database, which they have no control over, said Kenneth Bentsen, chief executive officer of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), which represents banks, broker-dealers and asset managers.
""SIFMA's guiding principle is 'they who hold the data bear the liability,'"" Bentsen said in a statement. 
SIFMA petitioned the SEC to stay the requirement that brokers sign the agreement before they begin sending the mandated data, which includes sensitive transactional and financial information of their customers, and open the process up to public comment. 
The CAT will allow regulators to track all trades from their inception, pinpointing buyers, sellers, exchanges and brokers involved, with one former SEC commissioner likening it to a Hubble Space Telescope for the securities markets.

The project has faced years of delays, the most recent of which came on Monday when the SEC extended the deadline for broker-dealers to begin submitting reports to June 22, instead of May 20, due to disruptions caused by the coronavirus crisis.

(Reuters) - The Silicon Valley venture capital firm known for its early backing of companies such as Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc is raising a new fund, but without one of its most prominent general partners, a source close to the firm said on Wednesday. 
Benchmark is raising a $425 million 10th fund, the person said, after a long track record of early backing for major tech firms such as eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR).
But influential general partner Bill Gurley, who led the firm's early investment in Uber, one of the largest tech companies to emerge in the past decade, will not be part of the new fund, the person said.
The Wall Street Journal reported the development earlier on Wednesday.
Gurley has been a vocal advocate for direct listings, an alternative way for companies to become publicly traded that gives both early investors such as Benchmark and tech company employees paid with stock a way to sell their shares for cash while paying potentially fewer fees to investment banks.
 Spotify Technology  SA (NYSE:SPOT) and Slack Technologies (NYSE:WORK) Inc - neither of which was a Benchmark investment - used the technique, but Uber held a traditional initial public offering last year.
Another source close to Benchmark said Gurley was not ""going anywhere."" He will remain on 11 boards of Benchmark portfolio companies and will work with the firm and the founders of those startups for ""many, many years into the future,"" the source said.

The sources declined to say why Gurley was not joining the latest fund.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors in SkyBridge Capital asked for hundreds of millions of dollars back after the fund suffered a 23% loss in March when investments made by its debt-focused hedge fund managers soured, Anthony Scaramucci wrote in a letter to clients, saying he was ""embarrassed"" by the loss.
""Redemptions were approximately 9.3% of assets as of March 31, 2020,"" Scaramucci wrote about the firm's main portfolio, called Series G. The letter was dated April 23 and seen by Reuters on Friday. The firm manages $7.7 billion in assets.
SkyBridge, which invests with a handful of hedge funds, in turn submitted redemptions of more than $1 billion to these managers in order to pay back its investors and shift around its investments.
The firm had no comment beyond the letter.
Scaramucci, one of the hedge fund industry's best-known executives, said that a number of the firms SkyBridge invests with, including Bayview Liquid Credit Strategies, Metacapital Mortgage Opportunities, Medalist Partners Harvest and Tempo Volatility, had suspended redemption requests, which means investors cannot pull their money out right now.
He also detailed the Series G portfolio's March losses, described new investments and said that a long-serving executive who had planned to retire was returning to full-time service.
""We are embarrassed by this performance,"" Scaramucci wrote about the firm's 23.3% loss in March, which left the portfolio down 22.79% in the first quarter. The firm's year-to-date loss has narrowed to 21.54%, thanks to a 1.62% gain for the current month through April 21. The S&P 500 stock index has lost 14.79% this year.
""We have to do better, and we will,"" Scaramucci wrote, noting that the fund made a $170 million investment with $22 billion hedge fund manager Canyon Partners on April 1, having waited for a distressed credit cycle to make the investment.
Ray Nolte, SkyBridge's long-time co-chief investment officer who had been transitioning into an advisory role, is back full time for at least two years. ""He is energized by the opportunity to lead the investment team and, once again, produce the attractive returns that marked the past fifteen years,"" Scaramucci said.
Scaramucci himself returned to SkyBridge, the firm he founded in 2003, after a planned sale to Chinese conglomerate HNA Group fell through in 2018. He spent 11 days as the White House communications director in 2017 and has since spoken out widely on economic and political topics.

SkyBridge's heavy investments in structured credit -- a bet that helped it a few years ago -- contributed to this year's heavy losses, the letter said. Angelo Gordon Mortgage Value Partners funds, Medalist Partners Harvest funds, and Axonic Credit Opportunities funds hurt SkyBridge the most, the letter said, noting that the funds were ""insufficiently hedged relative to their peers.""

733,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 11:55PM ET</span>",Fund managers fish for dividend plays amid sharp cuts,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some dividend fund managers are wading back into the shares of battered railroad stocks, energy companies and other economically sensitive, cyclical names, even as a host of companies have slashed their payouts. 
Cyclical stocks were among the worst-hit S&P 500 sectors in March's sell-off, with the group (SPLRCD) losing as much as 33% from its highs amid fears that a coronavirus-fueled economic slowdown will deal an outsized blow to companies' businesses. 
More than 15 companies in the benchmark S&P 500 - many of them cyclical names - have either suspended or cut their dividends in the last four weeks. On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa) cut its payout for the first time since World War Two as part of a plan to save $30 billion to help it weather an unprecedented decline in oil demand. 
Yet some managers of divided funds - which seek to give their clients exposure to a steady stream of income - believe the beaten-down sector may hold companies that are likely to keep their dividends intact and see their share prices rise. The sector has rebounded 28.5% from its March lows, compared with 26.3% for the S&P 500. 
""The initial moves were very emotionally based and now we're getting back to fundamentals,"" said Scott Davis, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments who oversees $24 billion in income strategies. ""There is still going to be volatility but we think you can pick your spots."" 
Davis has recently added to positions such as  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) that have attractive free cash flows despite being in industries that have been among the hardest-hit by the slowdown. Both companies offer a dividend yield of approximately 2.5%. 
Companies like Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Home Depot that have free cash flow growth above 6% will likely be able to invest and grow their market shares during a recession, while those such as Macy's Inc (N:M) could end up in bankruptcy, he said. 
""I have a feeling that some of those trends that were already in play will only get accelerated,"" said Davis. 
U.K. and European companies will likely cut dividends more than their U.S. counterparts, which are more likely to reduce share buybacks first, said Mark Peden, investment manager, Equities, at Kames Capital. 
Companies like cruise line operator Carnival Corp (N:CCL) and British retailer Marks and Spencer Group PLC (L:MKS) likely will not restore their dividends to previous levels, but other companies will want to increase theirs as early as possible to demonstrate their financial health, he said. 
While dividend-paying stocks may provide the cushion of a payout, their dividends - and share prices - could be in jeopardy if a subsequent wave of the virus deals another blow to growth by forcing countries to reinstate or extend lockdown measures. 
Analysts at BofA Global Research urged investors to focus on companies whose dividends are likely to be secure, rather than comparatively rich.
""The massive economic disruption brought on by COVID-19 questions the sustainability of dividends,"" the bank's analysts wrote.
At the same time, historically low borrowing costs have prompted many companies without strong balance sheets to initiate dividends since the end of the 2008 financial crisis, noted Linda Bakhshian, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). 
While many of those companies will be forced to cut their dividends, cash-rich firms in growing sectors like healthcare and technology are the most likely to maintain or even increase their payouts through what could be a painful recession ahead, she said. 
""You're going to see soon which companies are going to come out of this on the other side stronger,"" she said.

734,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>","Fear, sticker shock over health insurance greet laid-off workers","By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you were laid off in April, the health insurance from your job may stop at the end of the month. Then what? 
Rest assured there are options, even if they are all expensive. 
If you are losing a workplace plan, you will get paperwork explaining your benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, known as COBRA, which allows you to continue on your same plan. The catch is that you have to pay the full amount of the premiums, not just the employee portion. 
""The employer was typically paying 50 to 100% of the cost, that's why COBRA is so expensive,"" said Anthony Lopez, vice president of operations for eHealth.com https://www.ehealthinsurance.com, a nationwide aggregator.
Lopez said most people calling eHealth now are looking for other options besides COBRA, and that means going through the state exchanges, private insurance or short-term plans. You can also go to state websites, healthcare.gov https://www.healthcare.gov or directly to insurance companies to find rates for your personal situation. 
""People are scared,"" Lopez said, mostly because they fear they will not be able to get health insurance. 
Lopez said he was not seeing denials, which is reassuring, but then the fear turns into sticker shock. 
The key to picking the best plan is to figure out if it is better to pay less for the premium, but more of the actual cost of the care through a high deductible - and which level to choose. 
The average monthly premium for 2020 was $456 for individuals and $1,134 for families, according to eHealth's latest analysis. Deductibles averaged $4,263 for individuals and $7,893 for families, meaning this is how much they would have to pay out of pocket, excluding services like well visits for children, before the insurance starts to pay. 
Options for high-deductible plans have been prevalent for years, even through employer plans, but many would have these costs offset by the employer paying a big chunk of the premium and also contributing a lump sum toward the deductible. 
Help might be available for premium reductions for those who qualify for government subsidies. The math will be a little tricky right now though, because the calculation is based on your last tax return. If you estimate your income based on your job loss, and then you get another job, you may owe a penalty, Lopez warned. 
DEALING WITH DEDUCTIBLES
It is not just Americans facing job losses who have to face the reality of high deductibles because of COVID-19. Those still on their workplace plans, who may have been furloughed but are able to keep their insurance, are having to manage their costs more than ever. 
Researchers at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy studied what happens financially to people who switch from traditional health plans to high-deductible plans, and found there was a significant increase in out-of-pocket spending and excessive financial burden. 
""If you are healthy and lucky, then a high deductible is a great thing for you,"" said Neeraj Sood, a professor at USC who worked on the study. 
None of us is very lucky right now, however. 
In reality, it is very easy to rip through a deductible of several thousand dollars. A couple of trips to urgent care at full price or an afternoon in an emergency room could do it. 
Even if the test for COVID-19 is a covered expense, there are all sorts of other costs you could face if you fall ill, and you are on the hook for normal healthcare costs too. 
It takes advance planning to properly deal with these expenses, and that will not be something everyone can pull off with stretched finances. 
Jeff Hicks, a certified financial planner from Illinois, is one model. He has had a $10,000 family deductible plan for nearly 20 years, and each year religiously puts aside the full amount of the deductible in a Health Savings Account, which is a specialized pre-tax account that also grows tax-free.
For the first four years, he spent none of it. Then his wife got very sick, and they went the next four years spending the full amount. Since then, they have gone back and forth on the spending. 
""Once she had this catastrophic deal, I knew we were looking at potentially having it every year. I resigned myself to the fact that this may be the path we’re on,"" Hicks said.

At least 30 meatpacking workers have died of the novel coronavirus and more than 10,000 have contracted it, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW), which represents more than 250,000 meatpacking and food processing workers, said in a statement.
The pandemic caused at least 30 meatpacking plants to temporarily close over the past two months, resulting in a 40% drop in pork production capacity and a 25% drop in beef production capacity, the union said. 
Earlier on Friday, the U.S. Agriculture Department said 14 plants that had closed due to outbreaks of the virus were in the process of reopening this week. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue applauded ""the safe reopening of critical infrastructure meatpacking facilities across the United States.""
U.S. President Donald Trump on April 28 invoked the 1950 Defense Production Act to mandate meat plants stay opened during the pandemic, after companies warned of meat shortages in the United States. UFCW has previously said more protective equipment and testing would be required to open the plants. On Friday the union adopted a more critical tone. 
""Today’s rush by the Trump Administration to re-open 14 meatpacking plants without the urgent safety improvements needed is a reckless move that will put American lives at risk and further endanger the long-term security of our nation’s food supply,"" UFCW International President Marc Perrone said in a statement. 
""Since the executive order was announced by President Trump, the Administration has failed to take the urgent action needed to enact clear and enforceable safety standards at these meatpacking plants."" 
The 14 plants included a Smithfield Foods Inc pork facility in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, that started operating on May 7 and another in Waterloo, Iowa, that  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) said earlier in the week would resume limited operations.
The agriculture department also said meat facilities operated by JBS USA [JBS.UL] in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and six other Tyson plants were reopening. 
As of Thursday, about 35% of U.S. slaughter capacity for hogs still remained idle, said Steve Meyer, economist for Kerns and Associates. He estimated that about 32% to 33% was idle on Friday.

(Reuters) - Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc ""must not reopen"" its vehicle factory in the San Francisco Bay area as local lockdown measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus remain in effect, the local county health department said on Friday.
The comments came after Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk, told employees Thursday evening that limited production would restart at the factory in Fremont, Tesla's only U.S. vehicle factory, on Friday afternoon. 
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday afternoon said that manufacturers in the state would be allowed to reopen. But Alameda County, where the factory is located, is scheduled to remain shut until the end of May.
A spokeswoman for the Alameda County Public Health Department in a statement referred to the county's coronavirus lockdown order that only permits essential businesses to reopen.
""Tesla has been informed that they do not meet those criteria and must not reopen,"" the spokeswoman said.
Earlier on Friday, Erica Pan, a health officer for the county, said the department has had many discussions with the company and recommended that Tesla wait at least another week to monitor infection rates and discuss safe ways to resume production.
Pan, speaking during a virtual townhall with the mayor of the city of Alameda, called Tesla a ""very hot topic.""
Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Vehicle manufacturing operations are not allowed to operate regularly, according to the Alameda County order.
Musk has been bluntly criticizing the lockdown and stay-at-home orders, calling them a ""serious risk"" to U.S. business and tagging them ""unconstitutional,"" saying they would not hold up before the U.S. Supreme Court if challenged.
Tesla, in an internal mail seen by Reuters, had said that starting Friday, limited operation would resume at the Fremont factory with 30% of normal headcount per shift.
""Our Gigafactories in Nevada and New York have also begun limited operations as approved by their respective states,"" the mail said.
However, Musk said employees who feel uncomfortable coming back to work were not obligated to do so. 
Tesla had sparred with officials in California in March Tesla over whether it had to halt production at the Fremont factory under lockdown orders that allowed only essential businesses to continue to operate. It ended the stand-off in mid-March and said it would suspend production.
The lockdown order was imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, which has infected over 3.8 million people globally.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A week packed with U.S. economic data is likely to provide investors with more evidence of the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic has hit growth, sharpening the debate on whether a rebound in stocks has been justified amid an unprecedented slowdown. 
The raft of data will include reports on retail sales, industrial production and inflation from April, a month in which large parts of the country were under lockdown as officials mandated stay-at-home policies due to the spreading coronavirus. 
It comes as investors digest a rally that has lifted the S&P 500 Index (SPX) more than 30% from its March lows, even as unemployment has soared and large swathes of the U.S. economy are at a near-standstill. 
Economic data worse than the already-dire expectations could bolster the case for investors who argue that the rally in stocks has gone too far. Few can say, though, whether it will derail a surge in which stocks logged their best monthly gain in three decades in April despite weak economic data from the previous month. 
""The market has shown an ability to look through the economic data. I think it will continue to do that for the April data,"" said Doug Cohen, managing director for portfolio management at Athena Capital Advisors.
The parade of April data kicked off on Friday, when the Labor Department reported the U.S. economy lost a staggering 20.5 million jobs that month, the steepest plunge in payrolls since the Great Depression. Though bleak, that number was smaller than analysts’ expectations of 22 million jobs lost.
Two key data points next week include retail sales and industrial production, due on Friday, May 15. The numbers could help investors gauge the effect of closures on sales and factory output, said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics.
Economists polled by Reuters expect retail sales to tumble 10% in April, surpassing the record drop of 8.4% in March. Industrial production, which slipped 5.4% in March, is forecast to fall 11.6%.
Steep drop-offs like those are concerning to investors who worry that unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve and U.S. government have led markets to shrug off the economy's massive slowdown. 
U.S. stocks have rallied even as Citigroup’s U.S. economic surprise index, which measures whether key economic indicators are coming in above or below forecasts, has tumbled to multi-year lows.

""Markets are suffering from cognitive dissonance,"" said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist for MFS Investment Management, which manages about $470 billion in assets. ""Even if you reopen economies... you are not going to have economic normalization in the second or third quarter."" 
Big gains in technology and communications stocks led the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) to erase all its year-to-date losses on Thursday. Rebounds in beaten-down sectors like energy have helped push the S&P higher in recent days. 
""A pause (in the stock market rally) may not be surprising but the momentum trade is to continue higher as reopening of the country accelerates,"" said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management.
Some recent economic data has also eased from the jarring levels of several weeks ago, though they remain weak by historical standards. 
Initial jobless claims for state unemployment benefits decreased for the fifth straight week to 3.169 million for the week ended May 2. That compares with 6.867 million in the week ended March 28.
Still, much depends on the path the pandemic takes in the coming months. A vaccine or antiviral drug could accelerate efforts to reopen economies and reduce unemployment at a faster pace in the United States and abroad, analysts at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) said in a note to clients.

At the same time, ""if social distancing proves both less effective and/or more disruptive to economic activity than we are assuming, and antiviral drugs less helpful, the prospects for even a moderate bounce in activity... this year could be dashed,"" the report said.

(Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes jumped on Friday and logged solid gains for the week after data on historic job losses due to the coronavirus crisis showed they were slightly fewer than feared.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors were positive, led by the beaten-up energy group (SPNY), which gained 4.3%.
A 2.4% gain in Apple (O:AAPL) shares also lifted the indexes after the iPhone maker said it will reopen a handful of U.S. stores starting next week.
The U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the Labor Department reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls diving by 22 million, but the decline still marked the steepest plunge since the Great Depression.
“It’s tough to call the jobs report, which is what everybody was waiting for, anything but a complete calamity, but relative to expectations you can see some silver linings in there,” said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen, pointing to the large number of temporary layoffs.
“Except for the initial panic in the month of March, in general the markets are ignoring economic data for the most part and are looking more at data related to COVID-19,” Nick said.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 455.43 points, or 1.91%, to 24,331.32, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 48.61 points, or 1.69%, to 2,929.8 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 141.66 points, or 1.58%, to 9,121.32. 
The Nasdaq posted its fifth straight daily gain, its longest such streak since December 2019.
The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's fear gauge, fell 3.46 points to 27.98, its first close below 30 since Feb. 26.
Financial markets on Thursday began pricing in a negative U.S. interest rate environment for the first time, as investors grappled with the economic consequences of the new coronavirus outbreak.
Stocks have staged a sharp rebound since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. The tech-heavy Nasdaq on Thursday erased its 2020 declines and turned positive for the year.
Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak.
""People are watching closely to just see how this reopening process works,"" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services.
""On the margin, you are starting to hear businesses say that things are starting to look better from a depressed level.”
Optimism for markets was also fed by news that U.S. and Chinese trade representatives discussed their Phase 1 trade deal, with China saying they agreed to improve the atmosphere for its implementation.
In company news, Uber Technologies (N:UBER) shares rose 6.0% after the company said ride service bookings slowly recovered in recent weeks.
 Noble Energy  (O:NBL) shares gained 13.5% after the company said on Friday it would curtail oil production and further cut its capital spending to cope with a plunge in oil prices.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.47-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and three new lows.

About 10.1 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 11.4 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

The loan, which will be provided by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) Limited, will be used only for expenditures related to production at the Shanghai plant, the filing said.
The factory is Tesla's first car manufacturing site outside the United States and is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and to avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars.
Tesla had suspended production at its San Francisco Bay Area plant due to the broader impact of the coronavirus, and was told by the local county health department on Friday that it ""must not reopen"" as local lockdown measures remain in effect.

743,By Investing.com,"<span>May 08, 2020 05:12PM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: U.S. Stock Bulls Vs. Bears,"By Yasin Ebrahim and Kim Khan
Investing.com - Wall Street ended the week with another strong gain as investors managed to shrug off the worst drop in nonfarm payrolls ever.
The Nasdaq Composite turned positive for the year this week, with tech stocks remaining a particular point of strength. And sentiment looks strong as earnings season winds down and states across the U.S. begin to reopen their economies.
But has the rally got legs as summer approaches?
Yasin Ebrahim contends that the Federal Reserve will do whatever it takes to support the economy and for the foreseeable future equities remain the only game in town.
Kim Khan argues that the rally looks narrow, the employment picture will worsen and the days of tax cuts are in the rearview mirror. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bull Case
The Covid-19 pandemic has destroyed the jobs markets and left many businesses on the brink of financial ruin. But the pandemic's grip on equity markets has seemingly been short-lived as swashbuckling gains have followed on Wall Street since the March 23 lows.
Pointing to the disconnect between underlying economic conditions and surging equity markets, many are scrambling for answers at a time when the ultimate economic cure – a Covid-19 vaccine - is still some ways off.
But for others the explanation is simple: the Federal Reserve.
The most powerful central bank in all the land has cut rates within a quarter percentage point of zero and pledged to do whatever it takes to ensure that an eventual economic recovery is robust.
The Fed has expanded its asset purchases beyond Treasuries to include investment-grade debt, municipal bonds, ETFs and junk bonds, helping to stabilize credit markets and lay a softer landing for the coronavirus-ravaged economy.
The spending so far has taken the Fed's balance sheet to nearly $7 trillion, with the central bank recently conceding that it would need to more to support the economy.
The unprecedent move into unconventional markets and unrelenting support from the Fed has strengthened the narrative that the Fed will do whatever takes to support the economy.
""Don't fight the Fed,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a recent note. ""This move (the Fed's $2.3 trillion stimulus) is in-line with our prior view that investors should have no doubt about the Fed’s resolve to do whatever it takes to make sure the recession does not turn into a depression.""
Beyond the Fed, Congress has also ensured the well of stimulus remains deep, rolling out about $2.4 trillion in coronavirus aid to support individuals and businesses impacted from the coronavirus crisis.
Equities -- The Only Game in Town
With U.S. rates currently languishing at near zero and expected to turn negative next year, sitting in cash is not attractive, so equities remain the only game in town.
""(T)here would be no other place for these cash balances to go than chasing equities and bonds in the world as the need for precautionary savings subsides over time,"" JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) said.
But the flows into equities are not indiscriminate. Unsurprisingly, it is the FAANGs -- Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google-Parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- and others like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) and Slack (NYSE:WORK) that are best suited to the current pandemic and beyond that are attracting attention.
While stimulus has played the biggest role in the most recent rally, the gradual lifting of restrictions across the country has underpinned hopes the economy has weathered the worst of the pandemic.
""We expect GDP to grow ... as firms and households learn to combine higher economic activity with continued virus control via a range of adjustment mechanisms including mask and glove wearing, frequent cleanings of workplaces, lower office and retail occupancy, and improved testing and contact tracing,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said.
Without a coronavirus vaccine the possibility of a second wave of infections could threaten the current rally, but for the time being traders are willing to bet the Federal Reserve “put” will remain in place until a Covid-19 vaccine is found.


The Bear Case
Investors should beware the bubble. Not an asset-price bubble bears usually speak about, but an economic bubble.
This rally has happened in a bubble where the economy had to be shut down, but the Federal Reserve and the federal government provided an unprecedented backstop. As state governments attempt to reopen and the limitations of that backstop are evident, a lot of valuations will be called into question.
Investors will always be reluctant to fight the Fed, especially one providing historically large liquidity and with a fed funds rate tilting to negative for the first time. But the unprecedented action isn’t creating unprecedented enthusiasm.
“While hedge funds have responded to lower prices by their equity exposure from the lows of late last year, they have gone back only to a neutral allocation,” Andrea Cicione, Head of Strategy, at TS Lombard said in a note this week. “And both institutional and individual investors remain somewhat bearish.”
Breadth shows wavering conviction as well. The percentage of stocks trading above their 200-day moving average is 20%, compared with 70% to 80% last year when the S&P (NYSE:SPY) was around the same level, Cicione noted.
The current high equity prices also seem to be dismissing the seismic shift that’s happened to the economy, pricing in a V-shaped recovery where the angle of the V is approaching 0 degrees and things are reverting back to how they were in no time.
Friday’s employment report brought into sharp relief the pandemic economy landscape. The BLS reported that 20.5 million jobs were lost last month and the jobless rate spiked to 14.7%.
Jobless claims figures gave investors a good idea of what to expect, but stocks have still rallied. A lot of that may have to do with expectations of a sharp rebound by both investors and those recently out of work.
About 77% of laid-off or furloughed workers expect to be rehired by their previous employer, according to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll out this week. But economists aren’t so optimistic. The Post also noted that a report from the University of Chicago’s Becker Friedman Institute predicted that 42% of job losses from the pandemic will be permanent, with businesses closing and spending curtailed sharply even after reopening.
Meanwhile things could still deteriorate. The Minneapolis Fed’s Neel Kashkari said Thursday the true unemployment rate could be as high as 24% and the recovery will be “slow”.
The new landscape will likely also feature something to which Wall Street is especially averse: higher taxes.
The Treasury is borrowing a record $3 trillion this month to pay for the stimulus programs launched to stabilize the economy. And there could be more programs to come if Republicans and Democrats can agree.
“There is one clear implication: The era of tax cuts is over,” Jim Millstein, co-Chairman of Guggenheim Securities told Bloomberg. “People who have been fortunate enough to be able to make significant incomes are going to have to make a greater contribution.”"
744,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",Apple to reopen some stores in United States next week,"By Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) said Friday it will reopen a handful of stores in four U.S. states starting next week, in the first resumption of physical retail operations since the iPhone maker shuttered all U.S. stores in mid-March. 
The company said it will open ""some"" stores in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho and South Carolina. Apple has two stores in both South Carolina and Alabama but did not say which would open. Its Boise, Idaho location will open Monday, with others to follow later in the week.
Apple executives have said they are examining local health data at the county and city level in each community where the company has physical stores to determine when to reopen. Apple has locations in several U.S. states, such as Texas and Georgia, where state rules would in theory allow it to reopen stores, but it has not yet announced plans to do so.
""Our team is constantly monitoring local heath data and government guidance, and as soon as we can safely open our stores, we will,"" Apple said in a statement.
In the four states where Apple stores will reopen, new procedures will be in place similar to those in countries such as South Korea, Australia and Austria, where stores have already reopened.
Customers and employees will be required to undergo temperature checks and wear masks before entering the stores, and Apple will provide a mask if customers do not have their own. Social-distancing rules will limit the number of customers in the store at one time, which Apple said could create delays for walk-in customers.
""With many working and learning from home, our primary focus will be providing service and support,"" Apple said. ""We recommend, where possible, customers buy online for contactless delivery or in-store pick-up.""
Apple will still have demonstration devices for customers to handle in the store, but staff will clean them often, and hand sanitizer dispensers will be placed in stores.

Apple earlier on Friday said it would reopen stores in Germany. The company started shuttering its China stores in January and reopened them by mid-March. Days later, Apple closed all stores outside mainland China as the virus moved around the globe. Stores began reopening outside the Greater China region in mid-April with its store in South Korea.

Investing.com –  The Dow rallied into the close Friday, ending positively for the time in three weeks as investors bet on a comeback in the jobs market following data showing a record loss of jobs last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.91%, the S&P 500 gained 1.69%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.58%. The Nasdaq turned positive for the year earleir this week after bouncing off lows seen in March,
Nonfarm payrolls dropped by 20.5 million last month and the unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that was not as bad as many had feared, with economists' forecasting 22 million jobs lost in April and an unemployment rate of 16%.
The bulk of the job losses were temporary and are expected to return as stay-at-home orders are gradually lifted and businesses start to open, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
""The good news is that our base case is that employment contracts modestly in May and returns to growth in June as businesses reopen and laid-off workers begin to return to work,"" Jefferies said in note. ""We think it will take roughly two years to return to pre-COVID19 employment levels.""
The strength of the rally was underscored by a muted reaction to reports that the Trump administration has paused talks on plans to roll out another coronavirus stimulus package as parts of the country begin to gradually lift restrictions that had weighed on economic activity.
Rising energy stocks, meanwhile, led the broader market rally as oil prices settled 5% higher for a second-straight weekly climb amid ongoing hopes that the reopening of economies and output cuts by major oil-producing nations will stem in the glut in crude supplies.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors digested mixed quarterly performance from corporates.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) rose 5.91% after the ride-hailing company reported a bigger-than-expected loss, but reassured investors that the Covid-19 pandemic would set its path to profitability back by quarters rather than years.
The company previously said it expected to turn a profit in the fourth quarter of the year.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) fell 8% as it warned growth in its ad business was expected to fall short of its initial expectations and reported mixed first-quarter results amid a surge in costs.
After reporting first-quarter earnings that missed estimates, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) climbed 3.4% after it sold out all tickets for the reopening of Shanghai Disneyland on Monday.
Supporting a climb in tech, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 2.4% after announcing it would reopen soe stores in four U.S. states starting next week, albeit with restrictions on capacity.   
The strong end to the week for stocks came as U.S.-China trade tensions eased, after both sides reportedly said they expected to meet their obligations under the Phase 1 agreement signed in January."

The U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating the involvement of the multilevel marketing company's Chinese unit in an alleged decade-long scheme to bribe Chinese government officials to win business and evade regulatory scrutiny.
The bribes were intended to help Los Angeles-based Herbalife obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny of its Chinese operations, and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media, authorities have said.
Under the tentative settlement, Herbalife said it would enter a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which would defer criminal prosecution of the company on charges related to a conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for three years.

After that, the IRS will send the money by check to the address on file, with those payments expected to arrive in late May and June, according to a statement from the agency Friday. Taxpayers can submit their information and check on the status of their payment at the IRS’s website.
“Time is running out for a chance to get these payments several weeks earlier through direct deposit,” IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in the statement.
Approximately 130 million people have already received payments worth more than $200 billion, according to the IRS. The agency plans to send more than 150 million payments in total.
People who aren’t required to file tax returns -- such as those who receive Social Security, disability and veterans benefits -- will automatically receive their payments the same way they typically get their federal benefits.
The push to get payments out quickly comes as Congress is debating sending another round of direct payments to households as unemployment numbers skyrocket and many states remain fully or partially in lockdown in attempts to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Democrats are proposing to send more direct payments, while President Donald Trump has said he prefers a payroll tax cut over stimulus checks.

755,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 03:06PM ET</span>",U.S. post office loss doubles as it warns COVID-19 will hit its finances,"By Diane Bartz
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service on Friday said its losses more than doubled to $4.5 billion in the quarter ending in March and warned the economic slowdown spurred by the spread of COVID-19 could severely hurt its finances over the next 18 months.
The Postal Service's Board of Governors also met on Friday and said the service needs financial help from Congress to maintain service at current levels. The White House has threatened to block aid that Congress has already approved during the pandemic, and has accused the Postal Service of charging too little to package shippers such as Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN).
""The stark reality is that the pandemic will cause meaningful near-term and long-term implications, from the steep decline in revenue we will suffer this year and in the coming years. That will endanger our ability to fulfill our universal service missions absent congressional intervention,"" said Postmaster General Megan Brennan, who steps down June 15. 
She said the Postal Service had requested funding from Congress and unrestricted access to borrowing. She told a congressional committee last month that the new coronavirus alone could mean $13 billion in lost revenue this year.
The agency said quarterly revenues rose $348 million to $17.8 billion. But lower interest rates pushed up workers compensation costs to $2.99 billion last quarter from $771 million for the same quarter last year.
To determine what it pays for workers' compensation each quarter, the Postal Service calculates potential costs related to injuries and other problems. It then determines how much it must invest to have those funds available when needed. Lower interest rates because of the economic slowdown related to the pandemic require more investment.
The meeting comes two days after the governors announced they had selected Republican donor Louis DeJoy to be the next postmaster general.
The Postal Service has been struggling for years as online communication has replaced letters, and after a 2006 law required it to pre-fund employee pension and retirement health care costs for the next 75 years. It is funded entirely through services and postage and has been further hurt as advertisers have decided to reduce mail during the pandemic.
Congress has authorized the Treasury Department to lend the Postal Service up to $10 billion as part of a $2.3 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. President Donald Trump has threatened to block that aid.
Trump has frequently criticized the post office, saying it charges too little to deliver packages sent by online retailers such as Amazon, whose founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post, which has been critical of the president.
E-commerce packages account for most of the USPS Parcel Select business, which brought in revenue of $6.8 billion on the delivery of 2.9 billion packages during the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2019. 
The three largest USPS customers – identified by experts as Parcel Select users Amazon.com,  United Parcel  Service Inc (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corp (N:FDX) - account for 8.5% of its operating revenue. USPS makes money on every package, based on a review by the Postal Regulatory Commission. Shippers get discounted rates for some U.S. ZIP codes, but not on roughly 23,000 ZIP codes outside of urban areas where it is more competitive, said Robert Fisher, a postal consultant and a former USPS executive.
Delivering to far-flung doorsteps in more-remote areas is expensive and few shippers want to pay extra fees that companies like UPS and FedEx tack on to cover the cost. Fisher doubted the USPS will disappear. ""It's not going to happen anytime soon because approximately one out of three Amazon packages is still delivered by the Postal Service, and it will be skewed towards the places where it's more expensive for them to do it themselves,"" he said.

The pandemic has also boosted interest in expanding options to vote by mail rather than crowding into polling places, making it more important that funding extends past November for the presidential election.

Investing.com – Wall Street surged on Friday, shrugging off the worst monthly U.S. jobs report in history as many expect the lifting of restrictions will kickstart labor market activity, while rising oil prices continued to underpin energy stocks.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.49%, the S&P 500 gained 1.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.23%.
Nonfarm payrolls dropped by 20.5 million last month and the unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But was not as bad as many had feared, with economists' forecasting 22 million jobs lost in April and an unemployment rate of 16%.
The bulk of the job losses were temporary and are expected to return as stay-at-home orders are gradually lifted and businesses start to open, according to Jefferies (NYSE:JEF).
""The good news is that our base case is that employment contracts modestly in May and returns to growth in June as businesses reopen and laid-off workers begin to return to work,"" Jefferies said in note. ""We think it will take roughly two years to return to pre-COVID19 employment levels.""
Rising energy, stocks, meanwhile, led the broader market rally as oil prices continued to climb amid ongoing hopes that the reopening of economies and output cuts will stem in the glut in crude supplies.
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors digested mixed quarterly performance from corporates.
Uber (NYSE:UBER) rose 6.1% after the ride-hailing company reported bigger-than-expected loss, but reassured investors that the Covid-19 pandemic would set its path to profitability back by quarter rather than years.
The company previously said it expected to turn a profit in the fourth quarter of the year.
 Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) fell 8% as it warned growth in its ad business was expected to fall short of its initial expectations and reported mixed first-quarter results amid a surge in costs.
After reporting first-quarterly earnings that missed estimates, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) climbed 2.5% after it sold out all tickets for the reopening of Shanghai Disneyland on Monday.
In a sign of strong risk appetite, the CBOE Volatility Index, or fear index, fell 8.2% to a more-than-two-month low."

760,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Wirecard revamps management board amid probes,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Wirecard (DE:WDIG) Chief Executive Markus Braun apologised to shareholders on Friday as the company announced a reshuffle of its management board and appointed a new compliance officer, days after the hedge fund TCI demanded Braun's removal.
Wirecard faces allegations including accounting irregularities and disclosure violations, which it denies. 
In a bid to assuage investors, Wirecard hired KPMG to conduct an independent audit but the accounting firm said it had insufficient information to disprove the allegations, made by the Financial Times, leading to a 26% drop in Wirecard's share price and prompting calls from TCI to overhaul the company.
Wirecard announced the management changes as Germany's financial market watchdog BaFin intensifies a probe into whether the company may have withheld information before KPMG published its report.
Wirecard had booked half of its worldwide revenues from three obscure third-party acquiring partners and KPMG said it had not been able to conclude whether these revenues did or did not exist for the period 2016-18.
Chris Hohn, head of $24 billion fund TCI, said in an open letter to Wirecard's supervisory board that the audit by KPMG raised questions over management's compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws.
""We are of the view that the supervisory board is legally obliged to intervene,"" Hohn wrote in the letter, addressed to Wirecard Chairman Thomas Eichelmann and other supervisory board members. ""In our opinion, the necessary intervention is now to remove the CEO from all management duties,"" Hohn said.
Commenting on Friday's management reshuffle Eichelmann said, ""The business model of Wirecard AG (OTC:WCAGY) is sustainable and highly profitable. With the resolutions adopted, we are setting the course for a continued successful future of the company.""
Wirecard on Friday said it will hand responsibility for financial communications to Chief Financial Officer Alexander von Knoop, who will oversee investor relations, finance and accounting and controlling, as well as licensed subsidiaries such as Wirecard Bank AG. 
Braun will in future focus on strategic alliances, innovation management and the further business development of the group, the company said.
Wirecard said it had appointed James Freis as its new compliance officer, effective July 1. 
Freis is a former compliance officer at German stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) and a former Director of the United States Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), Wirecard said. 

Braun said: ""This reorganization lays the foundation for the next growth phase of Wirecard AG, which I am extremely pleased about. I would like to apologize to all our shareholders, customers, partners and employees for the turbulence of the past weeks and months.""

761,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>",Wall Street Game-Plans Which ETFs the Fed Might Buy This Month,"(Bloomberg) -- With the Federal Reserve about to wade into the market for ETF bonds, investors are guessing where it’ll make the biggest splash.
Exchange-traded funds eligible for central bank-purchase already got a boost in anticipation of a big new owner. Now that the Fed is set to start buying, figuring out the ETFs it will target can be lucrative.
Wall Street has been betting heavily on industry giants such as the $45.5 billion BlackRock’s iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (LQD) and the $21 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG). The $24.6 billion Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (VCSH) and the $15.9 billion iShares Short-Term Corporate Bond ETF (IGSB) -- which track debt due in less than three years -- are also seen as likely to be bought.
Getting it right matters because the Fed’s announcement that it will buy ETFs sparked a rally in some funds. That’s likely to extend in the ones it targets. Its primer on the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility says that its individual bond purchases will be limited to securities with maturities of five years or less While the Fed hasn’t said that applies to ETFs, Elya Schwartzman says it’s reasonable to think the Fed will prioritize funds that track shorter-dated debt.
“That makes the most sense since you want to support companies’ ongoing ability to refinance for the next year or two,” said Schwartzman, who spent nearly a decade at BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) before founding ES Investment Consulting LLC in January. “What is the actual goal we’re trying to achieve here? You want to achieve short-term solvency and the ability to fund operations.”
The New York Fed said Monday that it expects to begin purchasing shares of eligible ETFs in early May, an announcement that Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) strategists took to mean “any day now.” The Fed introduced the corporate bond buying program on March 23 to cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus, and expanded it to include debt from companies that recently lost their investment-grade rating in early April.
It’s also possible that policy makers would purchase ETFs with defined maturity dates, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Unlike a typical ETF, such funds would terminate upon reaching maturity and save the Fed the step of having to sell the product. Defined maturity ETFs dated through 2025 have roughly $17 billion in assets, BI said.
“Focusing on ETFs with set expiration dates would allow the central bank to avoid re-entering the market as a seller, making it easier to reduce the balance sheet of the special-purpose vehicle without hurting asset prices,” BI analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas wrote in a note this week.
ETFs such as the $1.8 billion Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) BulletShares 2021 Corporate Bond ETF (BSCL) or the $1.4 billion iShares iBonds Dec 2021 term Corporate ETF (IBDM) could potentially qualify, the analysts wrote. Still, they expect that any such targeted purchases will play “second fiddle” to ETFs such as LQD and HYG, given that the program’s goal is broad exposure to U.S. corporate bonds.
While BlackRock’s ETFs have been among the biggest beneficiaries so far, it’s possible that the program will lean towards other issuers, according to Peter Tchir of Academy Securities. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager and ETF issuer, has been charged with running the Fed’s three debt-buying programs.
The firm said it would waive investment advisory fees on ETFs it buys on behalf of the Fed. Though that would make buying other issuers’ funds more expensive, it might shield BlackRock from criticism, Tchir said.
“My guess is BlackRock will weight towards other firm’s products where they can,” said Tchir, Academy’s head of macro strategy. “Perception might count.”
With that in mind, funds such as State Street’s $6.2 billion SPDR Portfolio Short Term Corporate Bond ETF (SPSB), VCSH and State Street’s $9.7 billion SPDR Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) High Yield Bond ETF (JNK) could qualify, Tchir said.

Colony Capital has received a ""notice of acceleration"" covering $780 million of the defaulted debt, it said in a regulatory filing.
The firm also suspended its common dividend for the second quarter of 2020 and said it is prudent to conserve cash during a period of uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Earlier this year, Colony Capital reached a settlement with Blackwells, handing the activist investor a fourth board seat and creating a new vehicle to buy Colony's stock on the open market.
Blackwells and Colony last year decided to give Blackwells two board seats and jointly agree on a third director later.
Blackwells has kept up the pressure on Colony since then, however, and in November called for Tom Barrack, a billionaire friend of U.S. President Donald Trump, to step down as CEO of Colony.
Barrack had planned to leave the post in 2021 but will now leave sooner. Since Blackwells became involved with Colony, the company has cut costs, sold its industrial segment to Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) and pushed Kevin Traenkle to step down as chief investment officer in February.

Jobs that aren’t compatible with telecommuting were among the hardest hit, while industries with more work-from-home capabilities had some of the lowest unemployment rates, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Financial, professional services and the information industry reported lower than average joblessness. Leisure and hospitality was more than double the April rate for all Americans.

767,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>",Not as bad as it looks? Pemex's $24 billion loss mostly accounting distortion,"By David Alire Garcia
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - More than 80% of state-owned Pemex's multibillion-dollar loss in the first quarter stemmed from its accounting of a beat-up peso, rather than evaporating cash, but real losses are set to mount unless it modifies pre-coronavirus output plans.
This is because average Mexican oil prices will almost certainly be much lower in the second quarter than in the first, dipping in April to just above $12 per barrel, or less than half their first-quarter average of about $26.
Last week, Pemex posted nearly $20 billion in currency exchange losses during the first three months of this year. That accounted for all but $4 billion of the national oil company's jaw-dropping $23.9 billion first-quarter loss, on paper one of the worst corporate earnings reports in history.
For Pemex, which mostly operates in U.S. dollars, such currency exchange distortions do not reflect the actual hemorrhaging of cash.
In fact, more Pemex bonds were bought than sold after the results were announced, data from MarketAxess shows, as investors mostly shrugged off the latest set of negative numbers, which followed the bonds' designation as ""junk"" by a second major credit ratings agency earlier last month.
Investor indifference reflected the smaller hit to operations and the government's now-explicit vow to keep the company afloat, analysts and ex-Pemex executives said.
""It's a paper loss,"" said John Padilla, managing director of oil consultancy IPD Latin America, referring to how the peso's decline was reflected on the quarterly report. 
He nonetheless warned that ""boat loads of cash"" will vanish from Pemex throughout the rest of this year if prices remain low due to global oversupply, nearly full storage plus Pemex's lesser-valued heavy, high-sulfur crude.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's insistence on increasing Pemex's oil output this year in spite of the price slump almost certainly spells additional negative returns in the near term.
Pablo Medina, oil analyst with consultancy Welligence, notes that so far this year both private as well as other state-run oil companies have on average cut their investment budgets by some 30%, while Pemex has announced only a 13% cut to its 2020 investment plan.
""According to our calculations, it would have to cut (capital investment) by 75% to overcome this crisis,"" said Medina, pointing to Pemex's large number of unprofitable oilfields at current prices.
Medina argues that some 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Pemex's current crude production of some 1.7 million bpd are uneconomic given prevailing prices, which this week hovered around $20 per barrel.
Pemex's press office did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
Lopez Obrador, a leftist oil nationalist, has repeatedly pledged to revive Pemex with a mix of savings from his anti-corruption push, periodic capital injections and a reduced tax bill.
The president dubbed oil a ""good business"" when asked on Thursday about Pemex's huge first-quarter loss, arguing that prices are inching up and that Pemex is buffeted by its relatively low production costs, which company executives have recently said average about $14 per barrel.
DOLLAR REVENUE COLLAPSE
Like most other Latin American state-run oil companies, Pemex is essentially a dollar-denominated company, including the vast majority of its spending and revenue. 
Among its major expenditures, only about 30% of the company's authorized budget of 523.4 billion pesos ($21.8 billion) is paid in the local currency, mainly the cost of its payroll and pensions. A weaker peso actually helps Pemex with those expenses.
Pemex's peso-translated financial reports mean that the firm's massive debt balances in foreign currencies - mostly U.S. dollars - look much bigger on its balance sheet when the Mexican currency's value slides as it did in the first quarter.
But Pemex services its debt with the U.S. dollars it reaps from crude sales, not with pesos, meaning that the losses on paper do not affect its ability to pay. 
Relative to the greenback, the peso slumped 25% from January to March, marking its biggest downward spiral since the mid-1990s. 
Even without the numbers being inflated in peso terms, Pemex's financial debt remains the biggest of any oil company in the world at nearly $105 billion. 
Additionally, Pemex's $4 billion non-foreign exchange loss is still a major headache, said Victor Gomez Ayala, senior economist with financial firm Finamex. He notes that even the firm's dollar revenue has collapsed.
""Neither the upstream nor the downstream are making money at today's prices, irrespective of which currency,"" said Chris Sladen, formerly a Mexico-based oil executive now with Reconnoitre.ltd.

770,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 12:06PM ET</span>","Exclusive: J.C. Penney to file for bankruptcy as soon as next week, sources say","By Mike Spector and Jessica DiNapoli
(Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) is preparing to file for bankruptcy protection as soon as next week with plans to permanently close about a quarter of its roughly 850 stores, becoming the latest major U.S. retailer to succumb to fallout from the coronavirus outbreak, according to people familiar with the matter.
A bankruptcy filing would cap a long decline for the iconic 118-year-old department store chain, which struggled with a nearly $4-billion debt load and competition from e-commerce firms and discount brick-and-mortar retailers even before the pandemic's onset.
The Plano, Texas-based company, which employs nearly 85,000 people, is in discussions with creditors for a so-called debtor-in-possession loan to bolster its finances while it navigates bankruptcy proceedings, the sources said. The loan could total between $400 million and $500 million, some of the sources said.
The timing of a bankruptcy filing could slip depending on how much time it gets from creditors, the sources said. J.C. Penney skipped a $17 million debt payment Thursday and only has five days to make good on it before defaulting. A 30-day grace period on a $12 million payment the company skipped April 15 ends next Friday.
J.C. Penney has not made a final decision on how to address its strained finances, and is also considering alternatives that include negotiating a deal with creditors outside of bankruptcy court or obtaining additional financing, the sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.
J.C. Penney declined to comment.
While J.C. Penney aims to reorganize and emerge from bankruptcy protection, it plans to permanently shutter roughly 200 stores, a figure that could fluctuate depending on negotiations with creditors, the sources said.
Under one plan being discussed, J.C. Penney would emerge from bankruptcy as two separate companies, the sources said. One would own some of the company's real estate and serve as a landlord to the other entity operating the retailer's business, they said. Creditors, many of them Wall Street hedge funds, would control the businesses in exchange for forgiving debt, they said. 
J.C. Penney's online sales have not been enough to compensate for the significant losses it has incurred while keeping stores closed across the United States in response to lockdowns aimed at curbing spread of the coronavirus.
While the company has enough cash to survive in the coming months, it faces a $105 million debt payment due in June and about $300 million of annual interest expenses. More than $2 billion of debt comes due in 2023. 
J.C. Penney Chief Executive Jill Soltau told customers in a Thursday email that stores have started to gradually reopen with precautions such as Plexiglass shields at registers and limited crowds. 
Retailers are bearing a significant brunt of the economic fallout from the pandemic as sales all but evaporate. Just this week, luxury department store chain Neiman Marcus Group and clothing retailer J. Crew Group Inc filed for bankruptcy protection. 
In April, the U.S. economy lost 20.5 million jobs, the steepest plunge since the Great Depression, the Labor Department reported on Friday.
IN NEED OF TURNAROUND
J.C. Penney opened its first store in Wyoming in 1902 and called it ""The Golden Rule,"" a reference to what the retailer saw as its standard for customer service, according to its website.
The e-commerce revolution that took hold in the 21st century eroded J.C. Penney's business much as it did other traditional retailers'. The company now also faces fierce competition from discount chains including TJX Cos Inc’s (N:TJX) Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains.
J.C. Penney spent years trying to recover from a failed transformation spearheaded by former CEO Ron Johnson, the one-time pioneer of Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) retail stores. 
Johnson launched expensive renovations of J.C. Penney locations and eliminated coupons, resulting in a customer backlash that led to plunging sales. He was replaced in 2013, and a revolving door of executives followed before Soltau took the helm in late 2018.
J.C. Penney had recently made some strides in its turnaround attempt, meeting or exceeding guidance on financial objectives for 2019 and improving sales at some stores. 
Before the pandemic, J.C. Penney hoped to persuade creditors to give it more financial breathing room, as Soltau tried to forge a turnaround focused on the company's roots as a seller of affordable apparel for middle class families.

But discussions with creditors earlier this year did not win J.C. Penney any concessions, the sources said. The coronavirus outbreak prompted the company to draw $1.25 billion from its revolving credit line and eventually start making bankruptcy preparations.

771,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2020 11:54AM ET</span>",Oil Crash Busted a Broker’s Computers and Inflicted Huge Losses,"(Bloomberg) -- Syed Shah usually buys and sells stocks and currencies through his Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) account, but he couldn’t resist trying his hand at some oil trading on April 20, the day prices plunged below zero for the first time ever. The day trader, working from his house in a Toronto suburb, figured he couldn’t lose as he spent $2,400 snapping up crude at $3.30 a barrel, and then 50 cents. Then came what looked like the deal of a lifetime: buying 212 futures contracts on West Texas Intermediate for an astonishing penny each.
What he didn’t know was oil’s first trip into negative pricing had broken Interactive Brokers Group Inc. Its software couldn’t cope with that pesky minus sign, even though it was always technically possible -- though this was an outlandish idea before the pandemic -- for the crude market to go upside down. Crude was actually around negative $3.70 a barrel when Shah’s screen had it at 1 cent. Interactive Brokers never displayed a subzero price to him as oil kept diving to end the day at minus $37.63 a barrel.
At midnight, Shah got the devastating news: he owed Interactive Brokers $9 million. He’d started the day with $77,000 in his account.
“I was in shock,” the 30-year-old said in a phone interview. “I felt like everything was going to be taken from me, all my assets.”
To be clear, investors who were long those oil contracts had a brutal day, regardless of what brokerage they had their account in. What set Interactive Brokers apart, though, is that its customers were flying blind, unable to see that prices had turned negative, or in other cases locked into their investments and blocked from trading. Compounding the problem, and a big reason why Shah lost an unbelievable amount in a few hours, is that the negative numbers also blew up the model Interactive Brokers used to calculate the amount of margin -- aka collateral -- that customers needed to secure their accounts.
Thomas Peterffy, the chairman and founder of Interactive Brokers, says the journey into negative territory exposed bugs in the company’s software. “It’s a $113 million mistake on our part,” the 75-year-old billionaire said in an interview Wednesday. Since then, his firm revised that loss estimate down to $109.3 million. It’s been a moving target from the start; on April 21, Interactive Brokers figured it was down $88 million from the incident.
Customers will be made whole, Peterffy said. “We will rebate from our own funds to our customers who were locked in with a long position during the time the price was negative any losses they suffered below zero.”
That could help Shah. The day trader in Mississauga, Canada, bought his first five contracts for $3.30 each at 1:19 p.m. that historic Monday. Over the next 40 minutes or so he bought 21 more, the last for 50 cents. He tried to put an order in for a negative price, but the Interactive Brokers system rejected it, so he became more convinced that it wasn’t possible for oil to go below zero. At 2:11 p.m., he placed that dream-turned-nightmare trade at a penny.
It was only later that night that he saw on the news that oil had plunged to the never-before-seen price of negative $37.63 per barrel. What did that mean for the hundreds of contracts he’d bought? He frantically tried to contact support at the firm, but no one could help him. Then that late-night statement arrived with a loss so big it was expressed with an exponent.
The problem wasn’t confined to North America. Thousands of miles away, Interactive Brokers customer Manfred Koller ran into trouble similar to what Shah faced. Koller, who lives near Frankfurt and trades from his home computer on behalf of two friends, also didn’t realize oil prices could go negative.
He’d bought contracts for his friends on Interactive Brokers that day at $11 and between $4 and $5. Just after 2 p.m. New York time, his trading screen froze. “The price feed went black, there were no bids or offers anymore,” he said in an interview. Yet as far as he knew at this point, according to his Interactive Brokers account, he didn’t have anything to worry about as trading closed for the day.
Following the carnage, Interactive Brokers sent him notice that he owed $110,000. His friends were completely wiped out. “This is definitely not what you want to do, lose all your money in 20 minutes,” Koller said.
Besides locking up because of negative prices, a second issue concerned the amount of money Interactive Brokers required its customers to have on hand in order to trade. Known as margin, it’s a vital risk measure to ensure traders don’t lose more than they can afford. For the 212 oil contracts Shah bought for 1 cent each, the broker only required his account to have $30 of margin per contract. It was as if Interactive Brokers thought the potential loss of buying at one cent was one cent, rather than the almost unlimited downside that negative prices imply, he said.
“It seems like they didn’t know it could happen,” Shah said.
But it was known industrywide that CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME).’s benchmark oil contracts could go negative. Five days before the mayhem, the owner of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where the trading took place, sent a notice to all its clearing-member firms advising them that they could test their systems using negative prices. “Effective immediately, firms wishing to test such negative futures and/or strike prices in their systems may utilize CME’s ‘New Release’ testing environments” for crude oil, the exchange said.
Interactive Brokers got that notice, Peterffy said. But he doesn’t feel five days was enough time to upgrade his company’s trading platform.
“Five days, including the weekend, with the coronavirus going on and a complex system where we have to make many changes, was not a sufficient amount of time,” he said. “The idea we could have bugs is not, in my mind, a surprise.” He also acknowledged the error in the margin model Interactive Brokers used that day.
According to Peterffy, its customers were long 563 oil contracts on Nymex, as well as 2,448 related contracts listed at another company, Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc. For each of those, Interactive Brokers will issue a credit of $37,630, he said.
To give a sense of how far off the Interactive Brokers margin model was that day, similar trades to what Shah placed would have required $6,930 per trade in margin if he placed them at Intercontinental Exchange. That’s 231 times the $30 Interactive Brokers charged.
“I realized after the fact the margin for those contracts is very high and these trades should never have been processed,” he said. He didn’t sleep for three nights after getting the $9 million margin call, he said.
Peterffy accepted blame, but said there was little market liquidity after prices went negative, which could’ve prevented customers from exiting their trades anyway. He also laid responsibility on the exchanges and said the company had been in touch with the industry’s regulator, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
“We have called the CFTC and complained bitterly,” Petterfy said. “It appears the exchanges are going scot-free.”
Representatives of CME and Intercontinental Exchange declined to comment. A CFTC spokesman didn’t immediately return a request for comment.
Peterffy said there’s a problem with how exchanges design their contracts because the trading dries up as they near expiration. The May oil futures contract -- the one that went negative -- was expired the next day after the historic plunge, so most of the market had moved to trading the June contract.
“That’s how it’s possible for these contracts to go absolutely crazy and close at a price that has no economic justification,” Peterffy said. “The issue is whose responsibility is this?”

773,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Job Losses Show That Congress Has Urgent Work to Do,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- If anyone required further evidence of the havoc that the coronavirus pandemic has wrought on the U.S. economy, the Labor Department delivered it Friday: In a matter of weeks, more than 20 million people have been thrown out of work.
There’s a lot more that Congress can and should do to help.
The jobs report for April is a catalog of extremes. The unemployment rate, at 14.7%, is the highest since the Great Depression (and that is probably an underestimate). The share of the population employed, at 51.3%, is the lowest. The number of nonfarm jobs lost is by far the largest on record in a single month.
The data further reveal the heavy toll the crisis is taking on the poor and the marginalized. Job losses, for example, were concentrated in relatively low-wage sectors such as leisure, hospitality and retail, as hotels, restaurants and stores shut their doors.
Black and Latino people have suffered disproportionately, exposing and deepening the inequities that fracture American society. From February to April, their employment rates declined more sharply (10.6 and 13.8 percentage points, respectively) than those of their white counterparts.
Congress has acted to cushion the shock, most notably with the $2.2 trillion Cares Act that it approved in late March. But implementation has been weak. Emergency cash payments have been frustratingly slow to reach the people who need them most. Overwhelmed state bureaucracies have made it hard to collect enhanced unemployment benefits. The first-come-first-served forgivable loans of the Paycheck Protection Program have left out many of the businesses and jobs the measure was supposed to protect.
Now, legislators are struggling to reach agreement on another economic relief package. There’s no shortage of options to make the response more effective. Enhanced food-stamp benefits could quickly reach the non-tax-filers and unbanked that stimulus checks can’t. More federal funds could help states deliver better benefits faster. And design tweaks, together with refunding, could make PPP better at keeping people employed.
The cost is enormous and mounting, but so be it. Congress hould mobilize resources commensurate to this crisis — and do it as quickly as possible.

The VIX, commonly called the equity market’s fear gauge, fell to 29.5 as of 10:01 a.m. in New York, its first time below 30 since March 3. At that point two months ago, the S&P 500 had fallen 11% from its record high and still had an additional 25% to go before bottoming on March 23. The VIX would rise as high as 85.5, topping the 2008 record, as the coronavirus pandemic took hold.
Stock volatility has subsided, even in the lead up to Friday’s jobs report, as investors turn their focus toward what they hope will be a sharp economic recovery once the virus-related shutdowns ease. The S&P 500 has swung an average of just 0.8% a day over the past four sessions. That compares with an average of 5% a day in March, a record.
“People aren’t scared like they were in the second week of March,” said David Harden, the chief investment officer at Summit Global Investments. “The virus is more of a known quantity to everyone, we know how it affects us, we know how to protect ourselves. We’ve begun to normalize that into our lives.”
The S&P 500 is poised to snap a two-week streak of losses as states begin the early stages of reopening their economies and stimulative monetary policy measures loosen credit markets. With the gauge up almost 30% from the March lows, stock bears have been forced to reevaluate pessimistic views.
The VIX below 30 is still elevated compared with its long-term average of 19. According to Michael Purves, chief executive officer of Tallbacken Capital Advisors, a look at VIX contracts that expire in coming months -- as opposed to the front-month contract most traders use as a benchmark -- suggests volatility will likely remain for some time.
“While a continued rally here will most likely further put downward pressure on VIX spot and help de-invert the front month of the curve, the later-dated contracts are a reminder to us of the fragility of this risk-on condition,” Purves wrote to clients.

778,By Investing.com,"<span>May 08, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Jumps on Belief Worst Is Over After Jobless Surge,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets roared ahead on Friday, shrugging off the biggest rise in unemployment in U.S. history, as investors took the view that April's labor market report marks the worst of the pandemic's impact on markets.
By 10:20 AM ET (1420 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 341 points, or 1.4% at 24,217 points, while the S&P 500 was up 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite, which on Thursday erased its losses for the year and moved back into positive territory, also gained another 1.2%.
Earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed that nonfarm employment fell by 20.5 million in April, pushing the jobless rate up to 14.7% of the workforce. The broader U6 measure of underemployment rose to 22.8% of the workforce from 8.7% a month earlier.
""Today’s jobs report shows that shutting down the U.S. economy will create deep and long-lasting scars for America’s labor force,"" said Josh Lipsky of the Atlantic Council think-tank. ""It is clear there will be no 'V' shaped bounce back from the depths of this shock."" 
Lipsky was critical of the rush to reopen the economy, arguing that a fresh wave of infections could lead to worse economic outcomes. 
""With a large majority of Americans still reluctant to go out and spend, reopening too early will likely trigger higher infection rates without delivering a meaningful economic recovery -- a double blow that could prolong the pain for America’s workers.""
However, two months of relentlessly negative news flow and the awareness of a comprehensive Federal Reserve backstop mean that investors are more inclined to trust in the recovery so far. Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock rose 4.8% after CEO Dara Khosroshahi said the pandemic would delay its goal of an operating profit by ""quarters, not years"". Uber’s first-quarter loss widened to $2.94 billion in the first quarter as it wrote down a raft of unprofitable investments.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:NYSE:DIS) stock rose 2.3% after the company said the reopening of its Shanghai theme park - capped by the authorities at 30% of capacity - had sold out immediately. Airlines and cruise line stocks, which have been roundly battered in the last two months, were also among the biggest gainers.
There was also better news from Detroit, with General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock rising 5.6% after raising $4 billion in senior unsecured debt, further bolstering its liquidity position after a first quarter that saw it conserve cash better than expected. Ford Motor (NYSE:F) stock also rose 3.8% after it said it aims to restart production at its North American factories from May 18. The company also said on Thursday that its two Chinese joint ventures had posted year-over-year sales gains in April.
Among the losers,  Roku  (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock fell 5.3% after the maker of streaming devices lowered its guidance for revenue and gross profit this year in response to a dismal first quarter for advertising. Its net loss widened in the first quarter due to higher subscriber acquisition costs and a drop in the advertising revenue on its free channel."

783,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2020 09:27AM ET</span>","States, Cities Cut Payrolls by Nearly 1 Million Over Shutdown","(Bloomberg) -- U.S. states and cities cut their payrolls steeply as the broad shutdown of the economy decimated tax collections, threatening to push them into the worst fiscal crisis in decades.
The number of state and local government jobs fell by 981,000 to 18.9 million in April, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. The drop, while small compared with the nearly 20 million private sector jobs lost last month, is significant because governments didn’t start laying off employees until well after the onset of the last recession.
The pandemic-related shutdowns are leaving local governments nationwide facing ballooning deficits as surging unemployment dashes income-tax collections and the closure of businesses hammers sales taxes, another major revenue source.
With schools shut, the vast majority of the lost public sector jobs were in education and they’re likely to be reversed when children return. But local governments also cut about 332,000 jobs outside of school systems. States eliminated 4,300 outside of that sector.
“Everybody in this country, the private sector included, is having to contract,” said Erik Walsh, city manager for San Antonio, Texas, which furloughed about 270 employees who work for the convention center and the Alamodome stadium after hotel-tax revenue dropped. “And the city is doing the same thing.”
Governors and mayors have pleaded with Congress for aid to help make up for the lost revenue, warning that without it they will need to resort to deep budget cuts and layoffs that would exert a drag on any economic recovery.
States alone may see record deficits of $460 billion from now until June 2021, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and California on Thursday projected a shortfall of $54 billion through then, the equivalent to about one-third of its annual budget. The National League of Cities said as many as 1 million Americans on municipal government payrolls could lose their jobs or see pay reduced.
It typically takes many months for economic slowdowns to affect government revenues. Following the last recession, local governments didn’t start cutting jobs deeply until mid-2009, when it was officially coming to an end.
But this time the speed and scale of the downturn is spurring some governments to act more quickly. Rochester, New York, announced the city would cut 17 positions and that its remaining 386 employees would be subject to furloughs or “work sharing,” which the city said would save $2.1 million.
“We are hopeful that our federal and state governments will step up to help Rochester and other cities,” Mayor Lovely Warren said in a statement. “But we cannot wait.”

786,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",U.S. regulators started Scotiabank probe before metals closure: filings,"By Peter Hobson
LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. regulators were investigating Bank of Nova Scotia's ( Scotiabank 's) (TO:BNS) metals trading activities several months before it told staff it would wind down the unit, according to its most recent earnings report.
Scotia, one of the most venerable names in the gold trade, told staff in a global call on April 28 that it would wind down its metals business by around the start of 2021, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time.
Scotia has declined to comment on the report. 
In its first quarter earnings statement in February, Scotia said its metals business was under investigation by U.S. regulators.
""The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Department of Justice's Criminal Division are conducting investigations into (Scotiabank's) activities and trading practices in the metals markets and related conduct,"" it said.
It said it was ""responding to requests for information related to these investigations.""
Scotia did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on the investigation. The DoJ and CFTC declined to comment. 
A U.S. court filing in March shows that Scotia also provided around 800,000 pages of evidence to regulators probing precious metals trading at  JP Morgan Chase  & Co. (N:JPM).
Six current and former employees of JPMorgan have been charged since 2018 in relation to alleged spoofing, a technique that involves traders pushing markets up or down by placing bids to buy or offers to sell but cancelling them before execution. 
JPMorgan has said in U.S. regulatory filings that its metals trading practices are the subject of probes from ""various authorities"" and that it is ""responding to and cooperating with these investigations"".
CURTAIN DRAWN
The winding down of Scotia's metals business draws the curtain on what was for years the world's biggest lender to the physical precious metals industry, with a history stretching to the founding in 1684 of London gold dealer Mocatta Bullion.
Scotia's senior management had long viewed its metals business as inherently high risk and out of step with its core strategy, six sources familiar with the matter said. 
In its heyday a decade ago, ScotiaMocatta, as the unit was known, brought in around $300 million a year, but increasing regulation has required more capital to be put aside to back trading, making it less profitable.
In 2017, Scotia decided to sell the metals business, but failed to find a buyer and instead sharply downsized it.
Scotia also tried to sell its India metals operation, one of the biggest importers of gold to India, but decided last year to close it, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.

""They changed it and downsized it to fit the profile they wanted,"" one of the sources said. ""But they realised it is still more than they want.""

The lawyer said the indictment, accepted by an Istanbul court late on Thursday, formally charged the four pilots and a company executive with ""migrant smuggling"", a crime carrying a maximum sentence of eight years in jail.
Two flight attendants were charged with failing to report a crime, which can carry a jail sentence of up to one year, lawyer Mehmet Fatih Danaci told Reuters.
The prosecutors' office did not immediately comment. 
Turkish police detained the suspects on Jan. 2 and an interior ministry official was cited at the time as saying that Turkish border police were not notified about Ghosn's arrival and that neither his entry nor his exit were registered.
The following day, Turkish private jet operator MNG Jet said the former Nissan boss had used two of its planes illegally in his escape from Japan, with an employee falsifying lease records to exclude his name from the documents.
MNG Jet, which had filed a criminal complaint for the illegal use of its aircraft, said on Friday that it welcomed the prosecutor's decision and will ""continue to cooperate with Turkish and Japanese authorities to bring justice"".

Ghosn has said he fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes, which he denies.

789,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2020 08:09AM ET</span>",Jobless Benefits May Be the Intended Victim of Fast Reopenings,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Many states are racing to reopen their economies before measures such as testing, contact tracing and full-time mask-wearing are in place. But the one of biggest economic effect of a hasty end of lockdowns adopted to limit the spread of the coronavirus won’t be to save businesses; it will be to kick people off of desperately needed government assistance.
While almost all other developed nations are seeing their new Covid-19 cases decline as a result of lockdowns and other public-health measures, the U.S. has only managed to reach a plateau. State-by-state data paints an even grimmer picture with infections and deaths falling in the hard-hit New York City metro area but rising elsewhere. In this dire situation, it would seem imprudent to lift lockdowns nationwide. Although a few states -- Alaska, Hawaii and a handful of others -- have low case growth, copious testing and teams of contact tracers standing ready to catch outbreaks before they can spread, most are not ready yet. And in fact, most Americans want government to wait before reopening:
Proponents of reopening paint it as a choice between human lives and the economy. If tens or hundreds of thousands of Americans die so that the economy can live, so be it. But this probably is a false choice. A premature reopening is unlikely to resuscitate the economy, because lockdowns aren’t the biggest factor keeping people in their houses. The biggest factor is simply fear of the virus itself.
Most states began closing schools and large public events about March 15, but didn’t issue stay-at-home orders until a week or so later. But by that time, restaurant traffic nationwide had collapsed:
The obvious explanation is that the same fear that drove public pressure for states to adopt lockdowns also kept people at home. Nor has this fear dissipated as the outbreak has continued. A recent CBS News poll found that even if stay-at-home orders were lifted, 48% of Americans wouldn’t return to public places until the outbreak is over, while an additional 39% say it would depend on the course of the outbreak. A large majority -- 71% -- said they wouldn’t be comfortable going to a bar or restaurant.
This widespread wariness will be devastating for any business that relies on foot traffic. Restaurants and shops have to pay monthly rent and other costs that don’t depend on the amount of business they do. Very few brick-and-mortar businesses can survive a 70% decline in patronage.
On top of this, it will be hard for many of these businesses to find workers willing to tolerate the increased risks without large increases in pay. Already, workers at meat-packing plants, which tend to be among the hardest-hit workplaces, are quitting as the plants reopen.
Leaders intent on reopening might be able to force workers back to their jobs by canceling their unemployment checks. For example, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds recently declared that workers not returning to the job because they're afraid of getting sick would be treated as having quit, and they would lose the unemployment benefits that now are their economic lifeline. Other states have made similar threats.
Giving workers a no-win choice between abject poverty and mortal danger will force some back to factories, stores and offices. But that doesn’t mean that there will be much work for them to do. Consumers can’t be forced to shop or dine out at gunpoint. As both polls and restaurant reservation data show, as long as the coronavirus is still running rampant, Americans will continue to cook at home, order goods online, cut their own hair, watch Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) instead of going to the movies and so on. And with unemployment checks canceled, demand for local services will tumble even more. Meanwhile, if infections begin to accelerate again, consumer fear will become more deeply entrenched.
In other words, premature reopenings may well hurt state economies instead of helping them. So why are governors doing it? One possibility is that for some conservative leaders, withholding government benefits for workers, consumers and businesses is a goal in and of itself. Governors such as Reynolds might be simply misinformed about the choices they face, but they might be motivated by a principled opposition to government payouts.
This would be a terrible reason to reopen. Small-government principles are not worth the loss of both citizens’ lives and their economic well-being. Instead, states should maintain and intensify lockdowns while racing to increase testing and hire contact tracers for those who test positive. A safe reopening is within reach, but it requires patience and discipline -- two qualities that seem sorely lacking in the U.S. today.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to post sharp gains Friday, as signs of improving U.S.-China relations provided a fresh dose of optimism.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 29 points, or 1%, higher, Nasdaq futures were up 90 points, or 1%. The Dow futures contract rose 237 points, or 1%.
Wall Street is set to post its first winning week in three, while the Nasdaq cash index, the home of the country’s tech giants, has erased all of 2020 losses, to lie just 8.5% below its all-time high.
Earlier Friday, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed they will work together to create a favorable environment for implementing the Phase 1 trade deal reached early this year.
That offered some relief to investors worried about rising tensions between the two countries after President Donald Trump threatened to terminate the agreement earlier this week, in addition to criticizing China's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
This rosier outlook comes as investors await a monthly update on the state of the jobs market, which will show the depth of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the American economy.
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls plunged by 22 million last month, when the data are released at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
On the earnings front, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) stock climbed 7% premarket despite reporting a first quarter loss of $2.9 billion.
The Silicon Valley firm said its ride-hailing business had been ""hit hard by the ongoing pandemic"", though there was room for optimism as its smaller Uber Eats division was buoyed by a surge in food deliveries. 
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock climbed over 2% premarket after disclosing hefty demand for tickets for its Shanghai Disneyland park, which reopens on May 11.
Adding to the positive tone are continued gains in oil futures Friday, helped by Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter of oil, increasing its official selling prices for June. That follows signs of North American producers slashing output faster than skeptics expected.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 1.2% higher at $23.81 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 1.1% to $29.77..

791,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 06:56AM ET</span>","Green hydrogen's time has come, say advocates eying post-pandemic world","By Nina Chestney and Kate Abnett
LONDON (Reuters) - Hydrogen has long been touted as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. Now, as major economies prepare green investments to kickstart growth, advocates spy a golden chance to drag the niche energy into the mainstream of a post-pandemic world. 
Green hydrogen was pushed to the fore last week when Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said the technology was ""ready for the big time"" and urged governments to channel investments into the fuel.
Some countries, including the Netherlands, Australia and Portugal, have already begun investing in the technology. Now investors, politicians and businesses are pushing the European Union and others to use its post-crisis recovery plan to support hydrogen in areas like trucking and heavy industry. 
The promise of hydrogen as a fuel to help power vehicles and energy plants has been a talking point since the 1970s, but it is currently too expensive for widespread use. Proponents say infrastructure investment and more demand from transport, gas grids and industry will bring the cost down.
Most hydrogen used today is extracted from natural gas in a process that produces carbon emissions, which defeats the object for many policymakers. But there is potential to extract ""green"" hydrogen from water with electrolysis, an energy-intensive but carbon-free process if powered by renewable electricity. 
EU officials, one of whom described green hydrogen as the ""holy grail"", said it could replace fossil fuels in sectors that lack alternatives to align operations with the EU's Green Deal plan to reduce net emissions to zero by 2050. 
""Hydrogen could solve a lot of problems. We need everything else as well but the political interest is because to achieve deep energy efficiency and decarbonisation, hydrogen seems relatively easy,"" said Jesse Scott, senior advisor at think-tank Agora Energiewende. 
""It is less alarming (for policymakers) than some other elements for meeting net zero,"" she added, such as carbon removal technology for example. 
HYDROGEN GAINING MOMENTUM
Momentum appears to be building; EU industry chief Thierry Breton met hydrogen companies online this week to discuss the bloc's recovery from the pandemic.
""We could use these circumstances, where loads of public money are going to be needed into the energy system, to jump forward towards a hydrogen economy,"" said Diederik Samsom, who heads the European Commission's climate cabinet.
This could result in hydrogen use scaling up faster than was expected before the pandemic, he added. 
The European Commission has earmarked clean hydrogen - a loose term which can include gas-based hydrogen, if fitted with technology to capture the resulting emissions - as a ""priority area"" for industry in its Green Deal.
Over the past year, several governments, including Germany, Britain, Australia and Japan, have announced or have been working on hydrogen strategies and the pace has picked up over the past month during the pandemic. 
This week, Australia set aside A$300 million ($191 million) to jumpstart hydrogen projects. Portugal plans to build a new solar-powered hydrogen plant which will produce hydrogen by electrolysis by 2023. 
The Netherlands unveiled a hydrogen strategy in late March, outlining plans for 500 megawatts (MW) of green electrolyser capacity by 2025. A German hydrogen strategy is expected later this month.
The Dutch government is pushing for the EU to follow suit and present an ""action plan"" for clean hydrogen, a spokesperson told Reuters. 
CAN IT BECOME AFFORDABLE?
When it comes to transport, hydrogen fuel cells trail electric batteries in the push for greener cars, given their higher price and the lack of refuelling stations. But proponents see potential for heavier vehicles.
Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) and Volvo Trucks unveiled plans last month to bring hydrogen fuelled heavy-duty vehicles to market within the decade.
Hydrogen gas is already used in industry to produce ammonia, which goes into fertilisers, and methanol, used to make plastic. 
A major drawback of the green hydrogen that governments are most interested in, is that it requires a large amount of renewable electricity to produce. The good news is, renewables prices have fallen sharply in recent years. 
According to Bernstein analysts, hydrogen made from fossil fuels currently costs between $1-$1.8/kg. Green hydrogen can cost around $6/kg today, making it significantly more expensive than the fossil fuel alternatives.
However, increased demand could reduce the cost of electrolysis. Coupled with falling renewable energy costs, green hydrogen could fall to $1.7/kg by 2050 and possibly sub-$1/kg, making it competitive with natural gas. Higher carbon prices would also encourage the shift.
""Clean hydrogen produced from electricity is around three times more expensive than that from natural gas, but solar and wind costs have decreased in recent years and if they continue to fall, clean hydrogen produced with lower electricity costs would become more affordable,"" said Philippe Vie, global energy and utilities lead at consultancy Capgemini.
""On hydrogen we are right now where we were with renewables in 2000-2005. Ten to 15 years is probably a good time lapse to become competitive,"" he added.
MAJOR MONEY NEEDED 
Any serious attempt at large-scale use - either in industry or transportation - would also require major infrastructure investments. For example, power from an offshore wind farm would need to be connected to an electrolyser that produces the green hydrogen, which would then need to be transported to end users. 
Europe has around 135 MW of electrolyser capacity, but planned green hydrogen projects could bring that to 5.2 gigawatts, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. But many projects hinge on further investment partners or subsidies, which advocates fear will be scarcer in the COVID-19-induced economic slump.
""Investments that would have been foreseen to be done now are not made because production is delayed,"" Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, secretary general of lobby group Hydrogen Europe, told Reuters.
To help lower costs, several projects are being worked on across the gas infrastructure, industry, mining and energy sectors.
Royal Dutch Shell (L:RDSa) and Dutch gas firm Gasunie unveiled plans in February to build a mammoth wind-powered hydrogen plant in the northern Netherlands, capable of producing 800,000 tonnes of hydrogen by 2040.
In Germany, oil refinery Raffinerie Heide is embarking on a project using excess wind energy and abundant water supply in the region to produce hydrogen to make kerosene.
""The price of hydrogen we pay for now is four times natural gas from an external source fed through the pipeline and produced 30 km away,"" said CEO Juergen Wollschlaeger.
A big fear for companies in the hydrogen industry is that they will be unable to take advantage of the unique opportunity presented by vast economic stimulus packages, and that governments will favour supporting traditional high-carbon fuel sectors that have been hit hard by a collapse in energy demand.

""For us, that will be the question to be answered in the next weeks. Will the carbon fuel industry succeed in convincing the officials to support them?"" Bernd Hübner, chief financial officer at German green hydrogen start-up Hy2gen said.

792,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Deutsche Boerse chief would be good Deutsche Bank chairman: investor,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Theodor Weimer, the chief executive of Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn), would make a suitable successor for Paul Achleitner as  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) chairman, a leading investor in the lender said.
The comments by Germany's Union Investment, a top 20 shareholder in the bank, is a rare public endorsement in the succession wrangling that has so far largely remained behind the scenes. 
Achleitner, whose second-five year term as chairman ends in 2022 and has been under pressure to leave earlier, has been working on a succession plan, according to people with knowledge of his thinking.
Weimer is a top contender to replace Achleitner, some of those sources have said. Weimer is up for election to fill a spot on Deutsche Bank's supervisory board at the lender's annual general meeting (AGM) on May 20. 
Vanda (NASDAQ:VNDA) Heinen, Union Investment analyst focused on corporate governance, told Reuters she supported Weimer's ascension to the board and to eventually become chairman.
""After his departure from Deutsche Boerse, we believe he would be a suitable successor to Mr. Achleitner."" 
Investors have been frustrated with the 80% decline in Deutsche Bank's share price over the past decade, billions of euros in losses, as well as the bank's involvement in money laundering scandals. 
A top shareholder advisor, Glass Lewis, has called on investors to vote against ratifying Achleitner's actions at the AGM in a blow to one of Europe's most prominent bankers.
Weimer is under contract to manage Deutsche Boerse until the end of 2024. There is no indication he would leave the well-paying CEO job at the exchange operator early for the less lucrative oversight role at Deutsche Bank.
A spokeswoman for Weimer said he wouldn't be available to chair Deutsche as long as he is at the helm of Deutsche Boerse.

Deutsche Bank declined to comment.

794,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Biden allies told to attack Trump's stimulus as 'cronyism',"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allies of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden are being told to sharpen attacks on President Donald Trump's stimulus efforts as thinly veiled ""cronyism,"" according to a memo being sent to Democratic officeholders and supporters on Friday.
The memo, which was seen by Reuters, gives Biden campaign representatives new language to use in their attacks on Trump and shows a campaign honing an increasingly aggressive tone ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
The strategy document says Trump's post-pandemic stimulus contains ""the largest corporate bailout in American history,"" a kind of ""cronyism,"" that is ""systematically rigged in favor of big businesses, the wealthy, and the financial sector - and against the working people and middle class families who are enduring the worst economic losses the country has faced in modern memory.""
A Biden campaign spokesman declined to comment on the memo, which was written by two of the campaign's top policy advisers, Stef Feldman and Jake Sullivan.
A Trump campaign spokesman, Tim Murtaugh, characterized the argument as ""pathetic.""
""The president has been hard at work protecting the safety of Americans and also safeguarding the economy, while Joe Biden sits in his basement lobbing political hand grenades in a desperate plea for relevance,"" Murtaugh said.
Biden and Trump are both retooling economic plans after the coronavirus pandemic put more than 33 million Americans out of work and ended the longest recorded boom in U.S. history.
Each candidate is also searching for a winning message on the economy for the election that political strategists increasingly see as a single-issue campaign - how to deal with the health and economic consequences of the pandemic. 
The novel coronavirus has infected more than 1.25 million Americans and killed more than 75,000, the world's highest number of cases and deaths.
TWO THEMES
With the new attacks, Biden is attempting to court not just moderate and independent voters but also liberals in his own party, some of whom favored the tough-on-corporation message of Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, his former rivals for the Democratic nomination.
Even though Biden has strong union ties and touts working-class values, some left-wing voters find his policies not progressive enough and also dislike his use of high-dollar fundraisers to finance his campaign.
While Democrats in Congress supported nearly $3 trillion compromise stimulus legislation, Biden's team is asking allies to attack various faults that have emerged in the program, the memo shows.
The campaign cited media reports and research suggesting that small businesses with ties to the administration received aid, that banks may be prioritizing wealthy clients when making loans under the emergency program and that Democratic-led states that did not support Trump's re-election might not be getting sufficient support. 
Government officials have said they are prioritizing oversight as they manage the programs.
A Reuters analysis on Thursday showed that some U.S. companies that took in emergency government loans had months of cash on hand to cover expenses.
Biden's team also took issue with the Federal Reserve for backstopping the ""junk"" bond market with too-few conditions attached, the memo showed.
Trump's campaign has been refining its message too after the strong economy it was overseeing withered under the coronavirus pandemic.
Several Trump aides say their 2020 campaign will now be chiefly defined by two themes: Trump is the only candidate who can resurrect the economy and that Biden will not be as tough on China, a country Trump is blaming for the pandemic.
Reuters/Ipsos polling this week showed that 45% of Americans said Trump was better suited to create jobs, while 32% said Biden was the better candidate for that task.

The former vice president was due to deliver an economic policy speech on Friday on NowThis, a left-leaning news platform aimed at younger audiences. It was not clear if his speech would match the tone or content of the memo.

Investing.com -- Perhaps Europeans just aren’t optimistic enough. Their continent is well ahead of the U.S. in terms of bringing the Covid-10 pandemic under control, and looks likely to do a better job of supporting consumer incomes, through the crisis, but you wouldn’t guess it from the stock market performance.
After another lackluster week, with a rise of only 0.9% despite a steady stream of news flow about economic reopening, the Stoxx 600 is still down 18% for the year, underperforming the S&P 500’s 10% drop and even the 16% decline notched by the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, has disappeared over the horizon, having now made it back to its 2020 starting point.
The composition of the respective indices explains a lot: the Stoxx 600 is dominated by traditional cyclical and financial stocks, many of which are now facing just the latest in a series of existential challenges.
European markets have not had the support from heavily-weighted tech companies truly positioned to exploit the pandemic's most immediate effect: the quickening transition to a digital and often remote economy. There is no European company to rival Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in cloud storage; for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the best that Europe can offer is  ITV  (LON:ITV), Prosieben or a Vivendi (OTC:VIVHY).
Even the biggest online-only retail or Internet names such as Zalando (DE:ZALG),  Adyen  (AS:ADYEN) or Just Eat Takeaway (AS:TKWY) are not big enough to move the broader market’s dial. Those that are, such as SAP (DE:SAPG), have been hobbled by individual problems, the German enterprise software giant ditching co-CEO Jennifer Morgan only a few months after appointing her. Ocado (LON:OCDO), the U.K.-based online grocery store that morphed into an infrastructure provider for supermarkets' online channels, is an honorable exception.
To find other European companies that really are in a Covid-created sweet spot, you have to look very hard. Europe's closest approximation to Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM), for example, is German-based  TeamViewer  (DE:TMV), a provider of remote technical support. TeamViewer, which went public last year at a price of 26.50 euros, has risen 65% since then, which is also more or less what it has gained since the height of the March panic. It reports its first-quarter earnings next week.
Payments company Adyen, a 2018 market debutant, has done even better, more than doubling since its IPO. It has hit a series of new record highs in recent days, as both it and sector peers PayPal and Square (NYSE:SQ) have talked of boom times ahead. But Adyen’s very rarity means that investors have to pay a ferocious premium to hold it: the stock now trades at 13 times 12-month trailing sales.
That’s a valuation that suggests desperation in the search for any business model that offers a truly viable future. Given the certainty of an unprecedented contraction in the economy, and the lack of certainty about the shape of any subsequent recovery, that desperation is likely to be reflected in prices for some time."

China’s Vice Premier Liu He talked with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by phone on Friday Beijing time, according to China’s Xinhua News Agency. The two sides pledged to cooperate on the economy and public health, the report said.

In corporate news, ING  (AS:INGA) stock climbed over 5% despite the Dutch bank posting a drop in first quarter profit of 35% on the back of higher provisions taken for the potential fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. The numbers were still better than expected.
However, activity is likely to be limited Friday ahead of the key U.S. employment report for April, which will capture an entire month of lockdown measures that brought large parts of the economy to a standstill.

799,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 03:46AM ET</span>",India may see 0% GDP growth this fiscal year: Moody's,"By Swati Bhat
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The impact of the coronavirus outbreak will exacerbate the material slowdown in India's economic growth, with the country expected to see 0% expansion in the current fiscal year, analysts at Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said on Friday.
The ratings agency said it expected India to see no growth in financial year 2021 and bounce back to a 6.6% GDP growth in FY22, while the fiscal deficit is seen rising to 5.5% of GDP in FY21 versus the budgeted estimate of 3.5%.
The COVID-19 spread in the country has also ""significantly reduced the prospects of a durable fiscal consolidation,"" it said in a report.
In November, Moody's cut the outlook on India's sovereign rating of Baa2 to ""negative"" from ""stable"" due to a slowdown in growth and had said it will monitor the country's debt levels closely. 
Baa2 is the second-lowest investment grade score.
""Prolonged financial stress among rural households, weak job creation and, more recently, a credit crunch among non-bank financial institutions have increased the probability of a more entrenched weakening,"" the agency noted.
If nominal GDP growth does not return to high rates the government will face very significant constraints in narrowing the budget deficit and preventing a rise in the debt burden, Moody's said.
India has so far outlined a 1.7 trillion rupee ($22.53 billion) stimulus plan providing direct cash transfers and food security measures to give relief to millions of poor and a second package focussing on help for small and medium businesses is expected soon.
Moody's reiterated that the negative outlook indicates an upgrade is unlikely in the near term. 
""We would be likely to change the rating outlook to stable if we saw a significant increase in the probability of fiscal metrics stabilizing and strengthening over time,"" it said. 
It added that a downgrade of India's rating would likely occur ""if we expected its fiscal metrics to weaken materially"".
India's eight-week long lockdown, one of the world's most stringent, has helped contain the spread of the coronavirus, officials say, with the country having reported only 56,342 cases and 1,886 deaths, compared to the 3.86 million global infections.
""Lower growth and government revenue generation, coupled with coronavirus-related fiscal stimulus measures, will lead to higher government debt ratios, which we project to rise to around 81% of GDP over the next few years,"" Moody's said.

While the government remains committed to medium-term fiscal consolidation, material strengthening in India's public finances is likely to be limited near term and the debt burden will remain sensitive to changes in nominal GDP growth, it added.

801,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 03:42AM ET</span>",Indian police file complaint against LG Chem after deadly gas leak,"By Sudarshan Varadhan
CHENNAI, India (Reuters) - Indian police have filed a complaint against an LG Chem subsidiary over a toxic gas leak at its chemical plant in the south of the country that killed 11 people and sickened almost a thousand more. 
Authorities doubled the evacuation area around the factory in Andhra Pradesh to a 5 kilometre (3 mile) radius on Friday, a day after the gas first began leaking. Around 800 people were hospitalised.
A copy of the police complaint filed against the management of LG Chem's subsidiary LG Polymers, viewed by Reuters, cited several counts of negligence and culpable homicide. 
The report, which precedes a full police investigation and potential charges, refers to negligent handling of poisonous substances and causing hurt and endangering public life due to negligence. Culpable homicide is classifed as not amounting to murder.
An LG Chem spokesman in Seoul declined to comment on the police report. 
There was confusion about whether Friday's expanded evacuation orders were sparked by a renewed leak, as reported by at least one local fire official, or by the fear that rising temperatures at the plant could lead to another leak.
LG Chem said on Friday there was no second leak at the plant, which makes polystyrene products used in manufacturing electric fan blades, cups and cutlery and containers for cosmetic products.
""LG Chem has asked the police to evacuate residents as a precautionary measure as there are concerns that tank temperatures would rise,"" South Korea's biggest petrochemical maker said in a statement. ""We are taking necessary measures, including putting water into the tank.""
N. Surendra Anand, a fire officer in Visakhapatnam district, had earlier told Reuters that more people were being evacuated because of renewed emissions from the plant: ""the situation is tense."" Residents said police began moving them out of their homes and into waiting buses from around midnight.
Srijana Gummalla, commissioner of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, said gas emissions had been fluctuating through the day and had largely subsided. 
LG Chem shares fell as much as 2.4% in early trade on Friday, before regaining some ground to be down 0.6% against the broader South Korea market's 1% gain. The stock lost nearly 2% on Thursday.
India's government has formed a committee, which includes senior bureaucrats, to investigate the leak, identified by authorities as coming from styrene, a principal raw material at the plant.
The factory was in the process of reopening after a weeks-long shutdown imposed by Indian authorities to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, local officials and the company said.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy said in a televised address on Thursday that the leak occurred because the styrene had been stored for a long period of time.

A build-up of short positions in fed funds futures contracts could have resulted in a squeeze Thursday, forcing a mass of traders to hit the exit at the same time and push rate expectations below zero, according to Wall Street strategists. They recommended investors fade the move.
“Markets may be undergoing a repositioning or short squeeze — akin to the recent move in oil futures,” TD Securities’ Priya Misra and Gennadiy Goldberg wrote in a note Thursday. “We do not think this is justified by fundamentals as FOMC members have repeatedly stated that they do not expect to take rates negative.”
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. strategist Jay Barry agreed, suggesting investors may have been positioned for higher yields, after the Treasury announced earlier this week a surge in T-bill supply was on the way.
The January fed funds futures contract reached a peak of 100.025 on Thursday in New York -- a record high -- indicating a policy rate of negative two and a half basis points.
A host of dovish rhetoric from Fed officials has reignited speculation of negative U.S. rates after Chairman Jerome Powell dismissed the idea in March. Two-year Treasury yields sank to a record low Thursday as officials including Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari sounded a cautious note about the U.S. economy’s recovery from the virus pandemic.
Many strategists recommended traders fade the move. The TD Securities duo suggested investors sell July 2021 fed funds futures, while strategists at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) preferred expressing this view using January 2021 overnight index swaps.

805,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 12:10AM ET</span>","Asian shares up as U.S., China trade negotiators talk","By Andrew Galbraith and David Henry
SHANGHAI/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian shares rose on Friday as investors focused on talks between U.S. and Chinese trade officials and solid corporate earnings rather than the looming release of data expected to show the worst U.S. unemployment rate in more than 70 years.
Having opened higher following gains on Wall Street overnight, Asian markets had a further boost late in the morning on Chinese state media reports that U.S. and Chinese trade representatives had held a phone call and pledged to cooperate on carrying out the countries' Phase 1 trade deal.
The news lifted U.S. stock futures, pushing E-minis for the S&P 500 up 1.06% to 2,910.5. 
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest gauge of Asian share indexes outside Japan was 1.1% higher and Japan's Nikkei added 1.78%.
Australian shares were 0.76% higher. China's blue-chip CSI300 index gained 0.86%.
While rising equity markets on Friday were accompanied by a slight uptick in U.S. Treasury yields, bond markets remained focused on the shaky global economic picture as coronavirus-related lockdowns continue to depress economic activity, despite signs of reopening.
""The equity market is disconnected and optimistic ... We've got this bizarre scenario at the moment, where the bond market is really looking at the doomsday economic data and also hopes for potentially further support from the U.S. Federal Reserve,"" said Ryan Felsman, senior economist at CommSec in Sydney. 
Data from Japan on Friday showed the impact of lockdowns, with household spending plunging 6% on year in March, and service-sector activity shrinking at a record pace.
Wall Street indexes climbed on Thursday, with the Nasdaq erasing losses for 2020, following a clutch of upbeat earnings. PayPal Holdings soared 14%.
After hitting a record lows of 0.129% on Thursday, the yield on U.S. two-year Treasurys ticked up to 0.1368%, while the benchmark 10-year note edged back up to 0.644% from the previous day's close of 0.631%. 
The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 1.3342% from a close of 1.321% Thursday. 
Bond markets were jolted this week, and the U.S. yield curve steepened after the U.S. Treasury Department said it would introduce a long-planned 20-year bond and expected to borrow $2.999 trillion in the second quarter. 
But yields fell from three-week highs on Thursday as investors digested the prospect of a surge in debt supply and as some saw a dim outlook for the economy as it emerges from virus lockdowns. 
Federal funds futures <0#FF> continued to show expectations of negative U.S. interest rates on Friday, even as Federal Reserve officials have said such a development would be bad for the economy. 
Looming on the market horizon is a report on Friday that is expected to show that the U.S. April unemployment rate jumped to 16% as people stayed home to thwart the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Markets had a foretaste with weekly claims for unemployment benefits that added up to some 33.5 million people over the past few weeks, roughly one of every five American workers.
In currency trading, the dollar index falling 0.171% to 99.646 after hitting a two-week high on Thursday as some investors took profits ahead of the jobs report.
The euro rose 0.17% to buy $1.0850, but the dollar was steady against at 106.33 yen.
Oil prices rose on hopes that easing lockdowns would boost demand. Brent futures were up 29 cents, or 0.98%, at $29.75 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 28 cents, or 1.19%, to $23.83.

After rising more than 2% on Thursday in anticipation of weak U.S. jobs data, spot gold edged down 0.1% to $1,715.72 an ounce.

806,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>",U.S. Stock Futures Gain as Negotiators Vow Effort on Trade Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. stock index futures rose after China’s Xinhua News Agency reported that top trade negotiators of the two nations vowed to create favorable conditions for the implementation of a phase-one trade deal.
Contracts on the S&P 500 rose 1.1% as of 12:02 p.m. in Tokyo, while futures climbed 1.1% on the Nasdaq 100 Index and 1.2% on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. China’s Vice Premier Liu He talked with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin by phone on Friday Beijing time, according to Xinhua. The two sides pledged to cooperate on the economy and public health, the report said.
“Given the recent rising tensions between the U.S. and China surrounding Covid-19, investors are likely comforted to see that both sides are still working toward implementing the phase-one deal,” said Takeo Kamai, head of execution services at CLSA Securities Japan. “Disruption in the trade front would’ve added another level of anxiety and put us right back to the central issue for the markets in 2019.”
The gains in equity futures added to bullish sentiment that drove shares higher on Wall Street on Thursday. The underlying S&P 500 rallied 1.15% with speculation mounting that the worst of the economic damage from the virus has passed as more of the country reopens.
Filings for unemployment remained at historically high levels, but fell from the prior week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite turned positive for the year, wiping out losses that reached as much as 24% at the depths of the pandemic-fueled sell-off.
“Although one fails to see how the phase-one trade deal implementation report will be music to the ears of the U.S. administration, seeing the latest trade statistics between U.S. and China, the engagement expected between the two sides has nevertheless calmed some nerves for the market,” Jingyi Pan, a market strategist at IG Asia Pte. in Singapore, wrote in a research note.

807,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 08, 2020 12:00AM ET</span>","Asia Momentum at Level That Presaged Past Routs, Bernstein Says","(Bloomberg) -- If it has paid off in the past to bet on Asian stocks showing momentum, that strategy has now become too expensive.
That’s according to Sanford C. Bernstein’s Rupal Agarwal, who noted the valuation spread between winners and losers is at record levels -- much higher than in 2000 and 2008, when a “catastrophic” crash followed. Back then, the factor slumped 38% and 48%, respectively, over the next six months, the strategist wrote in a report Friday.
An MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) gauge tracking momentum shares in Asia ex-Japan is outperforming the broader market this year, showing a decline of just 4% compared with a 13% slump in the regional index.
“Momentum is a late-cycle factor which tends to work well during times of expansion when the trend has been established and hence winners continue to be winners while losers continue to be losers,” Agarwal wrote. “During times of economic recession or recovery, momentum strategies underperform as the factor hates uncertainty.”
What qualifies as momentum has changed “drastically” and is no longer exclusively tech stocks, according to Bernstein. It’s also staples and health-care equities, and in China the factor remains positively exposed to discretionary shares, the note said.
High-momentum stocks in Asia and China seem to be those with high growth expectations, while low-momentum ones look like value shares, Agarwal said. The momentum factor faces headwinds from macro-economic conditions and investors should be cautious, she added.
“The markets are not yet pricing in the risk to high-momentum stocks, and we strongly caution against exposure to the factor,” Agarwal wrote.

The announcement, marking the end of Yabuki's 15-year tenure at the top of the Brookfield, Wisconsin-based business, came on the day that Fiserv announced a slight increase in adjusted revenue in the first quarter compared with a year earlier.
At one time considered a possible successor to Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM), Bisignano ran First Data Corp until its $22 billion acquisition by Fiserv last year.
""If you go back (to the merger announcement in January 2019), nothing was mentioned and we didn't write anything down, but we have got to know each other since then,"" Bisignano told Reuters.
""This was Jeff's decision and I'm happy to take on the role.""
Yabuki oversaw a period of significant growth for both Fiserv and the payments industry, with the global economy embracing electronic methods of transacting, both between businesses and with their customers.
With a market capitalization of nearly $73 billion, Fiserv has grown into one of the largest payments companies in the world. It has around 44,000 employees and deals with financial institutions and businesses in around 100 countries, according to its website.
In its earnings on Thursday, Fiserv reported adjusted revenue of $3.48 billion, although Yabuki noted the company had experienced a ""significant impact"" in its business at the end of the reporting period due to the global coronavirus pandemic.

Looking forward, Bisignano said Fiserv had strong recurring revenue and a number of synergies from the First Data merger which would support its performance, although he stressed the importance of small businesses reopening and the likely slow economic recovery.

810,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>",Market Closures in South Asia Leave ‘Bitter Taste’ for Foreign Funds,"(Bloomberg) -- Sri Lanka’s stock market is set to resume trading Monday after its longest ever shut down aimed at combating the pandemic, while the Bangladesh bourse has yet to flag a reopening. Foreign funds, however, may have lost interest during the prolonged wait.
“It leaves a bitter taste,” Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer in Dubai said of the Bangladesh bourse shutdown. “Many foreigners will be put off by the ad hoc closure of the market for such a long period.”
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh exchanges are among a handful of global stock markets that halted trading in March after the coronavirus contagion shut down economies and hammered equities. Investors in these markets missed out on a worldwide rebound in equities in April. The island nation’s stock gauge is down more than 20% from its most recent peak in December, while Bangladesh equities last traded on March 25 and are marking their longest closure since 1976.
The seven-week “closure of the Colombo Stock Exchange will likely affect short term sentiment toward Sri Lankan equities once markets do re-open as selling pressure would have built up,” said Ruchir Desai, a fund manager at Asia Frontier Capital Ltd. in Hong Kong. Some foreign investors had raised their concerns about the extended closure via intermediaries to the regulator, Desai said.
Curbs on imports of non-essential goods and capital outflows were also imposed in March to preserve foreign exchange as the rupee dropped to consecutive record lows. Sri Lanka had registered 797 coronavirus infections and nine deaths, while Bangladesh had 12,425 cases and 186 fatalities, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University as of May 7.
‘Black Swan Risk’
“The Covid-19 pandemic is the essence of a black swan risk,” said Mattias Martinsson, chief investment officer of Tundra Fonder AB in Stockholm. “There will be a certain understanding of extreme action. In addition, investors in smaller emerging markets and frontier markets are aware that these markets can be more fragile during times like these.”
Tundra plans to retain its holding in Bangladesh pharmaceutical shares when trading resumes as valuations are “attractive,” Martinsson said.
Still, extended closures of stock markets would have “long lasting consequences”, which could result in stocks “getting kicked out from global indexes like MSCI (NYSE:MSCI),” said Thomas Hugger, chief executive officer at Hong Kong-based Asia Frontier Capital, which has equity assets in frontier markets including Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
 MSCI Inc  . won’t implement any changes resulting from its May 2020 Semi-Annual Index Review for Sri Lanka and Bangladesh securities in MSCI country or composite indexes that they’re a component of due to the prolonged exchange closures, it said in a statement dated May 6. Changes not implemented would be deferred to its August quarterly review.
In Sri Lanka, foreign investors haven’t been net equity buyers since last year’s third quarter. Overseas funds, which account for about a third of market volume according to the market regulator, have sold net $28.8 million of local equities so far this year. The Colombo All-Share Index is at its lowest level in almost a decade and trades at a price earnings multiple of 8.41.
The island’s curfew restrictions would have led to “lots of practical problems,” especially post-transactions, if the market hadn’t been shuttered, said Dimuthu Abeyesekera, chief executive officer at stock brokerage Asha Securities Ltd. in Colombo.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka “fully understands the impact and possible consequences of the inability to re-open the stock market and the need to recommence market activities at the earliest,” the regulator said in an emailed response to queries.
Efforts to cushion a selloff on reopening with three tiers of circuit breakers replacing one at the Sri Lankan market’s reopening may help curb a further collapse in stocks in the face of excessive selling, said Kavinda Perera, head of research at Asia Securities Pvt. in Colombo, while Tallimer’s Malik doesn’t expect a rush to withdraw from Bangladesh.
“It will be a gradual, long-lasting withdrawal by foreigners,” said Tellimer’s Malik. “Perhaps, a persistent overhang for the market.”

812,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>",Neiman Marcus's attempt to manage crushing debt undone by COVID-19,"By Mike Spector and Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - On March 17, about a week after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, Neiman Marcus Group had no choice but to close its 67 stores.
The storied U.S. luxury department store chain long had plans to manage its crushing $5 billion debt load, the legacy of private equity takeovers. But as stores remained closed, week after week, executives soon faced a harsh reality: They could no longer make looming debt payments. 
Neiman Marcus needed to hand the keys to its stores to creditors. Executives held discussions with restructuring advisers at law firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP and investment bank  Lazard Ltd  (N:LAZ). The advisers are known for steering companies through a last resort that now had become unavoidable: a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. 
Over the ensuing weeks, Neiman Marcus negotiated with Pacific Management Investment Co and other investment firms holding the company’s debt, people familiar with the matter said. Desperate to eke out sales, the Dallas-based company asked employees to report to work at its closed stores to fulfill online orders, taking advantage of exceptions to government orders that shut down businesses deemed nonessential. 
An April 22 target date for a bankruptcy filing came and went, and Neiman Marcus batted back an 11th-hour financing proposal led by a distressed-debt investor that called for the company to explore a sale to rival Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co or another suitor. 
On Thursday, the nearly 113-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy protection in a federal court in Houston after reaching an agreement to eliminate $4 billion of debt in exchange for ceding control to creditors. 
The creditors are also providing $675 million of fresh financing to keep Neiman Marcus going while it navigates bankruptcy proceedings. The investments of its private equity owners will be wiped out. 
The filing comes only about a year after the company’s flashy opening of its first Manhattan location, a three-floor, 188,000-square-foot-store boasting several dining options in the recently completed Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Yards complex. The mammoth store is now dark. 
“This was never in our consideration until COVID-19 became a pandemic,” Chief Executive Geoffroy van Raemdonck, a former Ralph Lauren Corp (N:RL) executive who took the helm of Neiman Marcus in 2018, said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. 
This account of Neiman Marcus’s rapid decline over the past several weeks is based on court records and interviews with nearly a dozen people familiar with the company’s restructuring negotiations. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. 
A BET TURNED SOUR 
The pandemic, which in the United States has resulted in more than 75,000 deaths, is inflicting widespread financial pain on retailers. J. Crew Group Inc, another private-equity-backed retailer, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday. Long-troubled J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) is contemplating a bankruptcy filing of its own as a way to rework its unsustainable finances, Reuters previously reported.
Neiman Marcus was founded in 1907 when the Marcus and Neiman families opened their first store in Dallas. They started the business after considering and passing on an investment in a then-unknown soft drink called Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), according to the company's website. 
Neiman Marcus added Bergdorf Goodman, itself founded around the turn of the 20th century, to its ranks in the 1970s. The retailer expanded across the United States to become a fashion mainstay for celebrities and other wealthy customers seeking expensive handbags, clothing and the like.
Neiman Marcus changed hands among private equity firms over the past 15 years, culminating in a $6 billion takeover by Ares Management Corp (N:ARES) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The owners had no comment. 
The bet turned sour. Neiman Marcus soon struggled to manage its heavy debt load. Like other retailers, it grappled with consumers' shifting away from physical stores to online shopping. Competition from luxury e-commerce upstarts such as Yoox (MI:YNAP) Net-A-Porter Group (YNAP) and Farfetch Ltd (N:FTCH) added pressure.
Neiman Marcus started to buckle and reached a deal with creditors last year aimed at providing a few years of breathing room. Litigation erupted alleging the company improperly moved its MyTheresa e-commerce business, which was not part of Thursday’s bankruptcy filing, beyond the reach of creditors. Neiman Marcus said the move was proper. 
Neiman Marcus posted about $400 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2019, and had been ahead of its internal financial targets at the start of this year, van Raemdonck said.
In March, as the coronavirus began spreading across the United States, governors began closing businesses in their states and ordering citizens to remain at home. Neiman Marcus closed all stores and eventually furloughed many of its roughly 13,200 employees. 
The company asked, but did not require, employees to report to shuttered stores to package online orders for items such as sweaters and handbags, according to documents Reuters reviewed.
The decision was made with the health and safety of employees in mind, van Raemdonck said. ""That’s why we made it a voluntary process,” he said.
Workers at the King of Prussia mall store outside Philadelphia are provided a take-out lunch, gloves, masks, wipes and hand sanitizer, according to documents Reuters reviewed. The company overall generated $60 million of online sales over several weeks, partly via tools that allowed employees to interact with customers and sell merchandise remotely, van Raemdonck said. 
HOPES FOR ONLINE
On April 15, the company skipped debt payments. One payment only allowed it five days to make good before defaulting. Neiman Marcus prepared to seek bankruptcy protection on April 22, but discussions dragged on.
A few days later, another creditor, Mudrick Capital Management LP, delivered a competing proposal. Mudrick and other investment firms would lend Neiman Marcus $700 million. It also would pay some creditors that had been agitating for money as the value of their collateral, which included unsold merchandise, declined. 
The proposal also called for Neiman Marcus to explore a sale. The company, already far along in talks with other lenders, rejected the offer. Talks continued for nearly two more weeks. 
Saks owner HBC had explored a bid for Neiman Marcus in 2017 but did not pursue it. HBC was taken private earlier this year by owners including its CEO, Richard Baker, and it remains unclear whether the company is still interested in a takeover. HBC declined to comment. 
Neiman Marcus now hopes its online business will pick up significant slack if shoppers are hesitant to return to stores when they reopen, van Raemdonck said. 

The company envisions emerging from bankruptcy early this fall without widespread, permanent store closures. Most of its 22 Last Call discount stores were previously earmarked to be closed. Creditors have agreed to a $750 million package that will refinance the company’s bankruptcy loan while providing additional operating cash.

U.S. District Judge Christine Reiss rejected James Ehlers' claim in the proposed class action that Ben & Jerry's misleading marketing enabled it to burnish its socially conscious image and charge higher prices for its ice cream, even though more than half the milk and cream was mass-produced.
Reiss said Ben & Jerry's ""happy cows"" claim was merely an opinion, and that Ehlers did not show that reasonable consumers would buy its ice cream solely because the company said on its website it used ingredients from ""Caring Dairy"" farms.
The Burlington, Vermont-based judge also said Ehlers could not seek injunctive relief, because Ben & Jerry's has removed ""happy cows"" from its packaging and updated a web page for the Caring Dairy program.
Ben & Jerry's was founded in 1978 in a renovated gas station. It has been a unit of Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company  Unilever  Plc (L:ULVR) since 2000.
Lawyers for Ehlers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Unilever and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests. Reiss said Ehlers may file an amended complaint if he wishes.
Ehlers lost in the Democratic primary to become Vermont's governor in 2018.
The case is Ehlers v Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Vermont, No. 19-00194.

814,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",UK corporate insolvencies fall as virus support plans kick in: KPMG,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of corporate insolvencies in Britain fell a third in April compared to the year before even as the COVID-19 pandemic hammered the economy, figures compiled by KPMG showed on Friday, as government support packages kept firms afloat.
The spread of the novel coronavirus - and lockdown measures introduced to contain it - has ravaged the British economy, with Britons told to stay indoors and many non-essential businesses told to close. The Bank of England said on Thursday it could cause the biggest economic slump in over 300 years.
Britain is due to begin a limited easing of lockdown measures next week but a rapid reopening of the economy is not on the cards as Prime Minister Boris Johnson looks to avoid a second peak of infections.
To support businesses through the lockdown, finance minister Rishi Sunak has announced a raft of schemes, including a job retention plan allowing employers to furlough staff while government pays up to 80% of their wages. 
KPMG head of restructuring Blair Nimmo said that the measures had prevented a deluge of companies entering administration but cautioned that the route out of the crisis was uncertain and that, for some, insolvencies might have been merely delayed.
""It gave companies the opportunity to go into a mothball or hibernate state whilst they waited to see what the outcome would be and how they could access the support schemes,"" Nimmo told Reuters, adding that courts had also not been processing winding up orders in the same way.
""It doesn't mean to say that the companies won't have issues moving forward.""
The analysis of insolvency notices by KPMG's Restructuring practice showed that 61 companies fell into administration during April 2020 compared to 91 in April 2019. 
Some high profile firms have gone into administration since the pandemic struck, including Carluccio's restaurants in late March and retailers Oasis, Warehouse and Debenhams in April.
Nimmo said that casual dining and retail had already faced substantial difficulties even before the coronavirus lockdown, which would not be alleviated by temporary government measures.
He said that some firms that would have gone out of business in April even without the COVID-19 pandemic had been saved by the government's schemes, but the measures had also rescued otherwise viable companies from the effects of the outbreak.
""In some cases, the schemes will only help to delay the inevitable,"" Nimmo said. ""But in other cases they may actually be able to avoid it.""

But Tesla is located in one of the San Francisco Bay Area counties, Alameda, that have a separate lockdown scheduled to last until the end of May. Under that county order, Tesla's only U.S. vehicle factory, in Fremont, California, is not allowed to operate regularly.
The state order announced on Thursday does not supersede the county plan, Alameda Sheriff's Office spokesman Ray Kelly told Reuters by text message.
The state plan outlined by the governor includes several requirements for reopening, such as implementing physical distancing, screening workers and training employees on limiting spread of the virus.
Musk has criticized the lockdown and has been eager to reopen the Tesla factory. Musk is also CEO of rocket and spacecraft company SpaceX.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

816,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2020 06:17PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for May 8,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Stocks finished in the green today, helped by some strong earnings reports.
Sentiment was also buoyed by the latest jobless claims figures, which, while above expectations and still staggeringly large, indicated that the weekly rise was still diminishing.
Tomorrow the big government employment report is on the schedule and all eyes will be on the numbers ahead of trading.
There will be more data on oil production and some earnings that could give more insight into the Covid-19 effect.
Here are three things that could move the market tomorrow.
1. Historically Bad Jobs Report Coming
The April employment report will capture an entire month of lockdown measures that brought large parts of the economy to a standstill.
The Labor Department will report the numbers at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that nonfarm payrolls plunged by 22 million last month, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would be 27-times the worst monthly decline during the Financial Crisis and 11-times the record drop of September 1945, the demobilization of World War II, Bloomberg reported.
The unemployment rate is expected to spike to 16% from 4.4%, although that would be well below rates above 20% seen during the Great Depression.
Average hourly earnings are expected to have risen 0.4%, although visibility on that datapoint could be tough.
“The blow to wages is much more immediate and abrupt than we have seen in the past and could take a toll on average hourly earnings in a way we have never witnessed,” Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk said in a note. “Firms usually lay off workers before they scale back compensation schemes; both have happened simultaneously during this crisis.”
2. Rig Count on Tap
Oil settled lower today, despite Saudi Arabia raising the official selling price of its June light crude.
After ascending higher than $20, WTI is now encountering resistance, with many thinking the rally has been overdone given the fact that there is little concrete evidence that the global economy is gearing up again.
Tomorrow will give investors the latest measure of U.S. oil rig activity from Baker Hughes at 1:00 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
The number of oil rigs in operation has fallen to levels last seen in mid-2016.
The rig count dropped to 325 last week.
3. SeaWorld Set to Report
As the week winds down, so does earnings season with the last of the busy Fridays before the reporting calendar is sparse again.
While no major market-movers are issuing results, there a couple of companies that could give some more insight into the lockdown economy.
SeaWorld Entertainment (NYSE:SEAS) will report its numbers ahead of trading, although the numbers likely won’t be the most interesting part of the report. The theme park operator already issued its results for the first two months of the year in late April and updated its guidance (to the downside, naturally).
But whether the company thinks it can open its parks and possibly maintain social distancing and what it thinks of demand in the future will be of particular interest.
Analysts are predicting a loss of 67 cents per share on revenue of $172 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
And they say Twinkies can survive through any circumstances, but are they a sought-after comfort food during lockdown.
Hostess Brands (NASDAQ:TWNK) will also report ahead of trading with a profit of 13 cents per share expected, with sales of about $228 million."
817,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 06:15PM ET</span>",Mack-Cali says Bow Street contest puts company at 'risk' during pandemic,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Mack-Cali Realty (NYSE:CLI) Corp on Thursday named five new director candidates and said investment firm Bow Street Capital's plan to seize control of its board puts the real-estate investment trust at ""tremendous risk"" during the coronavirus outbreak.
Mack-Cali named five independent director candidates to its slate, which already included six incumbent candidates, in a regulatory filing on Thursday. The new nominees are Jamie Behar, Michael Berman, Howard Roth, Gail Steinel and Lee Wielansky.
Mack-Cali took the unusual step of not renominating four directors who were elected to the board last year after having been nominated by Bow Street.
The company also backed its chief executive, Michael DeMarco, saying he is ""central to the company's strategic transformation."" 
""Bow Street has not shared a substantive business plan or named a replacement CEO candidate, leaving the company at tremendous risk for disruption and loss of value,"" Mack-Cali said in the filing.
A spokeswoman for Bow Street declined to comment.
The fight is noteworthy because the two sides appear ready to proceed to a vote at Mack-Cali's annual meeting on June 10.
The coronavirus outbreak has prompted many other shareholders and companies in recent weeks to settle their differences quickly to let management teams return to running their companies.
Bow Street, which owns 4.9% of Mack-Cali, called for DeMarco's ouster in a regulatory filing on Wednesday and said it was speaking with candidates who might replace him.
The investment firm has nominated four new directors, including Bow Street partner Akiva Katz, to run this year to reinforce the four Bow Street directors elected last year to Mack-Cali's 11-member board. Bow Street also nominated the directors who were elected last year because the company did not put them up for re-election.

818,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",Pandemic’s Economic Toll Sparks New Call in U.S. to Abolish WTO,"(Bloomberg) -- The World Trade Organization is coming under fresh criticism from Washington, this time from a Midwestern lawmaker who sees the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to rebuild America’s standing in the global economy.
Senator Josh Hawley, writing in the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) op-ed page on Tuesday, called for the abolition of the WTO, blaming the Geneva-based arbiter of international commerce for overseeing a system that he argued has failed American workers. The U.S. needs to stop Chinese imperialism and renegotiate trade deals with allies, he wrote, saying that “abandoning the WTO is a start.”
Hawley followed up Thursday by introducing a resolution in the Senate to withdraw the U.S. from the WTO.
While no authority exists for the U.S. government to close down the WTO single-handedly, the complaints from the junior Republican senator from Missouri echo many of those the Trump administration has voiced since taking office in 2017. It also reflects the hardening of some Americans’ views about China and the growing list of scapegoats sought for the economic calamity the country now faces.
Yet the U.S. Trade Representative’s office issued a reminder on Wednesday of how the WTO can work to the country’s advantage. In a long-running dispute between Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. and Airbus SE (OTC:EADSY), pitting the U.S. against the European Union, USTR Robert Lighthizer said the U.S. has fully complied with WTO recommendations, leaving “no valid basis for the EU to retaliate against any U.S. goods.”
Hawley’s call to scrap the organization that the U.S. helped design a quarter century ago reignited a debate -- with historians, economists and the business blasting his idea as ill-conceived and badly timed. One of his claims was that the WTO did “next to nothing to stop Chinese theft of American intellectual property and products.”
Simon Lester, an associate director at the Washington-based Cato Institute, said the senator has it backwards.
“The WTO, with its agreement on Trade‐​Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, does a lot,” Lester wrote in a blog post. “If the U.S. pulls out of the WTO, it loses one of the key mechanisms to press China to improve its protection of these rights.”

Hawley’s op-ed also argues that because of the WTO “foreign agriculture won concession after concession, while American farmers struggled to get fair access to markets.”
That’s not borne out in the data. The U.S. farming industry has been a major beneficiary of the WTO’s 24% to 36% average reduction in global agricultural tariffs. U.S. agricultural exports have more than tripled since the WTO was established -- growing to $143 billion in 2018 from $44 billion in 1994, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Even though the U.S. can’t abolish the WTO unilaterally, the timing of Hawley’s plan makes it interesting. Every five years, Congress can introduce and vote on a joint resolution to withdraw congressional approval of the WTO, and that opportunity comes up this year.
But U.S. business groups argue that withdrawing from the WTO would result in retaliation and a balkanized global economy that hinders America’s economic recovery.
By one estimate, dissolving the WTO and nullifying existing trade agreements would erase 30% of the total gains from trade, which would amount to a $2.7 trillion loss in global gross domestic product.
“Abandoning the WTO would only invite other countries to close their markets to U.S. exports,” said Myron Brilliant, the executive vice president and head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “With 95% of the world’s consumers outside our borders, keeping our trade lanes open will be critical to recovery.”

819,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>",Global hedge funds post April gains but still negative for the year: data,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - Global hedge funds posted their biggest monthly gain in more than a decade in April when stocks rocketed higher with the help of government rescue packages designed to fuel growth stalled by the coronavirus outbreak, according to new data on Thursday.
The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index climbed 4.8% last month, marking its best showing since May 2009 when it gained 5.15% at the tail end of the financial crisis, research firm Hedge Fund Research said.
Managers that focus on stocks, bet on corporate events, and engage in activism by pushing management to perform better delivered the industry's biggest gains in a month that saw the Standard & Poor's 500 index gain 12.81%, HFR data shows.
Still, April's returns were not enough to erase three months of losses, including an 8.42% drop in March, and the average hedge fund remains in the red for the year with an average loss of 6.6%, the data shows. The S&P 500 index is off 9.28% in the first fourth months of 2020.
The difference between winners and losers was large last month, HFR said. It noted that the top decile of managers who submit their data to the firm gained 19.7% while the bottom decile fell 4.1%, representing a dispersion of 23.8 percentage points.
Big market swings, including the drop in oil prices, helped hedge funds in April, HFR President Ken Heinz said in a statement.
An uncertain outlook for the months ahead, as unemployment soars and certain sectors return to business after weeks of lockdown, could create ""dynamic opportunities for managers to generate outperformance through the remainder of the year,"" Heinz added.
Hedge funds often promise to protect capital from sharp market swings, but investors still get cold feet. They pulled $33 billion out of the hedge fund market as performance sagged in the first three months of the year, marking the biggest quarterly outflows in more than a decade, the HFR data shows.

""Despite the likelihood that total U.S. advertising expenditures will decline in 2020, we believe Roku is relatively well positioned based on the effectiveness of our ad products and the trend towards streaming.

The miss on the bottom line comes as operating expenses jumped 76%, offsetting a jump in active accounts, average revenue per user (ARPU) and streaming hours.
""The acceleration of growth in new accounts and viewership continued in April. Active accounts grew roughly 38% versus last year, driven by a year-over-year (YoY) increase in new accounts of more than 70%. Streaming hours rose by roughly 80% year-over-year, driven by an increase in streaming hours per account of approximately 30%,"" Roku said.

""Since mid-March, platform monetization has seen a mixture of impacts. For example, subscription video on demand (SVOD) trials and subscriptions, and transactional video on demand (TVOD) purchases are up.

Investing.com - Uber (NYSE:UBER) reported bigger-than-expected losses in the first quarter of the year after suffering writedowns of $2.1 billion in overseas investments after the coronavirus pandemic brought ride-sharing activity to a halt.
Uber was down 4% following the report.
Uber reported a loss of $1.70 a share, missing estimates for a loss of 90 cents a share, but revenue of $3.54 billion topped estimates.
The weaker results come as Covid-19 pandemic dented growth in its ride-sharing business but underpinned a jump in activity in its faster-growth business, UBER Eats.
“While our Rides business has been hit hard by the ongoing pandemic, we have taken quick action to preserve the strength of our balance sheet, focus additional resources on Uber Eats, and prepare us for any recovery scenario,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO. “Along with the surge in food delivery, we are encouraged by the early signs we are seeing in markets that are beginning to open back up.""
Gross bookings, a measure of total value of rides before driver costs and other expenses, rose 15% to $15.8 billion from a year ago, with Eats growing 54% year over year.
The company grew monthly active consumers 11% to 103 million in the quarter.

831,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Turning Oil Wells Back on Is Trickier Than Shutting Them Off,"(Bloomberg) -- With thousands of oil wells choking back or completely shutting off production, companies already are looking ahead to what may prove to an even bigger challenge: turning wells back on.
U.S. and Canadian oil producers are curbing as much as 4.5 million barrels of daily supplies, according to Plains All American Pipeline LP. In the U.S. alone, drillers have announced plans to halt more than 600,000 barrels of daily output this month and next, said Rystad Energy AS. Old-style, conventional wells were the first to go down and the closures are expanding to some of the horizontal gushers that represent shale drillers’ prize assets.
Although shutting down a well can be a relatively simple -- and even remote-controlled -- process, industry executives and their engineering teams aren’t altogether sure how smoothly an idle well can be restarted.
“When you shut in wells, especially for a long period of time, you have a lot of surprises,” Clay Bretches, an executive vice president at  Apache Corp  (NYSE:APA)., said during a conference call with analysts on Thursday. “Some of them are good and some of them are bad.”
Executives are careful about disclosing which wells are being curtailed -- which involves squeezing back on the volume of crude flowing out of the well -- versus those that are completely shut down. That’s because reversing a total shutdown presents a more challenging set of tasks and costs.
Houston-based Apache has shut about 2,500 wells, and Bretches said the company is taking “great pains” to make sure they’re being preserved. That includes preventing corrosion and maintaining equipment that sits atop the well in remote fields.
WPX Energy (NYSE:WPX) Inc., which plans to shut in a total of about 45,000 barrels of oil a day this month and possibly next, said it could be as simple as remotely opening up valves or speeding up electric pumps installed at the bottom of some wells. But the company cautioned against the expectation that it could be done quickly.
Restoration Costs
“It wouldn’t be as simple as ‘just give us a couple days and we’ll be back up running at 100%,’” said WPX Chief Operating Officer Clay Gaspar. “Anybody who says that, they’re probably short-changing their field organization just a touch.”
That’s why deciding whether to shut a well involves more than just comparing operating costs and oil prices, according to Rystad. Producers also must weigh the cost and mechanical difficulty of restoring those wells back to pre-curtailed volumes.
“When you start back up from the level we’re at, we do expect to have some start-up capital,” said Jeff Alvarez, head of investor relations of Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY)., which is shutting down about 5% of its production next month. “It’s things like, just when I spend $1 today, I don’t get production for a couple of months from that.”
 Cimarex Energy  Co (NYSE:XEC). said the obstacles to reopening wells mostly revolve around speed and costs, rather than any threats to the structural integrity of the rocks themselves. The Denver-based explorer held an internal technical session recently that looked at how its reservoirs would be affected by shut-ins, and the results showed that they were likely to be “just fine.”
Pipeline Capacity
“We think we’re in pretty good shape with our reservoirs to shut them in and bring them back when we need,” CEO Tom Jorden said during a conference call.
Oil companies aren’t the only ones who have to think about the long-term impacts of shuttered wells. Millions of miles of pipelines crisscross the continent to haul crude from the field to refineries and export terminals. As supplies drop, so does demand for pipeline capacity.
Pipeline operator Targa Resources (NYSE:TRGP) Corp. was asked Thursday if the wells its system serves would ever ramp up to previous volumes.
“I think for the most part, we’d expect the shut-in volumes to come back and perform well,” Targa CEO Matt Meloy said. “Could there be some older, really low-rate vertical wells ... which they shut-in and just don’t bring back? I think there could be some amount of those.”

(Reuters) - The Nasdaq (IXIC) was on track to end Thursday in positive territory for 2020 after winning back the vast majority of steep losses caused in recent months by the coronavirus pandemic.
Following a slump of almost a third between Feb. 19 and March 23, the tech-heavy index has rebounded over 30%, driven by strong gains in Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN),  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) and other so called ""stay-at-home"" stocks. 
""Everything else has been so bad that tech is now seen as a safe-haven,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC. ""It's like we're back in 1999, where if you had a website, you were hot. Now, if you specialize in selling online, you're hot.""

Thursday's 1.5% Nasdaq rally was fueled by a nearly 14% leap in  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) after the payments processor delivered an upbeat outlook as the health crisis drives more people to shop online.
The Nasdaq was on track to end the session up about 0.1% year to date.
A surprise rise in Chinese exports raised hopes of a faster economic recovery from what is expected to be a deep coronavirus-led recession, lifting stocks across Wall Street.
The Nasdaq's recent strong performance leaves it down about 8% from its February record high, just before fears of the coronavirus put an end to an 11-year bull market. By comparison, the S&P 500 remains down 14% from its record high, and the Dow is down 19% from its peak.
The Nasdaq has gained about 13% over the past 12 months. It has little exposure to oil stocks, which have been a drag on the S&P 500 as demand for crude evaporates due to the slump in economic activity caused by the coronavirus.

Microsoft, Wall Street's most valuable company, on Thursday rose 0.5%. It has been helped recently by increased use of its Teams chat and online meeting app and Xbox gaming services.

Read: Nasdaq Composite Erases 2020 Losses as Big Earnings Drive Gains
Investors are picking technology as a safe corner at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is causing so many uncertainties for global markets. Tech behemoths, known for their strong balance sheets and high growth, have counterbalanced the gloom and doom affecting many other industries. With millions of people around the world stuck in their home offices to help contain the outbreak, companies that specialize in remote-working products are becoming a hot spot.
“It’s a sector now that’s just resilient,” said Shawn Cruz, senior manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). “The conditions we’re in right now, companies need to keep operating -- they just need to do it remotely. And that benefits a lot of these tech companies.”
While the Nasdaq Composite Index turned green for 2020 on Thursday, broader gauges such as the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average remained lower for the year by at least 10%. All three major benchmarks have surged from their March lows, but technology is the only S&P 500 group that’s up for 2020.
That preference for tech is visible in the ETF world. After posting its best month of inflows since 2001 in March, QQQ added another $3.2 billion in April and $367 million so far in May. The fund rose 1.6% at 2:17 p.m. in New York -- on track for its highest close since Feb. 21.
“Investors may recognize that the constituents of QQQ’s benchmark, the Nasdaq 100, are well positioned to capitalize on the current shift to digital working and learning, potential advancements in biotech and healthcare along with a number of transformative, long-term themes in the marketplace,” said Ryan McCormack, Invesco QQQ strategist.
Only four other ETFs are currently above $100 billion -- SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY (NYSE:SPY); iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, or IVV; Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, or VTI; and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, or VOO.
Despite QQQ’s rally, traders are increasingly looking to bet against the fund. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on QQQ -- a rough indicator of bearish bets on the fund -- climbed to 5.1% on Wednesday, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. That’s up from about 2.7% on March 23.
“The thing we haven’t seen yet with tech names is how badly advertising is going to be hit,” said Marc Odo, client portfolio manager at Swan Global Investments. “Those companies are going to have to plug the gaps or their earnings are going to take a hit.”
Still, solid first-quarter earnings from Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc., Facebook, Microsoft and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. have contributed to momentum -- at least for now.

The lucky ones who already set up credit lines have $577 billion at their disposal, according to economists at the New York Federal Reserve.
For everyone else, lending standards are tightening and that potential windfall is closing down.
“There are some lenders that are shutting off their home equity lines and are really increasing the pricing for cash-out loans,” said Logan Mohtashami, senior loan manager at AMC Lending Group in Irvine, California. “It is problematic for those that might have equity, but don’t have a home equity line.”
About 14.5 million U.S. homeowners out of 54.7 million total were considered equity-rich in the first quarter of 2020 -- meaning the amount of loans secured by those properties was 50% or less of their estimated market value, according to property data firm ATTOM Data Solutions.
The impact of the coronavirus pandemic is not reflected in the data, cautioned Todd Teta, chief product officer with ATTOM: “With the potential for home values to fall, there is a significant chance that equity levels could drop over the coming months while underwater levels rise.”
Still, the data show which metro areas may be more resilient.
Increases in home equity across the U.S. “is one of the reasons why I don’t think you’re going to see a foreclosure crisis,” said Mohtashami. “People are staying in their homes longer and they have a much much higher equity than before and there wasn’t any cash-out boom in this cycle like it was from 2002 to 2005.”
The top five large metro areas with the highest shares of equity-rich properties were all in California last quarter. In addition, 48 of the top 50 equity-rich zip codes were in the Golden State, including the wealthy counties in and around San Francisco.
Meanwhile, Rust Belt cities like Toledo and Cleveland in Ohio have some of the highest levels of underwater mortgages, worth 125% or more of the property’s market value

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. cryptocurrency investor on Thursday sued a suburban New York high school senior, accusing the 18-year-old of being the mastermind and ringleader of a cybercrime scheme that defrauded him out of millions of dollars in digital currencies.
The plaintiff, Michael Terpin, accused Ellis Pinsky, of Irvington, New York, and his alleged co-conspirators of stealing $23.8 million of cryptocurrency in January 2018, when the defendant was 15, and is seeking triple damages of $71.4 million.
""On the surface, Pinsky is an 'All American Boy,'"" Terpin said in a complaint filed in federal court in White Plains, New York. ""The tables are now turned.""
Pinsky could not immediately be reached for comment. Calls to a phone number for him obtained through court records and a public records search were not answered. It was unclear whether Pinsky has a lawyer.
Cryptocurrency crime is a growing problem, with losses soaring to $4.52 billion last year from $1.74 billion in 2018, according to cybersecurity company CipherTrace.
In his complaint, Terpin said Pinsky and his ""gang of digital bandits"" would steal from victims after gaining control of their smartphones through ""SIM swaps,"" and that Pinsky bragged to friends that he would never get caught.
Terpin accused Pinsky and his alleged co-conspirators, none identified by name in the complaint, of violating federal laws against racketeering and computer fraud.
Terpin in May 2019 won a $75.8 million civil judgment in a related case in a California state court against Nicholas Truglia, an alleged Pinsky associate who has faced criminal hacking charges in California and New York.
Terpin said the New York charges relate to the $23.8 million theft. Terpin is also suing his carrier AT&T Mobility in Los Angeles for $240 million, court records show. A judge is considering AT&T's bid to dismiss that case, the records show.
SIM swapping occurs when a hacker tricks a mobile phone carrier into transferring a target's phone number from a registered SIM card, the small plastic chip connecting a phone to a cellular network, to a SIM card he or she possesses. This can be done with help from someone at the carrier, or by stating information about the target obtained from social media and other accounts.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's indexes jumped on Thursday, with the Nasdaq turning positive for the year, following a clutch of upbeat earnings reports led by PayPal as investors looked past more weak jobs data caused by the coronavirus-induced economic downturn.
All 11 S&P 500 sectors moved higher, led by energy (SPNY), materials (SPLRCM) and financials (SPSY) which have lagged this year. 
Shares of PayPal Holdings (O:PYPL) soared 13.9% and boosted the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq after the company said it expects a strong recovery in payments volumes in the second quarter as social distancing drives more people to shop online.
Shares of media company ViacomCBS Inc (O:VIAC) and ride-hailing firm  Lyft  (O:LYFT) also jumped after their earnings, as a first-quarter reporting season that Refinitiv estimates will show a 12% decline in earnings begins to wind down. ViacomCBS shares rose 10.7% and Lyft shares climbed 22.0%.
Stocks have rebounded sharply since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak.
“You are seeing incrementally some parts of the global economy opening up again plus slightly better earnings,"" said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 294.12 points, or 1.24%, to 23,958.76, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 40.43 points, or 1.42%, to 2,888.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 132.69 points, or 1.5%, to 8,987.08. 
The Nasdaq turned positive for 2020 during the session, after being down well over 20% for the year as of late March.
Data showed millions more Americans sought unemployment benefits last week, suggesting layoffs broadened from consumer-facing industries to other segments of the economy and could remain elevated even as many parts of the country start to reopen.
The U.S. employment report for April is due on Friday.
“The market rightly or wrongly is just much more focused on what that data looks like two months from now, not what that data looks like right now,” Freedman said.
Investors were also encouraged by news that China's exports unexpectedly rose in April for the first time this year as factories raced to make up for lost sales due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The development of treatments for the coronavirus has been watched closely by Wall Street as key for resuming economic activity.  Moderna  Inc (O:MRNA) shares rose 10.1% after the company sped up plans for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine and said it expected to start a late-stage trial in early summer.
Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.68-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted nine new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 53 new highs and seven new lows.

Friday’s U.S. jobs report is forecast to show employers slashed about 21.7 million jobs in April, nearly erasing a decade of job gains in a single month as the country shut down to control the spread of the coronavirus.
That’s 27 times the worst monthly decline during the 2007-2009 recession and about 11 times the previous record decline in September 1945, when the nation demobilized with the end of World War II.
“This might be the worst macroeconomic data report in U.S. history,” said James Sweeney, chief economist at  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) Group AG.
The unemployment rate -- which was at a 50-year low just a few months ago -- may surge to 16%, the highest level by far in records dating back to the 1940s. With millions more Americans filing for unemployment benefits in recent weeks, the jobless rate is likely to keep climbing in May.

But other numbers will detail which workers are feeling the most financial pain -- through job losses or reduced hours -- and provide hints about how quickly the once-smooth running American jobs engine will recover.
Industry Breakdown
The sheer volume of jobless claims alone -- 33.5 million in the seven weeks through May 2 -- show job losses have been extensive. Hourly workers, particularly those employed at restaurants and hotels, have been hit especially hard, but this report will offer a fuller picture of the size and scope of the payroll reductions across industries.
“The breadth of the job losses will be important,” said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC).
The more the losses are concentrated in areas like accommodation, food services and retail, the more it would look like “an isolated shock,” she said. However, widespread cuts in industries less directly hit by Covid-19 will show “the extent to which the recession has rippled into the broader economy.”
Data from the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Research Institute on Wednesday already indicated the job losses are broad-based. All categories except company management and education saw declines in payrolls.
Hourly Earnings
The Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates average hourly earnings through a basic equation of dividing total payroll costs by total hours worked. When done on a national scale, the composition of the jobs market can impact the figure.
Layoffs have been particularly extreme within low-wage industries such as leisure and hospitality. So a greater share of workers employed in higher-pay sectors would result in a more pronounced pickup in average earnings. While the median estimate calls for a 0.4% increase from a month earlier, some economists see average hourly earnings jumping by as much as 5-6%.
Hours Worked
For employees fortunate enough to escape widespread layoffs, many are now working fewer days and hours. Even though their wage rates may be the same, reduced hours translates to less take-home pay. The severity of the drop in average weekly hours will offer insight into the degree of financial stress those still employed are facing.
U-6 Rate
The traditional unemployment rate (known as the U-3 rate) doesn’t capture those who have stopped looking for a job.
The so-called U-6 rate will offer a more accurate picture of how the pandemic is ripping through the once-strong labor market. The underemployment rate includes those who have quit looking for a job because they’re discouraged about their prospects -- something that may be a common theme during the shutdowns -- and people working part-time but desiring a full workweek.
Temporarily Unemployed
The number of unemployed people on temporary layoff surged by a record 131% in March to 1.85 million. That means people without a job temporarily -- such as those furloughed -- accounted for 77% of the total increase in unemployed Americans.
The BLS said last month the figure would have been even higher if not for a technical mistake in survey responses. The agency is adding coronavirus-specific questions with the May report, due in early June.
With many workers still attached to their employers, there’s a greater chance they will return to their jobs when the nation reopens.
“In the Great Depression, the vast majority of job losses were permanent. Today the vast majority of job losses are temporary,” said Mark Vitner, senior economist at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. But, “I don’t think we get back to 100% for at least a year, 18 months, and we’re not going to need as many workers if we’re not back at 100%.”
That may mean even if the unemployment rate sharply drops to something like 8% as the economy turns back on, it will be a very slow descent back to the pre-Covid level, Bank of America’s Meyer said.

844,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Beijing opens financial markets further amid tension with Washington,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China finalised rules on Thursday that would scrap quotas under two major inbound investment schemes, giving qualified foreign institutions unlimited access to Chinese stocks and bonds in the latest step to open the country's financial industry.
The revised rules come as tensions have flared up between Washington and Beijing in recent days over the origins of the coronavirus, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening more aggressive economic measures against China.
""It is poetry in motion for me to watch the Chinese move on approving the significantly revised regulations to registration-based market access at the very same moment Washington is looking to coax U.S. institutions to refrain from allocating capital into RMB asset classes,"" said Peter Alexander, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.
""For me, this is 4D chess going up against the Washington Beltway that can only operate in two combined modes - domestic and partisan,"" he said.
Under the new rules, foreign investors no longer need to apply for any quotas under China's two inbound investment channels - the dollar-dominated qualified foreign institutional investor (QFII) scheme and its yuan-denominated sibling, RQFII.
The rule changes are aimed at ""further opening up China's financial market,"" the People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) (PBOC) and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) said in a joint statement.
In addition, the regulations would simplify administrative requirements on the remittance and repatriation of funds as well as currency exchanges by foreign institutional investors, aiming to better facilitate foreign participation in China's financial market, according to the statement. 
China introduced the QFII scheme in 2002 and RQFII in 2011 as part of the country's financial deregulation, but the channels have become increasingly overshadowed by more recent cross-border programs such as Stock Connect and Bond Connect, which are less restrictive.
Nearly 300 global institutions including UBS AG (S:UBSG), Goldman Sachs & Co LLC (N:GS) and  BNP Paribas  (PA:BNPP) had obtained QFII quotas worth a combined $114.66 billion at the end of April, according to SAFE, the foreign exchange regulator.
The new regulations, which take effect June 6, were published after regulators solicited public opinions. The rules involve regulatory details around how foreign money investing in Chinese securities and futures shall be regulated. 
""This is exactly what the foreign investment community wanted: clarity,"" said Alexander of Z-Ben Advisors.
China is stepping up opening its giant financial industry, having removed foreign ownership caps in futures, securities and mutual fund sectors earlier this year.

The handovers, down from 70 planes in the same month of 2019, included two wide-bodied jets of which one was an A350 for customer Japan Air Lines (T:9201). The other was an internal delivery of an A330 to be converted into a military tanker.
Demand for jetliners, especially oversupplied twin-aisle models, has slumped as airlines hold back from taking delivery over financial concerns and European lockdowns or travel restrictions make it harder to send inspection teams.
Airbus is operating a system of split shifts divided into red and blue teams in order to slow the spread of the epidemic.
The planemaker sold nine single-aisle aircraft to Irish lessor Avolon in April, but these replace nine previously cancelled by the same firm for earlier delivery - highlighting aggressive moves to save cash and postpone capital spending.
Avolon has said it is planning for a lengthy downturn in demand following the industry's worst crisis.
So far in 2020, Airbus has delivered 136 aircraft, down from 232 at the same stage of 2019.

It has sold 365 aircraft, while taking 66 cancellations for a net order tally of 299 airplanes.

Virgin Atlantic said earlier this week that it would lay-off almost a third of its workforce as it battles to stay afloat in the coronavirus pandemic which has brought air travel to a near standstill.
Founder Richard Branson, whose Virgin Group owns 51% of Virgin Atlantic alongside U.S. airline Delta (N:DAL) with 49%, said in April the airline will only survive the impact of COVID-19 if it gets financial support from the government, but it is also seeking private investment.
In an internal memo dated May 6 which was addressed ""Dear Pilots"", the airline said that it only needed 550 pilots out of about 1,000 currently, and that shedding jobs would help it win new investment.
""In order for us to qualify for financial support from HM Government or the private sector it is critical that we demonstrate that we have taken all self-help measures in a timely fashion so we can secure the funding we need to survive,"" the memo said. 
When asked about the memo, Virgin, which is in a consultation period with unions over the redundancies, said it continued to explore options for additional funding with the government and private investors. 
""Discussions are ongoing and constructive,"" a Virgin Atlantic spokesman said on Thursday. 
Elsewhere in Europe, the French and Dutch governments have pledged up to 11 billion euros in rescue aid for Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), while Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is in talks about a bailout. Union and opposition politicians in Britain have called for extra government support for the aviation sector.
Virgin's internal memo also highlighted that cargo revenues, an extra source of income alongside passenger ticket sales, had become a lifeline for the airline during the pandemic. 
Virgin called the cargo-only programme ""critical"" and said it was helping to protect the airline's cash position. 
The Virgin spokesman said that Virgin was operating more than 90 cargo-only flights per week in May. 
Strong cargo demand is also helping Virgin's bigger rival British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG).
""The fact that we're seeing good, strong cargo demand has enabled us to operate passenger flights that without the cargo would be cash negative,"" IAG CEO Willie Walsh told investors on a call earlier on Thursday. 

IAG said that demand for cargo was such that it was considering modifying a couple of its Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 planes. It said that these were aircraft that would be reconfigured in future anyway, so it would remove the seats on some of the planes and fly cargo in the passenger cabin.

""That's enough to cover our cash burn under a zero-revenue environment for at least 18 months, not 12, 18 months,"" Del Rio told Reuters in a phone interview. 
""So unless you want to make the case that this pandemic is going to close us down more than a year and a half into almost 2022, we believe the company is in a great financial position, has all the cash and liquidity needed to survive a prolonged lay-up and be in a position to come out strong,"" he added.

853,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>","Wall Street bullish on ride-hailing firms on lower driver costs, recovery signs","By Anirban Sen and Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) - Wall Street gave a resounding vote of confidence to ride-hailing stocks ahead of Uber's (N:UBER) results on Thursday, after  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) indicated a slow recovery in demand and lower costs as rising unemployment creates greater supply of drivers. 
Shares of Lyft surged nearly 20%, while Uber's stock jumped about 8%. 
As parts of the U.S. economy start to re-open, demand for ride-hailing services is expected to get a significant boost, following weeks of upheaval in the core businesses of Lyft and Uber due to lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. 
Americans are also expected to turn to ride-hailing as a significant source of income, which in turn is expected to create a supply glut that will help companies such as Lyft and Uber to curb driver incentives and other costs. 
""The Street was bracing for worse on 1Q and overall cost cuts/road to profitability was some relative good news in a dark time,"" Wedbush analysts said in a note to clients. 
""The dichotomy we are seeing in this environment is that despite rides being significantly depressed (and likely to continue being so), Lyft is seeing stronger profitability.""
Lyft and Uber rely on independent contract workers and resist calls by some U.S. lawmakers to classify their drivers as employees, which would force them to pay benefits.
Total costs and expenses fell about 29% to $1.37 billion year-over-year for Lyft in the first quarter. 
At least four brokerages, including Wedbush and RBC Capital Markets, raised their price targets on Lyft on Thursday. 
""We think the ride-sharing environment will likely exhibit rational behavior both during and post-COVID as it relates to lower rider and driver incentives. Per management, rider incentives have essentially gone to zero,"" RBC Capital Markets said. 
RECOVERY IN DEMAND
With lockdown rules easing in the United States, Lyft rides rose 21% in the first week of May compared with a low point on April 12. 
""We expect rideshare demand to gradually come back as States relax stay-at-home orders and as riders possibly prefer private rides vs. public transport in the near term,"" J.P.Morgan analysts said in a note. 
Lyft's upbeat forecast bodes well for larger rival Uber Technologies (N:UBER), slated to report its first-quarter numbers later on Thursday. 
""We believe...greater-than-expected losses at one is likely to be read as a negative read-thru to the other, and better-than-expected profitability at one is likely to be a positive read-thru to the other,"" RBC said.

854,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Michigan governor to announce manufacturing can reopen in state - sources,"By Ben Klayman and David Shepardson
(Reuters) - Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday is expected to announce that the state's factories can reopen soon, removing one of the last major obstacles to North American automakers bringing thousands of laid-off employees back to work amid the coronavirus pandemic, two people familiar with the plans said.
Companies will be told they can begin work next week at their plants, including training their workforces for the restart, the sources said. 
This week, General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) had said they were targeting resuming vehicle production in North America on May 18, but suppliers would need time to prepare ahead for that date.
Whitmer is scheduled to provide an update of the state's handling of the coronavirus outbreak at 3 p.m. EDT.
The governor previously extended the state's coronavirus stay-at-home order through May 15, but lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio allowed manufacturing to resume on Monday, and Whitmer had faced increasing calls to follow suit.
Michigan's shutdown had stymied efforts by the Detroit Three and rival automakers to restart vehicle assembly anywhere in the United States, because so many critical parts suppliers are based in the state.
Automakers and their suppliers already have begun gearing up for a possible resumption of work at their U.S. plants, but needed the official go-ahead from Whitmer.
On Wednesday, No. 1 U.S. automaker GM said it was aiming to reopen its North American plants on May 18, the day after smaller Italian-American rival FCA provided the same target.  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) has not said what date it is targeting.
The automakers' plans were tacitly approved on Tuesday by the United Auto Workers union, which represents the Detroit automakers' hourly U.S. plant workers. The union had previously said early May was ""too soon and too risky"" to restart manufacturing.
Whitmer, a Democrat, has come under pressure from some Michigan residents and Republican lawmakers to ease her lockdown of the state to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. She has emphasized a phased approach to reopening the state, addressing regions and businesses that are less affected or better protected.
Whitmer has been mentioned as a potential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and has been a target of criticism from Republican President Donald Trump. 

Michigan, which Trump narrowly won in 2016, is considered a crucial swing state in the November presidential election and the state's COVID-19 infections rank among the highest in the country. As of Wednesday, Michigan had more than 45,000 COVID-19 cases and 4,250 deaths, but state officials have said the rate of infection has slowed.

(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) on Thursday appointed board member and turnaround specialist Jochen Zeitz to the role of chief executive officer, as the struggling motorcycle maker looks to tap into his expertise to woo customers and revive sales.
Shares of Harley, which were down 47% this year as of last close, rose 5% to $20.6 in morning trade.
Zeitz, a former CEO hailed for turning around German footwear brand Puma's near-bankrupt business, is known to have led a push for sustainability at Harley and was a force behind Harley's LiveWire, the company's first electric bike.
The company said Zeitz, who joined the Harley board in 2007, will continue to serve as the board chairman.
Harley has failed for years to increase sales in the United States, its top market, which accounts for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer consumer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to attract new customers.
To make matters worse, the pandemic has further dented demand as Americans stay at home to curb the spread of COVID-19.
In April, Harley slashed https://www.reuters.com/article/us-harley-davidson-results/harley-boosts-cash-reserves-as-coronavirus-hits-demand-idUSKCN22A1L0 its dividend and halted share buybacks to boost its cash reserves to weather the impact from the health crisis.
Zeitz was asked to take over after CEO Matthew Levatich stepped down in February following Harley's worst sales performance in at least 16 years.
In his first call with investors as acting CEO, Zeitz lined up plans to cut costs and ""de-emphasize"" some of its unprofitable international regions.

The shift in strategy for the company that symbolized the counterculture movement of the 1960s comes as it struggles to woo the next generation of younger riders with its electric and more nimbler bikes in the United States.

(Reuters) - Twilio Inc (N:TWLO) shares surged 32% to a record high after the cloud communication provider's quarterly results and forecast smashed Wall Street estimates on increased demand from telehealth and education companies amid widespread lockdowns.
At least eight brokerages raised their price targets on the stock. Mizuho made the most bullish brokerage, raising its target by $55 to $180.
""Twilio stands to be a significant beneficiary of COVID-19 in the short term, boosting usage volumes dramatically,"" Mizuho analysts wrote in a note. ""Longer term we expect the company to sustain robust growth.""
The San Francisco, California-based company said demand in the quarter dwindled from several of its top customers, including home rental startup Airbnb and ride-hailing firms Uber (N:UBER) and  Lyft  (O:LYFT), which have taken a hit from shelter-in-place orders to stop the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was, however, offset by increased use of its cloud-based services by call centers, education companies, healthcare and food delivery firms, the company said.
""Despite CV19 disruptions where industry demand abruptly slowed in March at small businesses and digital native customers including Airbnb, Uber, Lyft, and Lime, it was shocking to us that in these conditions TWLO delivered the largest absolute revenue beat since IPO,"" Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) analysts said.
Out of the 26 brokerages covering the stock, 19 have a ""buy"" or higher rating and the rest are on ""hold"".
The company reported first-quarter revenue of $364.9 million, well above the average market estimate of $331.3 million. It also forecast current-quarter revenue of $365 million to $370 million, above expectations of $336.9 million.
""We get the sense that the company is enthusiastic about incremental growth in the healthcare vertical and sees the potential for Video APIs being a long-term growth driver (today it is much smaller than messaging, voice and email),"" RBC analysts said.

Twilio had more than 190,000 active customer accounts as of March 31, up 23% from a year earlier.

868,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 07, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Hedge Funds Now Burned by Trades That Worked for Decades,"(Bloomberg) -- The sudden breakdown of a decades-long relationship between U.S. and Asian stocks has blindsided hedge funds, turning what were meant to be low-risk bets on volatility into big money losers.
Managers including Nine Masts Capital Ltd. and Myriad Asset Management Ltd. suffered losses in March on wagers that equity-market swings in Asia would be more extreme than those in the U.S. or Europe, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The bets were widespread among traders who focus on volatility, said Govert Heijboer, co-chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based True Partner Capital, a $1.4 billion hedge fund firm whose flagship volatility product gained 10% in March.
While the trades performed well in back tests over three decades, and produced big returns during the 2008 financial crisis, they fell apart in March as the coronavirus pandemic roiled global stocks. Swings in the S&P 500 Index soared far above those of benchmark gauges in Asia -- hitting a record versus Chinese shares in Hong Kong and touching the highest levels relative to Japanese and South Korean equities since Wall Street’s Black Monday crash in 1987.
The dramatic reversal highlights the risk of relying on historical market relationships to guide investments, an approach that has come under renewed scrutiny this year as many quantitative funds underperformed their benchmarks. Opinions differ on why the link between U.S. and Asian volatility broke down, but some investors have pointed to the growing complexity of U.S. market structure and the stabilizing presence of government funds and central banks in Asia. America has also become the new epicenter of the pandemic, with confirmed cases skyrocketing in March even as infection rates across much of Asia leveled off.
“Being long Asia versus short U.S. volatility worked in 2008, so it back tested well as a trade for stressed environments” Heijboer said. “In practice, it turned out otherwise.”
Nine Masts’ relative-value hedge fund lost 23.5% in March, mostly due to wagers that Asia index price swings would outstrip those in the U.S., according to people with knowledge of the Hong Kong-based firm. Myriad, also based in Hong Kong, ended the month with double-digit losses, said a person familiar with the matter. Its small derivatives book represented its largest losing strategy because of extreme moves in U.S. and European volatility, one of the people said. Representatives for the firms declined to comment.
Hedge fund wagers on price swings have swelled in recent years in part due to a steady supply of volatility exposures generated by the structured products desks of big investment banks. In a process sometimes called “risk recycling,” many banks have been offloading these exposures to their trading clients to comply with stricter post-2008 financial regulations.
One of the instruments favored by hedge funds -- the corridor variance swap -- allows for bets on relative volatility but can lead to outsized losses when markets move in the wrong direction. Such swaps contributed to the March downturn at Nine Masts, which oversaw $1.1 billion at the end of February and had made money in nine of the last 10 years. Myriad, which managed $4 billion at the end of 2019, also invested in the swaps. In March, the firm’s multistrategy hedge fund suffered the worst monthly performance in its eight-year history.
La Francaise Investment Solutions’ LFIS Vision Premia Opportunities Fund, which has invested in corridor variance swaps and other similar instruments in recent years, saw its net asset value drop about 23% in March. While the firm hasn’t disclosed details of its losing trades, it said in a March filing that the market environment was “unprecedented, with financial parameters at historically distorted levels and liquidity severely impacted.” La Francaise declined to comment.
The trades have been a “disaster” for some hedge funds, said Bharat Sachanandani, head of Asia-Pacific flow strategy and solutions at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA. Many of the wagers were based on the assumption that “when the U.S. sneezes, Asia catches a cold and vols spike much higher,” Sachanandani said. “It didn’t happen.”
One factor behind the subdued swings in Asia may have been the stabilizing effect of Chinese government intervention in the economy and markets, said Steve Diggle, who made $2.5 billion from volatility trades at Artradis Fund Management Pte between 2007 and 2008.
China’s central bank has kept the financial system flush with liquidity this year, while the so-called National Team of state-backed funds has helped underpin confidence in stocks after stepping in to support prices in the wake of a market crash in 2015. The sanguine mood has also buoyed Hong Kong shares, which attracted a record HK$137.9 billion ($18 billion) of net inflows in March via exchange links with the mainland.
Meanwhile in Japan, the central bank has been pouring money into Tokyo-listed exchange-traded funds as part of its unorthodox monetary stimulus program -- often buying on days when the stock market declines. The Bank of Japan owned an estimated 31 trillion yen ($290 billion) of ETFs at the end of March, according to NLI Research.
U.S. stocks have also gotten plenty of indirect support from the Federal Reserve. But the market has nonetheless become more vulnerable to sudden price swings as central bank stimulus fueled the popularity of leveraged investment strategies that are structurally short volatility, according to Gwilym Satchell, a fund manager at Invesco (NYSE:IVZ).

When leveraged U.S. investors are forced to unwind their bets on low volatility, the argument goes, they exacerbate bouts of market turbulence. Some analysts blamed the phenomenon for sharp swings in U.S. stocks in late 2018, one of the rare periods before this year when the S&P 500 became more volatile than Asian counterparts like the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. Up until March, 60-day swings in the U.S. gauge had been smaller than the Chinese index more than 90% of the time since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1993.
Satchell said he was also positioned for Asian stock swings to exceed those in the U.S., but hedged his exposure to protect against an extreme move in the other direction. He ended up making about $150 million from the trades in March, skirting what could have been a $120 million loss without the hedge.
What happens next is far from clear. While it’s possible that March was just a blip and that the historical U.S.-Asia volatility relationship will reassert itself, True Partner’s Heijboer isn’t willing to bet on it.
“It is difficult to predict,” he said, citing uncertainties around structured product sales, the economy and the varying impact of the virus. “There are many moving parts.”

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened smartly higher on Thursday as the number of people filing initial claims for jobless benefits slowed for a fifth straight week.
Initial claims fell to 'only' 3.17 million in the week to Friday, the lowest since states began to close their economies at the end of March in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, continuing claims rose faster than expected to a new record of 22.65 million, well above the 19.99 million expected by analysts ahead of time. The market reaction suggests that such unprecedented numbers of jobless claims have lost their ability to shock a market more focused on the reopening of the economy.%.

The breakdown of stock movements again reflected the triumph of the online world over the physical one, as investors upped their bets on Internet- and electronic-based technology. 
PayPal  (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock surged 12.8% to a new record high after the company promised a strong second quarter, reflecting the surge in e-commerce volumes caused by lockdown measures. It’s now up some 50% from March’s low. Fellow payments company Square  (NYSE:SQ) rose 7.0% on similar grounds.
Likewise, exercise bike maker Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) leaped 11.4% after maker of fitness bikes reduced its net loss to 2 cents a share in the first quarter as the pandemic and related lockdown measures drove a boom in working out from home, while Nintendo ADRs rose 3.0% after a strong performance in the three months to March by its  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) consoles (due largely to the Animals Crossing game).

876,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>","PayPal, Square eye boost as crisis spurs online shopping shift","(Reuters) - Wall Street analysts looked past a surprisingly shaky first quarter for payment processors  PayPal Holdings Inc  (O:PYPL) and  Square Inc  (N:SQ) hoping that the shift towards more online buying will see their businesses surge this year.
Square reported a surprise loss in the first quarter on Wednesday, as the coronavirus outbreak shut down large parts of the global retail industry and operating expenses rose, while PayPal's profit plunged 87.4% after it boosted credit loss reserves.
The decline tied in with the record drop in U.S. retail sales in March, indicating shoppers cut back on non-discretionary spending. (https://reut.rs/2LadvuU)
Analysts, however, bought into PayPal's predictions that the second quarter would be far brighter as more consumers get back to work and the boost the crisis has given to online sellers beds down.
The company reported ""unprecedented"" use of its platform over the past month, adding a record 7.4 million net new customers for the month of April.
Square, best known for its signature small white credit card readers that are plugged into smartphones, also said it had seen improving payment volume growth rates since mid-April.
""On May 1, we had our largest single day of transactions in our history, larger than last year's transactions on Black Friday or Cyber Monday,"" PayPal's Chief Executive Officer Daniel Schulman told analysts on a post-earnings conference call.
At least 11 brokerages raised their price target on PayPal following its results, while eight brokerages did the same on Square. 
Square's stock dipped 2.1% in premarket trading on Thursday, reflecting the poor first quarter. Shares in PayPal popped 10%. 
""Driven by changes in consumer shopping behavior tied to severe COVID-19 related health concerns, the shift to e-commerce is accelerating, making PYPL (PayPal), a pure-play in e-commerce payments, the greatest beneficiary in our coverage universe,"" Evercore analysts said.
Shopify Inc (TO:SHOP), said on Wednesday more people were shopping online as the virus outbreak kept them at home and rivals eBay Inc (O:EBAY) have also seen higher-than-usual demand.
Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) founder and the world's richest person, said last week in a statement, ""we're not thinking small,"" a sign that the e-commerce company would invest heavily during the pandemic.
The world's second-largest payment processor Mastercard Inc (N:MA) said last month it expects consumer spending to gradually return to ""pre-COVID"" levels as people start using their cards again on clothing and domestic travel.

""We expect e-commerce volumes will be insulated throughout the downturn and expect consumer shifts to e-commerce in certain spend categories will be durable post-downturn,"" Compass Point analysts said.

878,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 08:40AM ET</span>",Three big easyJet shareholders back management in dispute with Haji-Ioannou,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three investors in easyJet (L:EZJ) have thrown their weight behind the British airline's management in their battle with the founder and biggest shareholder Stelios Haji-Ioannou over a 4.5 billion pound plane order. 
The dispute is due to come to a head on May 22 when the results of an investor vote on whether to remove easyJet's chief executive, chairman, chief financial officer and another director will be made public.
The vote, forced by Haji-Ioannou, is a proxy vote on management's strategy to still buy more planes from Airbus (PA:AIR), one of many areas of broader corporate conflict sparked by a race to save cash during the pandemic.
Haji-Ioannou, whose family own just over a third of the stock, wants the airline to scrap the plan to buy 107 new planes, arguing that the coronavirus pandemic means the carrier cannot afford them and they won't be needed. 
INVESCO, which according to Refinitiv data owns 10% of easyJet's shares and is its No.2 shareholder; Ninety One UK Limited, which has 5.2% and is No.3 on the list plus Phoenix Asset Management, with 3.3% and the fifth-biggest, all said they were backing management in the vote. 
To win the votes, Haji-Ioannou's resolutions need backing from over 50% of the shares voted.
EasyJet has agreed to defer the delivery of 24 of the new aircraft, but its chairman John Barton says it needs to stick with the order to modernise its fleet and because any termination would be costly. He has added that removing directors at this time would be ""damaging and destabilising"". 
EasyJet published the investor letters supporting its management on its website.

(Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) on Thursday posted a $268 million quarterly loss as the coronavirus pandemic hurt air travel demand, and revised its order book with Airbus SE (PA:AIR) to save $1.1 billion in aircraft spending through 2022.
Since cases of the novel coronavirus began accelerating in March, U.S air travel demand has sunk by about 95%, forcing airlines to shift their focus from growth plans to parking planes and minimizing their daily cash burn.
While the overall number of bookings was ""extremely limited,"" New York-based JetBlue said it believed demand had reached a floor around mid-April and it expected to have a better sense of the third and fourth quarters by early summer.
Following measures to boost its liquidity, JetBlue expects its daily cash burn to fall to just below $10 million in May from an average of $18 million in the second half of March, excluding government assistance under the CARES Act.
The airline is set to receive $936 million in government payroll assistance, which bans companies from reducing their workforce until Sept. 30, and said it has applied for an additional up to $1.14 billion government loan that it can draw if needed. 
Revenue declined 15.1% in the first quarter from a year earlier, including a 52% decline in March as the pandemic hurt demand and fares.
Net losses reached $268 million for the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $42 million a year earlier.

Excluding special items, the net loss was $116 million, or a loss of $0.42 per share.

In addition to providing the funding, Apple said it would help COPAN Diagnostics design and source new equipment from York, Pennsylvania-based K2 Kinetics and Waukesha, Wisconsin-based MWES, both makers of industrial robotics systems.
Shortages of collection kits and testing supplies have slowed efforts to track the spread of the novel coronavirus in the United States. The corporate parent of COPAN Diagnostics, COPAN Group, is based in the Lombardy region of Italy, one of the worst-hit regions in the world during the pandemic, and stepped up production as demand surged. 
In California, COPAN Diagnostics makes specialized nasal swabs to collect samples for Covid-19 tests, along with vials and sterile media used to transport those swabs to labs for testing. The companies said Apple's help would expand production of sample kits destined for U.S. hospitals from a current several thousand per week to more than one million kits per week by early July.
In a statement, Norman Sharples, chief executive of COPAN Diagnostics, said Apple's ""teams are already making a huge difference with our efforts to scale up the production of our sample collection and transport kits.”
Apple did not specify the nature of the funding but made the award from a $5 billion advanced manufacturing fund. The iPhone maker previously used the fund to support expansions and research at its suppliers, such as Corning (NYSE:GLW) Inc, which makes glass for iPhones, and II-VI (NASDAQ:IIVI) Inc-owned Finisar, which makes chips for Apple's face recognition sensors.

“We feel a deep sense of responsibility to do everything we can to help medical workers, patients, and communities support the global response to COVID-19,” Jeff Williams (NYSE:WMB), Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement.

881,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",U.S. and Europe spar over next stage of aircraft subsidy dispute,"By David Lawder and Philip Blenkinsop
WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States said there was ""no valid basis"" for the European Union to retaliate against U.S. goods in a long-running subsidy row after Boeing lost state tax breaks, but the EU said it was pressing ahead with its demand for tariffs.
The transatlantic dispute over support for Europe's Airbus (PA:AIR) and U.S. rival Boeing (N:BA) has already led to U.S. tariffs on European goods and could lead to a tit-for-tat EU response.
The United States said on Wednesday it had notified the World Trade Organization (WTO) that it had fully complied with WTO findings by repealing tax breaks for Boeing in Washington state.
Washington state's legislature in March repealed the preferential aerospace tax break first introduced 16 years ago, which saved Boeing some $118 million in 2018 based on its published jetliner revenue.
The WTO has found the world's two largest planemakers received billions of dollars of unfair subsidies in a pair of cases dating back to 2004.
Last year it allowed the United States to levy tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of EU goods, including aircraft, wines and cheese, due to Airbus subsidies that it had deemed illegal. 
Now it is considering whether to grant similar rights to the EU in a parallel case involving illegal support for Boeing.
""With Washington State’s repeal of this relatively minor tax reduction, the United States has fully implemented the WTO’s recommendation, ending this dispute,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said. ""This step ensures that there is no valid basis for the EU to retaliate against any U.S. goods."" 
Wednesday's formal U.S. submission to the WTO aims to neutralize the EU's demand for some $10 billion in annual tariffs, USTR said.
But the EU's executive Commission rejected the move and said the United States remained out of step with the WTO's rule-setting Dispute Settlement Body.
""The EU does not agree with the U.S. unilateral assertion that it has fully implemented the DSB recommendations and rulings in this dispute,"" it said.
The EU said it was still studying the state tax repeal, but listed other measures where it said the United States had failed to comply with WTO rulings on aid for Boeing, including research support from NASA and the Pentagon.
The United States denies that any other measures are outstanding in the Boeing case and said on Wednesday that the abolition of tax breaks brought the marathon case to a close.
EU TARIFF RULING AWAITED
The spat brings the aircraft industry a step closer to an expanded tariff war. 
The United States raised tariffs on Airbus planes to 15% from 10% on March 17, though the immediate impact is muted as many airlines delay deliveries due to the pandemic. 
The WTO is expected to issue a decision on the EU tariff request in June. 
EU officials have emphasized their desire to negotiate an end to the dispute, while U.S. sources have said this has not led to concrete proposals. 
Airbus has said it is for the WTO to rule on compliance while Boeing says it has advocated against its own economic interest for the tax breaks to be repealed to protect rules-based trade.
Boeing was reported to have lobbied in the past for the tax breaks to be introduced and later extended, while Airbus lost a separate bid to prove they were a more serious WTO violation.
The WTO decision on EU retaliation is expected to arrive well before any compliance proceeding could be completed. Even without an appeal, it could take the WTO until mid- to late 2021 to rule on the compliance issue, experts said.
Boeing last week declined to seek aid from a U.S. government $17-billion coronavirus relief fund for aerospace and other national security-linked firms after it raised $25 billion in a corporate bond offering.

The USTR launched formal negotiations with Britain on Tuesday for a post-Brexit free-trade agreement.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd (T:7974) said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit soared 200% due to surging demand for its  Switch  (NYSE:SWCH) games console, and that title Animal Crossing: New Horizons shifted a record 13.4 million units in its first six weeks.
The Kyoto-based gaming company posted operating profit of 89.4 billion yen for January-March, Reuters' calculations showed based on annual figures, smashing analyst estimates.
Nintendo has defied scepticism over its ability to draw in consumers beyond a hardcore base in the Switch's fourth year with the runaway success of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which has become the console's fastest-selling title since launching on March 20.
The appeal of the title among consumers looking for escapism in coronavirus-hit economies around the world underscores Nintendo's games-maker credentials at a time when investors have been frustrated by the company's conservative management, which includes what many regard as a half-baked foray into mobile gaming.
Nintendo said it expects to sell 19 million Switch console units in the current financial year. Its forecasts are widely viewed as conservative.
""Animal Crossing's impact was bigger than expected but is temporary,"" CEO Shuntaro Furukawa said, adding he did not see the company's forecasts, which include a fall in full year software sales to 140 million units, as conservative.
In the year ended March, Nintendo sold 21 million Switch consoles, well above its forecast of 19.5 million.
That breaks down as 14.8 million units of the hybrid home-portable device and 6.2 million units of the handheld-only Switch Lite, which went on sale in September.
SHORTAGES 
The popularity of the device and the coronavirus outbreak's impact on supply chains has led to Switch shortages around the world, preventing the company from taking full advantage of pent-up demand.
The company said production and shipping are ""gradually recovering"" following pandemic-induced delays but pointed to the risk of further disruption including to games development. 
""It is difficult to expect the same productivity"" from employees working at home, Furukawa said, adding delays to game releases are a possibility if the crisis is protracted. 

Nintendo has provided few details of upcoming titles, risking putting a break on sales momentum as studios across the world scramble to mitigate disruption from the virus. Rival Sony Corp (T:6758) has already announced delays to high-profile releases.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Thursday, helped by gains in the energy sector after better than expected Chinese export data raised hopes of a prompt recovery for the global economy.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 38 points, or 1.4%, higher, Nasdaq futures up 127 points, or 1.4%. The Dow futures contract rose 278 points, or 1.2%.
Dollar-denominated exports from China, the world’s second-largest economy, unexpectedly rose in April for the first time this year, climbing 3.5% from a year ago.
The surprise stoked speculation the Asian giant could recover from its coronavirus lockdown quicker than first thought and support global growth in the process. The dire import data, which fell by 14.2% on the year, has tended to be overlooked.
Adding to the positive tone are sharp gains in oil futures Thursday, fueled by news that Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest exporter of oil, had increased its official selling prices.
Extremely low oil prices have been weighing on the energy sector, with many oil producers having to cut spending and reduce dividends to reduce cash breakevens.
At 7 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 8.4% higher at $26.00 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract rose 5.7% to $31.31.
On the earnings front, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) will report earnings after the bell, having already said it is cutting 3,700 jobs in customer support and recruitment as it looks to cut costs as ride volumes crater. 
 Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock climbed 14% premarket after the ride-sharing company stated that its ridership had been improving since mid-April.
Ahead of trading, drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock rose 2.9% premarket after weighing in with better than expected quarterly results. 
Elsewhere, Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON) stock climbed 15% premarket after the fitness company posted strong fiscal third quarter sales and issued encouraging guidance for the following quarter.
The day’s key economic release will be weekly U.S. jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), a precursor to Friday’s key monthly official employment.
Economists expect claims for first-time unemployment benefits totaled another 3 million last week. That would continue the downward trend of initial claims, from 3.8 million the week before.
This follows the U.S. private sector shedding a record 20.23 million jobs in April, according to Wednesday’s report by payrolls processor ADP (NASDAQ:ADP).
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.5% to $1,696.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0791, largely flat.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba/LONDON (Reuters) - There is no room on the range for cattle, as shuttered slaughterhouses across North America due to the pandemic leave farmers nowhere to ship their animals. 
Now fast-food chain Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) says it is running out of beef, while Kroger (NYSE:KR) and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) limit sales of some meat items, underlining the growing dislocation in the meat supply chain.
Canada and the United States are among the world's biggest beef exporters, but outbreaks have forced plants owned by Cargill Inc,  JBS SA  (OTC:JBSAY) and  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN) to temporarily close or slow production, as they balance worker safety with food security.
""It’s a horrible situation for us to watch,"" said Leighton Kolk, who normally ships 500 head of cattle to slaughter per week from his feedlot at Iron Springs, Alberta. 
Last week, he moved 40 and is not sure there will be a single bid this week, at a time when he normally sees the highest prices of the year ahead of barbecue season. Each head of cattle that stays on his farm costs C$4 per day to feed.
""The consumer is going to pay a huge price and we could approach financial insolvency because these animals are dropping in value,"" Kolk said. 
Ryan Kasko, chairman of the Alberta Cattle Feeders' Association, estimates there are up to 80,000 Canadian cattle awaiting slaughter, and the number may reach 250,000 head by July.
""A month ago, I couldn't even imagine this,"" Kasko, a feedlot operator, said.
But beef buyers are seeing anything but glut conditions.
""From time to time, there could be some items that we're out of stock on,"" Wendys Chief Executive Todd Penegor told analysts on Wednesday. ""It's probably a couple of weeks of challenging tightness that we'll have to work through."" 
Victor Colello, director of meat and fish at New York City grocery chain Morton Williams (NYSE:WMB), said he has not had any trouble getting meat but that ""prices are crazy.""
""In the past two weeks, prices have gone up anywhere from $3 to $5 per pound. I find myself changing prices every two or three days.""
For example, he said wholesale filet mignon went from $8.50 or $9 per lb two weeks ago to $14. Short loins, which are porterhouse steaks, used to cost $6.50 a lb, now are up to $10-$11, while a pound of rib steaks climbed from $7 to $11.
""I'm 56 years old, I've been doing this all my life and I've never experienced something like this,"" Colello said.
BEEF PRICES JUMP
The average unit price of fresh beef at U.S. tracked retailers was 6% higher in the week ended April 25 than a year earlier, according to market research firm Nielsen.
Those prices are not reaching cattle farmers, however. Some packers offer no bids for cattle, while others offered prices that were 30% lower from January, Kasko said.
With packers offering low prices for cattle and meat prices high in stores, 11 Midwestern states on Tuesday urged the federal Department of Justice to investigate suspected price fixing by meat packers.
""We believe the assertions lack merit, and we are confident in our efforts to maintain market integrity and conduct ethical business,"" Cargill spokesman Daniel Sullivan said.
Kolk and Kasko normally ship to two Alberta plants that together supply two-thirds of Canada's beef, but are now coronavirus hotspots. 
Cargill resumed production this week at High River, Alberta after a two-week shutdown, and JBS is producing more slowly at its Brooks, Alberta plant. 
Tyson Foods has shuttered cattle slaughterhouses in Dakota City, Nebraska, and in Pasco, Washington, which partially reopened on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered meat processors to keep plants open.
Canada and the United States have both announced aid packages for the food and agriculture sectors.
Alberta rancher Kelly Smith-Fraser sees a long crisis ahead. 
Price estimates for the calves she will sell in autumn are less than half of the usual price, as the feedlots who buy them cope with big cattle backlogs.
""Each day we are on pins and needles to make sure those plants stay open.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The owner of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus must cut costs across the board to weather the coronavirus crisis as air travel won't return to normal until at least 2023, its chief executive Willie Walsh said on Thursday. 
British Airways has already announced job reductions of up to 12,000 so Thursday's statement by its owner IAG (L:ICAG) has raised the prospect of further cuts at its other airlines as it looks to preserve cash during the crisis.
Walsh, who has delayed his retirement until September to see IAG through the pandemic, also said the company was looking at getting a cut in the price of Spanish airline Air Europa, which it agreed to buy for 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) last year.
Walsh reiterated that IAG was not looking for any state bailouts beyond general government schemes to help companies through the crisis, unlike rivals such as Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG).
IAG shares were down 4% in early trading, having already lost almost 70% of their value over the last three months. 
""I've been very clear that state aid which is made on a general basis, if it's applicable to us and we can avail of it ... then we will do so,"" said Walsh.
IAG, which has used furlough schemes to pay staff, said it had accessed 300 million pounds ($371 million) under Britain's Coronavirus Corporate Finance Facility and had 10 billion euros of liquidity available at the end of April.
""However, we do not expect passenger demand to recover to the level of 2019 before 2023 at the earliest. This means group-wide restructuring is essential in order to get through the crisis and preserve an adequate level of liquidity,"" Walsh said.
Analysts have speculated that IAG could make cost savings by pulling out of the Air Europa deal. 
Walsh said the regulatory process was continuing but IAG was looking at it, and the price could be lowered. 
""There is a price adjustment mechanism in the agreement that we have with Air Europa,"" he said. 
JULY RESTART
Walsh had been planning to retire in March but would now leave on September 24, IAG said, when the head of Iberia, Luis Gallego, will succeed him.
By then, IAG hopes its planes will be back in the air. It said on Thursday it was planning for flights to restart in July with passenger capacity about 50% lower, though the return was subject to the easing of travel restrictions. 
As a debate intensifies over how to get airlines flying again while respecting social distancing, Walsh said IAG supported the use of temperature checks on departure and arrival, as well as mandatory face coverings. 
""Our industry has had to adapt quickly to changing regulations in the past, we've done so, and we will do so again,"" he said. 
Looking to reshape its operations to cope with lower demand, IAG said it would seek to defer the deliveries of 68 aircraft, building on measures taken last week, when it said it would cut more than a quarter of BA staff.
Other European airlines Ryanair (I:RYA) and Virgin Atlantic have also since announced job cuts while Air France-KLM reported a first-quarter operating loss of 815 million euros on Thursday.
IAG said it had reduced its weekly operating costs to 200 million euros since the crisis struck from 440 million euros, which analysts said was encouraging.

""We read this as more positive than negative in terms of how management are handling the current crisis, albeit with huge uncertainty still overhanging both the group and the industry as a whole,"" Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said.

891,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>",Global luxury gloom to deepen despite easing lockdowns: Bain,"By Silvia Aloisi
MILAN (Reuters) - Global sales of luxury goods are expected to slump by 50% to 60% in the second quarter even as some countries begin to ease coronavirus lockdowns and despite signs of recovery in the Chinese market, consultancy Bain said on Thursday. 
The coronavirus crisis, which first hit China late last year before spreading to Europe and the United States, has kept shoppers at home and forced retailers to shut stores, resulting in a crushing halt to a decade of spectacular growth for high-end brands. 
With the April to June decline coming on top of an estimated 25% drop in the first three months of the year, Bain expects global sales of luxury handbags, clothing and cosmetics to shrink by between 20% and 35% in 2020, against a previous estimate for a 15% to 35% decline. 
The consultancy, which produces closely followed forecasts for the sector, says it will take until 2022-23 for revenues to return to 2019 levels, which are estimated by Bain to have totaled 281 billion euros ($303.5 billion).
An April report by fellow consultancy McKinsey said the personal luxury goods industry is expected to contract by 35% to 39% this year.
If stores remain shuttered for two months, roughly 80% of listed fashion companies in Europe and North America will be ""in a state of financial distress"", McKinsey said.
A recent rebound in China, where the lockdown has been gradually eased since March, is helping offset some of the decline in Europe and the United States, where luxury goods stores are only expected to reopen in the second half of May. 
The best-performing brands are already registering a year-on-year sales increase in China for the first four months of 2020, Bain said. Store traffic has nearly halved from a year ago, but people who do venture out are more inclined to buy and the average spend has also increased.
CHINESE UPLIFT
Bain did not name brands, but Louis Vuitton and Dior owner LVMH (PA:LVMH) has said that sales in mainland China had jumped by 50% in some cases during the first weeks of April, while Hermes has also reported a sharp pick-up in Chinese business.
 Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) is also seeing signs of a sales rebound in China and online, it said this week as it reported a 17% drop in first-quarter sales and forecast a 50% slump in the second quarter.
""If a customer goes to a store, there is a very good motivation to buy,"" said Federica Levato, a partner at Bain. 
Chinese shoppers accounted for 35% of global luxury spending in 2019 and Bain expects their influence on the sector to grow even further in the next few years - making up nearly half of all luxury sales in 2025. 
With global travel not expected to return to normal levels for up to two years, Chinese consumers who used to make most of their luxury purchases abroad will largely be shopping at home, accelerating a trend that was already under way. 
Beijing has cut import duties and sales tax, eroding the competitive price advantage of destinations such as London and New York, while Hong Kong - long a shopping magnet for Chinese from the mainland - has lost its lustre after months of protests last year.
""For sure the repatriation of purchases in China will be faster,"" said Levato, adding that consumer morale is also likely to bounce back more quickly in Asia than in recession-hit Europe or the United States.
""If luxury brands are able to serve their customers in China with the same service level and offer the same experience (that they would be normally offering abroad) then they can recover the bulk of what they are losing in terms of Chinese tourists no longer shopping in Europe or the U.S.,"" she said.

Bain expects more than half of luxury goods purchases made by Chinese consumers to take place in China by 2025.

894,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2020 05:31AM ET</span>",StockBeat: 'Free Money Forever' Greases Telefonica's U.K. Deal,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- It’s Europe’s biggest M&A deal since the continent went into lockdown: Spanish telecoms giant  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) is merging its U.K. business O2 with Virgin Media, owned by ‘cable cowboy’ John Malone’s Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA).
If approved by regulators, it will combine the U.K.’s second-biggest mobile business (O2) with the country’s second-biggest internet business (Virgin), creating an integrated giant more than capable of taking on the two local heavyweights, BT Group (LON:BT) and  Vodafone  Group PLC (LON:VOD), and will squeeze smaller rivals such as Talk Talk even harder.
The logic to the deal is undeniable – Telefonica has been looking for a partner for O2 for years. Its original choice, CK Hutchison’s 3, was forbidden by the U.K.’s antitrust regulators. 
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), Telefonica stock was down 0.4%, paring some of the gains it had made as details about the intended deal had dribbled out. Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) shares were down 0.5% while Talk Talk  (LON:TALK) was down 1.0%.
BT shares fell by a more dramatic 8.8%, due to a separate but, in the light of things, probably connected development: it’s suspending its dividend until its fiscal 2022 year in an effort to preserve cash that’s sorely needed to cover customer defaults and, of course, the rolling out of 5G services.
The new joint venture is valued at just over 31 billion pounds ($38 billion), including 11.3 billion pounds of debt. Its owner will share free cash flow equally, even though the more profitable Virgin, at 18 billion pounds, was valued 50% higher than O2.
Telefonica will get some 5.3 billion pounds in cash as the merger completes, a prospect that allowed it to keep its dividend unchanged on Thursday – unlike BT.
But what stands out most about the deal is the amount of leverage that the two companies feel comfortable with. They’re targeting ongoing net leverage of between 4 and 5 times. Given the limited opportunities for growth in a saturated market, and the limited space to push higher prices on a hard-pressed consumer base, that implies that neither expects a significant increase in borrowing costs for years (and why would they, given the current state of ECB and Bank of England monetary policy?). It's just as well they think they can squeeze 540 million pounds of costs a year out of the deal. 
In other words, the main takeaway from the deal is that ‘free money forever’ will be the working assumption behind M&A in the Covid-19 era."

""From the end of April onwards the H&M group started gradually reopening stores in a number of markets,"" it said in a statement. ""In those markets that have begun to open up, trade in the stores has initially been muted.""

896,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>","AB InBev sees worse ahead, but some light in China","By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) -  Anheuser-Busch InBev  (BR:ABI), the world's largest beer maker, forecast a ""materially worse"" second quarter as coronavirus restrictions curb drinking across the globe, although China was showing early signs of recovery.
The brewer of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois sold 9.3% less beer and other drink than a year ago in the first three months of 2020, but this decline worsened to about a third in April as bars and restaurants closed and some production halted.
At one extreme, South Africa banned sales of alcohol at the end of March and Peru closed down beer production and sale until the end of April, while many stores in Mexico were out of stock after breweries were shut.
The Belgium-based beer maker did say, however, there were early signs of recovery in China and South Korea as restaurants, and to a lesser extent clubs, began reopening from mid-March.
The company's drinks volumes in China were down 46.5% in January-March, but only 17% lower in April.
AB InBev has already scrapped its guidance for 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposed halving its final 2019 dividend, along with taking other cost-saving measures.
It also said regulatory approval had concluded for the A$16 billion sale ($10 billion) of its Australian operations to Japan's Asahi Group Holdings (T:2502), the deal now expected to close on June 1.
AB InBev shares were up 2.7% at 40.00 euros at 0810 GMT in a broadly stronger market, although they are still down 45% this year.
""April trends are bad, but they could have been worse and the Australia sale, even if expected, is almost there,"" said Trevor Stirling, beverage analyst at Bernstein Research, adding he was modelling a 37% volume decline for the second quarter.
FROM BARS TO STORES AND DELIVERIES
Overall, first quarter core profit (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation or EBITDA) came in at $3.95 billion, down 13.7% from a year earlier. That compared with a company-compiled consensus of a 14.7% drop.
In the United States, AB InBev's largest market, the company lost market share as the craze for hard seltzer - sparkling, often fruit-flavoured alcoholic beverages - accelerated, although the company is pushing more into this category.
Sales in stores also rose, disproportionately benefiting established brands such as its own and larger packs, though it was not clear if this would continue long term.
Stores across the world have seen surging sales of beer, wine and spirits, although the pace in many countries has slowed and it seems unlikely to make up the shortfall from lost sales in bars, clubs and restaurants.
In Brazil, the company's second largest market, revenue fell 10% in the first three months of the year as many states forced the closure in March of bars and restaurants, which account for more than half of AB InBev's drinks volumes in the country.

It is hoping to expand a service delivering cold beer to customers within an hour from closed venues.

897,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",European stocks lifted by surprise rise in Chinese exports,"By Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - European shares rose on Thursday as a surprise rise in China's exports overshadowed another set of grim results and a warning from Air France-KLM that demand could take ""several years"" to recover.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose 0.6%, led by gains in retail (SXRP), mining (SXPP) and real estate (SX86P) sectors (SXMP).
German online fashion retailer Zalando (DE:ZALG) jumped 10.2% after saying it was recovering from an initial hit by coronavirus lockdowns and it expects a return to profitability as it posted a first-quarter loss.
The mood stabilised globally as Beijing reported a 3.5% rise in April exports, confounding market expectations for a sharp fall, as factories restarted production after the coronavirus pandemic.
""Market reaction has generally been driven by things not getting any worse,"" said Will James, deputy head of European equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments in London.
""There's probably a bit of danger to extrapolate a similar path of recovery within Europe and elsewhere because in China, the state is very heavily involved.""
Despite forecasts for a record 7.7% contraction for the euro zone economy this year and a 14% plunge in Britain's economy, European shares have held near two-month highs on hopes that easing lockdowns will spark a rebound in economic activity.
However, the threat of a renewed Sino-U.S. trade spat has weighed on sentiment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo renewed his aggressive criticism of China on Wednesday, blaming it for the deaths of thousands of people from the coronavirus.
Some disappointing earnings forecasts also cast a shadow, with Air France (PA:AIRF) dipping 3.8% as it predicted operating losses to widen ""significantly"" in April-June quarter, with 95% of flights expected to remain grounded.
British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) fell nearly 2.8% after it warned that passenger demand would not return to previous levels until 2023, and it would seek to defer deliveries of 68 aircraft.

Britain's largest telecoms group BT (L:BT) tumbled 7.1% and was the biggest decliner on the FTSE 100 (FTSE) after it suspended its dividend until 2021-22 and pulled its financial outlook in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

899,By Investing.com,"<span>May 07, 2020 04:13AM ET</span>","Stocks - Europe Higher, Helped by Strong Chinese Export Data","By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Thursday, helped by stronger than expected export data from China as well as a call for more stimulus for the region.
At 4:20 AM ET (0820 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.6% higher, France's CAC 40 rose 0.5%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index traded up 0.3%.
Earlier Thursday, Chinese exports grew 3.5% in April from a year earlier, completely confounding expectations of a 15.1% fall and outweighing a 14.2% drop in imports.
The surprise stoked speculation the world's second largest economy could recover from its coronavirus lockdown quicker than first thought and support global growth in the process.
Closer to home, European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos called for greater cooperation in fiscal policy from the region’s political leaders to support the recovery.
Stating the euro zone economy is facing a deep recession, he told the European Parliament's committee on economic and monetary affairs that ""it is thus vital that the fiscal response to this crisis is sufficiently forceful, in all parts of the euro area."" 
In corporate news, Zalando (DE:ZALG) stock soared over 10% after the Berlin-based online retailer predicted double-digit growth in 2020.
On the flip side, BT Group (LON:BT) fell over 8% after the telecoms group said it would suspend its dividend until 2022 to fund a restructuring plan to deal with the pandemic. BT also faces stiffer competition after  Telefonica  (MC:TEF) and Liberty Global  (NASDAQ:LBTYA) confirmed the merger of their O2 and Virgin Media services.
The day’s key economic release will be weekly U.S. jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT), a precursor to Friday’s key monthly official employment.
Economists expect claims for first-time unemployment benefits rose by another 3 million last week. That would continue the downward trend of new claims, which totaled 3.8 million the week before.
This follows data suggesting the U.S. private sector shed a record 20.23 million jobs in April, according to Wednesday’s report by payrolls processor ADP (NASDAQ:ADP).
Oil futures slipped Thursday, despite the Energy Information Administration reporting a smaller-than-expected increase in U.S. crude oil stocks late Wednesday as investors consolidate recent gains.
At 4:20 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 0.5% lower at $23.88 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 0.6% to $29.52.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,694.20/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0794, largely flat."

(Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce (OTC:RYCEY) signalled on Thursday it expects to cut some of its workforce, after reports that it was considering cutting up to 8,000 jobs to weather a global aerospace sector slump.
A source close to Rolls-Royce, one Britain's best known industrial names and one of the world's main producers of jet engines for airliners, told Reuters last week that it was looking at cutting up to 15% of its 52,000 strong workforce.
""We have promised to give our people further details of the impact of the current situation on the size of our workforce before the end of this month and will consult with affected employees in due course,"" Rolls-Royce (L:RR) said.
Shares in Rolls-Royce, which said in a statement it had furloughed 4,000 staff in Britain, were down as much as 3.6% at 283 pence in early trading. Shares in the FTSE 100 company have lost nearly 60% of their value this year.
Rolls-Royce also said it was cutting its forecast for production of widebody plane engines to around 250 widebody engines in 2020, down from its prior forecast of 450, and taking steps to save 1 billion pounds in costs.
The company said its civil aerospace widebody engine flying hours were 40% lower than expected for the first four months of 2020, reflecting a 90% collapse in April as airlines across the world ground most of their fleet.
""The severity of the disruption caused by COVID-19 is expected to lead to a smaller commercial aerospace market which may take several years to recover,"" it said in a trading update. 
""We must ... take the difficult but necessary decisions to ensure the group emerges from this period with the appropriate cost base,"" it said, adding that it would consult with trade unions on any layoffs. 

Before the coronavirus crisis all but halted air travel this year, Rolls-Royce was striving to emerge from a multi-year turnaround plan and it said it expects a significant net cash outflow during the second quarter.

904,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 02:55AM ET</span>",British insurer RSA sees £25 million in coronavirus claims,"LONDON (Reuters) - British insurer RSA (L:RSA) said it expected its exposure from the coronavirus pandemic to total around 25 million pounds ($30.89 million), with claims coming from travel, wedding and event cancellation insurance.
The home, motor and commercial insurer had received around 25,000 claims on which it would pay out, of which around 23,000 were travel claims, it said in a statement.
There had been little effect from the pandemic on RSA's first-quarter results, with business operating profit up by double digit percentages, RSA said. Net written premiums totalled 1.5 billion pounds in the first quarter, down 1% from a year earlier. 
Best known in Britain for its ""More than"" brand, RSA also has large operations in Canada, Ireland and Scandinavia.
RSA said last month it would not pay its 2019 final dividend, following pressure from regulators on insurers to protect policyholders and ensure strong levels of capital. 
Chief Executive Stephen Hester said RSA was ""resilient"".
""We are also very conscious of our shareholder responsibilities, especially with regards to restarting dividend payments when it is prudent to do so.”
The group's solvency ratio fell to 151% from 168% at end-Dec due to market moves and planned pension contributions, but remained within the insurer's 130-160% target range. 
A level above 100% indicates an insurer has sufficient capital.
RSA is one of several top insurers facing the possibility of multi-million pound lawsuits from small businesses in Britain which allege legitimate business interruption claims have been rejected.
The Financial Conduct Authority said last week it was seeking clarity from the courts to resolve uncertainty over business interruption payments.

""The great majority of business interruption claims are not expected to be eligible under their coverage terms for COVID-19"", RSA said, adding that for claims due to the pandemic in general, ""it is expected that some cases will be challenged and may have outcomes the same or different to our expectations"".

""We have some A350s for the end of the year that will be pushed into next year, and then we have some A350s for next year that will be pushed into the year after,"" Chief Executive Ben Smith said, adding that this was at Airbus's request.
Air France has also been notified by Boeing that a 787 due to arrive in June will not be delivered on schedule, he said.
The delays come at a time when cash-strapped airlines are themselves requesting postponements.
""These are nice domino impacts on us and we are going to continue to negotiate to ensure we have the right mix to match our liquidity and our assumptions going forward,"" Smith said.
Airbus and Boeing paused production last month to adjust to lockdowns and are cutting future output due to lower demand.
Air France-KLM is also reviewing aircraft deployments in light of a 7 billion euro ($7.6 billion) state-sponsored French loan deal.
In December, Air France ordered 60 Airbus A220-300s in the first stage of a plan to modernise its single-aisle fleet.
Smith said it may shift more of these onto its domestic network to meet conditions for cutting emissions as part of the loan deal, which also requires fewer domestic flights.
The carrier is not yet ready to think about the second stage of the modernisation programme, expected to pit the Airbus A320neo against the Boeing 737 MAX.
""It's not a subject for this emergency period,"" Smith said.
The Franco-Dutch group's immediate priority is to examine fleets to see where it has flexibility to return jets to lessors or keep planes grounded, based on assumptions that it will take at least two years for demand to recover.
Only then will it consider how much risk is worth taking to position itself for future growth, Smith said, adding: ""When there is no demand for airplanes you can negotiate some pretty amazing deals"".
In November, Air France-KLM announced plans to streamline fleets by reducing the number of aircraft types and phasing out the Airbus A380 by 2022. 
Smith declined to say whether A380 retirements would be accelerated, but said they would not be flying any time soon.
Fleet requirements are expected to form part of a revised business plan likely to be issued in mid-July.
France's finance minister has said government support also comes with the expectation that the airline keeps buying from France-based Airbus.
Smith said all airplanes already on order by the French side of the group ""just happened to be Airbus"", but added the question of new orders was ""not a subject today"".

Asked whether the group could cancel any orders, he said, ""We're talking with all suppliers to understand what flexibility we have in this new environment"".

The parent companies, which expect to achieve 6.2 billion pounds of synergies on an annual basis by the fifth full year after closing, will have equal ownership of the combined entity, they said on Thursday. 
The joint venture will invest 10 billion pounds in the UK market over the next five years.
The companies said the deal would value Telefonica's O2 at 12.7 billion pounds and Liberty's Virgin Media at 18.7 billion pounds, both on a total enterprise value basis, including debt. 
""O2 to be transferred into the joint venture on a debt-free basis, while Virgin Media to be contributed with 11.3 billion pounds of net debt and debt-like items,"" the companies said in a joint statement.
Both parties expect to receive net cash proceeds at closing following a series of recapitalisations that will generate 5.7 billion pounds in proceeds for Telefonica and 1.4 billion pounds for Liberty, they said.

The deal will allow Telefonica to squeeze cash from O2 and keep a presence in Britain, while Virgin will gain access to its own wireless network, saving the money it has spent until now on leasing capacity for its mobile operations.

910,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 02:00AM ET</span>",Air France job cuts set to test CEO Smith's consensual style,"By Laurence Frost and Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) is opening talks with its French unions on workforce cuts, Chief Executive Ben Smith told Reuters, as the airline group warned of mounting losses with no clear end in sight to the coronavirus crisis.
Air France has scheduled a strategic workforce planning meeting in June to discuss capacity cuts and their consequences for staffing, Smith said in an interview as the group's quarterly results offered a foretaste of the pandemic's impact.
The meeting, known by its French acronym GPEC, often prefigures significant redundancy plans. Smith did not elaborate on the size of likely cutbacks but said the company had ""already identified"" opportunities for voluntary layoffs.
Air France-KLM has long trailed the profitability of European rivals Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and British Airways parent IAG (L:ICAG).
But under Smith, who joined in 2018 from Air Canada, the Franco-Dutch group had struck productivity deals with its French pilots and begun to cut unit costs, a key aviation metric.
Unions have praised Smith's transparency. But cuts required to survive the coronavirus may yet test his approach and the labour peace it ushered in, after years of industrial action that culminated in the abrupt resignation of his predecessor.
""So far he has done OK at keeping the unions onside,"" aviation consultant John Strickland said. ""The question is whether he can build on that and convince them to go as far as possible.""
Competitors are moving faster to reduce workforce in the face of a travel slump that many now expect to last years. British Airways, Ryanair (I:RYA) and Virgin Atlantic have announced 18,000 job cuts between them.
Besides its powerful unions, Air France-KLM must answer to the French and Dutch governments, which each own close to 14% of the group and have pledged up to 11 billion euros ($11.88 billion) in rescue aid. Air France employs some 45,000 workers to KLM's 35,000.
CEO Smith said the French airline's relatively high average staff age would allow it to make the necessary cuts through voluntary redundancy plans, without announcing numbers up-front.
""There are a lot of people that are close to retirement, so we have that advantage,"" he said. ""In France you go to the GPEC, you explain the situation, you negotiate it with the unions and you put it into place - you don't just come out and say, 'I want to cut a thousand jobs.'""
Within months the Air France-KLM boss will present an updated strategy expected to accelerate the expansion of low-cost division Transavia and shrink Air France's money-losing domestic network, which lost 200 million euros last year.
""Ninety-five percent of the domestic routes do not make money,"" Smith said in his interview.
Structural fleet capacity will be cut by 20% by next year, the group said in its quarterly results announcement - offering a possible hint at the approximate scale of staff reductions.
Additional potential savings come from a combined fleet that includes dozens of older planes that could be withdrawn from service at little cost, Smith said.

The group also has ""a higher percentage of leased aircraft, which by default gives us more flexibility,"" he added. ""There's no writedown on a leased aeroplane.""

911,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>","Asia stocks get China trade relief, U.S. bonds face debt deluge","By Wayne Cole
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian shares pared early losses on Thursday after Chinese exports proved far stronger than even bulls had imagined, while U.S. bond investors were still daunted by the staggering amount of new debt set to be sold in coming weeks.
Beijing reported exports rose 3.5% in April on a year earlier, completely confounding expectations of a 15.1% fall and outweighing a 14.2% drop in imports.
The surprise stoked speculation the Asian giant could recover from its coronavirus lockdown quicker than first thought and support global growth in the process.
The news helped some regional markets steady after a shaky start with both Japan's Nikkei (N225) and South Korea (KS11) back to flat.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) eased 0.4%, led by a 0.3% dip in Chinese blue chips (CSI300).
E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 (ESc1) fared better with a bounce of 0.5%, while EUROSTOXX 50 futures (STXEc1) and FTSE futures (FFIc1) both firmed 0.2%. 
Markets had started cautiously with renewed Sino-U.S. tensions lurking in the background.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be able to report in about a week or two whether China is meeting its obligations under a trade deal, as Washington weighed punitive action against Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
The flow of economic data also remained grim, with U.S. private employers laying off 20 million workers in April.
Figures due later on Thursday are forecast to show initial jobless claims rose a further 3 million last week, while Friday's payrolls report is expected to see 22 million jobs lost and unemployment hit 16% or higher.
On Wall Street, energy and utility sectors were the main losers while demand for techs kept the Nasdaq in the black. 
The Dow (DJI) had ended down 0.91% and the S&P 500 (SPX) 0.70%, while the Nasdaq (IXIC) added 0.51%.
WORLD'S BIGGEST BORROWER
Bond markets saw one of the largest shifts in a while after the U.S. Treasury said it would borrow an astonishing $2.999 trillion during the June quarter, five times larger than the previous single-quarter record. 
It will sell $96 billion next week alone and a surprising amount of that will be at longer tenors, which in turn pushed up long-term yields and steepened the curve.
Yields on 30-year bonds (US30YT=RR) jumped 7 basis points to 1.40%, the largest daily increase since mid-March.
That rise gave a lift to the U.S. dollar on most currencies and its index firmed to 100.192 (=USD). The euro eased to $1.0800 (EUR=), hurt in part by a gloomy economic outlook from the European Commission.
Indeed, the single currency sank to its lowest against the Japanese yen since late 2016 at 114.40 (EURJPY=), and even the dollar touched a seven-week trough at 105.98 yen .
""There's a lot to like about the yen these days,"" said  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s global head of G10 FX Alan Ruskin.
He noted that with rates across the globe falling to all time lows, the yen no longer had a large yield disadvantage.
""Across all of 3m, 2y, 5y and long-end tenors, the average spread between yen rates and the average of G10 yields are at lows not seen for at least the last three decades,"" he said.
The yen was also cheap by many measures, he argued, with fair value put at around 85 per dollar.
In commodity markets, gold eased on expectations that supplies will grow as bullion refineries resume operations. The metal was last up 0.3% at $1,691.54 an ounce . 
Oil prices inched higher after a six-session streak of gains which saw Brent almost double since hitting a 21-year low in April. 

Brent crude (LCOc1) futures were last up 21 cents at $29.93 a barrel, while U.S. crude (CLc1) rose 12 cents to $24.11.

912,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 01:25AM ET</span>",Air France-KLM loss gives first taste of coronavirus impact,"PARIS (Reuters) - Two weeks of coronavirus shutdown were enough to hit Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) with an 815 million-euro ($880 million) first-quarter operating loss, the airline group said on Thursday - predicting demand could take ""several years"" to recover.
In the month of March there was an ""abrupt plunge in revenue that will obviously extend through the second quarter,"" Chief Financial Officer Frederic Gagey warned.
Many major airlines have sought government help as they struggle to slash costs and conserve cash in response to the unprecedented global crisis.
Air France-KLM, which has received 7 billion euros in French-backed rescue aid and Dutch pledges for a further 2 billion to 4 billion, expects to reduce monthly cash burn to 400 million euros in the second quarter thanks to cost-cutting and state-funded furloughs that save 350 million euros a month.
But operating losses will widen ""significantly"" in April-June with 95% of flights expected to remain grounded by a combination of travel restrictions designed to contain the pandemic and collapsed demand.
Capacity will still be down 80% in the third quarter, the group predicted, with customers returning only gradually.
Air France-KLM's revenue fell 15.5% to 5.02 billion euros in the first quarter. Its net loss widened to 1.8 billion euros from 324 million, also swollen by a 455 million-euro impact from over-hedged fuel.
While the initial virus outbreak in China impacted Asia traffic early in the quarter, the full effect of European lockdowns and travel bans was not felt until the second half of March.
The group now expects a full-year loss in operating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) - the first in its history, CFO Gagey said.
Demand is ""not expected to recover to pre-crisis levels before several years,"" the company also warned.

Formally withdrawing its pre-crisis 2020 guidance, Air France-KLM said it now planned to reduce its aircraft fleet by 20% in 2021. Chief Executive Ben Smith will present an updated ""transformation plan"" to investors within months, it said.

The company said it would take a phased approach to resuming its operations and that the plant was expected to be fully operational by late May.
The union representing plant employees at the South Dakota facility said earlier this week that Smithfield had resumed limited operations at the plant.
Last week, President Donald Trump ordered meat-processing plants to stay open to protect the food supply in the United States, despite concerns about coronavirus outbreaks, drawing a backlash from unions that said at-risk workers required more protection.

Tyson Fresh Meats, the beef and pork subsidiary of  Tyson Foods  (NYSE:TSN), said on Wednesday that it would resume production this week at its Iowa plant after an indefinite suspension of operations since April 22.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast (NASDAQ:SBGI) Group has agreed to pay a $48 million fine to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) resolving the probe into the company's abandoned deal to buy Tribune Media in what the agency said was its largest-ever civil penalty.
Sinclair Chief Executive Chris Ripley said in a statement on Wednesday the company was pleased with the resolution.
""Sinclair is committed to continue to interact constructively with all of its regulators to ensure full compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations,"" said Ripley, who is the company's president.
In June 2019, the FCC disclosed it had opened a new investigation into whether Sinclair engaged in misrepresentations or a lack of candor in the $3.9 billion Tribune deal. The civil penalty also resolves FCC investigations into whether the company met its obligations to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith and its failure to identify the sponsor of content, the FCC said.
The FCC said Sinclair, the second-largest television station operator, has agreed to ""abide by a strict compliance plan."" The penalty is twice the prior record for a broadcaster.
""Sinclair’s conduct during its attempt to merge with Tribune was completely unacceptable,"" said FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. ""Today’s penalty, along with the failure of the Sinclair/Tribune transaction, should serve as a cautionary tale to other licensees seeking commission approval of a transaction in the future.""
Pai rejected suggestions the FCC revoke Sinclair’s licenses.
Tribune terminated the sale of 42 TV stations in 33 markets to Sinclair, which owns or operates 191 stations, in August 2018. A month earlier the FCC questioned Sinclair’s candor over the planned sale of some stations and suggested Sinclair would effectively retain control over them.
The collapse of the deal, which was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, potentially ended Sinclair’s hopes of building a national conservative-leaning TV powerhouse that might have rivaled Fox Corp's Fox News.
Nexstar Media Group (NASDAQ:NXST) Inc acquired Tribune in a $4.1 billion deal in September.
Democrats accused Sinclair of slanting news coverage in favor of Republicans. Trump in 2018 criticized the Republican-led FCC for not approving the Tribune deal, saying on Twitter it ""would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People.""

In 2017, the FCC said it was fining Sinclair $13.38 million after it failed to properly disclose that paid programming that aired on local TV stations was sponsored by a cancer institute. That probe was also resolved as part of the settlement.

Ford's main joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd (SZ:000625) sold 20,465 vehicles in April, up 38.3% from the same period a year earlier, Changan said in a stock exchange filing on Wednesday.
Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) (SZ:000550), in which Ford owns a stake, said in a filing on Thursday that it sold 28,028 vehicles in April, up 7.8%. JMC sells Ford-branded sport-utility vehicles and vans as well as JMC-branded commercial vehicles.
Ford's China sales fell 34.9% to 88,770 vehicles in January-March. During that time, the government imposed restrictions on movement to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has led to over 4,000 deaths in world's second-biggest economy.
China's overall first-quarter vehicle sales fell 42%.

The two Chinese ventures of Ford rival General Motors Co (N:GM) also reported double-digit growth in April, when many of the government's movement restrictions were relaxed.

(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (O:TMUS) said on Wednesday it added more monthly bill paying phone subscribers than expected in the first quarter, thanks to a surge in demand for cheaper phone services as people work from home amid coronavirus lockdowns.
The telecoms operator said it was confident it would emerge strongly from the pandemic as it expects to lure customers from rivals with its lower priced services.
However, the company did not give a full-year outlook, citing uncertainty linked to the pandemic, following in the steps of its competitors AT&T Inc (N:T) and  Verizon Communications  (N:VZ). 
Shares rose 0.60% in after-market trading. 
T-Mobile added 452,000 net new monthly paying phone subscribers in the first quarter, above analysts' estimates of 426,000, according to research firm FactSet.
The company's postpaid phone churn, or the rate of customer cancellations, for the first-quarter was 0.86%, compared to 0.88% last year, reflecting store closures and nationwide stay-at-home orders. 
As millions of people in the United States have lost their jobs, T-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert said he expected budget-constrained customers to be attracted to the company's services.
""I expect that AT&T and Verizon customers will most certainly be looking to get out from under their high monthly bills in search of a better value,"" Sievert said during an earnings call. 
The company posted a marginal rise in revenue to $11.1 billion from a year earlier, but missed expectations of $11.4 billion.
T-Mobile had closed 80% of its stores to comply with the lockdowns. However, an increase in service revenue offset the fall in demand. 
The company said it was expanding its 5G rollout as demand continues to rise during the lockdowns and that it built over 1,000 network sites in April. T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said the network is ""growing like a weed."" 
The report was the first since T-Mobile closed its $23 billion merger with Sprint Corp in April and switched its executive leadership.
The company said the coronavirus pandemic would continue to negatively impact in the second quarter while it integrated Sprint's network. 
T-Mobile expects to add up to 150,000 net monthly phone subscribers in the second quarter. The company said that its merger-related costs would range from $500 million to $600 million before taxes and its COVID-19 pandemic-related costs would be between $450 million to $550 million before taxes.
Last week, T-Mobile said in a preliminary report that Sprint lost 348,000 monthly phone subscribers in the first quarter, more than double the amount of Sprint's subscriber losses from last year. 
The filing also said that Sprint defines subscribers differently from T-Mobile and that the Sprint results would be materially lower once T-Mobile reporting policies were applied. Sprint's standalone results for the first quarter are expected to be released in May.

(Reuters) - General Motors Co (N:GM) has tapped thermal camera maker Flir Systems Inc (O:FLIR) for scanners to detect fevers among workers when they return to GM's factories, the companies told Reuters on Wednesday.
General Motors said it will deploy a total of 377 Flir scanners across 72 sites. The cameras scan workers for high temperatures from several feet away in an effort to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The pandemic has shuttered many of GM's North American plants, but company officials on Wednesday outlined plans to restart production on May 18.
Jeffery Hess (NYSE:HES), GM's corporate medical director, told Reuters that when employees prepare to enter the factory floor, they will be required to sanitize their hands, don a mask and goggles, answer several questions about possible symptoms and then undergo a temperature check.
Once employees have been trained on the new entry procedure, the entire process takes between 30 and 45 seconds, GM officials said. At full operating levels, GM has about 85,000 employees in the United States, and when combined with contractors, about 100,000 people enter its plants each day.
“We can get a couple hundred people through the door rapidly"" using fever scanners, Hess said. “Some facilities have 1,000 people on a shift. That's a lot of people to get through the door.”
Hess said the company will use medical-grade thermometers to double-check any thermal temperature scans that come in over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Cameras are being combined with other measures such as giving workers time to sanitize their workstation each shift and social distancing measures, Hess said.
Until the coronavirus pandemic, the bulk of thermal camera sales were for military or industrial purposes. GM said 89 of its Flir scanners were devices it already had on hand for research or manufacturing operations that were being re-purposed.
But now sales are booming. Flir Chief Executive James J. Cannon said on the company's corporate earnings call Wednesday that Flir saw about $100 million in bookings for coronavirus-related cameras and sensors. Reuters previously reported Flir was working with Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) to supply fever scanners, but Flir said it could not comment on any potential relationship with Amazon.
Thermoteknix Systems Ltd from the United Kingdom has won deals with  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), and Santa Barbara, California-based Seek Thermal said sales in the first four months of 2020 were two-and-a-half times that of the previous year.

""Hopefully, it will keep people who really do have a fever from going to work sick,"" Seek co-founder Bill Parrish told Reuters.

The strong results validated heightened expectations after analysts hailed Peloton, known for its $2,200 exercise bikes, as one of the few companies to benefit from prolonged lockdowns and a shift in consumer behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
With gyms and fitness clubs closed, Peloton has also become a hot topic across the internet. Online searches for ""Peloton"" nearly tripled since the end of February, according to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Trends, while its stock price gained 36% in the same period.
Sales of Peloton's electric bikes and other fitness equipment jumped nearly 61% to $420.2 million in its fiscal third quarter ended March 31. Its subscribers, who shell out $12.99 per month for live online exercise sessions, almost doubled to over 886,100.
""The extraordinary events taking place over the past two months have measurably expanded our market opportunity and accelerated the ongoing shift to connected fitness,"" Chief Financial Officer Jill Woodworth said on a post earnings call.
Executives also added that the current norm of social distancing and working from home was permanently influencing consumer behavior.
The loss-making company said it entered the fourth quarter with a backlog of bike deliveries in all geographies, and that its sales continue to surpass expectations.
Peloton forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $500 million to $520 million, well above the average analyst estimate of $383.26 million, but said it would incur higher costs to expedite shipments of equipment that was delayed due to the unexpected sharp increase in demand.
For the full year, it forecast revenue to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.74 billion, compared with an earlier forecast of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion.
The company also raised its outlook for Connected Fitness subscribers, or paid subscribers, for the year to 1.04 million to 1.05 million, from its previous estimate of 920,000 to 930,000.
In the reported third quarter, Peloton's total revenue surged 65.6% to $524.6 million, handily beating analysts' estimates of $487.7 million.

However, net loss attributable to Class A and Class B shareholders increased to $55.6 million, or 20 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $38.6 million, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the company to post a loss of 17 cents.

The bank’s board left its key rate at 0.5% -- matching a record low -- at its meeting Wednesday, and signaled that monetary policy will remain expansive for a long time to support the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
“The board’s decision to maintain the rate at its technical minimum of 0.5% is consistent with the need for monetary policy to remain in this highly expansive mode for an extended period of time to ensure the convergence of inflation to the 3% target over a two-year horizon,” the central bank said in its statement.
Chile’s businesses were already reeling from months of social unrest when the virus struck, causing a crash in consumer spending and hurting demand for the nation’s copper exports. The central bank said last month it sees the economy shrinking as much as 2.5% this year, which would be its worst performance since 1983.
The International Monetary Fund’s estimate is for an even deeper contraction, of 4.5%. Other major economies in the region such as Brazil and Mexico will fare even worse, according to the fund.
The Chilean peso has weakened 19% over the last year, while the benchmark stock index fell to levels last seen in 2009.

Chile’s policy makers have cut the benchmark interest rate by 1.25 percentage points over the last two months, are buying local bank bonds to boost liquidity and lower borrowing costs, while also intervening in the foreign exchange market. “The board will evaluate options to intensify the monetary impulse and support financial stability through unconventional instruments if required,” the central bank said in its statement.
At the same time, the government has promised fiscal stimulus measures equivalent to about 7% of gross domestic product.
“Today the problem isn’t the interest rate,” said former central bank chief Vittorio Corbo in a phone interview before Wednesday’s decision. “The central bank has been very aggressive in Chile. A lot of the operations of the central bank have to do more with getting credit moving and getting liquidity in the system.”

The former employees, both of whom lost their jobs on Wednesday, and one employee who retained her post, said they had been told that about 40% of staff in Uber's Egypt offices had been laid off.
That was out of a total headcount of 650-700, they said.
It came as Uber announced it would cut about 3,700 full-time jobs globally, affecting 17% of its employee count. 
An Uber spokesman declined to share details of the layoffs in Egypt but said a total of 46 countries had been affected by the changes.
Egypt, with a swelling population of more than 100 million, is the biggest market in the Middle East for ride-hailing services and has been among Uber's top 10 markets globally.
The country has taken a series of measures to curtail the spread of the new coronavirus, including a night curfew and the closure of schools and mosques.
However, the government has stopped short of imposing a lockdown, and taxis have continued to operate during the day.

923,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2020 06:27PM ET</span>","In a Gloomy Oil Market, India Pump Prices Echo $100-Plus Crude","(Bloomberg) -- Crude oil has plummeted to about $30 a barrel from $115 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first came to power six years ago, but Indian consumers are yet to enjoy the benefits of the plunge.
Modi’s administration has repeatedly raised taxes on fuel to cushion worsening public finances. Diesel in the country’s capital now costs 20% more than it did in 2014, with levies accounting for nearly half the retail price, while gasoline is roughly priced the same as under Modi’s predecessor.
Higher prices help avoid unnecessary use of the polluting fuel, authorities have said in the past. But, as consumption takes a dangerous dip amid the coronavirus lockdown, reducing costs could have helped citizens -- from factory owners to farmers -- at a time when millions have lost their jobs and are living on handouts from the government or the charity of neighbors.
The latest increase came close to midnight on Tuesday, when the federal government imposed an additional levy of 13 rupees per liter on diesel and 10 rupees on gasoline. Pump prices will, however, not change, the government said. That means fuel retailers like Indian Oil Corp., Bharat Petroleum Corp. and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. would have to absorb the higher duties. The companies’ shares plunged.
Taxes collected by the federal government on diesel have swelled by seven times in the last six years while those on gasoline have nearly tripled over the same period. Brent crude is trading at about $31 a barrel, after recovering from a more than 18-year low of $19.33 on April 21.
The steep increase in taxes on the two fuels, which account for more than half of India’s oil demand, comes at a time when demand has plunged by about 70% following the world’s biggest lockdown. Asia’s third-largest economy is seen hurtling toward its first full-year contraction since 1980, as several businesses shut, forcing 122 million people out of work last month.

While withdrawing its forecast for two- to three-year sales growth, Domino's said U.S. same-store sales were up 7.1% in late March and much of April, as diners under lockdown ordered home delivery more often.
Domino's kept company-owned U.S. stores open but said about 1,750 international stores were temporarily closed.
Shares of companies joining the S&P 500 often rise because many large investors track the index and must buy shares of new entrants. Domino's is replacing apparel maker Capri Holdings Ltd (N:CPRI) in the S&P 500.

 DexCom  Inc (O:DXCM), which designs glucose monitoring systems, is also joining the index. It replaces Allergan Plc (N:AGN), which is being acquired by another S&P 500 pharmaceutical company,  AbbVie Inc  (N:ABBV).

928,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>","Lyft sees rider demand improve in late April, 'on path to profitability'","By Akanksha Rana and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) -  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) on Wednesday posted higher-than-expected revenue and the ride-hailing company vowed further cost cuts to become profitable, saying ridership hit by the coronavirus pandemic had improved in late April.
Shares in Lyft rose over 18% in after-hours trading, but shares are still less than half the $72 price from their initial public offering last year. Shares of larger rival  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) were up 9%. 
The first-quarter results offer a first look at the impact of strict stay-at-home orders to combat the spread of the virus in many of the ride-hailing industry's largest markets. 
Lyft's earnings also serve as an indicator for the performance of Uber, which will report results on Thursday. 
For April, rides were down 75% year over year but Chief Executive Logan Green said Lyft saw moderate week-on-week growth in ride requests starting in mid-April. 
In the United States, rides rose 21% in the first week of May compared with a low point on April 12.
Ridership grew 25% in Atlanta, 35% in Chicago, 29% in Houston, 39% in New Orleans, 22% in New York City and 25% in Seattle between the week ended April 5 versus the week ended May 3. 
Based on April volumes, Lyft expects a second-quarter loss of less than $360 million before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
Green said Lyft had stopped virtually all ride discounts and would be able to reduce costly driver incentives as many unemployed Americans looked for work. About two-thirds of all costs are variable, he said, allowing the company to reduce losses as ridership drops. Green said competitors had also stopped offering rider discounts in recent months.
The company did not say whether it stuck to its goal of being profitable on an adjusted basis by the end of 2021 but on Wednesday said cost cuts would help it on the ""path to profitability.""
Lyft on Wednesday said first-quarter revenue rose by 23% to $955.7 million from the previous year, well ahead of a $884.7 million estimate by Refinitiv.
Loss-making Lyft had originally forecasted revenue of roughly $1 billion for the first three months of 2020.
The company's active ridership base increased by 3% to 21,200, while revenue per active rider increased by 19%. 
Unlike Uber, Lyft only operates in the United States and parts of Canada, where many states imposed lockdown restrictions towards the end of March. 
But while Lyft has been strictly focused on moving people, Uber might be able to recuperate some lost ride-hailing revenue through its food delivery business. Green said Lyft had no interest in launching a food delivery business.
Customers in the United States provide the bulk of revenue to both companies and the most damaging fallout for the ride-hailing industry is expected in the second quarter of this year. Lyft on Wednesday did not provide a forecast for the second quarter.
Green in a statement said the company was prepared to weather the crisis.
""We are responding to the pandemic with an aggressive cost reduction plan that will give us an even leaner expense structure and allow us to emerge stronger,"" Green said.
The company said it had $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and said it would remove some $300 million in expenses by the end of the year.
While total costs and expenses fell about 29% to $1.37 billion year-over-year, cost of revenue in the first quarter increased by roughly 17%.

Lyft last week withdrew its full-year guidance and announced a 17% staff cut and implemented pay cuts in response to the crisis.

929,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Brazil Cuts Key Rate to 3% And Anticipates More Easing Ahead,"(Bloomberg) -- Brazil cut its interest rate by three-quarters of a point to a record low, boosting the pace of monetary easing as the coronavirus pandemic shreds inflation pressures and lands a historic blow to Latin America’s largest economy.
The central bank’s board, led by its President Roberto Campos Neto, on Wednesday lowered the Selic to 3% in its seventh straight reduction, as forecast by only eight of 37 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Twenty-eight analysts expected a drop of 50 basis points, while one saw no change.
The board anticipated one ``final monetary adjustment, not larger than this one,'' to conclude its current monetary easing cycle, according to a statement accompanying its decision.
Brazil joins peers from Mexico to the Philippines in pumping more monetary stimulus amid a rapidly worsening outlook. The virus has undercut demand by crushing confidence and also hurt supply by closing factories. Analysts expect the economy posted deflation in April, and that consumer prices will end this year at least half a percentage point below the floor of the target range.
“Since the last meeting in March, the balance of risks deteriorated all around,” Newton Rosa, chief economist at Sul America Investimentos Dtvm, said before the announcement. “In the second quarter, we will probably have our worst GDP reading in history.”
On April 20, Campos Neto underscored a sharp downturn in growth prospects while saying low borrowing costs can still stimulate the economy. Organizations such as the International Monetary Fund expect Brazil’s economy to contract 5.3% as the unemployment rate approaches 15%.
Still, policy makers must also navigate a fresh bout of political tensions which include criminal accusations against President Jair Bolsonaro and the departure of two of his key ministers.

Investing.com - Stocks suffered a late selloff today after President Donald Trump told reporters that he wasn’t sure if China would live up to its part of the Phase 1 trade agreement.
But apart from the renewed trade tensions, the market was struggling to find a bid (apart from tech) after a report showed more than 20 million private sector jobs were lost in April.
More jobs numbers come in Thursday, a day before the big payrolls report.
There will also be more ride-haling earnings from Uber following  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT)'s strong report and the Bank of England has its big day.
Here are three things that could move the market tomorrow.
1. More Data From the Jobs Front
After today’s dire reading on private payrolls, two more employment indicators arrive ahead of trading tomorrow.
The Labor Department reports weekly jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that claims for first-time unemployment benefits rose by another 3 million last week. That would continue the downward trend of rises in claims, down from 3.8 million the week before.
At 7:30 AM ET, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas will issue its measure of April job cuts.
Cuts should soar again from the March measure of about 222,000, moving into the millions.
2. Uber to Report Following Layoffs
Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) will report earnings after the bell tomorrow, a day after it announced massive layoffs due to the impact of the virus on its business.
Uber said it is cutting 3,700 jobs in customer support and recruitment as it looks to cut costs as ride volumes crater. The company will incur a charge of about $20 million associated with the layoffs.
Analysts predict that Uber lost 84 cents per share in its latest quarter on revenue of about $3.5 billion.
Ahead of trading, drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) will weigh in with quarterly results.
The company is forecast to report a profit of $1.51 per share on revenue of about $9.5 billion.
3. BoE Decision Day
The Bank of England meets tomorrow, with its decision on interest rates and bond buying and its economic forecasts coming earlier than usual.
The BoE announcement comes at 2:00 AM ET (06:00 GMT).
The bank is expected to keep rates on hold, but may tweak its bond-buying program.
""We’d expect the Bank of England to also push back on the idea of a ‘V-shaped’ recovery this week,"" ING said.
ING estimates the UK economy will experience a 10% to 15% peak-to-trough fall in output, though said it wouldn’t be surprised if the bank penciled in a sharper decline."

Investing.com - Ride-sharing company  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) surged in after-hours trade on Wednesday as its first-quarter results were better than many had feared as higher margins eased the impact of the coronavirus-led slowdown in demand toward the end of the quarter.   
The company reported a first-quarter loss per share of $1.31 on revenue of $955.7 million, beating Wall Street estimates for a loss of $1.36 a share on revenue of $830.18 million. Lyft reported Q1 revenue of $955.7 million versus $776.0 million in the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 23% year over year.

939,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Some U.S. city transit agencies turn to Uber as ridership drops during coronavirus crisis,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - U.S. cities that have idled mass transit during coronavirus lockdowns are turning to an unusual partner to get essential workers to hospitals, warehouses and factories: ride-hailing company Uber.
Long criticized by officials in large U.S. cities for siphoning off transit riders and clogging up streets, some less-dense cities with reduced transit ridership are now turning to the Silicon Valley-based company to fill transportation gaps.
A handful of transit agencies are paying  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) and subsidizing rider costs during the pandemic to offer transportation at off-peak hours or in less busy areas.
Some give monthly bus-pass holders a limited number of Uber rides, others cover the entire cost for regular Uber rides to and from essential workplaces.
The model makes sense financially, as cities are able to offload insurance and fuel costs associated with maintaining nearly empty bus routes to Uber and its drivers, according to interviews with three transportation officials.
""A bus costs around $150 an hour to operate and you might have a route with only five boardings an hour. I'd rather move that bus to a corridor with 40 boardings an hour,"" said Alice Bravo, director of transportation and public works for Miami-Dade County, which offers fully subsidized Uber and  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) rides along the routes of nine bus lines that have been suspended at night.
The new partnerships come at a time when Uber is grappling with a slump in demand across the United States, its largest market, due to stay-at-home orders. Data from analysts and interviews with drivers suggest trip requests in some cities were down by as much as 80% in April.
While an Uber spokesman said the initiative was not a significant revenue stream compared to Uber's pre-coronavirus business, it underscores the company's ambitions to expand further into the public transportation sector.
Uber currently integrates transit information from more than a dozen cities worldwide and allows passengers in Denver and Las Vegas to purchase transit tickets through its app.
In its latest initiative, Uber is working with transit officials in Miami-Dade County; Indianapolis, Indiana; Livermore, California; Des Moines, Iowa; and Central Midlands, South Carolina.
Transit ridership has plummeted around 70% in most U.S. cities during the virus outbreak, forcing route reductions and less frequent service. Systems have also grappled with staff shortages as many operators and maintenance workers have taken medical leave to quarantine.
""As we were considering how to balance our resources, we had some areas that we wouldn't have been able to service anymore, so we started talking to Uber,"" said Luis Montoya, chief planning officer at Des Moines Area Rapid Transit (DART).
While ridership decreased by up to 90% on some routes, Montoya said, DART noticed that many of those still commuting were going to work at hospitals, manufacturers and grocery distributors. In collaboration with local companies, the agency created a voucher system for Uber and local taxi rides on fixed routes to designated businesses.
Indianapolis officials set up a similar system after Uber reached out. Essential workers had to register for the service and for the price of their monthly transit pass can now book one daily Uber round-trip to and from work.
The service, which started on April 23, is also allowing the city to gather valuable data on transit gaps, said Inez Evans, the chief executive and president of IndyGo.
Evans plans to continue supplementing some routes with Uber even after the crisis, saying that fixed bus lines made sense for the most frequently used routes but were not efficient in less traveled areas. IndyGo is evaluating how to structure its Uber program in the long-term.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.91%%, the S&P 500 slipped 0.70%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 0.51%.
The underlying strength of the economy was given another gut check on Wednesday, as ADP reported that private labor jobs fell by 20.2 million last month, the worst decline on record.
The weakness in the labor market has added to investor fears the consumer will be cautious on spending at a time when many hope the lifting of restrictions around the country will kickstart economic growth.
Worries that the U.S. and China could be headed for a fresh collision course on trade also weighed on sentiment, with President Donald Trump expected to provide an update next week on whether China is sticking to its agreements under phase one trade deal agreed last year.
The update will come against the backdrop of the rising U.S.-Sino tensions as the Trump administration has threatened to impose tariffs on Beijing for its handling of the coronavirus.
Utilities, which usually serve as the defensive corner of the market, were among the worst hit, paced by declines from NiSource (NYSE:NI) and  American Electric  Power (NYSE:AEP) amid weaker-than-expected quarterly results.
The ongoing climb tech stocks, however, led by FAANG - with the exception of Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - and chip stocks limited downside momentum in the broader market.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbed 1%, led by a surge in KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC), Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT).

General Motors (NYSE:GM) rose 3% after reporting first-quarter earnings that topped consensus estimates.
Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) rallied 6.6% after the declines in same-restaurant sales narrowed each week through April, while first-quarter results slowed from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) jumped 7.28% as revenue topped estimates amid a surge in demand for e-commerce as the pandemic has shuttered offline businesses.
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) reported revenue that topped estimates, but the social media company warned on gross margins as advertising income slowed in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, sending its shares 15% lower.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big gains in small caps stocks are fueling hopes that a bounce in broader equity markets may stick, as investors ponder how quickly the U.S. economy can emerge from its coronavirus-fueled slowdown. 
The small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT) rose 13.7% in April, besting the benchmark S&P 500's (SPX) 12.7% gain. Notably, the Russell's rally accelerated at the end of the month, when it notched six straight days with gains of at least 1%, its longest streak of such gains in two decades. 
That outperformance is a good sign to some investors, who believe that domestically-focused small cap stocks tend to be more sensitive to economic fluctuations and are among the first areas of the market to reflect both downturns and rebounds. The index took an outsized hit as stocks tumbled earlier in the year amid concerns over how countrywide lockdowns would impact U.S. growth, with the Russell 2000 falling as much as 42% from its highs, compared to a nearly 34% drop for the S&P. 
The spotlight on small caps comes as investors digest a bounce that has lifted the S&P 500 more than 28% from its March lows, and U.S. states try to gradually reopen their economies without stoking a resurgence of coronavirus cases. 
""People are believing that at some point in the third quarter we are going to get back to some semblance of what life was prior to all of this,"" said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) in New York. 
Subsiding volatility is another positive sign for small caps, said Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivative strategist at BTIG in New York. The spread between the Russell 2000 Volatility index (RVX) and the S&P 500 Volatility index (VIX) has narrowed after hitting a high in April, though it remains elevated in historical terms, he said. 
Small cap stocks have tended to outperform their larger peers six to 12 months after volatility declines from extreme levels, Emanuel said.

Smaller stocks still have some headwinds to battle, as data is likely to remain dismal through the second quarter, potentially putting profits at risk for a number of companies. Wednesday's release of the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report, which showed private employers laid off a record 20.236 million workers in April, was a stark reminder of the road ahead.
Nearly one-third of companies in the Russell 2000 are unprofitable, and the number is likely to increase as they use cash to stay in business as the economy struggles to regain its footing, according to the  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Investment Institute.
But even as growing optimism over the reopening of the economy has helped stocks surge, not all analysts are convinced the gains will keep coming. 
""We have just gotten into the recession as well as the earnings contraction,"" said Chris Haverland, global asset allocation strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in Winston Salem, North Carolina. ""The markets have gotten ahead of themselves given all the negative economic and earnings news that is going to be coming out in the next few months."" 
The upcoming weeks could go a long way to determining whether small caps can extend their gains, as several states such as Georgia, Florida and California begin to reopen their economies. Signs that officials may need to reverse reopenings in the event of a virus resurgence would likely endanger the rally in small caps. 
Nearly 135,000 Americans could die from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, by early August, almost double prior projections, as social-distancing measures for curbing the pandemic are increasingly eased, such as those on restaurants and retail stores, health researchers said Monday. 
""From our point of view, that sort of uncertainty is likely to put the brakes on this rally, at least in the near term,"" said BTIG's Emanuel.

While the Governing Council hasn’t decided on a plan to respond to Tuesday’s ruling, which declared the ECB’s biggest bond-buying program potentially unconstitutional, members are split on who takes the lead, according to people familiar with the matter.
Some see the issue as a domestic matter to be mainly resolved between the Bundesbank and the German government, the people said on condition of anonymity.
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann, on the other hand, said in his official statement that his central bank would “support” the Governing Council’s efforts, suggesting that he thinks the ECB should be at the forefront.
Spokespeople for the ECB and the Bundesbank declined to comment on the issue.
Taking Note
The ruling has sparked fears it could undermine the ECB’s efforts to prop up the euro-area economy. While the judges said their decision doesn’t affect the central bank’s emergency program to fight the coronavirus pandemic, it clearly calls into question how far bond-buying programs can go.
The initial response by the Governing Council after a call on Tuesday evening was to say it “takes note” of the judgment while also pointing to a 2018 ruling in its favor by the European Union’s top court.
Yet one overarching concern among policy makers is that the decision has thrust the ECB into uncharted territory. Some even wondered whether the pandemic emergency program could now become another target of litigation, the people said.
Officials left the call with little practical sense of how the ECB should address the court’s request to justify their policy within three months.
The virtual meeting, which featured presentations from Weidmann and lawyers, focused mainly on explaining the ruling rather than coming up with solutions, the people said. The decision on who should respond was seen as too controversial to tackle at this point, one of them said.
One thing they did agree on was that the ECB has made sufficient effort to explain its policies since launching the quantitative-easing program in question in 2015.
While providing a justification would be largely a matter of compiling that material in a single accessible form, there were reservations over whether that’s the best way forward.
Another approach that some policy makers say might work is for Weidmann to appear in front of the German parliament to explain the decision.
However, the Bundesbank chief was clear during his presentation that the response should be prepared by the Governing Council, some of the people said.

Investing.com – The Dow swung between gains and losses on Wednesday as investors weighed up further signs of trouble in the labor market against mostly bullish earnings and efforts on opening the U.S. economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.08%%, the S&P 500 gained 0.08%, while the Nasdaq Composite added 1.16%.
Just days ahead of the crucial nonfarm payrolls data, ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) reported jobs in the private labor market fell by 20.2 million last month, the worst decline on record, serving as a stark reminder that the economy, and in particular the strength of the consumer, is unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon even as the U.S. begins to reopen.
Ongoing appetite for tech stocks, however, led by FAANG and chip stocks kept the broader market in check.
The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbed 2%, led by a surge in KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC), Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT).
On the earnings front, meanwhile, investors digested mostly bullish quarterly results from corporates.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) rose 4% after reporting first-quarter earnings that topped consensus estimates.
Wendy’s (NASDAQ:WEN) rallied 7.6% after the declines in same-restaurant sales narrowed each week through April, while first-quarter results slowed from the Covid-19 pandemic.
Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) jumped 7% as revenue topped estimates amid a surge in demand for e-commerce as the pandemic has shuttered offline businesses.
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) reported revenue that topped estimates, but the social media company warned on gross margins as advertising income slowed in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, sending its shares 14.4% lower.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday voted to order exchanges and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to create a new governance plan for the dissemination of stock market data needed for trading.
The creation of the new plan will increase transparency and address inefficiencies, conflicts of interest and other issues around the dissemination of real-time, consolidated stock market data, which is currently governed by three separate plans, the SEC said.
The regulator tasked the exchanges and FINRA, collectively known as self-regulatory organizations (SROs), with creating a single governance plan that will reduce the influence of large exchange groups in decision-making around the data, in part by giving a bigger say to non-exchange participants.
The SROs were put in charge of the data feeds, which show current best prices and last trades for stocks, before exchanges were for-profit companies. The rules were last updated in 2005.
Since then, exchanges have created faster, more sophisticated proprietary data feeds that compete with the public feeds. Many larger brokers say they need to pay for the private data feeds, which are often more expensive than the public feeds, in order to remain competitive, and that this has created a two-tiered market.
""The significant conflicts and potential conflicts between the exchanges' business interests in proprietary data offerings and their obligations as self-regulatory organizations to ensure prompt, accurate, reliable, and fair dissemination of consolidated market data through the jointly administered equity data plans, need to be addressed,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said.
The SROs now must file a new plan within 90 days, which will then be published for public comment before the SEC takes it into consideration.
Separately, on Feb. 14 the SEC proposed adding more stock price information to public feeds and allowing other firms to compete against the exchanges in running them.
Some exchanges had asked the SEC for more time to consider the proposals, in part because their focus has been on keeping the markets operating during unprecedented volumes and shelter-in-place orders due to the coronavirus pandemic.
""We have serious concerns about reforms that give huge amounts of power to banks and prop traders, who are highly conflicted on the question of market data,"" said Nandini Sukumar, chief executive of the World Federation of Exchanges trade group. ""This proposal and another pending one on market data are being rushed through while everyone is grappling with a once-in-a-generation economic crisis. Why?""

That’s according to a new survey from the Society for Human Resource Management which found that 52% expect to be out of business within six months. The survey of 375 firms was conducted between April 15-21 and doesn’t account for improved business conditions as some U.S. states reopen this month.
“SHRM has tracked Covid-19’s impact on work, workers, and the workplace for months,” said SHRM Chief Executive Officer Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., “but these might be the most alarming findings to date. Small business is truly the backbone of our economy. So, when half say they’re worried about being wiped out, let’s remember: We’re talking about roughly 14 million businesses.”
Just over a third of small firms expect that they can continue to operate more that 6 months, while 14% are uncertain, according to the survey. About one quarter of firms have seen revenues rise or remain unchanged in recent months.
Among employees, hourly workers were hit hardest with eight in 10 firms cutting those positions, while 60% of surveyed businesses laid off salaried workers. A third of the companies polled by the advocacy group expected their payroll reductions to be permanent.

(Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 rose modestly on Wednesday, with gains in technology shares offsetting declines in financials and defensive groups as data showing U.S. private employers laid off 20 million workers in April underscored the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose over 1% while the Dow eked out a gain.
Four of the 11 major S&P sectors were positive, with tech leading. Financials and other cyclical groups, which often outperform when the economic outlook improves, declined. 
Gains in shares of Microsoft (O:MSFT), Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN) were among those providing the biggest lifts to the S&P 500.
""The leadership has come from stocks that benefit from stay-at-home economy,"" said Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers. ""For the most part people are hedging their bets, increasing their exposure to companies such as Amazon and Microsoft.""
U.S. private employers laid off a record 20.236 million workers in April as mandatory business closures in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak savaged the economy.
The Labor Department's more comprehensive report for April is due on Friday.
""It’s one thing to talk about big job losses...but to see it all in one spot, I think that has been some reason for pause,"" said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 22.95 points, or 0.1%, to 23,906.04, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 9.31 points, or 0.32%, to 2,877.75 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 122.14 points, or 1.39%, to 8,931.26.
Stocks have rebounded sharply since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak.
""States can declare themselves open all they want. If people aren’t comfortable going out of their houses, then they’re not going to do anything,"" Delwiche said. “The evidence of activity resuming is as important as states declaring themselves open.”
In company news, General Motors Co (N:GM) jumped 5.1% after the automaker topped first-quarter profit expectations and outlined plans for a May 18 restart of most of its North American plants.
Occidental Petroleum Corp (N:OXY) shares fell 8.9% after the company said it was looking to raise new cash or swap debt for stock, a day after it posted a large first-quarter loss.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by a 1.72-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.08-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - At least two Brazilian airlines and planemaker Embraer SA (SA:EMBR3) have hired investment banks to help with talks with state development bank BNDES for government support, sources with knowledge of the matter said.
Embraer has hired Itau BBA, the investment banking unit of Itau Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4), two sources said. 
Embraer is seeking credit lines between $1 billion and $1.5 billion after a deal with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) fell through.
Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported earlier on Wednesday that Embraer hired Itau BBA.
Embraer and BNDES did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Itau BBA is also advising airline  Azul SA  (N:AZUL) on negotiations with BNDES, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Azul did not immediately comment. Itau declined to comment on both mandates. 
Azul had hired previously restructuring specialists for talks with its creditors, including banks, suppliers and lessors of its planes. All payments were suspended. Restructuring boutique Galeazzi & Associados is leading the restructuring work at Azul.
Santiago-based  Latam Airlines  Group SA (SN:LTM) has retained investment bank  Banco BTG Pactual  SA (SA:BPAC3) as adviser on talks with BNDES, two of the sources added, mainly focused on discussing on the convertible debt equation.
Both Azul and Latam Airlines did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
BNDES is expected to finish this month negotiations with airlines and Embraer for a rescue package that may reach $2.5 billion.
Most of it is likely to be provided by BNDES, as private lenders have been resisting extending loans to airlines, an industry in which their current exposure is small, two sources said.
BNDES was initially considering conceding loans to airlines equivalent to half of the amount they require, which is around $2 billion, with the remaining part been provided by Brazil's largest lenders, such as Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), Itau Unibanco Holding SA (SA:ITUB4) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB3). Banks, however, rejected the plan and all parties are trying to reach an agreement.
BNDES support package to airlines will mix credit lines with convertible instruments that may give the bank a stake in the companies.

(Reuters) - British department store group Debenhams said it will shut down five of its stores in  Hammerson  (L:HMSO) leading to potentially 1,400 job cuts, as it failed to agree rent terms with the mall operator.
Retail property owners and tenants have been working together to defer rent payments and find other solutions that allow shops, businesses and landlords to ride out the coronavirus shutdown.
""We can confirm that despite our best efforts, we have been unable to agree terms with Hammerson on our five stores in its shopping centres, and so they will not be reopening"", Debenhams said in a statement. 
""We continue to engage in constructive talks with our landlords and have agreed terms on the vast majority of our stores, which we look forward to reopening when government restrictions allow"".
With Britain in lockdown during the pandemic, Debenhams' 142 UK stores are closed, while the majority of its 22,000 workers are being paid under the government's furlough scheme. The company continues to trade online.
Debenhams' spokesman said the company would shut down stores in Hammerson's centres, including Bullring and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). 
The likely 6% cut in its workforce comes as the retailer went into administration last month for the second time in a year, seeking to protect itself from legal action by creditors during the pandemic that could have pushed it into liquidation.
The news is an additional blow to Hammerson, whose shares hit an all-time low after it terminated a 400 million pound($497.20 million) deal to sell its retail parks to private equity firm Orion on Wednesday. 
They were the top loser on the STOXX 600 (STOXX) index. Shares of the company have dropped more than 80% since late December.
Last month, an industry body said that British retailers suffered their biggest fall in sales since the 2008 financial crisis in the first half of April as the pandemic kept shoppers at home and forced store closures.
Fashion retailers Oasis Warehouse Group and  Laura Ashley Holdings  (L:ALY) also went into administration in recent months.

Shares of Hammerson, which received only 37% of its UK rent billed for Q2, fell more than 12% on Wednesday.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Investment firm Bow Street Capital said on Wednesday it wants to replace the chief executive of Mack-Cali Realty (NYSE:CLI) Corp, streamline the real-estate investment trust's residential assets and cut debt after its stock price tumbled 37% in the last year.
Bow Street, which owns 4.5% of Mack-Cali's stock and won board seats last year, is back with a proposal to install more directors and a plan to improve operations.
The investment firm wrote to shareholders on Wednesday that it is interviewing potential candidates to replace CEO Michael DeMarco and that several Bow Street director candidates have the necessary experience to become interim CEO.
""After decades of underperformance and mismanagement, new leadership is required to create value at Mack-Cali,"" Bow Street partners Akiva Katz and Howard Shainker wrote in the letter. They blame DeMarco, who has been CEO since 2017, for an ""incoherent asset mix"" and using too much debt.
Bow Street wants to streamline the company's residential assets and prepare for a spin-off at some point, and cut debt by using the proceeds from asset sales.
A spokesman for Mack-Cali declined to comment.
Bow Street blames the board for signing off on DeMarco's pay package, which has totaled $28.2 million since 2015. For 2020, DeMarco's pay stands at $9.0 million, marking more than a 120% increase from his 2016 compensation, the letter said.
""Legacy directors have gone to extraordinary lengths to protect Mr. DeMarco and the status quo,"" the letter said.
Bow Street first called for DeMarco's ouster nearly two months ago when the firm laid the groundwork for a second proxy contest within two years. 
Katz and Shainker have nominated four new directors, including Katz, to run this year to reinforce the four Bow Street directors elected last year to Mack-Cali's 11-member board. Bow Street is also nominating the directors who were elected last year because the company, in an unusual step, is not putting them up for re-election.
The fight is noteworthy because the two sides appear ready to proceed to a vote at Mack-Cali's annual meeting in June.
The coronavirus outbreak has prompted many other shareholders and companies in recent week to settle their differences quickly to let management teams return to running their companies.

Some shareholders and investor advisory groups had highlighted ahead of the meeting what they regarded as excessive awards for Ocado's executives in 2019. Ocado says its rewards are justified because it created 7.5 billion pounds of value for shareholders in the five years to 2019.
Ocado said 29.76% of votes cast at the annual general meeting (AGM) were against the resolution to approve the directors' remuneration report, while 70.24% were in favour.
Shareholders who voted against the pay report included Royal London Asset Management and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK). Some 19.65% of votes cast also opposed the re-election of Andrew Harrison as a director. Harrison chairs Ocado's remuneration committee.
Ocado's AGM was not attended by investors, who had to vote by proxy because of the coronavirus lockdown in Britain.
Earlier, Ocado said it had seen retail revenue soar 40.4% year-on-year in its second quarter to date as it ramped up capacity to meet unprecedented demand during the country's coronavirus lockdown.

Like peers across Europe, Renault is gradually ramping up production after stoppages linked to the outbreak, as governments begin to ease some lockdown rules.
Inside the Flins factory northwest of Paris, where Renault makes its electric Zoe models and the Micra car for its partner Nissan (OTC:NSANY), sanitary protocols now restrict even the way coffee breaks are held - in a glimpse of measures to expect in other industries as shutdowns are further lifted. 
Most retailers are due to reopen in France from May 11, while factories turning out trains and luxury goods are starting up again too. 
At Flins on Wednesday, workers wound their way through tents at the entrance, where thermal scanners took their temperature. 
Equipped with gloves and masks, employees took their place at marked out spots on the assembly line, and followed instructions to spray down their tools with disinfectant at the end of their shift. 
During a 15 minute pause, colleagues chatted across the plexiglass shields separating them on tables of four. 
While the measures have allowed Renault to get manufacturing off the ground again, it is still unclear when it might return to business as usual.
The health crisis has clobbered auto demand and dealerships are still closed in many countries, with car sales points only due to start reopening in France from next week. 
Renault in particular was already struggling with faltering demand before the coronavirus crisis and looking to cost cuts.
""For the moment, we're only working at half of our normal production capacity,"" Jean-Luc Mabire, the head of the Flins factory told reporters. This was on account of health measures, he said, with only one shift operating a day instead of two to limit overlaps.

960,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2020 01:27PM ET</span>",Here’s How Boris Johnson Is Planning to Lift the U.K.’s Lockdown,"(Bloomberg) --
Prime Minister Boris Johnson put the U.K. into lockdown on March 23, telling everyone to stay at home unless they needed to go out for food or exercise, and to work from home if they could.
With the economy reeling, the prime minister has promised to set out a road-map to lifting the restrictions on Sunday, with some changes set to follow from Monday. Here’s what we know.
Big Change Isn’t Imminent
The key number to watch is “R,” the reproduction rate of the virus -- how many other people each infected person passes the disease on to. Scientists and ministers need to be confident the figure is less than one. On Sunday, the estimate was that it was “around 0.7.”
When scientists were preparing different social distancing plans at the start of March, they expected them to last for between eight and 13 weeks -- or through late June.
Some companies are working to that timetable: J Sainsbury (OTC:JSAIY) Plc, Britain’s second-largest grocer, has said it expects the lockdown to ease by the end of June while Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co. is planning to resume production at its plant in Sunderland, northeast England early next month.
It All Depends on Track-and-Trace
Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the key to keeping the infection rate down lies in tracking the spread of the virus and isolating people who have it as well as those who have been in contact with them. The U.K. has stepped up testing and wants to recruit 18,000 contact tracers.
The mobile phone app that will keep a record of people the owner has been in contact with won’t be ready until mid-May.
The U.K. Government’s Virus Contact-Tracing App: What We Know
A significant easing is unlikely before a lot of people have installed the app and the software is clearly working.
Workers will probably also have to wear a mask. Johnson signaled a shift in the government’s position when he spoke on April 30, saying face coverings will be “useful” to stop the virus spreading and also for “giving people confidence it’s safe to go back to work.”
The Easing Will Be Gradual
Ministers have been clear the economy can’t be switched back on all at once, so it will be done in stages. The government has written draft guides for businesses. Proposals include enforcing social distancing through tape on floors, stepped-up hygiene, staggered shifts and not sharing pens.
Businesses operating outdoors, like garden centers, where the risk of transmitting the virus is lower, are more likely to be able to open first when restrictions ease.
Some chain stores are looking at what they can do. Next Plc and Dixons Carphone (LON:DC) Plc plan to reopen their larger stores first, as it is easier to manage social distancing and crowd control.
JD (NASDAQ:JD) Wetherspoon Plc has said it is planning to reopen its pubs in or around June -- but that could turn out to be optimistic. The government has said the hospitality industry will be the last to see restrictions lifted, as it is the one where it is hardest to maintain social distancing.
Some Businesses Are Already Open
B&Q, the DIY chain owned by  Kingfisher  (LON:KGF) Plc, has reopened all 288 of its stores as has rival Homebase, which began trading from all 164 stores over the weekend. Media reports suggested Ikea UK planned to reopen its 18 U.K. Stores on May 18. The company has not confirmed that date but said it is making extensive plans.
On Tuesday, the fast-food chain McDonalds announced the first 15 restaurants scheduled to open next week. Rival Burger King has also begun a phased reopening, starting with drive-through restaurants.
James Daunt, chief executive of Waterstones, the book store chain, said it’s ready to open as soon as it gets the green light from government. Its reopening plans include measures to keep staff and customers safe including sneeze guards at till points and trolleys located throughout the store where shoppers can discard books they have touched but do not intend to buy. These trolleys will then be wheeled into store rooms where the books can “self heal” if they happen to be be contaminated.
Re-Opening is Complicated
Even businesses that don’t serve customers in person will have social distancing issues to address: employees will need to be separated in canteens, restrooms and meeting spaces. They may also need protective equipment.
Labor unions are demanding that workers are protected properly, and the Trades Union Congress on Monday pushed back on the draft guidelines, saying they’re too “weak.”
Then there is the question of how to phase the return to work -- public transport will need to return to full service early in the process to allow commuters to be spaced apart -- and many parents can’t go back to work until schools re-open.
Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said last week schools in England will re-open in a “phased manner,” but he couldn’t give give a date for when they will restart. He did, though, rule out opening them during the summer vacation.
Waiting For A Vaccine
The easing plans all rest on the assumption that the virus can be contained without a full lockdown. But if infections shoot up when the brakes come off, the country may find itself back in lockdown. There may need to be a vaccine before the restrictions can be fully removed.

The U.S. government on Wednesday told the WTO that it had fully complied with the WTO's rulings since Washington State had now repealed its tax breaks for Boeing, and there was ""no valid basis"" for the European Union to retaliate against U.S. goods.

But Airbus spokesman Clay McConnell said the U.S. notification was ""a claim"" that would have to be reviewed by the WTO. He said Airbus also looked forward to receiving more information about how the United States would remove other subsidies to Boeing that were identified in WTO rulings.

967,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>","Uber to cut 3,700 jobs, CEO Khosrowshahi to waive base salary","By Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) -  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER) will cut about 3,700 full-time jobs and Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi will forgo his base salary for the remainder of the year, the company said on Wednesday, as the COVID-19 pandemic decimates ride-hailing businesses.
Uber and rival  Lyft  Inc (O:LYFT) have been under investor pressure to show profits but the coronavirus-led lockdowns have forced them to cut costs and withdraw their full-year financial outlooks as demand for app-based rides have dropped sharply across the world.
Uber said https:// the layoffs, affecting 17% of its employee count, included its customer support and recruiting teams, and expects to incur about $20 million in costs for severance and related charges.
Lyft last week laid off 982 employees, or 17% of its workforce, and cut base salaries of top executives in addition to furloughing hundreds of employees.
""On the ride-sharing front, Uber and Lyft face Herculean-like challenges ahead as the new reality will likely change the business models of these companies (and competitors) for the foreseeable future,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said. 
Ives also said the pandemic may change consumer behavior as work-from-home becomes more common and people grow wary of using cab services due to concerns around the health of previous passengers.
A slowdown in rides also hurts the income of drivers, who are hired as contractors by the companies, with Uber alone having 3.9 million of them on its platform. 
California and three of its largest cities on Tuesday sued Uber and Lyft, accusing them of classifying their drivers improperly as independent contractors instead of employees, evading workplace protections and withholding worker benefits. 
But Uber, which operates in more markets around the world than Lyft, could recover some lost revenue with its food delivery business. 
Cowen analysts expect robust growth at Uber Eats to modestly offset declines in its Rides business when it reports earnings on Thursday. Lyft will report its results on Wednesday after market hours. 
On Wednesday, Uber launched a new Eats feature that allows customers to order food across countries, with real-time delivery tracking. 

Uber shares were down about 3%, while Lyft shares shed 4%.

Traders pulled a record $193 million from KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund on Tuesday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The $2.1 billion ETF, ticker KWEB, has giants such as Tencent and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) among its top holdings. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s $3.8 billion iShares China Large-Cap exchange-traded fund, or FXI, saw its biggest drawdown since July.
The renewed friction between Washington and Beijing threatens to undermine a trade deal signed only months ago, further jeopardizing global economic prospects. China has fired back at U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, saying he has no evidence to back up claims that the virus that causes Covid-19 escaped from a laboratory in the central city of Wuhan. Early sympathy for China’s plight has given way to increased tensions around the world, from the U.S. to Europe and Australia.
“As G-7 nations start to look toward China’s government to place blame on them about the Covid-19 outbreak and its source, sentiment has clearly started to change,” said James Pillow, managing director at Moors & Cabot (NYSE:CBT) Inc.
After suffering a drawdown of more than $400 million in April, China-focused ETFs have seen outflows of about $87 million in early May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even after rallying last month, FXI has fallen more than 12% in 2020, while KWEB is down about 2.5%.
Philip Lawlor, FTSE Russell’s managing director of global markets research, said the flows could be from profit-taking and fears that President Donald Trump will maintain his anti-China rhetoric through the 2020 election.
“His deflection strategy is clearly going to be placing all the blame on China and launching an attack on China in terms of economic sanctions,” he said. “The market is aware we are lining up for a confrontational second half of the year.”

972,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 10:40AM ET</span>","United Airlines to raise $2.25 billion in bonds, rolls back plan to cut work hours","By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) said on Wednesday it plans to raise $2.25 billion through a bond offering amid a coronavirus-linked slump in air travel demand, and backtracked on a controversial plan to cut working hours for thousands of employees.
A union representing more than 25,000 United Airlines aircraft and passenger service workers filed a lawsuit on Tuesday seeking an injunction against the cuts, alleging the plan violated the terms of government payroll aid.
United has said the lawsuit was ""meritless"" and the reductions, due to start on May 24, were in compliance with the terms of its $5 billion in federal assistance and its collective bargaining agreements.
However, in a memo to affected staff made public on Wednesday, the airline said a 25% reduction in work hours for full-time employees would now be optional, and that any volunteers would still retain full-time status.
""Given our continued need to cut costs across the entire company, this proposed program will only be successful if we have a high rate of participation,"" Chief Operations Officer Greg Hart said in the memo.
U.S. airlines are collectively burning more than $10 billion in cash a month because of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry trade group said on Wednesday, forcing a rush to raise capital and cut costs.
Chicago-based United has accepted U.S. government payroll aid that bans job or pay cuts before Sept. 30. 
However, United and other carriers have warned that the aid does not fully cover their payroll costs, and with demand unlikely to recover to pre-crisis levels by the fall, they are looking at ways to start reducing costs as they prepare to downsize in October.
United said on Monday it planned to cut at least 3,450, or 30%, of its management and administrative workers on Oct. 1, and has told pilots to brace for changes as well.
The airline's bond offering will be made in two tranches that will mature in 2023 and 2025, with the proceeds earmarked to repay a $2 billion term loan and for general corporate purposes.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) expects to have $10 billion in liquidity in June, up from $6 billion in March, while American Airlines (O:AAL) expects liquidity at $11 billion in the second quarter, up from $6.8 billion in the first.

United Airlines shares were down 1.6% at $23.73 in early trading.

Treasury also made clear it intends to try and move away from its current focus on Treasury bills that have helped raise urgent funds over the past six weeks in favor of spreading debt over a longer maturity structure over the coming quarters.
That said, Treasury noted it would continue to fill some of its financing needs with regular issues of cash management bills. The department has issued more than 30 cash management bills since mid-March, compared with two in February. 
""While the initial increases in financing related to the COVID-19 outbreak response were focused on Treasury bills, Treasury expects to begin to shift financing from bills to longer-dated tenors over the coming quarters,"" Brian Smith, Treasury's assistant secretary for federal finance, said in a statement.
""In light of the substantial increase in borrowing needs, Treasury plans to increase its long-term issuance as a prudent means of managing its maturity profile and limiting potential future issuance volatility,"" he added.
Following the announcement, yields on the U.S. 30-year bond rose to their highest level since April 14 and yields on the 10-year note also climbed.
In the statement, Treasury said it intends to increase auction sizes across all nominal coupon tenors over the May-to-July period, with the increases larger in the 7-year, 10-year, 20-year and 30-year categories. The largest increase will be on the 10-year note.
It also plans to ""modestly"" increase auction sizes for floating-rate notes, but keep auction sizes for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities unchanged. 
On Monday, the department said it expects to borrow $2.999 trillion during the April-June quarter, five times larger than the previous single-quarter record set during the 2008 financial crisis.
Congress has appropriated nearly $3 trillion in recent weeks as it seeks to stem the economic harm on businesses and households from widespread business shutdowns implemented to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
As previously flagged, Treasury will offer a 20-year bond, in an initial offering size of $20 billion, with the first auction taking place on May 20, 2020. The overall offering size over the next three months of $54 billion is more than recommended by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee.
A senior Treasury official told reporters strong demand was anticipated for the 20-year bond, and that the difference was partly due to the committee's estimate having been formulated before the coronavirus outbreak.
""It's clear that the Treasury is starting to finance out the debt faster than most people anticipated. Even as people knew that the deficit is going to grow, expectations on the 20-year bond were in the teens to low-teens, but they start with $20 billion,"" said Jim Vogel, senior rates strategist at FHN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee.
The department also said it is offering $96 billion of Treasury securities to refund approximately $57 billion of privately-held Treasury notes and bonds maturing on May 15, 2020. 

Treasury's previous record for borrowing for a full fiscal year was $1.8 trillion in 2009.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets pared early gains to trade mixed on Wednesday, as a grim preview of what will likely be the worst U.S. labor market report in history in two days' time dampened sentiment. 
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 74 points, or 0.3%, at 23,809 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.4% but the Nasdaq Composite was up 0.2%.
The market was initially untroubled by ADP (NASDAQ:ADP)'s report that the U.S. private sector shed over 20 million jobs in April, a figure that, while grim, was roughly in line with expectations. Weekly figures suggest that the pace of job losses has eased in recent weeks.
Among the layoffs announced Wednesday were 3,700 at Uber, which will take a $20 million restructuring costs. Uber (NYSE:UBER) stock fell 1.1%, while rival Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT) stock fell 1.8%. Both companies are ste to be sued by their home state of California for mis-classifying their drivers as contractors. 
Elsewhere, the political pressure to reopen the economy from Washington received some support from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who told CNBC that extending lockdowns deep into the second half of the year could drive the economy into a depression, with even worse health outcomes on a national level.
Spirits were lifted by some better-than-expected results, albeit of differing quality. Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) stock rose 6.1% after the hamburger restaurant chain showed a smart rebound in sales since states across the country started to lift lockdown restrictions. U.S. same-store sales were down only 2.1% in the week to May 3, having been down as much as 25% in April. CVS Health (NYSE:CVS), meanwhile, rose 2.8% after reporting a sharp rise in sales and profit. It declined to raise its full-year outcome, unwilling to extrapolate from a quarter marked by frantic stockpiling at the end of March.
General Motors (NYSE:GM) also beat expectations in some key areas, notably in cash burn. Its negative cash flow of $903 million in the first quarter was substantially better than Ford's, thanks in part to decent sales of trucks.  GM stock rose 7.2%.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock eked out a 0.9% gain after posting earnings that lived down to expectations after the closing bell on Tuesday, while  Beyond Meat Inc  (NASDAQ:BYND) stock soared 13.9% to its highest since February, after its earnings strengthened hopes that the disruption to the meat supply chain caused by the pandemic will accelerate its gains in market share. Pork and beef prices have risen sharply in recent weeks due to the closure of various meatpacking plants across the U.S., which have become hotspots for the coronavirus.

(NASDAQ:BYND) due to restaurant closures in the first quarter wasn’t as bad as feared, while stockpiling by consumers benefited the group’s retail business, analysts said.
UBS Group AG’s Steven Strycula noted the faux-meat maker’s U.S. retail sales surged 157% year-on-year, and joined analysts at Jefferies and Piper Sandler & Co. in lifting his price target for the stock.
Beyond Meat’s shares jumped 12% in pre-market trading to $112.30 a share, adding to a 32% year-to-date rise.
Here’s a summary of what analysts had to say:
Jefferies, Rob Dickerson
Rating hold, raises price target to $95 from $83
A 37% rise in retail sales was offset by a 29% sequential decline in foodservice division amid lockdowns. As a result revenue declined about 1% quarter-on-quarter.
Lowering prices via larger frozen product offerings combined with heavier promotions during grilling season should help take incremental share from the beef industry.
Piper Sandler, Michael Lavery
Rating neutral, raises price target to $95 from $72
Food services trends look better than expected, with quick-service restaurant sales down only modestly.
Raises 2020 revenue estimate 26%, 2021 by 29% on more modest foodservice declines, distribution gains in China, and steady retail sales growth.
UBS, Steven Strycula
Rating sell, price target raised to $75 from $73
Retail business was a bright spot with quarterly sales up 157% year-on-year.
However, notes restaurants are placing increased menu emphasis on value items and are hesitant to onboard new menu items.
First-quarter gross margin of 38.8% versus estimate of 31% reflects greater leverage than Street anticipated.
Berenberg, Donald McLee
Rating buy, price target $115
The sales beat was primarily driven by increased volumes in the retail channel due to stockpiling.
Also benefited from new products and international growth amid deals such as a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) partnership in Canada and China.Overall, restaurant difficulties to outweigh the success in retail. Restaurants accounted for about 50% of 2019 revenue.

978,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",World shares subdued amid weak data; oil resumes gains,"By Tom Arnold
LONDON (Reuters) - Global shares struggled on Wednesday as weak economic data, doubts about the easing of coronavirus lockdowns and simmering U.S.-China tensions cast a pall over markets.
Oil prices extended their run of gains, supported by expectations that demand will recover and by a record supply cut from OPEC and other producers.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s index of global shares was trading 0.1% up. The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) was 0.3% higher, helped by gains in healthcare stocks (SXDP) on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results from Denmark's  Novo Nordisk  (CO:NOVOb) and German dialysis specialist Fresenius Medical Care (DE:FMEG).
Shares in UniCredit (MI:CRDI) recovered from earlier falls to trade 0.9% higher. Italy's biggest bank reported a 2.7 billion-euro loss in the first quarter amid loan writedowns in anticipation of the damage caused by the pandemic.
""Earnings season is not great, but it's really the issue of the virus and the end of the lockdown, and sentiment towards that will push the market,"" said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Swiss wealth manager Prime Partners.
""We think there'll be a consolidation for the equity market. It won't take us back to the lows we saw in March, but markets are waiting for a clearer outlook on how the lockdown will end.""
Germany and Spain are among economies gradually emerging from lockdowns, but the outlook for an easing of restrictions elsewhere is less certain.
In a reminder of the economic damage from the lockdown, euro zone business activity almost ground to a halt last month, IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index showed.
The European Commission forecast the euro zone economy will contract by a record 7.7% this year, while the inflation rate will slow to 0.2%, but public debt and budget deficits will balloon.
Wall Street futures were positive, with E-minis for the S&P500 (ESc1) up 0.8%.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) climbed 0.6%. Volumes were light with Japanese markets closed for a holiday.
China, opening for the first time since Thursday, reversed early losses, sending its blue-chip index (CSI300) up 0.6%.
In a move seen by analysts as offering a olive branch to Washington amid the trade tensions, China's central bank set the yuan  at a broadly neutral midpoint. The exchange rate has been a contentious point in China-U.S. ties. 
""The People's Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) went a long way to extinguishing one major trade war hotspot by setting the yuan reference rate on a more risk-friendly level,"" said Stephen Innes, chief markets strategist at AxiCorp.
""USD/CNH dropped about 200 pips on the stable fix, and a recovery in risk sentiment ensued, and there was no follow-through on U.S. President Trump's threat to China.""
President Donald Trump has repeatedly taken aim at China as the source of the pandemic and warned that it would be held to account. On Tuesday, he urged China to be transparent about the origins of the coronavirus, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
On Wall Street overnight, the S&P 500 pared earlier gains after U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida warned that economic data would get worse before it got better.
EURO FALL
In currencies, the euro resumed its fall, declining to a near two-week low of $1.0786 on Wednesday (EUR=EBS). The currency was still under pressure after Germany's top court on Tuesday ruled that the European Central Bank's quantitative-easing programme ""partially violated"" the German constitution.
The yen rose 0.2% to 106.35, having earlier reached 106.20, its strongest since March 17 . 
The ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) National Employment Report of private U.S. payrolls on Wednesday could give an early warning of the damage expected to be revealed on Friday in the U.S. government's measure of jobs in April. It is expected to show nearly 22 million jobs were lost last month.
German borrowing costs rose before the country's first syndicated bond sale in half a decade. Germany's benchmark 10-year yields rose two basis points to -0.55%, though they remain close to Tuesday's seven-week lows (DE10YT=RR).
In commodities, U.S. crude futures (CLc1) rose 88 cents to $25.44 a barrel. Brent crude (LCOc1) was up 79 cents to $31.76, having risen in the past six sessions. The market is anticipating that demand will recover and that a record supply cut led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will support prices.
Analysts said the rebalancing of the market would be choppy.
""We're talking about normalisation of supply and demand but we've got a long way to go,"" said Lachlan Shaw, National Australia Bank (OTC:NABZY)'s head of commodity strategy.
""There are a lot of supply cuts that have come through. That combined with some early signs of demand lifting has meant the rate of inventory build is slowing.""

Spot gold  eased 0.1% to $1,704 an ounce.

979,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Russia to raise more debt ahead of deepest GDP fall in decade,"By Katya Golubkova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia plans to dig deeper into its rainy day fund, double borrowing and postpone some national projects, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told the Vedomosti business daily, as coronavirus is seen knocking the economy down even harder than sanctions. 
Russia, which has overtaken France and Turkey in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases, currently close to 166,000, has been largely on a lockdown since late March, which along with weak oil prices is hurting the domestic economy. 
Low oil prices and the lockdown mean the economy will shrink by 5% this year, Siluanov said.
That would be its worst performance since a 7.8% fall at the height of the global financial crisis in 2009. The economy shrank by 2.3% in 2015, due to a fall in oil prices and sanctions imposed following the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
Budget revenues are expected to fall 4 trillion roubles ($54 billion) below expectations this year. Lower oil and gas revenues will account for a reduction of around 1.5 trillion roubles. 
As a result, this year's budget deficit is expected to hit 4% of GDP, Siluanov said. Russia ran a budget surplus of 1.8% of gross domestic product last year and was expecting a 2020 budget surplus of 0.8% of GDP. 
To compensate for the lost revenue and to meet its social obligations, Russia will use more funds from the National Wealth Fund (NWF), Siluanov said, as well as proceeds from the recent sale of a stake in Russia's biggest bank, Sberbank (MM:SBER). 
Last month, the finance ministry used the NWF funds to buy a controlling stake in Sberbank from the central bank. The bulk of these proceeds are to be returned to state coffers. 
Before the pandemic hit, Russia was expecting the economy to expand by 2% this year, and President Vladimir Putin has been promising to increase the rate of growth through 2024 with a range of high profile national projects.
Those plans, which called for Russia to speed up the spending of $350-billion on 13 strategic areas ranging from healthcare and education to infrastructure this year, may be adjusted, Siluanov said.
To protect the NWF, state borrowing will double this year to 4.0-4.5 trillion roubles, Siluanov said. 
""We do not want to spend much from the NWF, it would not be right to spend it in two years,"" he told Vedomosti. 
Before the coronavirus outbreak, Russia planned to raise 2.3 trillion roubles in rouble OFZ bonds and up to $3 billion in Eurobonds this year. 
Two packages of fiscal stimulus already cost Russia 2.8% of GDP in direct measures alone, excluding debt and spending from the rainy-day fund.
A third package, yet to be announced, would provide support to recover after restrictions are lifted, Siluanov told Vedomosti. Putin has yet to say when restrictions are likely to be eased.

LONDON (Reuters) -  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) Chairman Jose Vinals said on Wednesday his Asia-focused bank was well placed to benefit from a late 2020 economic rally, despite the ""extraordinary"" impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy.
""There is no doubt that the world will be coping with the threat of COVID-19 for some time.

Chinese shoppers account for more than a third of global luxury goods spending and China was the first key market to be hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced brands to shut stores and led to a virtual halt in international travelling. 
As the virus spread to Europe and the United States, Chinese spenders gradually emerged from weeks of lockdown and most labels have been enjoying a recovery in sales there since March. 
But the pandemic has disrupted supply chains and warehouse planning across the globe, leaving fashion groups with vast amounts of unsold goods, while Chinese spenders, who used to buy mostly when travelling abroad, are now shopping at home.
In a statement on Wednesday, Alibaba said it was piloting the new Luxury Soho platform to run alongside its Tmall Luxury Pavilion flagship site. 
""Brands are now sitting on a worldwide abundance of stock and are also needing to find ways to reach new consumers,"" said Christina Fontana, head of Tmall Fashion and Luxury in Europe, in comments posted on Alibaba's website.
The platform will allow brands to run their own online stores with full control over their pricing, product selection and strategy.
Fontana said that while Luxury Pavilion would continue to offer the brands' latest collections and more exclusive services, focusing on a more affluent clientele, Soho would be home to ""luxury deals, older collections, timeless classics and vintage collectibles"". 
She said the platform would help high-end houses reach newer consumers such as those from China's lower-tier cities or so-called Gen Z shoppers, young clients up to the age of 25 who are just entering the world of luxury and are expected to become increasingly important for the sector.

""With Luxury Soho, brands can now move selected products and collections onto an online outlet store and bring them in front of a specific audience.""

983,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>","Britain's mid-sized banks coping with coronavirus, but warn of pain ahead","By Iain Withers and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - A slew of Britain's mid-sized banks on Wednesday reported steady deposits and demand in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, but warned it was too early to assess the long-term damage of the outbreak to their businesses.
The lockdown in late March to contain the spread of the new coronavirus has brought the economy to a near halt, prompting bigger banks last week to set aside provisions for loan losses in case businesses and consumers struggle to pay them back. 
Virgin Money (L:VMUK) made a first-half pretax loss after booking a 232 million pound ($289 million) provision for bad loans and likely defaults due to the pandemic, but reported a higher than expected capital buffer of 13% that steadied investor nerves.
The bank, which became the UK's sixth-largest lender following its takeover by CYBG, reported a pre-tax loss of 7 million pounds for the six months ended March 31, compared to a 9 million pound profit a year earlier. 
The firm made a 22 million pound after-tax profit thanks to a 29 million pound tax credit.
Smaller rival OneSavings Bank (L:OSBO) said its net loans and retail deposits held firm in the first quarter, as did its 2.66% net interest margin - a key measure of underlying profitability - despite the tough market conditions.
""It is too soon to say what the longer term impact will be on our business, but we entered this period with a strong and secured balance sheet, sensible LTVs and strong risk management capabilities, equipping us well to navigate the current situation,"" OneSavings Bank Chief Executive Andy Golding said.
Shares in Virgin Money were up 11% at 1128 GMT, while OneSavings gained 7%.
 Metro Bank  (L:MTRO) failed to reassure its investors with its thin quarterly trading update, reporting a modest dip in lending alongside a 77 million pound rise in total deposits. Its shares fell 3%.
Metro entered the crisis in bad shape after an accounting blunder last year decimated its stock market value, forced out its top bosses, and triggered an ongoing regulatory investigation.
The bank said it remained ""difficult to predict with any certainty"" how the outbreak would impact its customers and would provide an update when it reported half-year results, but said key capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory minimums.
""Metro's limited Q1 trading update may be a hostage to fortune in terms of what it does not disclose as opposed to what it does,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Joe Dickerson said in a note.
Unlisted Co-op Bank reported a further quarterly pretax loss - of 27 million pounds - but said this was in line with company expectations. Impairments nearly tripled to 2.9 million pounds, although Goodbody analyst John Cronin said they remained relatively benign.
The flurry of updates comes after Britain's biggest banks RBS (L:RBS), Lloyds (L:LLOY), HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Barclays  (L:BARC) set aside 6.7 billion pounds in provisions for likely loan losses last week.
Virgin Money said it would delay the rebranding of Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank for a year due to the impact of the crisis, although Chief Executive David Duffy told reporters the bank was committed to doing this over time.
Duffy said the bank's credit card business had not been impacted so far by the crisis, but the bank had provisioned for impairments to rise this year.
""It's a very high quality credit card book with very affluent customers,"" he said.
Commenting on bad loan provisioning, he said: ""I don't have a crystal ball but we have tried to be very conservative.""
Citing a lower capital buffer relative to peers, analysts had been concerned Virgin Money might need to raise additional capital, but a common equity tier 1 ratio of 13% was welcomed by analysts at Citi as ""a big positive"".
Virgin Money Chief Financial Officer Ian Smith said the bank still had ""a very substantial buffer"" to the regulatory requirement of 10%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc (N:KKR) reported an 11% jump in after-tax distributable earnings in the first quarter on Wednesday, driven by growth in asset sales and management fees ahead of the coronavirus-linked market turmoil.
After-tax distributable earnings rose to $355.3 million in the quarter through March, from $314.1 million a year earlier, KKR said. This translated to after-tax distributable earnings of 42 cents per share, which met the average analyst forecast, according to data from Refinitiv.
Private equity firms such as KKR were forced to mark down the value of many of their funds following a sharp decline in global markets in February and March amid the economic fallout of the pandemic, which shut down large swaths of the economy. 
The value of its private equity portfolio depreciated by 12% in the quarter, while its alternative credit and leveraged credit funds fell by 16% and 13% respectively. 
However, KKR said the value of its global infrastructure funds rose 18%. During the quarter, KKR sold its German fiber-optic network company Deutsche Glasfaser to private equity firm EQT (ST:EQTAB) and Canadian pension fund OMERS for a reported 2.8 billion euros ($3.03 billion).
KKR's peers have also reported declines in the values of their funds in the first quarter. Last week, Apollo Global Management Inc (N:APO) said its private equity portfolio depreciated by 21.6% in the first quarter, while its credit funds declined 9% in aggregate.
In April, Blackstone Group Inc (N:BX) reported a 21.6% slump in its private equity portfolio, while opportunistic and core real estate funds fell by 8.8% and 3.9%, respectively.  Carlyle Group  Inc (O:CG) said its private equity funds fell by 8% in the quarter, while credit funds fell by 21%.
KKR reported a net loss of $1.3 billion under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the quarter, compared with a net income of $701 million a year earlier. This takes into account the mark-to-market valuations of its funds, even if paper losses have not been realized. 
At the end of March, KKR had $207.1 billion in assets under management, down from $218.4 billion three months earlier.

KKR declared a quarterly dividend of $0.135 per share.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, as the Trump administration ramped up the debate about the reopening of the country’s economy.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 24 points, or 0.9%, higher, Nasdaq Futures up 70 points, or 0.8%. The Dow futures contract was up 210 points, or 0.9%.
President Donald Trump expressed his desire for the country to reopen quickly Tuesday, saying Americans should begin returning to their normal working lives even if it leads to more sickness and death from the pandemic.
The White House is considering phasing out its Covid-19 task force, according to its head, Vice President Mike Pence.
A number of states have started reopening their businesses, including Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina and Florida. But this has appeared to have gone fairly slowly, with consumers still reluctant to risk shopping or a restaurant visit. 
The U.S. has the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world, with about 1.2 million people infected and more than 71,000 killed so far. Aggregate numbers in Europe are, however, somewhat higher
The corporate earnings season continues Wednesday, with General Motors (NYSE:GM) set to report before the bell, with investors likely keen on how zero-percent financing offers have helped the automaker before sales were hit by the pandemic.
GM is predicted to have earned 50 cents per share in the quarter on sales of about $32.5 billion.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock dropped 1.8% premarket after its Q2 profit slumped 97% versus the same quarter last year due to shut theme parks and halted film and TV productions. 
Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) stock dropped 16% premarket after the social media network disappointed with quarterly earnings late Tuesday, while Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT) dropped 5% after reporting  a quarterly loss of 56 cents per share.
On a positive note, Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND) stock climbed 7.8% premarket after the maker of plant-based meat turned a profit in the first quarter, helped by the disruption to the meat supply chain.
Turning to economic data, ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) issues its private sector payrolls report at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT), the first full measure of a month the country spent on lockdown restrictions. This will provide a flavor of the rise in U.S. unemployment last month ahead of Friday’s historic labor market report.
Economists expect that private sector payrolls plunged by 20.05 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Oil futures pushed higher, helped by the American Petroleum Institute saying late Tuesday that its latest measure of inventories rose by 8.4 million barrels, a large number but below the 10 million barrels the week before.
The Energy Information Administration will post the official U.S. figures for crude stockpiles for the week ended May 1 at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).

992,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 06:57AM ET</span>",Online supermarket Ocado's sales soar 40% in lockdown Britain,"By James Davey
LONDON (Reuters) - British online supermarket Ocado (LON:OCDO) has seen retail revenue soar 40.4% year-on-year in its second quarter to date as it ramped up capacity to meet unprecedented demand during the country's coronavirus lockdown.
Growth accelerated from 10.3% in its first quarter to March 1, sending its shares up 3.2% at 0935 GMT, extending gains for 2020 to 35%.
Britain has been on lockdown since March 23, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country is past the peak of the pandemic and is expected to set out a plan on Sunday on how it might gradually ease restrictions.
In March, Ocado was forced to stop registrations from new customers and impose a queuing system online after it saw a several hundred percentage increase in web traffic.
""It took us a few weeks to adapt to a completely new situation, and I know we didn’t serve our customers as well as we’d liked (to),"" finance chief Duncan Tatton-Brown told reporters.
Pre-crisis, about 7% of UK grocery sales were delivered to homes - about one in every 15 households. Industry leader Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) had a 35% share of the online grocery market, while Ocado had about 14%.
All of Britain's big four grocers - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - have been ramping up their online capacity to meet some of the extra demand. But even if delivery capacity doubled, some 85% of the market would still need to be served by stores.
""There is too much demand in the UK for online (grocery) for the UK operations to serve that,"" said Tatton-Brown.
""So as an industry we can’t meet the demand, and Ocado is one of the players in the industry and therefore shares that disappointment.""
Ocado's capacity had increased to enable the delivery of over 40% more groceries in the UK than before COVID-19 hit, with its mature warehouses running at their peak and at their best ever efficiencies.
The number of items per customer basket appeared to have passed its peak, but remained high, Ocado said. The share of fresh and chilled products in the mix, relative to ambient store cupboard items, was also returning to normal, it added.
LONG-TERM SHIFT
Ocado expects the long-term shift towards online grocery to accelerate post the crisis.
But it highlighted uncertainties about its length, customer reaction immediately afterwards and its long-term impact on customers' disposable incomes. 
It said it had suspended its guidance for retail revenue for full year 2020 until it could accurately forecast likely outcomes. The group has cash of 1.2 billion pounds on its balance sheet.
Ocado Retail is a joint venture between  Ocado Group  and Marks & Spencer. Ocado's supply deal with Waitrose will finish at the end of August, when it will be replaced with M&S.
Ocado has a stock market capitalisation of 12.2 billion pounds ($15.2 billion), which is more than the combined market capitalisations of Sainsbury's, Britain's No. 2 supermarket group by sales, and No. 4 Morrisons.
The share price has mostly been driven by its state-of-the-art robotic technology which has enabled it to win partnership deals with supermarket groups around the world, including Kroger (NYSE:KR) in the United States, Casino in France and Aeon in Japan.
Ocado's update was published ahead of its annual shareholders' meeting, where the firm could face an investor revolt over executive pay. Co-founder and CEO Tim Steiner was paid 58.7 million pounds in 2019.
The company says its rewards are justified because it created 7.5 billion of value for shareholders in the five years to 2019.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) said several national regulators in the EU have noticed a significant increase in the number of retail clients opening investment accounts and trading.
Stock markets saw big falls in record volumes during March as countries entered lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic, with some EU states introducing bans on short-selling.
ESMA said financial firms have a legal obligation under the bloc's securities laws to act honestly, fairly and professionally.
They have even greater duties towards investors that are new or have limited investment knowledge or experience to trade in intensified market volatility, it added.
""ESMA emphasises that firms should pay particular attention to the possible ramifications of the COVID-19 crisis for the client’s personal situation and the risk profile of his financial instruments to ensure that these financial instruments are suitable for him.""
Britain's Financial Conduct Authority has also been warning that the pandemic could initiate new types of scam activity.
""Unfortunately we do see some scams and other bad behaviour come out of the woodwork whenever you get a crisis like this,"" FCA interim chief executive Christopher Woolard told a webinar on Monday.

995,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",UniCredit Posts $2.9 Billion Loss ,"(Bloomberg) -- UniCredit SpA can come close to achieving its profit target for next year if Europe’s economy rebounds as strongly as the bank expects, Chief Executive Officer Jean Pierre Mustier said after the lender reported its biggest net loss in three years.
Italy’s biggest bank by assets can reach 75% to 80% of its net income goal for next year, or 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) to 3.5 billion euros, if the European Union economy rebounds by 10% as the bank’s economists expect, Mustier said on a conference call.
Italy’s economy went into Europe’s longest lockdown to combat the coronavirus a few months after Mustier set out a new strategy to improve profitability and increase shareholder payouts. UniCredit expects to review its plan by early next year and the CEO said on Wednesday that the bank isn’t setting new targets for 2020 as uncertainty remains too high. The company will decide in the fourth quarter whether to distribute dividends on 2019 earnings.
UniCredit posted a first quarter net loss of 2.71 billion euros, as loan-loss provisions climbed to 1.26 billion euros, and it booked one off costs for job cuts and the writedown of its Turkish unit. About 900 million euros was set aside last month, specifically to deal with the impact of the virus. The lender’s main business was resilient in the first quarter, with income from fees and lending beating estimates.
UniCredit (OTC:UNCRY) was up by 0.7% in Milan trading as of 12:28 a.m. after having fallen as much as 2% earlier. That takes this year’s drop to about 48% compared with a 40% decline of the STOXX Europe 600 Banks Index.
The CEO, set aside more money than many of his European competitors including Italian rival Intesa Sanpaolo (OTC:ISNPY) SpA. The bank booked costs as it started the process of eliminating 5,200 existing jobs in Italy through 2023 and took a charge for the sale of a stake in Turkish business Yapi ve Kredi Bankasi AS.
“We want to be always extremely conservative in what we do” to produce a positive surprise later Mustier said.
“Core revenues were better, capital was affected by sizeable non-operating items, and it is broadly in line with adjusted consensus,”  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) analyst Azzurra Guelfi wrote in a note. The bank “has provided significant disclosure for cost of risk outlook, to reassure the market on the impact of macro deterioration.”
UniCredit was the first big European bank to try to quantify the effect of the coronavirus, setting the provisions and predicting a 13% contraction in the euro zone’s economy for the year. Banks across Europe have added billions of euros in provisions and tossed out their earlier forecasts for earnings this year, with many also saying it’s too early to provide new estimates.
Despite the affects of the pandemic on borrowers, UniCredit reduced its non-performing loan ratio to 4.9% as of March from 5% at the end of December. The CET1 ratio, a key measure of financial strength, rose to 13.44% from 13.09%. Regulators have encouraged banks to tap into their capital buffers to make more money available for lending.
Italy was the first major European economy to impose a virus-related lockdown, with non-essential businesses closed on March 9 and a ban on travel between the country’s provinces. The country, which had some of the highest infection rates and deaths, started the first stage of a gradual re-opening businesses on May 4.
The net loss is the biggest for UniCredit since the fourth quarter of 2016, when the bank posted a loss of 13.6 billion euros on charges related to Mustier’s restructuring.

998,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","As U.S. auto supply chain revs up, worker safety fears linger in Mexico","By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Workers at a  Lear  Corp (N:LEA) autoparts plant in northern Mexico that saw the worst known coronavirus outbreak of any factory in the Americas are now bracing to be sent back to work.
They just don't know when, and some worry it still may not be safe just weeks after the pandemic struck factories in the industrial city of Ciudad Juarez, just across the U.S. border from El Paso, Texas. 
For many, it's an agonizing bind after the outbreak at Lear's Rio Bravo plant that Lear said has killed 18 employees. 
Even though a return to their posts may be scary, most are desperate to recover their full salaries that Lear reduced when it shuttered the plant of about 3,000 workers. Part of a wider international supply chain crucial to the U.S. auto sector, they are also aware that pressures from beyond Mexico may factor into the timetable.
""When the United States opens the automotive industry, we have to go back,"" said Dagoberto Galindo, 42, one of ten Lear employees at the Rio Bravo industrial park Reuters has interviewed since mid-April. He has worked 14 years at the factory that makes car seat trim covers for  Daimler  AG's (DE:DAIGn) Mercedes-Benz and  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) Mustangs and Explorers. 
""I would go back for economic reasons, because I'm not going to have money left. But not because I'd feel safe,"" said Galindo, who said he is taking home just 65% of his salary while the plant is closed, making it harder to support his wife and six children. 
Galindo is one of thousands of workers at various U.S.-owned factories known as ""maquiladoras"" along Mexico's northern border. 
Corporate America has benefited from lower wages and laxer health, safety and environmental strictures at the maquiladoras for decades. And they rely heavily on intertwined supply chains between the two countries that fueled $614.5 billion in U.S.-Mexico trade last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
That made Mexico the top U.S. trade partner, pushing past China, which has suffered from a bitter tariff conflict with U.S. President Donald Trump. But those benefits have come at a cost for Mexican workers, who earn less than U.S. counterparts and typically have weaker protections from unions.
Now with the Mexican infection curve several weeks behind the U.S. epidemic, experts say workers are right to be concerned about returning too quickly. As of Tuesday, Ciudad Juarez had the largest concentration of coronavirus in Chihuahua state, with 418 cases and 97 deaths.
""The maquiladora industry was a factor in the contagion,"" said human rights activist Cecilia Espinosa in Ciudad Juarez, urging health and labor authorities to inspect factories before allowing workers to return.
PROTESTS SOUTH OF THE BORDER
Multiple protests erupted in mid-April over safe working conditions following reported worker deaths at Honeywell International Inc (N:HON) and Lear, highlighting friction over which factories should remain open in the pandemic.
Ten workers at the Rio Bravo plant have since told Reuters that Lear took minimal protection measures there in the weeks before halting operations in late March - a month after Mexico detected its first coronavirus cases and as the U.S. death toll surpassed 1,000.
Lear, which employs 24,000 workers in 10 different plants in Ciudad Juarez, said that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control did not recommend the wearing of masks for non COVID-19 positive people until early April. 
The company said there was no sign of an uptick in visits to the factory's infirmary in the weeks before the closure, and that it learned of the first hospitalization on April 3.
""We are truly and deeply saddened by the situation,"" said Frank Orsini, a Lear executive vice president who oversees the seating business of the company that operates in 39 different countries. ""We have not seen anything like this anywhere else in the world.""
Orsini said the families told Lear that the official causes of deaths were pneumonia. Lear was not aware of any testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, Orsini said, noting that testing in Mexico has been limited. 
The company did an ""extensive study"" to look for links among the workers who died - including shifts, lunch breaks and busing - but did not find commonalities, Orsini said.
A lack of information is not helping ease some worker concerns about restarting factories. The ten workers interviewed by Reuters said the company never told them directly if some of their colleagues were sick from the coronavirus, or if any had died.
""We're a family, then from one minute to the next, they're not there anymore,"" said Lorenza Piña, 59, referring to her close-knit group of colleagues. 
Orsini said Lear's human resources staff made an effort to check in with employees by phone, and told them there were infections and fatalities, without disclosing how many. Lear also acknowledged in statements to Reuters since mid-April that an unspecified number had become casualties of the virus.
'SAFE WORK PLAYBOOK' 
Some Lear workers last week posted videos on social media of preparations to re-open the Rio Bravo plant. Tall cubicles now protect sewing machines, and a person in a white hazmat suit is shown spraying walls and floors with disinfectant spray with the words ""safety is built step by step"" emblazoned in large letters across a set of stairs.
Lear in recent weeks has promoted a detailed handbook to reopening factories safely, including instructions to install hand sanitizer floor stands in work areas per 50 employees, provide workers with masks and gloves and take their temperatures at the start of shifts. 
Now in its second edition, the ""Safe Work Playbook"" of best practices has been downloaded from Lear's website some 18,000 times, the company said.
Orsini said Lear will re-open in Mexico only once ""employees are comfortable with the precautions that we've taken,"" and government regulations allow it.
In a sign of the Trump administration's hunger for a quick ramp-up, the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, has also called for restarting work there to coincide with the United States and Canada.

""I am doing everything I can to save the supply chains that were built over the past decades,"" he said on Twitter in late April. ""It's possible and essential to take care of workers' health without destroying these chains. The economic integration of North America demands coordination.""

999,By Investing.com,"<span>May 06, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Crisis? What Crisis? Says Intesa,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Carlo Messina has taken the art of putting a brave face on things to a new level.
The CEO of  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP), Italy’s largest retail bank by asset,  put out what some might call an outrageously upbeat outlook for the next 19 months on Tuesday, promising a net profit of 3 billion euros this year - down by less than a quarter from 2019 - and no less than 3.5 billion euros in 2021. He's also promising to pay out 75% of 2020 profit in dividends – if regulators let him. No wonder the stock rose 5%, even if it has given back 0.7% on Wednesday morning.
That seems a world away from the endless profit warnings and provisions that are peppering the European bank earnings season so far (Unicredit (MI:CRDI), its biggest rival, was more on trend with its announcement of a 2.7 billion euro loss in the first quarter on Wednesday).
There must be doubts that any bank in Italy can sustain the kind of pounding the country is taking in 2020. The macro backdrop is not substantially improving, even though Italy is now slowly emerging from its nationwide Covid-19 lockdown: the sovereign debt burden – a country risk that Intesa cannot insulate itself against – can only increase from here. The EU’s latest forecasts, out Wednesday, show it rising to 159% of GDP as the economy contracts by 9.5% in 2020. 
And, as the German Constitutional Court’s outburst against the European Central Bank’s quantitative easing showed, German support for Italy is limited and conditional.
And yet, Messina’s record over the last few years, in which he has de-risked and refocused the bank while exploiting the failures of rivals to strengthen its position in its home market, demands that his forecasts are taken seriously.  The outlook for his hostile bid for Unione di Banche Italiane (MI:UBI) – which still needs regulatory clearance) - has also improved as the pandemic is almost certain to weaken his target more than it does Intesa (if anything, Messina is in a position to change the share exchange ratio in favor of his own shareholders).
The pandemic will make almost all European bank balance sheets harder to read, with investors having to make more account for regulatory and state support measures that all militate toward making banks (and the economies they serve) seem more healthy than they may well be. All the same, Intesa’s strategic position, its revenue mix and its management’s track record have a value which is harder to dispute.
The bad news is that it may already be fully discounted. A valuation premium relative to Unicredit (Intesa trades at 0.45 times book value compared to 0.24 for its rival) looks excessive, given Unicredit’s geographical diversification, and Intesa’s concentration of risk at home."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW AG  expects the coronavirus pandemic to hit demand and earnings throughout this year, prompting the German automaker to cut its profitability forecast for passenger cars following a drop in first-quarter deliveries. 
The firm forecast a margin on automotive earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 0% to 3% this year, versus the 2-4% seen before demand was crippled by worldwide restrictions on movement to tackle the virus.
""The BMW Group still expects the spread of the coronavirus and the necessary containment measures to seriously dampen demand across all major markets over the entire year,"" the Munich-based company said on Wednesday.
BMW reported a 133% jump in first-quarter profit to 1.38 billion euros ($1.50 billion). But that was against a period last year when earnings were pushed down to 589 million euros by a one-off 1.4 billion euro provision.
The automotive EBIT margin came in at 1.3%.
Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) automotive analyst Philippe Houchois described the margin as disappointing, given solid sales of typically more profitable sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).
BMW expects to make an operating loss in the second quarter as coronavirus lockdowns continue in large markets like the United States and Britain, it said. 
Like rivals, BMW also said it would throttle back investments to preserve cash. A 12 billion euros cost savings and efficiency plan will be extended, it added, without providing further details.
""In light of the current situation, we will be delaying a number of projects, like the plant in Hungary. Other projects will be carefully reconsidered,"" Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Peter said, adding the Hungary plant would be delayed by a year.
Free cashflow at the automotive business was minus 2.2 billion euros in the first quarter and BMW said it no longer expected to achieve positive free cash flow in 2020, despite cutting back investments.

BMW's forecasts are the latest sign that profitability at traditional automakers is on the wane, as they spend huge sums to clean up combustion engines in the face of increasingly stringent emissions regulations as well as rising competition from electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc (O:TSLA). 
Last week, Tesla said its automotive gross margin rose to 25.5% in the first quarter from 20.2% a year earlier, due to a 40% rise in deliveries, helped by demand for its Model Y crossover utility vehicle.
By contrast, BMW's passenger car deliveries fell 20.6% to 477,111 cars in a quarter blighted by the virus outbreak.
The company also said it had set aside a ""low triple digit million"" euros amount to cover potential defaults from customers buying cars on loans and leasing contracts.
BMW has had to ramp up spending on hybrid petrol-electric and pure electric vehicles to try to meet emissions rules and offset its heavy reliance on petrol-guzzling SUVs.
Sales of BMW's ""X"" series of SUVs jumped 21% last year, making up 44% of the BMW brand's global total. 
Carbon dioxide emissions from new vehicles sold in the European Union must be 40% lower in 2021 compared with 2007, and 37.5% lower in 2030 versus 2021 - with fines for non-compliance.

BMW's 2021 target is an EU fleet average of 102.5 grams of CO2 per kilometre. Last year, its average fell just 1 gram from a year earlier to 127 grams, while research and development spending left its automotive EBIT margin at 4.9%.

Investing.com - European stock markets traded slightly lower Wednesday amid weak economic data, while better than expected earnings helped the U.K. to outperform. 
At 4:35 AM ET (0835 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 0.1% lower, France's CAC 40 fell 0.2%, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index traded up 0.7%.
German factory orders slumped 15.6% in March to their lowest level since records began in 1991, while IHS Markit's final Composite Purchasing Managers' Index for the euro zone, seen as a good indicator of economic health, plummeted to 13.6 in April from March's already dire 29.7, easily its lowest reading since the survey began in 1998.
On a busy day for corporate news, BMW (DE:BMWG) stock fell 3% despite reporting a 133% rise in first-quarter profit. That was mainly due to a one-off provision in the year-earlier period. The German automaker offered up downbeat guidance, saying the impact of the coronavirus could erode demand and profit over the whole year.
Norwegian Air Shuttle (OL:NWC) slumped 11% after saying it would sell new shares at a 79% discount to the latest traded price as it seeks to boost its equity in order to qualify for Norway's government aid package.
Italian bank UniCredit (MI:CRDI) eked out a 1.0% gain despite posting a 2.7 billion-euro loss on soaring provisions.
By contrast, shares in  ITV  (LON:ITV), Britain's biggest free-to-air commercial broadcaster, rose over 4% despite saying ad revenue last month fell by 42%, while withdrawing its 2019 final dividend. Investors had worried that the figures could have been worse.
Ocado (LON:OCDO) stock rose 2% after the British online supermarket said retail revenue soared 40% year-on-year in its second quarter to date as shoppers in coronavirus lockdown sought deliveries to avoid venturing out. And pharma company AstraZeneca (LON:AZN) rose 1.4% to another all-time high after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved its Farxiga drug for treating heart conditions.

Sales of passenger cars in China were above year-earlier levels in the last week of April, Volkswagen executive Juergen Stackmann, who is responsible for passenger car sales and marketing at the VW brand, said on Wednesday. 
""It is clear to see that China will go through V shape,"" Stackmann said, referring to the shape of the recovery curve. ""We are not counting on a V shape recovery for Europe.""
In April, sales in Germany were down 60% on the year, with the rest of Europe down 85% as some major markets like Italy and Spain came to a full stop, Stackmann said.
Sales in North America were down 50%, and down 81% in South America, Stackmann said.
""There might be a trend toward individual mobility since people want to avoid public transport these days,"" he said, explaining that VW's Chinese budget brand Jetta had picked up market share after the country eased lockdown rules.
""Jetta in the first month of reopening has been a very, very strong month,"" Stackmann said, adding that unlike Europe, China still had lots of first time car buyers.
In Europe demand was patchy, he said 
""We will see a two-speed Europe. Southern Europe was hit really badly. Italy, Spain and to some extent France. We expect recovery to take much longer, it will be bathtub shaped,"" he said.
Norther European countries, includig Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany fared better. In Germany, sales to fleet customers remained almost at normal levels in April compared with a year earlier, he said. 
Pre-booking for VW's ID 3 electric car stands at 37,000 vehicles, with demand coming from across Europe and strongest in Germany, Stackmann said.
Aside from seeking government stimulus measures, Volkswagen is adapting its financing and leasing offers to make downpayments more palatable. 
Some financing offers will be stretched to 72 months, instead of 36, and Volkswagen will offer unemployment insurance, which allows new car buyers to suspend payments if they lose their job. 

""Financing will become the main instrument for the industry in the months to come,"" Stackmann said.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",Booze bonanza for shops masks beer and spirits downturn,"By Philip Blenkinsop
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - When Lionel Platteuw started planning how he would cope under Belgium's coronavirus lockdown, there was one item he wanted to make sure he had enough of - alcohol.
""My first concern was that we didn't have enough beer and wine,"" said the Brussels-based consultant. ""I wasn't concerned about toilet paper, but I didn't want to be stuck at home without alcohol supplies.""
Soaring sales of beer, wine and spirits at retail outlets suggest drinkers across the world took a similar attitude. 
Sales at British liquor stores leapt a third in March, while those for alcohol at U.S. retailers shot up more than 50% in the week after the country entered a state of national emergency.
But the drinks industry isn't popping any corks.
The surge in demand came as sales through bars, clubs and restaurants fell to zero as they were closed to contain the virus. And even as countries start to ease restrictions, these venues are likely to be at the back of the line to reopen. 
Manufacturers have also faced supply disruptions and, in some countries, even a ban on sales as authorities worry excessive drinking could jeopardise social distancing efforts. 
A deep global economic downturn also looks set to hit consumer spending, with signs drinkers are switching from premium brands to cheaper alternatives and multipacks.
NO SOCIAL OCCASIONS
In the United States, ""on-trade"" drinking at bars and restaurants accounts for about 20% of spirits sales and 25% for beer, so off-premise drinking would need to keep growing by 25-30% to compensate.
The signs are it's already starting to slow.
While U.S. stores' alcohol sales are up a quarter since early March, the rate of growth slowed to 16% in the week to April 18, according to market research firm Nielsen. 
In Europe, bars generally account for a bigger proportion of alcohol sales, rising to 60% in Spain. In many developing countries, including China and Brazil and for beer in Nigeria and Ethiopia, at least half of drinking is in bars.
Cees 't Hart, the chief executive of Danish brewer Carlsberg (CO:CARLb), told Reuters that in Europe retail sales had already returned to normal after initial panic buying.
Dutch rival  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) noted that even store-bought alcohol was often designed for group events now barred in most countries. 
""Beer belongs to social occasions and these occasions for consumption are simply lost,"" Chief Executive Jean-Francois van Boxmeer said last month, after reporting beer volumes fell by a third in Italy and a quarter in Spain in March.
SUPPLY PROBLEMS 
Lockdowns have created other problems for drinks makers. 
They have had to suspend production in countries such as China, India, Malaysia and Mexico, where there was only about 10 days of beer inventory last week.
Draconian travel restrictions have also closed duty-free shops, a particular concern for spirits makers.
 Pernod Ricard  (PA:PERP), the maker of Absolut vodka and Jameson whiskey, has forecast an 80% decline of its ""travel retail"" business from February to June. 
In India, the world's largest whisky market, most alcohol shops were forced to shut in its countrywide lockdown. South Africa has banned all alcohol sales for more than a month.
As restrictions start to ease, it is not clear how quickly drinkers will return to old habits. 
Manit Parikh, the head of an English learning technology company in Bengaluru, said he was ""gutted"" at not being able to have a drink or two in the lockdown, but also scared to go to liquor stores when they reopened with long lines on Monday.
New York-based insurance industry temp Samantha Gool said she switched to more vodka from beer and her drinking increased when confined at home, although may have started to taper.
Spiros Malandrakis, head of alcoholic drinks research at Euromonitor International, believes there won't be a surge in demand as lockdowns gradually ease, with some bars going bust, social distancing limiting business and some customers wary of going out.
BOXED WINE AND MULTIPACKS
He also believes the crisis could spell the end, or at least the suspension, of an industry-wide trend of the past two decades - persuading drinkers to spend more on ""premium"" brands.
In the global financial crisis of 2008-2009, consumers traded down to cheaper products. And all the signs suggest the hit to jobs and economies from the coronavirus pandemic - at least in the short term - will be much bigger. 
Wine consumption in Europe is forecast to fall by 8% this year, with a particular hit for sparkling and vintage wines, according to the European Commission.
In beer, marketing agency InMarket says AB InBev's (BR:ABI) budget Busch Light has seen the sharpest increase in sales since early March.
In Europe, Carlsberg has seen consumers veer towards multi-packs, while Belgian supermarket chain Delhaize said its biggest increase in alcohol sales was boxed wine. 
Many smaller players, particularly once booming craft brewers, are suffering.
Last year, the number of breweries in Europe passed 10,000. Pierre-Olivier Bergeron, secretary-general of the Brewers of Europe, sees the European market dropping by a third.

""Some players have no channels to retail at all,"" he said. ""There will be people who will simply not survive.""

1007,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 03:20AM ET</span>",Britain's brewers and pubs tap customer loyalty to aid survival,"By Natalie Thomas
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's brewers and pubs were hoping this summer would be a repeat of 2018, when crowds drawn by the combination of sunshine and soccer resulted in the biggest increase in year-on-year beer sales for 45 years.
That hope evaporated in March when the government advised people to avoid pubs, then demanded they closed and then imposed a countrywide lockdown, all in the space of a week, as it fought to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Sim Cotton, who co-founded The London Beer Factory six years ago, was left with beer in his tanks that he is now selling in cans - Lifesavers, a 4% gluten-free lager, and National Heroes, a 4.2% American Pale Ale - with the proceeds going to two local hospitals in south London that are treating COVID-19 patients.
""The uptake's been amazing,"" he said. ""We've had a lot of support from our regular customers and also people caring about the NHS and wanting to show their support."" 
The company sells some of its range of IPAs, sour beers and stouts to Tesco (OTC:TSCDY), Britain's biggest supermarket, and it recently started selling online.
The web store, which it hadn't previously promoted, had seen transactions rise from three or four a day to as high as 123 after the pubs closed, Cotton said. But that will never replace sales to pubs and bars. 
""Drinking beer is part of socializing and you're never going to be able to replace socializing with your friends in pubs or restaurants,"" he said. ""The likes of House Party or Zoom definitely don't come close.""
The Society of Independent Brewers said last month many breweries were facing closure as beer sales had fallen 82%. 
Mark Allan, landlord of the Black Prince in Kennington, south London, is offering takeout food and drink to maintain some revenue and keep a connection with loyal customers.
""The response has been amazing,"" he said. ""I think everyone appreciates that we're here.""
Allan has been at the pub for 10 years, and signed a new 15-year lease on the afternoon before pubs were ordered to close.
He has accessed a government loan, furloughed staff and received a rent break from his brewery to stop the pub going under. ""There's no playbook for COVID-19,"" he said.
The British Beer and Pub Association said the coronavirus had had a big impact. ""Overnight, pubs had to close and breweries lost their primary access to market,"" Chief Executive Emma McClarkin said.
She said grants and the job retention scheme had helped, but more needed to be done, especially if pubs were closed for a prolonged period and had to adapt to social distancing when they re-opened. 
""Any substantial reductions in usable space or increased costs will inevitably result in a need for further government support if the Great British pub is to survive,"" she said.
Customer Rachel Low said she was supporting the Black Prince by buying food and drink until it starts serving pints again. 
""It's about the beer, it's about the company and it's about the food,"" she said. ""You don't get it in a home, you don't get it in a bar, you don't get it on a football field or anything like that, you get it in a pub. 

""And the absence of it, I think, will be felt by lots of people.""

Qantas from Thursday will begin a weekly flight from the country's north to Hong Kong carrying seafood and other produce from Queensland state, while Singapore Airlines will carry food from the state of South Australia, the government said.
Australia's trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said the agreements would help re-establish direct freight routes for exporters who have been struggling to ship overseas during the pandemic.
""We recognise the current COVID-19 crisis has placed immense pressure on local seafood exporters, many of whom felt the earliest impacts when overseas demand began to dry up in January,"" Birmingham said.
The flights will fall under a A$1 bln government fund to support regions, communities and industry sectors affected by COVID-19. Officials did not say whether the fund would pay for or subsidise the routes.
A mix of South Australian products, including chilled seafood, tuna, lamb, chicken meat and eggs, will be carried to Singapore, and later distributed to Hong Kong, Thailand and China.
About half of the air cargo carried worldwide in normal times flies in the belly of passenger jets rather than in dedicated freighters, but grounding of airplanes due to COVID-19 has made the market more dependent on freight haulers. 

The COVID-19 crisis has also forced many airlines to use their passenger fleets as temporary cargo carriers.

1010,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 02:40AM ET</span>","Yum China keeps bets on dine-in, sticks to expansion plans after virus","By Sophie Yu and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Yum China (N:YUMC) is betting that Chinese consumers will still choose to dine-in in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis and plans to open more Pizza Hut and KFC outlets in China's smaller cities in the coming months, its chief executive said. 
Joey Wat, CEO of the fast food giant, said that while the virus had driven up the takeaway rate at its businesses, it continues to see expansion opportunities especially in fourth- and fifth-tier cities where there are less Western dining options and fewer competitors. 
""If you want to have Western food, or a cup of fresh ground coffee, where can you go? Even the hotels don't have it. Pizza Hut is the only choice,"" Wat told Reuters in an interview.
""We will continue to be committed to the China market and we are here to stay for long,"" she said. Yum China said last month that it plans to open up to 850 new stores in China this year, having already opened 179 in the first quarter.
The government's travel curbs and quarantine measures aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, which emerged in China last year, forced hundreds of thousands of restaurants and eateries across the country to shut or revert to food delivery-only models in late January. 
Many, including Yum China's roughly 9,000 outlets, have since reopened in recent weeks as a sharp drop in coronavirus cases has prompted an easing of restrictions, and their progress in returning to normality is being closely watched globally as other countries prepare to loosen their own lockdowns. 
In reopening its restaurants, especially for dine-in, Yum China has made the wearing of masks and temperature checks mandatory at its outlets.
Wat said the virus had helped drive takeway demand for Pizza Hut, which only accounted for 5% of the chain's orders prior to the epidemic. 
Pizza Hut's takeaway rate has so far increased to 13% and ""may triple to 15% within this year,"" she said. ""So we are seeing some positive things come out of it.""
Yum China, which reported a 10% fall in month-to-date same-store sales in April, also plans to introduce more value-for-money options in view of how many customers may have been economically affected by the virus, and is looking to beef up its presence in the Chinese dining sector.
In April, it paid $185 million for a controlling stake in Huang Ji Huang group, a casual dining franchise business whose signature dish is a pot of meat and vegetables stewed in sauces that is designed to be eaten in groups. 
There are few sign that the virus is causing Chinese diners to fall out of love with hotpot style dining in spite of contagion fears, with consumers seen returning to such restaurants in recent months once curbs were lifted. 

""In China, the bulk of the catering industry is still Chinese food,"" Wat said. ""And we've seen that hotpot is the category growing with highest speed in recent years.""

1011,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>",Expect a bumpy recovery? Exchanges may provide an upside,"By Tom Westbrook, John McCrank and Gaurav Dogra
SINGAPORE/NEW YORK/BENGALURU (Reuters) - As market volatility has eased after the mayhem of March, investors betting on a rocky economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis are buying shares of exchanges that are poised to profit if more turmoil ensues.
The global exchange sector, which thrives in turbulent markets, has outperformed so far this year, falling only 2% in value compared with a 15% drop in world stocks, a Reuters analysis showed.
As countries around the world went into lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus, investors repriced the value of assets including stocks, commodities and derivatives, such as futures and options, to reflect recessions. That led to a surge in trading activity as investors tried to hedge positions, while others made bets on where markets were going to bottom out. 
Financial exchanges, such as Singapore Exchange Ltd (SI:SGXL), Deutsche Boerse (DE:DB1Gn) and New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), all saw profits jump as trading-based fee revenues surged.
Asia's bourses, which are more reliant on volumes than their global peers, have gained the most, the analysis showed, as investors reckon they are best placed to benefit from further volatility.
""I think on balance the trends that have been in place will continue for quite a while,"" said Scott Gilchrist, who manages an A$680 million ($440 million) portfolio of Japanese stocks at Australia's Platinum Asset Management (AX:PTM). 
""It's very hard to tell, but my sense - and it's only a gut feel - is that we haven't fully passed through this period of volatility yet,"" he said.
Gilchrist's fund has been increasing exposure to Japan's GMO Internet Inc (T:9449), owner of a forex trading platform where volumes have been surging, as has GMO's stock, up 9% this year, compared with a 17% drop on Japan's TOPIX index (TOPX).

The 2% decline in the sector globally is largely due to poor performers in Latin America and Africa, obscuring a standout run by Asia's bourses, led by Singapore's SGX, which is benefiting from the uncertain recovery.
""It's a really hard call to make,"" Michael Syn, head of equities at SGX, where profit hit a 13-year high last quarter amid record turnover, said of the outlook. Markets' optimism seems out of sync with the real economy, he said.
""Is the market pricing in a long future, saying, 'let's not worry about the detail of how we get there?' Or will it suddenly have an aha moment of 'oh my God, I didn't quite understand how bad things are.'""
SGX stock is up 7% this year, one of just two gainers on the national Straits Times Index (STI). 
Elsewhere, Deutsche Boerse is up about 3% year-to-date and NYSE-owner ICE is up just under 1%, compared to declines in the DAX (GDAXI) and Dow Jones Industrial (DJI) indexes of around 19% and 16.5%, respectively.
Graphic -  Singapore exchange 's out-performance: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwvkrzogpm/Singapore%20exchange's%20out-performance.jpg
ASIA'S STRATEGY PAYS OFF
Investors have sought out Asia's exchanges for their high exposure to trading volumes, driving share prices up almost 3% this year compared with declines of about 1% for U.S. exchanges and 5% in Europe.
Over the past decade as U.S. and European peers diversified by purchasing data providers and other adjacent businesses to bring in non-trading revenue, which is more stable, Asia's bourses tended to pursue new financial products, leaving them more dependent on trading revenues, but also with lower debt.
""Everyone's really concerned about recapitalisations, refinancing,"" said John Pearce, chief investment officer of Australian pension fund UniSuper, the top shareholder of domestic bourse operator ASX Ltd (AX:ASX). 
""Well, the ASX has got none of those concerns - it's got no debt and market volatility is actually positive for the ASX, so what you're really seeing is the market pricing it as a pretty stable annuity,"" he said.
Graphic - Exchanges monthly trade volume by region: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xlbvgnlkepq/Exchanges%20monthly%20trade%20volume%20by%20region.jpg
To be sure, a repeat of the stratospheric trade volumes of March seems unlikely, especially considering the scale and breadth of the liquidation during the sell-down.
But investors have pointed to Singapore's diversification across asset classes from forex to commodities, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing House Ltd's (HK:0388) exposure to China, and technology investment by ASX as boosting long-term prospects.
""Recent outperformance, or resilience, is driven mostly by market volatility,"" said Kristy Fong, senior investment director of Asian equities at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Singapore, whose funds own all three stocks. ""We see these stock exchanges as a good proxy for markets, and given that they are pretty much monopolies with good cash flow, it is quite a safe way to get exposure.""

MONETARY HEADWINDS
Policymakers responded to the coronavirus crisis by slashing interest rates and flooding markets with liquidity. That prevented a quick wave of mass defaults, boosting investor confidence and dampening the wild market swings of March. 
The potential for a prolonged bout of rock-bottom rates and lower volatility presents the biggest headwind for exchange operators.
Record trading volumes in the first quarter eased into the second quarter as volatility declined, Ed Tilly, chief executive of Chicago-based stock and options exchange operator Cboe Global Markets (Z:CBOE), said on an earnings call last week.
""No one can say with certainty how this situation will play out, but the path to recovery is unlikely to be linear,"" he said.
CME Group (O:CME), the world's biggest futures exchange operator and also based in Chicago, saw average daily volumes halve last month, compared with March.
Nevertheless, volumes are up from a year ago and CME's executives were upbeat about the outlook on an earnings call last week.
Other operators have seen silver linings, such as a surge in emergency capital-raising in Australia, benefiting ASX.
""I wish every company we owned was trading like ASX,"" said UniSuper's Pearce.

China's major state-owned banks including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (HK:1398) (SS:601398) and China Construction Bank (HK:0939) (SS:601939) have set up AICs to conduct debt-to-equity swaps in the past two years, as the country aims to cut leverage especially in state-owned entities and shift risks from banks.
Such AICs can now set up investment plans in market-oriented debt-to-equity assets including convertible bonds, debt-to-equity special bonds, ordinary shares, preferred shares and debt-to-preferred shares, China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said in a notice on Tuesday.
AICs can raise fund through private fundraising from qualified investors include families with at least 5 million yuan ($705,000) in net asset or individuals with annual income no less than 600,000 yuan in the past three years, CBIRC said. Insurance fund and pension fund can also invest in such debt-to-equity investment plans through AICs, it added.
The move comes as China has been taking a series of measures to expand direct financing via capital markets. Policymakers are carefully balancing the need for liquidity to revive the economy hobbled by the coronavirus pandemic and risks of higher inflation and improving leverage.
Beijing also announced plans last Thursday to create a public market for real estate investment trusts (REITs), aiming to channel personal savings and private capital into infrastructure projects without overstretching already debt-laden local government.

Companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) are now expected to report a 44.9% decline in earnings in the second quarter, down from a 40.4% drop forecast the week before.
For the third quarter, analyst expectations are now set for a 32.7% fall in earnings versus 29.1% a week ago.
While many governments in Europe have announced or started to implement strategies to gradually ease lockdowns set up to flatten the curve of the epidemic, there is currently little hope the economy will bounce back, let alone return to normal, before the first quarters of 2021.

Before the outbreak, analysts were expecting Europe to end in the first quarter a corporate recession, which lasted throughout 2019.

Tyson Fresh Meats, the beef and pork subsidiary of Tyson Foods, had indefinitely suspended operations at the Waterloo, Iowa plant on April 22 to contain the rapid spread of the coronavirus.
The company said all employees returning to work had been tested for COVID-19 and that any employee who tested positive would remain on sick leave until released by health officials to return to work. The statement did not provide further details.
Tyson Foods has also increased short-term disability coverage for employees to 90% of normal pay until June 30, the company said, adding that it had performed an additional deep clean and sanitization of the entire facility while the plant was idled.

The Waterloo plant, which will resume operations on Thursday, had been working at reduced capacity before it was shut late last month as the U.S. food supply chain faced disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 01:15AM ET</span>",GM investors want to know how much more coronavirus pain remains,"By Nick Carey and Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) - Investors want to know what kind of economic hit General Motors Co (N:GM) expects from the coronavirus pandemic as it moves forward, whether it needs to raise further cash and when North American vehicle production will resume when it reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. 
The Detroit automaker has slashed costs and made other moves during the COVID-19 outbreak, including suspending its dividend and share buybacks, closing its Maven car-sharing unit, delaying work on some product programs, reducing marketing budgets and cutting white-collar workers' salaries. It also added $16 billion to its cash position by drawing down credit lines.
GM also has suspended its 2020 profit outlook given the uncertainty.
Smaller U.S. rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) last month raised another $8 billion from corporate debt investors to further shore up its finances after previously drawing down its credit lines.
GM Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara warned employees in an internal video on March 26 that ""significant austerity measures"" were necessary to avoid ""serious damage"" to GM's long-term viability. 
One ray of hope has been China, where the pandemic began but where GM has resumed production. While first-quarter sales there fell 43%, they rebounded to grow by double digits in April. That offers hope for the U.S. market, where sales declined 7% in the first quarter. 
U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states reopening their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can safely restart.
GM, Ford and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) are aiming to resume production some time in May and are negotiating with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents their U.S. hourly workers, about when and how to safely restart. 
The Detroit automakers are anxious to end the cash burn that has occurred during the shutdown. While FCA said Tuesday it expects most of its North American plants to reopen by May 18, GM and Ford have not announced restart dates. 
The UAW said last month that it was ""too soon and too risky"" to reopen plants in early May. President Rory Gamble said last week the union was asking for ""as much testing as possible"" to protect its workers.
In its restart playbook, GM's strategy relies heavily on social distancing, temperature checks, regular sanitizing, improved plant ventilation and use of personal protective equipment, but does not address assembly line workstations.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer previously extended the state's stay-at-home order through May 15 but lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio allowed manufacturing to resume on Monday. 
Once production resumes, the question will be how fast U.S. demand rebounds, with some dealers expecting big discounts to lure consumers back to showroom floors. 
Some industry officials have said some level of government stimulus for the U.S. auto sector will be needed for consumers once the pandemic recedes.
During the Great Recession of 2008-09, the U.S. government rolled out a ""cash for clunkers"" program, which offered consumers rebates of up to $4,500 to trade in older gas guzzlers.
Other U.S. automakers already outlined the pain caused by the crisis.
FCA on Tuesday reported a first-quarter loss of $1.8 billion, said it expected a significant loss in the second quarter and scrapped its full-year profit outlook.
Last week, Ford said its second-quarter loss would more than double to over $5 billion from $2 billion in the first quarter. Executives said the current economic environment was too unpredictable to offer a full-year profit outlook.

Also last week, Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) reported its third consecutive profitable quarter, but the results were overshadowed by Chief Executive Elon Musk, who described as ""fascist"" the sweeping U.S. stay-at-home orders that have idled the electric carmaker's California plant.

1019,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2020 12:36AM ET</span>",Bond Investors Read Clear Message from ECB Ruling: ‘Watch Out’,"(Bloomberg) -- A critical German court ruling on the European Central Bank’s half-decade of quantitative easing is worrying the likes of Aberdeen Standard Investments and UBS Group AG (NYSE:UBS).
They’re concerned of a potential knock-on effect on the central bank’s latest stimulus to counter the coronavirus -- the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program -- that has served as a backstop to the euro zone’s most fragile bond markets in recent weeks.
Italy’s debt and the euro were jolted lower Tuesday by the German constitutional court giving the ECB three months to show how its first quantitative-easing program is in line with the law. It comes down to what constitutes “monetary financing,” effectively the subsidizing of government spending by central banks.
While the original public sector QE program has strict limits to avoid that, such as how much of each nation’s debt it buys, most of those do not apply to the emergency buying under the so-called PEPP. The ECB, which is considering how to respond to the court, may now have to be more careful how it buys debt.
“In their assessment the 33% bond issue limit, capital key and minimum credit ratings are all important to avoid monetary financing,” said Patrick O’Donnell, a money manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “The problem is that these have all been relaxed for PEPP and the market is demanding a significant upscaling of it.”
Still, any legal challenge to the current program could be a while coming, and potentially drag on until after the coronavirus pandemic has come to a close. The case against the original QE program has already been ongoing for around five years.
Aberdeen Standard’s O’Donnell is not taking any chances, with an underweight position on bonds from France, Italy and Spain -- namely the European nations that have a heavy reliance on the ECB’s asset-purchase programs. All three economies are threatening to contract by as much as 10% this year, blowing out fiscal deficits and requiring more borrowing in international debt markets.
While the ECB’s 750-billion-euro ($813 billion) pandemic program is set to snap up a lot of that, analysts at  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C). expect it to run out by mid-October at the current pace. They estimate it bought nearly 40 billion euros of Italian bonds in April alone.
“Market hopes about ever larger PEPP increases or capital key deviations could at least face some resistance,” said Christoph Rieger, head of fixed-rate strategy at Commerzbank AG (OTC:CRZBY).
ECB Surveillance
For UBS, it could begin to affect the ECB’s buying strategy now. Any purchases above the so-called capital key, which weights buying according to the size of a country’s economy and population, will likely have been done in shorter-dated bonds. The decision by the German court may mean support for that segment of the market dries up, it says.
Italy’s two-year bonds took the biggest hit from the court ruling, with yields rising much as 20 basis points Tuesday.
“This implicitly means ‘watch out for those limits,”’ said Jaime Costero, a rates strategist at UBS. “It delivered a clear message: do not be so soft, we are watching out you do not deviate from the capital key.”

1020,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 06, 2020 12:27AM ET</span>",Swedish Firms Pay Out Billions to Owners Despite Pleas to Stop,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of Sweden’s best known companies have ignored lawmakers’ entreaties to show restraint and paid out billions to shareholders, despite taking advantage of state aid programs.
The government of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven has shied away from placing explicit restrictions on dividends. As a result, companies including Volvo AB (OTC:VLVLY), Assa Abloy (OTC:ASAZY) AB and SKF AB (OTC:SKFRY) plan to pay out dividends totaling nearly 15 billion kronor ($1.5 billion) after cutting jobs and making workers reliant on state support.
Sweden’s parliament has voted through several emergency measures in response to the Covid-19 crisis. But none of those includes a ban on shareholder payouts. That’s despite a strongly worded appeal from parliament’s finance committee to suspend dividends for firms receiving state aid.
“The finance committee is unanimous in its position that such payouts are unjustifiable,” said Jakob Forssmed, a spokesman for the opposition Christian Democrats in Sweden’s parliament. “There should be a clear signal for large listed companies to act accordingly if they are interested in large subsidies from the state, regardless of legislation.”
The Social Democrat-led government has signaled that if companies go overboard enriching shareholders in the current environment, it will step in.
‘Swift Action’
Truck-maker Volvo plans to pay 11.2 billion kronor in dividends despite temporarily laying off all of its 20,000 staff in Sweden. SKF, meanwhile, will grant shareholders a dividend totaling 1.3 billion kronor at the same time as applying for about 40 million kronor in aid from the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth.
A spokesman for the Gothenburg-based bearings maker says people shouldn’t mix the issue of furloughed staff with dividends, which “have a very important function both for a working capital market and for our economy in general.”
It’s a view that’s also held by the head of the Swedish Bankers’ Association, who last month dismissed calls to cut dividends, arguing it’s a matter for boards to decide and the industry shouldn’t be blamed for the current economic crisis.
Read More: Swedish Bankers Reject Government Calls to Drop Dividends
But the issue of payouts isn’t going away for the Social Democrat-led administration. In response to questions on state broadcaster SVT on Monday, the country’s finance minister, Magdalena Andersson, said that including a restrictive dividend clause would have slowed down the government’s crisis-response.
“It was a trade-off between taking swift action and taking perfect measures,” Andersson said. “At this point we saw it as important to act promptly.”
But if dividend payments for affected companies become too generous, Andersson says her government “won’t hesitate to make changes to the legislation.”

1022,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 05, 2020 10:36PM ET</span>","For Merkel, Opening German Economy Proves Harder Than Shutdown","(Bloomberg) -- With the main tourist season fast approaching on the Baltic island of Usedom, Rolf Seelige-Steinhoff is itching to reopen his hotels after almost seven weeks of lockdown wiped out more than a quarter of the sales he was expecting this year.
“It almost feels like wartime for us, because our work collapsed under our feet from one day to the next,” said the head of Seetel, a 40-million-euro ($43 million) a year hotel group which is the largest on Usedom.
Like many other business leaders across Germany, Seelige-Steinhoff is eagerly awaiting a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and the 16 state premiers on Wednesday in which the government wants to hash out a roadmap for a gradual reopening of Europe’s largest economy.
Pressure has been mounting on Merkel in recent days to speed up the country’s exit from lockdown after the fight against the coronavirus outbreak sent the German economy into a tailspin. It is forecast to shrink by 6.3% in 2020, more than even during the financial crisis a decade ago, according to government projections.
After being forced to close since mid-March, economic hardship is eroding the patience of many businesses. From family-owned firms to the nation’s flagship airline  Deutsche Lufthansa AG  (OTC:DLAKY), many companies are struggling even though the government has fast-tracked more than 1 trillion euros in emergency loans and other forms of aid.
The Association for Small- and Medium-Sized Businesses, which represents the backbone of the Germany economy known as the Mittelstand, last weekend accused Merkel and the state leaders of a lop-sided focus on containing the pandemic that puts the country’s economic future in jeopardy. “Lift the lockdown before it’s too late,” the group said.
“We need clear and nationwide rules now on store opening hours,” said Stefan Genth, managing director of the country’s retail federation HDE, adding that the crisis will continue long after all retailers are allowed to sell their goods again. “Even with stores open people are only buying the minimum necessary,” he said.
Cautious Approach
Merkel has taken a cautious, step-by-step approach to relaxing the curbs imposed in the fight against the coronavirus, highlighting the fine balance governments across Europe are trying to strike between getting the economy going and preventing a second wave of infections.
Late last month, the government and the state leaders allowed some small shops, hardware stores and car dealerships to reopen, while this week hairdressers and, in part, schools have restarted. There’s also been a last-minute deal to reopen restaurants in mid-May, Deutsche Presse-Agentur reported on Tuesday night.
In the last few days it has looked as if the German chancellor might be struggling to achieve a consensus this time around. Several regional state leaders, eager to grab the public spotlight, have jumped the gun in recent days and announced their own easing plans, creating the potential for a patchwork of contradicting rules.
On Tuesday, Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder presented the state’s own timeline for reopening all stores, hotels and restaurants this month in what he hopes will serve as a blueprint for the rest of the nation.
Merkel’s Christian Democratic caucus leader on Tuesday criticized state premiers for announcing their own plans ahead of the consultations with the chancellor. “I urgently appeal to the state leaders to follow a coordinated course here”, Ralph Brinkhaus said on Tuesday in Berlin. In an effort to forge consensus, Merkel’s chief of staff, Helge Braun, has been working the back channels with his counterparts in the states.
Merkel, a trained physicist known for her methodological approach to crisis-management, had famously blasted early attempts at easing restrictions as “discussion orgies,” warning that a renewed outbreak could make the crisis longer and deeper.
At a caucus session on Tuesday, Merkel said further easing made sense at this stage as there has been a lot of progress in fighting the virus in the past few days, according to a participant of the meeting. But she also warned that if there is a renewed outbreak with more than 50 acutely infected per 100,000 inhabitants in a given region, then local curbs will have to be reinstated to prevent the virus from spreading.
Back in Usedom, Seelige-Steinhoff is hoping that the political leaders will come out with a clear timetable that will allow him to once again host guests from all over the country. In the meantime, he is going out of his way to adopt a comprehensive hygiene plan to help draw customers. Measures include distancing between waiters and dinner guests, laminating TV remote controls, and installing acrylic glass walls in front of the reception.
“We’re doing everything we can to keep guests safe,” he said. “The sooner we can reopen, the better.“

1023,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 10:05PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. airlines burn through $10 billion a month as traffic plummets,"By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - U.S. airlines are collectively burning more than $10 billion in cash a month and averaging fewer than two dozen passengers per domestic flight because of the coronavirus pandemic, industry trade group Airlines for America said in prepared testimony seen by Reuters ahead of a U.S. Senate hearing on Wednesday.
Even after grounding more than 3,000 aircraft, or nearly 50% of the active U.S. fleet, the group said its member carriers, which include the four largest U.S. airlines, were averaging just 17 passengers per domestic flight and 29 passengers per international flight.
""The U.S. airline industry will emerge from this crisis a mere shadow of what it was just three short months ago,"" the group's chief executive, Nicholas Calio, will say, according to his prepared testimony.
Net booked passengers have fallen by nearly 100% year-on-year, according to the testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee. The group warned that if air carriers were to refund all tickets, including those purchased as nonrefundable or those canceled by a passenger instead of the carrier, ""this will result in negative cash balances that will lead to bankruptcy.""
Separately, Eric Fanning, who heads the Aerospace Industries Association, will ask Congress to consider providing ""temporary and targeted assistance for the ailing aviation manufacturing sector,"" in testimony made public by the group.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co said last week it would cut 16,000 jobs by the end of the year, while GE Aviation plans to cut up to 13,000 jobs and airplane supplier Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE:SPR) Holdings Inc is cutting 1,450 jobs.
Fanning will say at the hearing that ""there is strong support in our industry for a private-public partnership to protect jobs and keep at-risk employees on the payroll through the pandemic,""
He will also raise concerns about some Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury lending programs that have ""conditions that prevent companies from accessing this aid with the speed and flexibility required.""
'DIFFICULT ROAD AHEAD'
U.S. airlines have canceled hundreds of thousands of flights, including 80% or more of scheduled flights into June as U.S. passenger traffic has fallen by 95% since March. They are conducting additional cleaning measures and requiring all passengers to wear facial coverings.
Calio said airlines ""anticipate a long and difficult road ahead. ... History has shown that air transport demand has never experienced a V-shaped recovery from a downturn.""
The U.S. Treasury has awarded nearly $25 billion in cash grants to airlines to help them meet payroll costs in exchange for them agreeing not to lay off workers through Sept. 30. Major airlines have warned they will likely need to make additional cuts later this year to respond to a long-term decline in travel demand.
United Airlines Co said on Monday it planned to cut at least 3,450 management and administrative workers on Oct. 1, or 30% of those workers and has also said it will reduce hours for thousands of other workers.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers sued United on Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York for what it called an ""illegal implementation of drastic pay and benefit cuts.""

United said in a statement that the lawsuit was ""meritless,"" and that the reductions were in compliance with the terms of its $5 billion in federal assistance and its collective bargaining agreements.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>","Disney takes $1.4 billion coronavirus hit, sets date to reopen Shanghai park","By Munsif Vengattil and Lisa Richwine
(Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co (N:DIS) estimated on Tuesday that global measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic cut profits by $1.4 billion, mostly from its shuttered theme parks, but said it would reopen Shanghai Disneyland to a reduced number of visitors next week.
It is unclear when Disney's other parks in Asia, the United States and France would again welcome visitors, executives said, or when the company's range of idled businesses including retail stores and cruise ships would return.
Disney said it will not pay a dividend for the first half of the fiscal year, which will preserve $1.6 billion in cash assuming it had kept the dividend constant at 88 cents per share.
Bob Chapek, who became Disney's chief executive in February just as the novel coronavirus was spreading around the globe, said Disney would reopen the Shanghai park on May 11.
The Chinese government has asked Disney to cap attendance at 30% of capacity, or roughly 24,000 people, Chapek said. Disney will restart operations with ""far below"" that number for a few weeks while it adjusts to new safeguards including social distancing, masks and temperature screenings, he said.
""While it's too early to predict when we'll be able to begin resuming all of our operations, we are evaluating a number of different scenarios to ensure a cautious, sensible and deliberate approach to the eventual reopening of our parks,"" Chapek said. 
Just three months ago, Disney was boasting about a record year for its movie studio and a strong start to the company's dive into the streaming media wars. 
In late January, the coronavirus started battering businesses across Disney's global portfolio when the company shuttered Shanghai Disney Resort and Hong Kong Disneyland. 
By mid-March, all of the company's theme parks were closed, movie theaters went dark, and television and film production were put on hold. Plus, Disney's ESPN sports network was left with no major live sports to broadcast. 
""In total, we estimate that the COVID-19 impacts on our current quarter income from continuing operations before income taxes across all of our businesses was as much as $1.4 billion,"" Disney said, adding that $1 billion of that came from losses at theme parks.
Disney posted adjusted earnings per share of 60 cents for January through March, down 63% from a year earlier and short of the 89 cents expected by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income from continuing operations dropped 91% to $475 million.
Shares of Disney fell 2.8% in after-hours trade to $98.30, after losing 2% during the regular session. Before the earnings report, Disney's shares had lost more than one-quarter of their value this year.
Disney is expected to take a larger hit in the current quarter, which ends in June. The company said it does not intend to provide financial guidance for the rest of the year. 
It has taken steps to cut costs, including putting 120,000 employees on furlough, according a filing with securities regulators.
Executives, whose salaries have also been reduced, said they were optimistic that Disney would rebound once the coronavirus crisis subsides.
""I have absolute confidence in our ability to get through this challenging period and recover successfully,"" said Executive Chairman Bob Iger, who stepped down as CEO in February.
Iger opened the call with a statement about Disney’s history of resilience before handing over to Chapek to address the company’s unprecedented challenges. 
One area gaining as audiences shelter at home is Disney+, the streaming service the company launched in November. Disney+ had 54.5 million paying subscribers as of May 4, up from 50 million on April 8.
The direct-to-consumer and international unit, which includes Disney+, is still spending large sums to build the service. The division lost $812 million in the just-ended quarter, less than the analyst forecast of $861 million.
At the parks, experiences and products division, operating income dropped 58% from a year earlier to $639 million.
Media networks, which include ESPN and broadcaster ABC, reported profit of $2.4 billion. That was a 7% increase from a year earlier, boosted in part by the addition of the FX and National Geographic Networks purchased from 21st Century Fox.
Profit at the movie studio fell 8% from a year earlier to $466 million. Disney released Pixar movie ""Onward"" just before theaters closed, then quickly moved it to video on demand for home viewers. 

Overall revenue for the quarter rose 21% to $18 billion, just ahead of analyst forecasts of $17.8 billion.

1025,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 05, 2020 09:18PM ET</span>",China’s Financial Markets Look Set for Another Post-Holiday Drop,"(Bloomberg) --
Here we go again: China’s financial markets have some catching up to do after an extended holiday, and most of it is bad news.
Mainland investors will have their first chance to react to the cautious shift in sentiment globally when onshore stock, currency and bond markets open Wednesday. International trading suggests a negative start to May: Chinese shares in Hong Kong sank more than 4% on Monday, while the offshore yuan is treading toward an all-time low.
On the bright side, China’s market reopen is unlikely to look anything like February’s, when stocks fell as much as 9.1% and the yuan tumbled the most in six months. A long list of targeted support measures since have eased concern over cratering domestic demand, and markets have stabilized. The nervousness this time will come from escalating political tensions with the U.S., with the blame-game over the origin of the coronavirus threatening to undermine a trade deal signed only months ago.
One key signal for the currency could come with the central bank’s daily fixing at 9:15 a.m. local time. A weaker-than-expected reference rate could show China is willing to let the yuan depreciate, while anything stronger could suggest it wants to limit declines. For stocks, investors are now putting a price on the bleak economic outlook globally that could hamper a recovery for corporate earnings after the worst start to a year since 2003.
After a steady but underwhelming month for Chinese assets, investors are counting on more stimulus from Beijing as the catalyst that will recharge the country’s financial markets. In April, the Shanghai Composite Index lagged the MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Inc. index of global stocks by the most in almost two years. The yuan eked out a small gain, while the yield on 10-year sovereign debt held near an 18-year low.
Currency traders aren’t expecting the yuan to go wild: at 6.4%, the offshore rate’s one-month implied volatility is below this year’s peak of nearly 10%. Its 12-month forward points, an indicator for investors’ bearishness, are near their 50-day moving average.
For China’s fixed-income market, the question is whether the looming wall of supply could derail this year’s rally in sovereign debt. Local governments are expected to sell some 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of bonds in May, the most on record. Commercial banks, which hold a large chunk of China’s sovereign debt, may switch into higher-yielding local government bonds.
The top focus for China investors going into the holiday was May 22, the start of the key annual meetings of the country’s top legislature. But renewed concern over trade -- at a time when overseas demand is already so weak -- could overshadow any measures China announces to help boost growth at home.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Venerable U.S. retailer Lord & Taylor plans to liquidate inventory in its 38 department stores once restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus are lifted as it braces for a bankruptcy process from which it does not expect to emerge, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
Lord & Taylor's preparations to liquidate its inventory as soon as its stores reopen offer a window into the grim future of a high-profile retailer - a storied department store chain founded in 1826 and billed as the oldest in the United States - that does not expect to survive the pandemic's economic fallout. 
On Monday, retailer J.Crew Group Inc filed for bankruptcy protection with a plan to avoid liquidation and reorganize its debts thanks to an agreement with its creditors.
Retailers that pursue a liquidation hold ""going out of business"" sales in order to generate cash, and their stores often become magnets for consumers looking for bargains. Lord & Taylor is holding off on a bankruptcy filing and subsequent liquidation until it can reopen its stores to attract those shoppers, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Lord & Taylor has lined up liquidators to help it run the ""going out of business"" sales and is girding to permanently close all its stores once the merchandise is sold, some of the sources said. The retailer had been exploring filing for bankruptcy among other options, including trying to negotiate relief from creditors and finding additional financing.
The sources said that it remained possible that external funding or some other intervention could rescue Lord & Taylor, and asked not to be identified because the liquidation preparations are confidential.
Lord & Taylor did not respond to a request for comment. 
Its stores are primarily in the northeastern United States, which has been hit hard by the pandemic, making the exact timing of the bankruptcy filing hard to plan, the sources said. Lord & Taylor also has stores in the Chicago area and Florida.
Fashion rental service start-up Le Tote acquired Lord & Taylor last year from Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson (NYSE:HUD)'s Bay Company for C$100 million ($71 million). 
Hudson's Bay kept ownership of some of Lord & Taylor's real estate and assumed responsibility for its rent payments, amounting to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Hudson's Bay may use the bankruptcy filing to take some of its leases back from the department store operator, one of the sources said.
Le Tote declined to comment. Hudson's Bay did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Other department store operators - already hit hard by competition from online rivals - are also struggling to survive. Neiman Marcus Group plans to file for bankruptcy within days, while J.C. Penney Company Inc is also considering a similar move, Reuters previously reported.
FAILING TO KEEP UP
Lord & Taylor is one of the world's oldest department store operators, founded by two English immigrants on the Lower East Side in New York City in 1826. During the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s, it opened a special section offering mourning apparel for widows. 
Lord & Taylor opened its flagship store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue in 1914, and became known for upscale fashion and its holiday window display. 
Investment firm NRDC Equity Partners acquired Lord & Taylor for $1.2 billion in 2006, when department stores were still doing well, and later it became a part of Hudson's Bay.
Long focused on upper middle class markets, Lord & Taylor once had nearly 50 locations but lost its way over the past decade as it struggled to distinguish itself from competitors Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) and off-price retailers such as TJX Companies Inc (NYSE:TJX). 
In 2019, Hudson's Bay sold the chain's flagship store to co-working space operator WeWork for $850 million.

Le Tote acquired Lord & Taylor to expand beyond e-commerce into brick-and-mortar stores. It took on Lord & Taylor's operations, including its merchandise, online business and most of its employees.

(Reuters) - U.S. agencies are probing  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co's handling of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for coronavirus relief, the country's fourth largest lender said on Tuesday.
The San Francisco-based bank has received ""formal and informal inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding its offering of PPP loans,"" it said in a regulatory filing without elaborating. (https:// A spokesman declined to comment on the nature of the probes. Wells Fargo faced a string federal investigations for most of the last three years after a sales practices scandal erupted in 2016. It wrapped up the last major probe into the issue in February, in a $3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission.Small businesses have filed lawsuits against U.S. banks including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co and Bank of America alleging unfair practices in processing loans under the program, including prioritizing larger loans over smaller ones. Wells Fargo started taking applications for the $350 billion rescue fund on April 4, one day after the official launch and a day later than Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. As of April 27 the bank had submitted more than 100,000 PPP applications to the Small Business Administration for review, Wells Fargo spokesman Manuel Venegas said on Tuesday. Companies with fewer than 25 employees account for 90% of those applications and 80% generate less than $2 million in annual revenue. The average loan size was less than $110,000, Venegas said. Wells Fargo initially capped its participation in the program at $10 billion due to the U.S. Federal Reserve's punitive curbs on increasing its balance sheet following its sales practices scandals. The bank expanded its role after getting permission to make loans under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act without counting them against the asset cap.

1029,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 05, 2020 07:18PM ET</span>","Occidental Takes $1.4 Billion Writedown, Cuts Budget on Oil Rout","(Bloomberg) -- Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY). took a $1.4 billion writedown related to an investment in a pipeline affiliate, cut capital spending and withdrew its guidance for the year after a historic collapse in oil prices.
Occidental’s first-quarter loss included impairment charges related to its equity investment in Western Midstream Partners (NYSE:WES) LP, the Houston-based company said in a statement Tuesday. The shale producer is reducing its budget for this year to between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion, a drop of more than 50% from its initial plan. Shares rose 4.4% to $16 in after-market trading in New York, while Western Midstream was little changed.
Occidental is more exposed than most of its rivals to the crash in crude markets after quadrupling its debt load to help finance last year’s $37 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp (NYSE:APC). Although Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub has so far survived an activist intervention by billionaire Carl Icahn, she’s now faced with a mountain of borrowings that start to come due next year.
Hollub has slashed capital spending, cut salaries and reduced dividends since the oil-price plunge began two months ago. Western Midstream is among the crown jewel assets that Occidental has sought to sell to reduce leverage.
Hollub’s strategy took another hit as Algeria opted to block the sale of assets acquired in the Anadarko deal to Total SA (NYSE:TOT). The sale, along with another in Ghana, was expected to raise somewhere in the range of $5 billion.
Occidental recently hired boutique investment bank Moelis (NYSE:MC) & Co. to help examine ways to reduce its debt load, Dow Jones reported, citing unnamed sources. The bank is expected to work with an advisory committee of the board of directors, Dow Jones reported.

Occidental had a $670 million first-quarter loss on interest rate swaps and $580 million in charges related to international oil and gas properties. The company said the charges were partially offset by $1 billion of gains on crude oil hedges.

1031,By Investing.com,"<span>May 05, 2020 06:24PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for May 6,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - Stocks ended higher today, but late selling took the shine off the rally.
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said that the unemployment rate could hit levels the country hasn’t seen since the 1940s, which trimmed gains in the major indexes in late trading.
The market will get private-sector employment numbers ahead of trading Wednesday.
There will be the weekly inventory numbers for oil investors and earnings from the payment and auto sectors.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Private Payrolls Expected to Drop by 20M
The countdown to Friday’s historic employment report begins Wednesday with a measure of April’s private sector job situation.
“One of the greatest surprises to many during this health crisis has been the surge in layoffs in the health care industry,” Grant Thornton Chief Economist Diane Swonk said in a note Sunday. “The fear of going to dental and doctor offices and contracting COVID-19 prior to national lockdowns in March had already triggered the largest ever drop in health care jobs in a single month.”
ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) issues its payrolls report at 8:15 AM ET (12:15 GMT), the first full measure of a month the country spent on lockdown restrictions.
Economists expect that private sector payrolls plunged by 20.05 million, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Some market watchers tend to overlook ADP numbers as they can diverge greatly from the official figures, but as we’ve seen in the case of oil inventories, when numbers get this large the divergence become less significant.
2. Oil Inventories on Tap
Official weekly oil inventories numbers will be reported tomorrow with prices on roll, cruising higher in almost every recent session. Prices rocketed more than 20% higher in today’s trading.
The Energy Information Administration will post its figures for crude stockpiles for the week ended May 1 at 10:30 AM ET (14:30 GMT).
Analysts predict that inventories rose by about 7.8 million barrels last week, which would be down from the build of 9 million barrels in the previous week and continue the downward trend.
After the bell today, the American Petroleum Institute said its measure of inventories for the week ended May 1 rose by 8.4 million barrels, compared with a rise of 10 million barrels the week before.
3. PayPal, GM to Report
Among earnings reports tomorrow, online payments company PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) will issue numbers after the close of trading.
The company could see some benefit from the rise of e-commerce during lockdown restrictions, but investors will be looking for strength in guidance as well with shares near an all-time high.
Analysts are looking for a profit of 76 cents per share and revenue of $4.75 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
General Motors(NYSE:GM) will report before the bell, with investors likely keen on how zero-percent financing offers have helped the automaker.
GM is predicted to have earned 50 cents per share in the quarter on sales of about $32.5 billion.
Online food delivery company Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) and drugstore chain CVS, both important indicators of the lockdown economy, will also report earnings tomorrow."

(Reuters) - Airbnb Inc is laying off 25% of its workforce, or nearly 1,900 employees, the home rental startup said on Tuesday, as the COVID-19 pandemic brings global travel to a near standstill. 
""Airbnb's business has been hit hard, with revenue this year forecasted to be less than half of what we earned in 2019,"" founder Brian Chesky said in a memo to employees.
Reuters reported about the move earlier on Tuesday. The laid off employees in the United States will get 14 weeks of base pay plus one additional week for every year at Airbnb, the company said.
With millions of tourists canceling plans for vacations, work trips and family visits, Airbnb earlier this year said it was allocating $250 million to help offset losses incurred by hosts.
In late March, it suspended its marketing activities to save $800 million in 2020 and informed workers that its founders will take no salary for the next six months while top executives would take a 50% cut.
Last month, Airbnb said private equity firms Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners would invest $1 billion in the startup, raising its cash reserves to around $4 billion. 
The fund would be used to attract more hosts or homeowners who list their properties for rent on its platform, Airbnb had said.

However, the vegetarian burger maker suspended its 2020 forecast as the COVID-19 pandemic hit demand for the company's plant-based meat products at restaurants. 
Closure of dine-in areas and restrictions on movement have severely dented sales at restaurants, including Beyond Meat's restaurant partners McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) Inc, Dunkin Brands Group Inc and  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX) and have forced them to rethink how to service customers through limited operations. 
Beyond Meat Chief Executive Officer Ethan Brown told Reuters on Tuesday that food service sales in March were about 23% lower than what the company had expected, while sales at retail outlets were up 12%. 
Sales at its U.S. food service channel rose 156% to $22.6 million in the first quarter, while sales grew 57% to $18.6 million in the international food service business. In contrast, it had posted a 312% growth in the overall restaurant and food service business in the previous quarter. 
""Like most food businesses, we have felt the impact but by no means is it destabilizing the business,"" Brown said. Packaged food makers, including  Hershey Co  (NYSE:HSY), Kellogg (NYSE:K) Co and  Mondelez International Inc  (NASDAQ:MDLZ), have all pointed to weakness in their food service channel in their recent earnings calls. 
To combat the weakness in its food service business, Beyond Meat has been doubling down on its expansion in retail outlets, the most recent being its partnership with Amazon Fresh. 
""We're repurposing lines that were running for food service to retail ... So this is not about just waiting this out, it's about how do we reroute to get to the consumer,"" Brown said. 
Beyond Meat's products are currently sold by grocers including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s Whole Foods. 
Overall, Beyond Meat's quarterly net sales rose 141.4% to $97.1 million, the slowest growth in at least five quarters, but beat Wall Street estimate of $88.3 million, according to IBES Refinitiv data. 
Net income was $1.8 million, or 3 cents per common share, in the three months ended March 28, compared with a net loss of $6.6 million, or 95 cents per common share, a year earlier. 

Analysts on average were expecting it to post a loss of 7 cents per share.

(Reuters) -  Mattel Inc  (O:MAT) will have a new line of ""Baby Yoda"" toys ready to hit shelves in time for Christmas, the company said on Tuesday, as it looks to chart a recovery from a steep drop in first-quarter sales due to the coronavirus lockdowns.
The toymaker said its global manufacturing and distribution facilities, including in China where it produces 60% of its products, were largely back to operating at full capacity, echoing rival  Hasbro Inc 's (O:HAS) comments from last week.
Mattel Chief Executive Officer Ynon Kreiz, however, cautioned that while he was expecting demand to increase towards the vital end-of-year holiday shopping season, any ramp up in production would be dependent on evidence of consumer demand rising in the coming months.
The company's shares fell nearly 10% to $7.77 in extended trading, adding to an over 36% drop so far this year.
While Mattel did not provide a forecast for the second quarter, Hasbro had warned of a hit to sales in the in the current quarter.
Mattel, known for its Barbie and Hot Wheels toys, said net sales fell 14% to $594.1 million, in the first quarter ended March 31, short of analysts' estimates of $652.7 million, as toy stores were forced to close in strict government lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus.
Kreiz told Reuters retail outlets, which normally account for about a third of Mattel's sales volumes, were closed at the end of March.
Still, Mattel said it shipped about 750,000 plush toys based on the viral Baby Yoda character from the ""The Mandalorian"" Star Wars series on Disney+ in March and April and would be ready to meet holiday demand.
The company's net loss widened to $210.7 million, or 61 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $176.3 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.
Excluding items, Mattel lost 10 cents per share, a penny more that what analysts had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Mattel said it had $1.6 billion credit line and enough cash on hand to weather through the crisis.

(Reuters) - Vegetarian burger maker Beyond Meat (O:BYND) plans to offer large value packs and discounts to some U.S. retailers this summer, hoping to grab a larger share of the market as prices for beef rise due to COVID-19-related production disruptions.
The value packs, which will be frozen, and the greater-than-normal discounts are aimed at narrowing the price gap between Beyond's plant-based burgers and beef, an issue analysts see as a hurdle to widespread adoption of Beyond's burgers. 
""It's putting us closer within range and we're going to try to further reduce that gap,"" CEO Ethan Brown told Reuters. He noted however, that the discounts would be temporary.
""We're not going to do anything on long-term pricing,"" he said. 
The coronavirus crisis has idled U.S. meat plants and slowed production. Some processors shut large slaughterhouses as the respiratory illness spread among workers.
Prices for beef shipped to wholesale buyers in large boxes have climbed to record highs as the coronavirus has reduced production as consumers want to start grilling hamburgers and steaks and as restaurants seek to reopen. 
Beyond posted better-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday, but suspended its 2020 forecast due to the uncertainty surrounding its business brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit demand for its plant-based meat products at restaurants.

Beyond Meat's premium in the market can be pronounced. During the first quarter, Beyond's ground beef and beef patty alternatives were priced at around double and triple the price per pound of traditional ground beef, according to  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC).

DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Airways is planning to cut a significant number of jobs because travel has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, and told cabin crew to prepare for redundancies, according to a company notice seen by Reuters.
The state-owned airline, one of few global carriers still operating scheduled services, said in March it was burning through its cash reserves and would eventually seek government aid.
“We have to face a new reality, where many borders are closed, rendering many of our destinations closed and aircraft grounded as a result, with no foreseeable outlook for immediate, positive change,” Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker said in the notice to cabin crew.
“The truth is, we simply cannot sustain the current numbers and we need to make a substantial number of jobs redundant - inclusive of Cabin Crew.” 
A Qatar Airways spokesman confirmed a number of roles were being made redundant due to the impact of COVID-19. 
""The unparalleled impact on our industry has caused significant challenges for all airlines and we must act decisively to protect the future of our business,"" the spokesman told Reuters.
Neither the notice or the spokesman said how many jobs would be cut.
A Qatar Airways spokesman had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters outside of normal business hours on Tuesday.
Affected employees would be paid their contractual dues and any owed overtime, the notice said, and those who are not able to immediately return to their home countries would be provided with housing and a living allowance until such a return was possible.
The airline said last month some staff would have their wages halved for at least three months though would be later paid back.
Qatar Airways Group, which counts the airline among its assets, had 46,684 employees at the end of its last reported financial year in March 2019.

Rivals Emirates and Etihad Airways have temporarily slashed wages as they try to weather the crisis, while budget carrier Air Arabia earlier on Tuesday said it had laid off 57 employees.

Edwin Coe and Harris Balcombe said they wanted to challenge the British subsidiary of Allianz on behalf of businesses, such as restaurants and leisure groups, whose policies had been arranged by brokers JELF and Marsh (N:MMC).
Officials at Allianz were not immediately available for comment.
A government-ordered national lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus has forced many companies in Britain to temporarily suspend operations and furlough staff in an effort to survive as the economy faces a deep recession.
But many who had hoped that business interruption insurance policies would help cushion their losses have been disappointed.
Top insurers such as AXA (PA:AXAF),  Hiscox  (L:HSX), RSA (L:RSA), QBE (AX:QBE) and Zurich (S:ZURN) already face potential multi-million pound lawsuits from British pubs, hotels, restaurants and leisure groups that allege legitimate business interruption claims have been rejected.
Insurers have said that very few such businesses' insurance policies extend to the pandemic, but that they were paying valid claims.

Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulator said last week it would urgently ask the courts to clarify uncertainty over whether businesses can claim compensation for disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The broader market eased from session highs as Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Richard Clarida suggested that the economy may need more stimulus served as a reminder that the underlying economy remains in trouble, hurting investor sentiment. Clarida also said unemployment could hit levels not seen since the 1940s. 
Healthcare stocks led the broader market higher as investors digested positive news on the drugmakers' efforts to produce a coronavirus vaccine.
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) ended 2.3% up after announcing it had begun testing a potential coronavirus vaccine in the United States.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) rallied 5.8% after reporting earnings that topped consensus estimates. The healthcare company also said it was on track to begin human trials of its experimental coronavirus antibody cocktail in June.
Technology built on its positive start to the week as chip stocks and FAANG names, excluding Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), ending in positive territory.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) confirmed it will host its annual worldwide developers conference virtually, beginning June 22.
Energy, meanwhile, was supported by a rally in oil prices as major oil producers cut supply, while the easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures that had hampered economic activity for several weeks boosted hopes of a recovery in oil demand.  
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) raised its estimate for WTI Crude prices in 2021 to $51.38 per barrel from $48.50 on expectations that oil output cuts and the reopening of economies would ease the glut in supply.
“Oil production has started to decline quickly from a combination of scaleback in activity, shut-ins and core-OPEC/Russia production cuts,” Goldman Sachs Equity Research said, according to Reuters.
""Demand is also beginning to recover from a low base, led by a restarting Chinese economy and inflecting transportation demand in developed market economies,” Goldman added.
With the economy set to reopen, the White House is reportedly discussing scrapping the White House coronavirus task force, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters.
“We’re having conversations about that,” Pence says in a briefing the task force held for reporters, confirming an earlier report by the New York Times."

1051,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>","BMW cuts margin outlook for cars division, citing coronavirus woes","FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (DE:BMWG) on Tuesday lowered the outlook for the profitability of its automotive and motorcycles divisions, citing worse-than-expected demand which has been hit by measures to contain the coronavirus. 
BMW said it expects the earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin for the automotive segment to fall within a range between 0% and 3% this year, adjusting its outlook from a previously expected margin range of between 2% and 4%.
""The decisive factor for the adjustment is that the measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic are lasting longer in several markets and are thus leading to a broader negative impact than was foreseeable in mid-March,"" BMW said. 
Delivery volumes in these markets will not rebound within a few weeks as BMW had assumed, with the highest negative impact now expected in the second quarter of 2020, the carmaker said, cautioning that matters could still get worse.
""The updated guidance does not, in particular, include, a longer and deeper recession in major markets, a more severe economic slow-down in China as a result of recessions in other parts of the world,"" BMW added. 
Further margin pressure could come from market distortions caused by an even stronger competitive environment or from a second wave of infections and associated containment measures.
The Munich-based group further said it now expects deliveries of motorcycles to be down significantly from 2019 levels. 
The EBIT margin in the motorcycles segment will now be within a range of between 3% and 5%, rather than 6% and 8%, BMW said.
Last month BMW warned it was expecting a further decline in global demand even after a 20.6% drop in first-quarter sales to 477,111 vehicles.
BMW said in March that its pre-tax profit and vehicle deliveries would drop significantly this year as the coronavirus spreads, and that this - combined with higher research and development spending - would lower the profit margin in its automotive segment.
BMW is due to publish first-quarter earnings on May 6.

1055,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>",Senators press Trump pick for top U.S. spy on China in era of coronavirus,"By Patricia Zengerle and Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators pressed Donald Trump's nominee to lead U.S. intelligence on Tuesday on whether he would act independently of the president on hot-button issues like the origins of the coronavirus in China, as lawmakers held the first socially-distanced hearing during the coronavirus pandemic.
Both Republicans and Democrats at the Senate Intelligence committee's confirmation hearing wanted to know how Representative John Ratcliffe would manage pressure from Trump, a president who has often been at odds with the intelligence community. 
The three-term House member, who fervently supported Trump during impeachment repeatedly pledged to act independently.
""The intelligence I deliver will not be subject to outside influence,"" he said.
Many questions for the Republican nominee to head 17 U.S. intelligence agencies centered on coronavirus and China, which Trump has partly blamed for the devastating impact on the United States.
The cavernous hearing room was eerily empty, as the Senate observed strict protocols to protect against the spread of coronavirus. Ratcliffe said that, if confirmed, he would focus on the virus's impact, questions about its origins in China and U.S. competition with Beijing.
""If confirmed, the intelligence community will be laser focused on getting all the answers that we can regarding how this happened,"" Ratcliffe said.
Trump's administration and the government in Beijing have been engaged in a bitter war of words over how the coronavirus spread, as the illness has killed more than 60,000 Americans and cratered the country's economy, complicating Trump's run for re-election in November.
Ratcliffe said he views China as the greatest threat to the United States, on many fronts. ""I won't say all roads lead to China, but a lot of them do,"" he said. 
Trump nominated Ratcliffe, a member of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee since January 2019, to be director of national intelligence last summer. The nomination was dropped amid questions about his lack of experience and partisan reputation but the Republican president nominated him again this year.
Now, a few Republican committee members, including committee chair Richard Burr, promised they would back Ratcliffe, while stressing the need for the director to be politically independent.
PARTISANSHIP
Democrats appeared unconvinced.
The committee's top Democrat, Senator Mark Warner, said he was concerned about partisanship from Ratcliffe, a strongly outspoken supporter of Trump during impeachment hearings last year, especially regarding intelligence oversight and whistleblowers.
""I still have some of the same doubts now as I had back in August,"" Warner said.
There has been no Senate-confirmed Director of National Intelligence since August, when former Republican Senator Dan Coats retired. The current acting DNI, Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, is seen as a fierce Trump partisan. 
Trump and aides have sharply criticized intelligence officials, accusing them of working for a ""Deep State"" seeking to undermine his presidency.
Ratcliffe repeatedly praised them.
""I don't think that the men and women of the intelligence community are running amok,"" he said.
Burr, who privately criticized Ratcliffe when his name was first floated last year, promised the Republican-majority panel would quickly recommend Ratcliffe to the full Senate. Trump's fellow Republicans hold a narrow 53 to 47-vote in the chamber, and he needs 51 votes for confirmation, so approval is likely.
Trump infuriated Democrats and attracted criticism from some Republicans by firing Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who sent Congress a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump sought to persuade Ukraine's president to collect potentially damaging information on former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Trump political rival.
That report became central to Trump's impeachment.
Much about the hearing was unusual, or unprecedented. Ratcliffe's family did not attend. 
Some staff and senators wore masks into the room, but removed them to speak. Ratcliffe did not wear a mask. Members of the press were limited to a small number, who provided pool reports.
Burr closely questioned Ratcliffe about his view of Russian interference in U.S. elections. The nominee said he agreed that Russia sought to sow discord in the United States and interfere in the 2016 and 2018 campaigns.
Trump has rejected intelligence community conclusions that Moscow sought to boost his candidacy. 

""I will deliver the unvarnished truth, it won't be shaded for anyone,"" Ratcliffe said under questioning from Senator Susan Collins, one of the Senate's most moderate Republicans.

1056,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 05, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft Sued by California in Major Gig-Economy Crackdown","(Bloomberg) -- Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc. and  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT). were sued by California for allegedly violating a new state law designed to give gig-economy workers the benefits of employees.While expected, the lawsuit filed Tuesday in state court marks a serious threat to the business model of an array of companies that save on labor costs by classifying workers as independent contractors. If the companies ultimately lose the suit, they could be forced to pay for overtime, health care and other benefits.
The complaint “asserts that Uber and Lyft gain an unfair and unlawful competitive advantage by inappropriately classifying massive numbers of California drivers as independent contractors,” California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said during a virtual press conference. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego joined the legal action, which was filed in San Francisco.
Shares of Uber and Lyft each fell more than 3.9% after the news, erasing most of their gains Tuesday.
“We are looking forward to working with the Attorney General and mayors across the state to bring all the benefits of California’s innovation economy to as many workers as possible, especially during this time when the creation of good jobs with access to affordable healthcare and other benefits is more important than ever,” Lyft said in a statement.
Uber said it will fight the lawsuit.
“At a time when California’s economy is in crisis with four million people out of work, we need to make it easier, not harder, for people to quickly start earning,” the company said in a statement. “We will contest this action in court, while at the same time pushing to raise the standard of independent work for drivers in California, including with guaranteed minimum earnings and new benefits.”
The lawsuit comes at a vulnerable time for the ride-hailing companies, which have been reeling from revenue losses caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The impact of shouldering the cost of worker benefits could be significant for the companies, with some analysts predicting as much as a 30% price increase. The exact cost may become more clear Wednesday and Thursday when Lyft and Uber report quarterly performance and discuss the coming quarter.
Signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom in September, the law known as Assembly Bill 5 took effect Jan. 1. It says workers can generally only be considered contractors if they perform duties outside the usual course of a company’s business. For Uber, that would mean arguing that driving isn’t the company’s usual course of business.
“When giant corporations like Uber and Lyft refuse to follow the law, we all pay the price,” California Labor Federation executive secretary-treasurer Art Pulaski said in an emailed statement. “When Uber and Lyft refuse to pay their fair share for unemployment insurance and other programs that are a lifeline to out-of-work drivers, taxpayers foot the bill while the bank accounts of the companies’ millionaire executives swell.”
Uber, the biggest of the gig-economy companies, has successfully fought numerous lawsuits over the years challenging its drivers’ status as contractors, settling some with modest payouts but without changing its business model. A.B. 5 gives California’s attorney general and city attorneys the ability to prosecute companies and block their operations if they’re found to be mis-classifying employees as contractors.
Because the suit is brought by the government and not by a private plaintiff, Uber and Lyft also can’t use any agreements signed by workers to shunt the dispute into arbitration.Public officials are more likely to get the courts to move quickly and unlikely to settle any cases without first demanding significant changes in how the companies do business, said Charlotte Garden, an associate law professor at Seattle University.
“This increases the likelihood that the key question -- whether drivers are employees under CA law -- finally gets resolved,” she said before the case was filed.
Uber saw the lawsuit coming. In December, it joined with another food delivery provider, Postmates Inc., in a preemptive lawsuit against California arguing A.B. 5 is unconstitutional because it singles out gig-economy companies and exempts some industries that rely on contractors. A judge rejected their request to temporarily block the law.
Uber and other gig firms have been bankrolling an effort to change A.B. 5 through a ballot measure, and have separately engaged in talks aimed at securing a deal with labor leaders and lawmakers to legislatively amend it.
Uber has made changes to its ride-hailing service in an effort to diminish the amount of control it exerts over drivers, which has traditionally been a key part of determining whether workers are employees or contractors.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",Some Canadian banks freeze new financing for commercial properties on COVID-19 concerns,"By Nichola Saminather
TORONTO(Reuters) - Some Canadian banks have frozen new lending for smaller commercial property purchases, in some cases withdrawing letters of intent, as the coronavirus crisis raises concerns about owners’ ability to make payments, mortgage and real estate brokers said.
The tighter lending environment will likely result in a rise in distressed sales of commercial properties in coming months as buyers vanish, industry players said.
With most businesses shut due to public health measures aimed at curbing the pandemic, major banks are also declining to refinance property for owners who are trying to move from more expensive alternative lenders as their rental income dries up.
""If you’re a landlord, and looking to refinance, you can’t get that,"" said Roelof van Dijk, director of market analytics at  CoStar Group  (NASDAQ:CSGP). ""So you’re probably going to have to sell. But they're also limiting new owners who might want to buy that space.""
Some owners who are unable to sell their properties are refinancing with alternative lenders at higher rates, adding to pressure on the struggling small to medium business sector.
Mortgage Outlet broker Shawn Stillman said two clients who had letters of intent signed to refinance with Bank of Montreal were told the bank was no longer financing commercial rental properties. His clients, whose mortgages were up for renewal at private lenders, refinanced with another alternative lender, at three percentage points higher than BMO's rate, he said.
BMO did not respond to requests for comment.
Alternative lender Equitable Group has seen steady loan volumes versus an expected decline, driven by fewer new originations by the big banks, said Darren Lorimer, vice-president for commercial lending at the bank.
Equitable anticipates the migration of borrowers spurned by the big banks will lead to ""better quality opportunities than we would have seen in the past,"" he said.
Canada’s largest bank, Royal Bank of Canada, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said they are both honoring offers made before the COVID-19 crisis.
Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada (OTC:NTIOF) declined to comment. Toronto-Dominion Bank did not respond to requests for comment.
Where banks are still lending, many are asking for additional proof of ability to make payments, particularly those in hard-hit industries like retail, said Mark Cascagnette, managing partner at commercial real estate firm Lee & Associates Toronto.
Concerns about valuations of properties are also giving lenders pause, as appraisals typically use sales from 45 to 60 days ago, said Anthony Contento, chief executive of Sherwood Mortgage Brokers.
""For properties that were purchased two months ago ... what are they worth today during this crisis?"" he said.
The federal government's commercial rent assistance program - forgivable loans to help landlords reduce rent owed by struggling tenants - could make it more difficult for applicants to get financing for commercial properties, CoStar's van Dijk said.
""To be eligible for (the rent relief) program you have to prove that your tenant has had a dramatic loss of business, and is really suffering,"" van Dijk said. ""(But) then to go to the banks, and say 'don’t worry, the tenant is going to continue doing business when we get out of this' is a hard sell.""

1059,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 05, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>",Fed Is Propping Up Companies It Had Warned Banks Not to Touch,"(Bloomberg) -- For years, the Federal Reserve warned that too many highly risky companies were engaging in fuzzy accounting that bumped up their earnings -- making it easier for them to obtain loans. The practice was driving up corporate debt to excessive and worrisome levels, regulators chastised.
But now, in its latest effort to keep credit flowing, the Fed has done a remarkable about-face. It essentially endorsed the dubious practice with a program that may serve to bail out some of America’s most leveraged companies.
The Fed move “rewards the worst abusers,” said Mark Carey, a former Fed official and co-president of GARP Risk Institute, the research arm of an association of risk managers. “People will see this as a backstop and in the future they will be encouraged to take on really high leverage.”
The reversal came in the Fed’s announcement last week to expand its Main Street Lending Program to allow more small and medium-sized businesses to qualify for as much as $600 billion in loans. That was widely applauded. But less noticed was a provision that allows companies that had used the widely-abused accounting techniques in the past to seek the loans.
At issue is the trend among many leveraged companies to “adjust” a key measure of their results -- known as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda -- to make them appear more creditworthy. After intense lobbying by business groups, the Fed has now said those adjusted earnings can be used for the Main Street lending program, rather than those under generally accepted accounting standards.
The ability of companies to goose projections, like counting expected savings from a cost-cutting program, is generally legal and an accepted practice. But it can distort the lending process and raises questions about their ability to repay loans. That’s especially crucial now. Unlike the government’s Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses, the Main Street loans are required to be paid back.
Moral Hazard
The Fed included some guardrails in the program to limit losses. The banks that originate the loans are to have skin-in-the-game by holding between 5% to 15% of the loan amount. And loans for part of the facility must have ratings that could exclude the most aggressive debt.
Carey and others also note that the Fed’s motivation -- to lend support to even more businesses and to prevent widespread waves of bankruptcy from further hobbling the economy -- is understandable. But they also worry about the message it’s sending to companies and lenders, that the central bank will bail them out regardless of how egregious their actions, a concept known as moral hazard.
“As the Fed issues alarms about certain assets going forward, it raises the question whether private sector participants will listen to it,” said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income.
The Fed’s historic action, lending directly for the first time since Word War II, came after Congress set aside capital to to support lending to smaller businesses. The first announcement, on March 23, allowed companies with high-yield bonds or leveraged loans to participate as well. In weighing their credit strength, the Fed said that it would consider their Ebitda. But the market was left confused by whether that meant adjusted or standard Ebitda.
The latest statement on April 30 clarified what the Fed meant: Adjusted would be accepted.
‘Material Loosening’
That marks a stark contrast with a series of Fed warnings going back to 2013 aimed at reining in risky lending practices. A Fed official in 2018 noted “material loosening of terms and weaknesses in risk management,” particularly in adjustments to Ebitda.
“The presence of these practices, especially without the appropriate controls, may lead to safety and soundness concerns,” Todd Vermilyea, a senior Fed official, said in a speech.
And two years before that, Fed bank supervisors cautioned  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). over risk to a debt deal it arranged to fund a $4 billion buyout of Ultimate Fighting Championship, according to people familiar with the matter at the time. Regulators were concerned about UFC’s use of accounting adjustments that more than doubled its Ebitda projections.
That was just one of many changes to Ebitda that have flared into a serious and pervasive problem in recent years, regulators and market players have said. These adjustments, known as add-backs in accounting lingo, increased from an average 9% at the start of 2015 to well north of 20% in 2019 for merger-related leveraged loan issuance, according to research firm Covenant Review.
Inflating Ebitda can help an indebted company borrow more, and in the process distort the loan-to-value ratio that guides the $2.9 trillion market for junk bonds and loans in the U.S. and Europe.
To see how adjustments affect creditworthiness, loans involved with mergers and acquisition last year had debt loads that were 5.5 times its Ebitda. But take out the adjustments and that ratio jumps to an extremely high 7.5 times, according to Covenant Review.
The new Fed lending facility says debt can be no more than 6 times earnings to be eligible for two of the programs.
But for companies that have played the adjustment game, that leverage cap becomes less relevant, said Scott Macklin, director of leveraged loan strategies at asset manager AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB).
“We foresee the ability for companies which are far more levered than 6 times to take advantage of the program given the creative adjustments to Ebitda often marketed,” he said.

Under government orders issued Tuesday, JetBlue can halt flights to 16 major U.S. cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, Houston, Seattle and Las Vegas, while Spirit can halt flights to six airports including Phoenix, Denver, Minneapolis and Seattle. 

Since March, U.S air travel demand has fallen by about 95%. U.S. airlines are cutting costs, canceling flights, parking planes and struggling to stay afloat. As a condition of receiving federal grants, they must continue most existing flight routes unless they receive specific approval from U.S. regulators.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - 3M Co (N:MMM) won an injunction from a federal judge against a New Jersey company it accused of illegally using its trademarks to sell 3M-branded N95 respirator masks at inflated prices to exploit the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan on Monday blocked Performance Supply LLC of Englishtown, New Jersey from using 3M's name and logo, or posing as an authorized 3M distributor, to help sell masks.
3M, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, is the world's largest maker of N95 masks, which are designed to filter 95% of airborne particles.
It said it sued after learning that Performance Supply tried to sell 7 million masks to New York City's Office of Citywide Procurement for $43.85 million, or an average $6.26 each, according to its invoice.
3M said the markup was roughly five times its list prices of $1.02 to $1.31 per mask, depending on the model, and amounted to ""extreme"" price gouging.
Performance Supply could not immediately be reached on Tuesday for comment. 3M has filed at least 10 similar lawsuits in several courts, and the preliminary injunction is its first.
""The goal from the start has been to try to get rid of 'static' in the system so that procurement officers don't have to sort through misleading offers, and we can get our respirators where they need to be,"" William Childs, a senior counsel at 3M, said in an interview.
Judge Preska said Performance Supply's conduct would likely irreparably harm 3M's reputation if it continued.
She also said an injunction served the public interest, and governments, hospitals and other healthcare providers should not have to squander resources to investigate the masks' origins.
""When lives are at stake and time is of the essence, as is clearly the case in this crisis, the public interest demands accountability,"" Preska wrote.
New York City is part of the epicenter for the pandemic within the United States.

3M in January doubled its annual production rate of N95 masks to 1.1 billion. Chief Executive Mike Roman said last week that the company is working with the U.S. Department of Defense to boost annual production to 2 billion by year end.

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes jumped on Tuesday as a recovery in oil prices lifted battered energy stocks and a slew of countries eased coronavirus-induced restrictions in an attempt to revive their economies.
Some hard-hit countries, including Italy, as well as a handful of U.S. states are tentatively easing stay-at-home orders this week, raising hopes for a recovery in oil demand.
All the major S&P 500 sub-indexes were trading higher, with the energy sector (SPNY) rising 2.4%, but the index is a big laggard across sectors with a 36.6% decline this year.
Healthcare stocks (SPXHC) were also in the spotlight with  Pfizer  Inc (N:PFE) up 2.8% after it announced a venture with its German partner had started delivering doses of its experimental coronavirus vaccines for human testing in the United States.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (O:REGN) jumped 5.6% as it said its experimental antibody cocktail for COVID-19 may be available for use by the end of summer or fall, as it ramps up efforts to start human trials in June.
Market-leading growth stocks such as  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) provided the biggest boost for a second day.
The S&P 500 (SPX) has climbed about 30% from its March lows on the back of unprecedented stimulus measures and signs of a plateau in new COVID-19 cases in many parts of the world.
""We are in the hope mode regarding the rebound that will come once the economies reopen,"" said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist for  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) in Chicago.
However, many market experts have warned the rally could be tested amid a risk of another wave of virus infections and with growing evidence of the damage to the economy and corporate America.
Data on Tuesday showed the domestic services sector recorded its first contraction in nearly 10-1/2-years, while the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) non-manufacturing index showed a smaller-than-expected decline.
Investors are now bracing for data on the labor market through the week with expectations of another staggering initial jobless claims reading on Wednesday and nonfarm payrolls for the month of April due Friday. 
""It's all about the mood swings and hopes of the economies reopening. But the problem is this could change once we get to see some of the hard numbers, especially the employment report,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) will sell new shares at a 79% discount to the latest traded price on the Oslo Bourse, the budget carrier said on Tuesday as it seeks to boost its equity in order to qualify for Norway's government aid package.
Shareholders on Monday approved a plan to convert nearly $1 billion of debt into equity and raise up to 400 million crowns ($39 million) from the sale of new shares to help the airline survive the coronavirus pandemic.
Norwegian aims to sell new shares at 1.0 crown each, it said, far less than Tuesday's closing price of 4.80 crowns as it seeks to attract investors even while the debt conversion leads to a massive dilution of ownership stakes.
The company plans to raise between 300 million and 400 million crowns, and has so far secured commitments from investors planning to buy shares for more than 100 million crowns, it added.
The debt conversion and share sale will allow Norwegian Air to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion crowns, which hinge on a reduction in leverage, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
If the process fails however, Norwegian Air is at risk of running out of money by mid-May even though it only pays invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, it said on April 27.
The debt conversion will hand majority ownership to the airline's creditors and could leave current shareholders with just 5.2%, and with further dilution for owners who do not take part in the share issue.
The airline that brought Europe's low-cost business model to the transatlantic market, flying more people to New York than any other non-U.S. carrier, has now grounded 95% of its fleet and furloughed or laid off most staff.
For the next 12 months, Norwegian plans to fly only seven aircraft, all on domestic routes in Norway, targeting a gradual expansion next year and a return to normal operations in 2022, albeit with a reduced short-haul and long-haul network.
Even with the ongoing financial restructuring, Norwegian will need additional cash to finance its eventual return to international markets, it said last month.
Airlines around the world have been hit hard by the pandemic's impact on travel, with many forced to turn to governments for state aid to avoid bankruptcy.
U.S. billionaire investor Warren Buffett last week said Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) had sold its stakes in U.S. carriers in April, adding to the sense of crisis around the industry.

After taking in a record $18.6 billion last month, those exchange-traded funds kept luring cash in early May, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. In only two trading days, they added another $786 million. Meanwhile, the three biggest S&P 500 ETFs all had outflows in April -- only the second month that’s happened since they started trading, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report.
“In times like these, active managers will stress the importance of security selection versus a broad-based approach,” said Lance McGray, head of ETFs at Advisors Asset Management. “You’re seeing a lot of investors trying to pick winners and avoid losers in this environment.”
The most closely-watched earnings season in history, now winding to a close, has thrown the difference between companies thriving from economic shutdowns and those decimated by it into sharper focus. While almost every sector ETF saw inflows in April, health-care and technology funds led the intake.
At the same time, the three biggest broad-based S&P 500 funds -- SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, or SPY (NYSE:SPY); iShares Core S&P 500 ETF, or IVV; Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, or VOO -- collectively lost $8.4 billion.

DETROIT (Reuters) - The union that represents U.S. hourly workers at Detroit automakers gave its tacit approval on Tuesday for the companies to restart production amid the coronavirus pandemic, after  Fiat  Chrysler said it expected to reopen its North American plants on May 18.
The United Auto Workers union has been negotiating with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU), General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) over how and when to safely restart U.S. production after widespread lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
""We continue to advocate for as much testing (for the disease) as possible at the current time and eventually full-testing when available,"" UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement. ""As for the start date, the companies contractually make that decision and we all knew this day would come.""
FCA said as it reported its first-quarter results that it expected to restart its North American operations on May 18.
GM and Ford have not announced restart dates, but the Detroit companies want to resume production so they can start bringing in much-needed cash. 
U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of cases of the novel coronavirus jumped. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states reopening their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can safely restart.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer previously extended the state's stay-at-home order through May 15, but lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio allowed manufacturing to resume on Monday, and Whitmer is facing increasing calls to follow suit. 
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk was highly critical last week of the various states' stay-at-home orders, which have idled the electric carmaker's California plant. He called the policies ""fascist."" 
Ford said on Tuesday it had not determined when to restart North American production. 
""We are continuing to assess public health conditions, government guidelines and supplier readiness to determine when the time is right to resume production,"" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said in an email.
Last week, Ford outlined the safety measures it will institute to restart its U.S. plants and said getting clearance from Michigan would be the last step. GM and FCA have instituted similar measures at their plants.
GM officials could not immediately be reached to comment.
Gamble, who had previously said early May was ""too soon and too risky"" to resume production, said his own family would be among those reporting to plants. His previous rule for automakers was asking whether they felt it was safe enough to send their own family members into plants.
Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said last week he would ""absolutely"" be comfortable having his family working at a Ford plant, given the steps taken to ensure employee safety.
""We must implement and follow these guidelines and self-reporting procedures we have worked out,"" Gamble said on Tuesday, referring to guidelines on worker health and safety. 

""And the UAW will fulfill its role to continue to actively monitor and aggressively respond regarding all issues impacting the health and safety of UAW members in whatever manner may be necessary as we return to the worksite.”

1070,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Book a table for fast food? Burger King trials post-lockdown app in Italy,"By Elvira Pollina
MILAN (Reuters) - Burger King is trialling an app for ordering food and booking a table at its outlets in Italy, as it seeks to persuade locals it is safe to eat out again after more than two months of coronavirus lockdown. 
Like other fast food chains, sandwich outlets and coffee shops, Burger King, which serves an average 11 million people a day in 25,000 restaurants around the globe, is worried that social distancing rules and fear of contagion will put people off from popping into its stores to grab a burger and chips.
""We need to be good at showing people that it's safe to come to a place which is perceived as being crowded, and give them options so they understand there is a safe way to come in,"" Andrea Valota, Burger King's chief in Italy, said in an interview.
The chain plans to start testing the app in three of its Milan restaurants as soon as they are allowed to fully reopen, which is expected from June 1. If successful, the app could be used in other countries, Valota said. 
Almost all of Burger King's 220 outlets in Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the virus pandemic, have been shut since the government imposed tight restrictions on people's movements and forced businesses and shops to close in early March. 
The chain, which on average serves 20 million people a year in Italy, gradually reopened around 40 restaurants for home delivery during the lockdown. Since May 4, when some restrictions were lifted and about 4.5 million Italians returned to work, it has been selling burgers at drive-through points. 
Valota said the pandemic could change consumers' behaviour ""for a year or two."" 
The app will allow customers to order food, pay and book a table from home before making their way to the restaurant. Alternatively, they can book a take away order.
Around a third of the tables in restaurants during peak hours - usually 12-2 p.m. and 7-9 p.m. - will be reserved for this use, Valota said. Social distancing rules will more than halve capacity inside restaurants, he added. ""If you have 100 tables, now you can use just 40 of them at the same time."" 
By doing this, he said the chain hoped to keep its revenues stable, without giving figures. In normal times, around 70% of restaurant revenues come from customers eating in. The hope is to reach at least 50% with the new system, he said. 
""The rest should be made thanks to drive through and home delivery, which before the crisis was really marginal,"" he said. 
The chain has also reorganised its kitchens to keep workers further apart. Staff are being divided into teams to limit mixing and are encouraged to wash their hands every 30 minutes.

The shelter-in-place orders have boosted demand for essential products, including home office products, cookware and kitchen appliances and children's furniture, at a time when most Americans are working from home and limiting their time outdoors.
""Home is becoming an area that customers are disproportionately investing into, and I would expect that to persist for a while,"" Chief Executive Officer Niraj Shah said on a post earnings call.
Wayfair said it saw a pickup in both traffic and sales starting in mid-March. Its executives added that the sales momentum has carried into the current quarter, with its quarter-to-date gross revenue growth trending up roughly 90% from a year earlier.
""We are seeing not just robust new customer acquisition but also strong repeat trends from both long-term loyal and recently added new customers,"" Chief Financial Officer Michael Fleisher said.
The Joss & Main furniture e-store owner has also been benefiting from the temporary closure of physical furniture stores in the United States, as it posted a 19.8% increase in sales in the first quarter ended March 31, helped by a surge in orders in the month of March.
Fleisher, however, said Wayfair's performance thus far puts it on a trajectory to achieving positive consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter even without the impact of the virus-led rise in sales it is experiencing. 
 Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) analyst Zachary Fadem said Wayfair, in an unexpected fashion, delivered a narrative-changing message, as recent cost efforts are bearing fruit in the form of a second-quarter profit inflection.
The company's first-quarter net sales of $2.33 billion beat Wall Street estimates of $2.31 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Wayfair also said the number of active customers in its direct retail business increased 28.6% to 21.1 million as at the end of the quarter, from a year ago.
The company, however, posted a net loss of $2.30 per share, but was smaller than the average analysts' estimates of a loss of $2.60 per share.
Wayfair's shares, which have increased over 81% this year, were up 22.2% at $163.89.

The Swiss bank is cashing in on the infamy of the U.S. Oil Fund LP, known as USO (NYSE:USO). It’s issuing fresh shares in a note that lets clients bet the $3.5 billion product will see calmer days after its near 80% plunge this year.
Using what’s known as a covered-call strategy, the X-Links Crude Oil Shares Covered Call exchange-traded note, ticker USOI, is structured to outperform if USO stays locked in sideways trading. A prospectus published last week showed the bank is adding 2.2 million shares, worth $54 million.
The world’s largest oil ETF captured headlines last month after retail investors got burned with ill-timed bets on a crude rebound. Amid negative prices, USO was forced to re-tool its methodology and took other extraordinary steps to prevent shuttering.
Now as the dust settles, Credit Suisse reckons it can tap fresh demand for traders seeking steady income from investing in oil futures.
Despite this week’s bounce in crude prices, oil looks stuck in a quagmire of weak demand and oversupply. Meanwhile USO’s issuer has upended how it tracks the commodity -- potentially capping both its gains when front-month oil futures rise and price swings going forward.
All of that looks set to boost the Credit Suisse strategy.
“USO implied volatility is obviously quite high, for good reason,” said Benn Eifert, chief investment officer at QVR Advisors. “But USO methodology changes have stabilized it somewhat, reduced left tail risk and reduced the volatility it should experience.”
Income Hunt
The Credit Suisse product holds shares of USO while simultaneously writing call options. The premium generated from selling those contracts is designed to provide a steady income. Since its 2017 inception, it’s outperformed its bigger sibling by around 19% on a total return basis.
The strategy isn’t without its risks. Like all covered-call products, it will underperform if USO goes on a tear. Also, if implied volatility of the ETF drops, it will earn less premium from selling the options contracts, hitting its dividend.
A spokesman for Credit Suisse declined to comment.
As investor interest in USO drops off in the wake of the tumult, the Swiss bank may be betting that investors will flock to its note as a viable alternative. Recent data from online trading platform Robinhood shows a drop in customers holding the beleaguered fund.
“The retail interest in USO has finally started to fade,” said Ole Hansen of Saxo Bank.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>","Thomson Reuters cuts sales outlook, narrowly misses earnings estimates","By Nick Zieminski and Kenneth Li
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Thomson Reuters  (TO:TRI) cut its full-year sales outlook due to disruption to the global economy from the coronavirus crisis on Tuesday as it reported higher quarterly sales and earnings which fell slightly short of Wall Street estimates.
The company, controlled by Canada's Thomson family, said it was targeting a $100 million cost reduction program to address the changed business environment and noted it has no debt due until 2023. It said it has enough liquidity for the next 12 months and does not expect to change its dividend payout.
The news and information provider, which owns Reuters News, reported a 2% rise in first quarter revenue to $1.52 billion, helped by gains in its legal and corporates businesses, and said operating profit rose 6% to $290 million. 
Adjusted earnings of 48 cents a share were 1 cent below Wall Street expectations, according to Refinitiv. 
Thomson Reuters (N:TRI) U.S.-listed shares were flat in early trading, while its Toronto-listed shares were down 0.9%. The stock had dropped by about a third between late February and late March, but has since recovered most of those losses. 
Thomson Reuters forecast total revenue growth of 1%-2% this year, below its February estimate of 4.5%-5.5%, saying its business of selling information and software electronically and by subscription was not immune to the global economic downturn.
""These were impressively stable results,"" said Matt Arnold, an analyst with Edward Jones, who cited Thomson Reuters' recurring revenues as a source of strength. 
""Its ability to weather the downturn is very high. Thomson provides mission critical information that businesses need. They're still looking at growth for this year,"" Arnold said, adding that it was ""very hard to find"" companies which were growing in the current tough business climate.
""We don't plan any layoffs at this point in time,"" Steve Hasker, who succeeded Jim Smith as chief executive of Thomson Reuters in February, said in an interview with Reuters. ""We are focused on investing in our business.""
Chief Financial Officer Michael Eastwood, said Thomson Reuters would continue to seek opportunities as part of a $2 billion acquisitions budget. But the company does not expect to buy back shares in the near term, he told analysts on a conference call.
Executives said they would evaluate potential targets that may come up at the end of this year or early in 2021, adding that it was too early to predict when world markets may recover.
The company has spent $1.3 billion through the beginning of the year and Hasker, who was formerly president of Nielsen (N:NLSN), said any purchases would be considered ""bolt-ons"" to existing businesses and not in new sectors. 
REFINITIV SALE
The coronavirus pandemic has brought major economies to a halt, pushed millions into unemployment as businesses shutter, and emptied trading floors around the world as companies scrambled to slow its spread among their workers. 
Thomson Reuters executives said that they aimed to cut discretionary expenses, while nearly all the company's own 24,000 employees have been working remotely during the outbreak. 
Reuters News revenues were flat at $155 million, while organic revenues fell 4% due to COVID-19 related cancellations of events in the Reuters Events business, the company said.
Thomson Reuters also said it expects the sale of data company Refinitiv to close in the second half of 2020. 

 London Stock Exchange  (L:LSE) said last month it was committed to completing its $27 billion takeover of Refinitiv, in which Thomson Reuters has a 45% stake, with no plans to revise savings targets as recession looms.

U.S. meat manufacturers, including  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN), have signaled disruptions to food supply as they are forced to shut many meat plants to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
""Beef suppliers across North America are currently facing production challenges. Because of this, some of our menu items may be in short supply from time to time at some restaurants in this current environment,"" a Wendy's spokesperson said.
The burger chain, known for its fresh-never-frozen patties, said it would continue to supply hamburgers to all of its restaurants, with deliveries two or three times a week. 
Just before the virus outbreak in the United States, Wendy's launched a new breakfast menu that included sausages, eggs, croissant and a hamburger variation in the hopes of attracting more footfall in the morning, a crucial daypart for restaurateurs.
The pandemic has also led to rival McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) trimming its menu to serve drive-thru and delivery customers faster, while its dine-in operations remain shut. Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski last week told analysts that the company has had no break in supply till date.

Several retailers including  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and Costco Wholesale Corp (O:Cost) have also limited meat purchases per customers.

""E-commerce saved us in April... It was our strongest performing vertical across the board,"" Chief Strategy Officer Matthew Fassler said on a conference call with analysts.
XPO is courting new e-commerce business and squeezing costs via warehouse and other automation projects since losing two-thirds - or $600 million - of its Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) business early last year.
The company's shares, which topped $114 in September 2018, jumped almost 13% to $71.85 in early trading on Tuesday and were at $68.96, up 8%, in late morning. 
The company's e-commerce services include pack and ship, returns management and ""last mile"" delivery of big and bulky items like furniture and exercise equipment - all of which have seen an uptick due to stay-at-home orders aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 250,000 people around the world. 
Online sales of products for home offices, home improvement and do-it-yourself projects are up, said XPO executives, who noted increased shipments of everything from home gym equipment and electronics to appliances and home and garden supplies. 
""E-com is a good place to be right now. And fortunately, we have a good exposure to it. It's not the majority of our business, though,"" Fassler said.
The transportation and warehousing company, which does not break out e-commerce results separately, on Monday said net profit tumbled more than 51% in the first quarter. Its core transportation segment revenue declined almost 8%, due to demand destruction wrought by the pandemic and the loss of business from Amazon. 
Excluding e-commerce and food and beverage, ""all other parts of transportation logistics did not perform well from the middle of March until the end of April,"" Fassler said.

MILAN (Reuters) -  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) plunged to a first-quarter loss of $1.8 billion and warned of a ""significant"" loss this quarter, even as it prepares to reopen its most profitable North American truck plants on May 18 as coronavirus lockdowns ease.
The Italian-American company, which has struck a binding merger deal with France's PSA Group (PA:PEUP) to create the world's fourth largest carmaker, said on Tuesday that work on the tie-up was ""progressing incredibly well.""
On a conference call, Chief Executive Michael Manley said ""the terms of the deal have not changed"" and FCA (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) remained ""committed to completing the transaction by the end of this year or early 2021.""
Car sales across the world have slumped as measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic forced production lines to shut and showrooms to close, leaving manufacturers scrambling to try to conserve cash. 
Manley said a planned 1.1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) dividend was under review, as part of FCA's efforts. The company also scrapped its full-year earnings forecast.
FCA has begun reopening plants in China and Europe, and said most of its North American ones were expected to reopen on May 18.
In the United States, UAW president Rory Gamble responded to the planned restart by saying automakers must ""implement and follow the guidelines"" for worker safety that the union had worked out with them. The union had objected to automakers' original plans to reopen in early May. 
Much of FCA's revenue and profit comes from North America, where quarterly sales of its Ram truck brand were up 7% from the previous year and its share of the full-size pickup market rose to 24%.
Capital expenditure (capex) was up in the quarter, driven by spending on the new Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, and redesigned Jeep Grand Cherokee models. But executives said full-year capex estimates would be trimmed by 1 billion euros as key programme launches had been delayed by an average three months.
'SIGNIFICANT IMPACT'
FCA said it made a net loss from continuing operations of 1.69 billion euros ($1.83 billion) in the quarter. That compared with a 508 million euro net profit a year earlier.
""The pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact on our operations,"" the company said in a statement.
However, FCA still made an operating profit, albeit 95% lower than a year earlier. Adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) amounted to 52 million euros.
FCA's Milan-listed shares extended their gains after the results were released and were up 2.2% at 1355 GMT.
The automaker said that due to the continued uncertainty related to the pandemic, it had withdrawn its full-year guidance and would update it when it had better visibility of the overall impact of the crisis.
In February, the group guided for an increase in adjusted EBIT to more than 7 billion euros this year and industrial free cash flow of over 2 billion euros. 
In the first quarter, industrial free cash flow was around minus 5 billion euros. But FCA said it had available liquidity of 18.6 billion euros as of March 31, including a 6.25 billion revolving credit facility which was fully drawn down in April. 
Liquidity was further strengthened last month with a new 3.5 billion euro incremental bridge credit facility, which remains fully undrawn.
""We continue to assess all funding options,"" FCA said.

1087,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 05, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",America’s Reopening Will Depend on One Thing: Trust,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- As America’s economic reopening fitfully proceeds, it is becoming clear that it will require a precious resource often in short supply: trust. Americans are about to see a new referendum on how strong is the glue that holds them together.
Should you show up again for work? It depends how much you trust the pronouncements of your employer that the work space will be safe. Should you send your children back to school? That depends on how much you trust the school system. Should you go to that block party? It depends on much you trust your neighbors about where they’ve been and who they’ve seen.
The problem is that such trust can never be absolute. No matter how much parents like the local schools, for example, or would trust them on other issues, child-to-child transmission of Covid-19 still may occur. The risk of infection cannot be eliminated, and schools have never been world-class performers in the monitoring and control of disease.
I find that when I order takeout, I am patronizing the two local restaurants whose proprietors I know best. Yes I like their food, but I also have been impressed by their seriousness and dedication of purpose, and I trust they will undertake the necessary safety precautions. One of those restaurants serves cuisine from the Wuhan area of China, and the virus is not something they take lightly.
My preferences here might not be completely rational. But I expect many people will feel the same way: They will want to buy from people they know and respect.
The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic brought serious economic damage for thinly capitalized face-to-face retailers, such as small family-owned restaurants. But many of those same institutions will lead the recovery — that is, if they have built up trust among their patrons. If they ask me to sit outside to eat my meal, I will trust that their kitchen procedures are “clean enough,” because I believe that the boss is watching.
It is also worth asking whom I do not trust. When it comes to providing a fully clean and safe store, I do not trust most of the big-box retailers. I trust them just fine in ordinary times, but no single manager can oversee the entire cleaning and disinfectant operation. And can they monitor Covid-19 in the air? If they tell me that “all possible precautions have been taken,” I might believe their words, but I won’t believe that is enough.
I will also remain skeptical of the airlines. Like most American travelers, I’ve experienced lost bags, canceled flights and inexplicable delays. I am not a complainer by nature, yet still I would classify my experience in 44 years of flying as “OK to good.” I’m not afraid of a plane crash, but when it comes to risking Covid-19 exposure … I’m going to wait a bit longer.
Not only must customers trust businesses, but businesses must also trust customers — and customers will have to trust each other. At a bare minimum, businesses have to trust their customers not to show up with visible symptoms of Covid-19, as well as trust that they haven’t engaged in high-risk activities more generally. Right now many or possibly most carriers are asymptomatic, yet most businesses do not have the capacity to test customers for Covid-19, which they would want to do if the tests were reliable, which they aren’t.
I’ve found that customers are much better and more tightly masked at my local organic supermarket, which was never so crowded anyway. The one quick inside shopping trip I did was to that venue, as much a mark of trust in the customers as in the owners.
The NBA is wondering if it can resurrect its playoffs at a dedicated location with television coverage but no audience in the stands. So far the teams are hesitant, in part because they are afraid of public resentment if the league’s millionaire players have access to Covid-19 tests while the general public does not.
The reality is that if the NBA announced it was buying up a lot of tests, it would boost the supply of tests. That could provide testing with valuable positive publicity, with the NBA serving as a role model for what other businesses might do. Yet the NBA does not yet trust its fans to see things in such a positive light, and so reopening is delayed. There might be some danger to playoffs games without fans, but surely less than in, say, collegiate or professional football, where injuries and concussions are built into the very nature of the competition.
In sum: Americans are about to find out just how trusting a nation this is. We might not like everything we learn.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened higher on Tuesday as the sight of more and more states relaxing lockdown measures fostered hopes of a robust rebound from the current collapse in economic activity.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 297 points or 1.3% at 23,047 points, while the S&P 500 was up 1.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.4%.
The market was supported by strength in energy stocks as crude oil prices continued their recovery from recent lows. The lifting of lockdown measures is underpinning demand for gasoline, while a number of U.S. producers both big and small have recently announced they will lower output, contributing to the general rebalancing of supply and demand. Index heavyweights Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock rose 4.9% and 3.8% respectively to test two-month highs. U.S. crude futures, meanwhile, were up 18% at $24.06 a barrel.
According to analysis by Evercore ISI, the share of Americans living under state-wide stay-at-home orders has fallen from over 90% in mid-April to only 60% as of this week, and is expected to fall to around 5% by the first week of June. 
However, that reopening comes at the risk of a fresh pickup in infection rates. The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has revised its estimates for the U.S. death toll from Covid-19 sharply higher on the basis of current knowledge about the timing of state reopenings. It now expects around 135,000 U.S. deaths by early August, according to The Wall Street Journal.
In a relatively busy morning for pharma stocks,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) rose 2.4% to its highest in over three months after announcing the start of human testing for its prospective coronavirus vaccine, a project it's developing together with German-based Biontech  (NASDAQ:BNTX). Biontech stock rose 7.9%. 
Elsewhere, Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN) stock rose 5.2% after its Dupixent treatment for eczema more than doubled sales in the first quarter, generating a better-than-expected set of results at the group level. Meanwhile, Alexion Pharmaceuticals  (NASDAQ:ALXN) stock fell 4.1% after it agreed to buy Portola (NASDAQ:PTLA) at a premium of more than 100% to its current market value.
Underperformers included car hire firm Hertz Global (NYSE:HTZ), which fell 13% after a report saying that it may file for chapter 11 bankruptcy as early as this week. Worth $15 billion in 2014 before the rise of Uber (NYSE:UBER) and  Lyft  (NASDAQ:LYFT), the company with nearly $10 billion in sales last year is now valued at aroumd $500 million. Uber, meanwhile, rose 5.0% after announcing it intends to discontinue the loss-making Uber Eats services in eight markets across the globe."

Lufthansa Technik, a subsidiary of the German airline Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), would not disclose the name of the A380 customer in a statement.
Half of air cargo normally travels in the belly of passenger jets rather than dedicated freighters. But the grounding of two-thirds of the world’s fleet has led to demand for cargo.
As a result, Lufthansa Technik and other aircraft maintenance and engineering companies are seeing a windfall of new work, Reuters reported last week.
Since regulators have said passenger cabins are not designed for cargo, special temporary permission is needed.
The A380, the world's largest passenger airliner, is being retired by carriers and will cease being produced by Airbus in 2021.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 09:11AM ET</span>",Lufthansa has no plans to buy rivals hit by coronavirus crisis: CEO,"By Ilona Wissenbach
FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) is not planning to buy rivals weakened by the coronavirus crisis, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr told shareholders at the company's virtual annual general meeting on Tuesday.
The carrier, which is preparing to restart passenger flights slowly from June, is currently in talks with governments about a roughly 10 billion euro bailout and Spohr said that he expected a deal with Germany shortly. 
""Our focus is on stabilising Lufthansa in its current form and not on acquiring other airlines. We are not planning a takeover at this time,"" he said, adding that consolidation among European airlines will slow down due to government bailouts.
Travel bans have forced the German carrier to ground 700 of its aircraft, leading to a 99% drop in passenger numbers and causing the group, which includes Swiss, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines, to lose about one million euros ($1.1 million) in liquidity reserves per hour.
Lufthansa's rescue deal is expected to give Germany a 25.1% stake in the airline as well as supervisory board representation, people close to the matter said.
Separately, Lufthansa is expected to receive about 5 billion euros in non-voting capital as well as roughly 3 billion in state-backed loans, they added.
The exact size of the various elements of the rescue deal as well as the possible contribution from Switzerland, Austria and Belgium is still unclear, the sources said.
Spohr is expected to visit Brussels this week, according to Belgian daily L’Echo. The airline is seeking 290 million euros in financial aid from the Belgian state to survive the crisis. In exchange, Belgium wants guarantees on the future of Brussels Airlines and the development of the Brussels airport. 
Spohr said that despite the bailout the German government was not interested in taking an active role in the company, after he had earlier warned about possible state interference. 
Klaus Schmidt, head of the council of economic advisers to the federal economy ministry, said at a ministry briefing on Tuesday, that the government should not weigh into discussions, for example, on whether Lufthansa's Germanwings division should be shuttered. 
To reduce its cash outflows, Lufthansa -- which is taking a 2020 hit of about 1 billion euros from crude oil hedging -- said at the AGM that it had among other things asked Airbus (PA:AIR) and Boeing (N:BA), to postpone aircraft deliveries. 
Lufthansa is sticking to its plan to sell its catering activities, Spohr said, adding that further asset sales were not planned at this stage and a potential listing of its Lufthansa Technik business would currently only be possible at a massive discount. 

The company said that it was impossible to give long-term forecasts as the coronavirus would continue to weigh on the airline industry for a long time.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ocado investor Royal London Asset Management said it will vote against the online grocer's pay report at Wednesday's annual meeting, calling CEO Tim Steiner's 58.7 million pound ($73 million) reward ""excessive"".
The total remuneration package for Steiner, who co-founded Ocado (L:OCDO) in 2000, included a 54.1 million pound bonus award linked to the group's share price growth for the five years from 2014.
In total the ""Growth Incentive Plan"" paid out 87.5 million pounds to Ocado's executive directors, including 13.5 million pounds each to chief financial officer Duncan Tatton-Brown and chief operations officer Mark Richardson, and 6.4 million pounds to Luke Jensen, CEO of Ocado Solutions.
""Ocado’s latest pay report is a classic example of how poorly designed incentive plans can lead to excessive awards for management,"" Ashley Hamilton Claxton, head of responsible investment at Royal London Asset Management (RLAM), which holds a 0.3% stake in Ocado, said on Tuesday.
He said RLAM recognised the significant returns for shareholders which Ocado had delivered since the end of 2017, but was concerned its remuneration committee did not apply any discretion, particularly as the scheme ran alongside Ocado’s regular variable pay plans.
Ocado had no immediate comment.
RLAM's intervention follows that of shareholder advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) which recommended investors vote against the pay report and against the re-election of Andrew Harrison, the director who chairs the remuneration committee.
Ocado's share price ended 2017 at 384 pence and closed on Monday at 1,688 pence, giving it a market capitalisation of 11.9 billion pounds. That is more than the combined market values of  Sainsbury 's (L:SBRY), Britain's No. 2 supermarket group by sales, and Morrisons (L:MRW), the No. 4 player.
Ocado's share price has been driven by its state-of-the-art robotic technology which has enabled it to win partnership deals with supermarket groups around the world, including Kroger (N:KR) in the United States,  Casino  (PA:CASP) in France and  in Japan.
Steiner also owns 4.2% of Ocado's equity, according to Refinitiv data.
Due to the coronavirus the annual shareholders' meeting, cannot be attended by investors, who had to vote by proxy.
Ocado is due to publish a trading update ahead of the meeting.
It has traded strongly through the crisis as Britons have sought deliveries to avoid venturing out to supermarkets, and having to queue, during the lockdown.
Ocado shares were up 1.9% at 1115 GMT.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 07:50AM ET</span>",Swiss parliament backs bailout package for aviation sector,"ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss parliament has backed the government's request for nearly 1.9 billion Swiss francs ($1.97 billion) in aid for the struggling aviation sector crippled by the coronavirus pandemic, but said carriers must meet environmental targets.
The package includes 1.275 billion francs in loan guarantees for Lufthansa-owned (DE:LHAG) Swiss and Edelweiss and 600 million francs for companies that provide services including Swissport International, Gategroup and SR Technics.
The lower house on Monday linked approval of the package to assurances that the carriers would adhere to future government climate targets but rejected even tougher conditions sought by MPs sceptical about state aid to airlines in general.
The upper house approved the package on Tuesday with some minor differences that need to be worked out, but this was seen as a formality.
Meeting in special session after weeks of being suspended amid the pandemic, parliament is signing off on around 57 billion Swiss francs in emergency measures proposed by the government to get the economy back on its feet.
This includes loan guarantees for business, support for short-time work regimes and payments for entrepreneurs sidelined by restrictions on public life.
Finance Minister Ueli Maurer has forecast a federal budget deficit of up to 50 billion francs and new borrowing of 30-50 billion this year.
Aviation bailout funds are to be used only for Swiss infrastructure. The government forbade dividends or other payments by carriers until the assistance has been repaid.
It provided no special help to EasyJet's (L:EZJ) Swiss unit, whose parent was expected to cover its liquidity needs.
Switzerland is not seeking ownership stakes in the airlines helped by the aid package, although state-backed loans from banks would be secured by shares in Swiss and Edelweiss.
Governments across the world are intervening to prop up airlines as estimated revenue losses from the coronavirus pandemic have climbed to $314 billion, the International Air Transport Association said last month, with more than of the world's airplanes in storage.
Lufthansa, Europe's biggest carrier by revenue, is in talks with the German government about a rescue plan.

Tuesday's proceedings were the first time that Germany's Federal Court of Justice, or Bundesgerichtshof, heard arguments from a plaintiff seeking damages from VW because it had sold vehicles with manipulated diesel engines. 
Any ruling in this landmark case will serve as a guideline for other cases.
Presiding judge Stephan Seiters said several arguments brought forward by Volkswagen were not applicable. 
The case is about a Volkswagen customer who sued the company for having sold a car with a manipulated diesel engine so that it could pass emissions tests. The man had been awarded 26,000 euros in damages by a lower court.
The plaintiff is seeking higher damages, while VW has asked the court to dismiss the claim altogether.

A ruling will be made at a later point in time, the judge said.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>","Uber, Lyft investors want to hear plans to get riders back in cars","By Tina Bellon and Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - As U.S. lockdowns and fears of the coronavirus pandemic stretch into a third month, who wants to take an Uber ride? 
Not many investors. Shares of Uber (N:UBER) dropped 3.4% on Monday, while smaller rival  Lyft  (O:LYFT) tumbled almost 9%, ahead of both companies' quarterly reports this week. Their stocks have slid 33% and 42%, respectively, since February, more than twice the drop in the S&P 500 (SPX).
Investors are keen for the companies to outline a path out of the crisis as Americans - who provide the bulk of the companies' revenue - consider resuming travel.
""It's clear to us that business is going to be terrible. What we want to hear is, 'What is their outlook, and are they seeing any indications of a pickup in activity?',"" said King Lip, Chief Investment Strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco. 
Demand for app-based rides has dropped sharply as governments around the world ordered people to stay home to combat the spread of the virus, prompting both companies to withdraw their full-year guidance. Data from analysts and interviews with drivers suggest trip requests in some cities were down by as much as 80% in April. 
Unlike Uber, which could recover some lost revenue with its food delivery business, Lyft has been squarely focused on transporting people. 
Some analysts expect globally-exposed Uber to be hit harder in the first quarter than Lyft, which only serves the United States and parts of Canada. Lyft, which reports results after the bell on Wednesday, a day ahead of Uber, could therefore serve as an early indicator of the U.S. market. 
Uber's quandary is captured in a TV and online ad https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e8XLnMiCOE showing a montage of coronavirus lockdown videos accompanied by the tag line: ""Stay home for everyone who can't. Thank you for not riding with Uber.""
Americans tell pollsters their transportation preferences will change as a result of the crisis, although ride-hailing demand in China, the first country suffering an outbreak, has been recovering since the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
In an April survey by the  IBM  (NYSE:IBM) Institute for Business Value among 25,000 U.S. adults, more than half of the respondents said they would use ride-hailing less or stop completely.
China's Didi Chuxing, an Uber competitor, has taken additional safety measures, paying for the installation of transparent plastic sheets to separate drivers and passengers in ride-hailing vehicles in Beijing. The company said it was also exploring technology to trace infected people.
An Uber spokesman on Monday confirmed a CNN report https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/03/tech/uber-drivers-riders-face-masks/index.html that Uber will require riders and drivers to wear face coverings in the United States and other countries. 
Lyft and Uber recommend face coverings and ask riders to sit in the back seat and open windows during rides. They also ask drivers to regularly disinfect their vehicles, and have supplied limited amounts of sanitizers.
Uber's advantage could be in food delivery. 
""We need to find out whether Uber's food delivery service is as strong as we think,"" said Jake Dollarhide, Chief Executive of Longbow Asset Management, which owns shares of Uber and Lyft. 
The average analyst estimate for Uber's March-quarter revenue has fallen by more than $600 million since early February. Analysts on average expect Uber to report March quarter rose 14% to $3.53 billion, and an adjusted loss of 83 cents per share, according to Refinitiv. 
Lyft is expected to report quarterly revenue up 16% to $898 million, and an adjusted loss of 63 cents per shares.

Overall for the first quarter, analysts see Uber losing $1.36 billion and Lyft losing $388 million.

European flights have all but come to a standstill during the coronavirus pandemic with government restrictions meaning that only a few services are operating for essential travel such as people going to work or being repatriated, or for cargo.
Wizz Air said on Tuesday that it was announcing the new routes as part of its planning for the easing of restrictions, and said that new rules it had introduced, such as compulsory face masks for passengers and staff, should give customers confidence to fly. 
It is not yet clear whether traditional summer holiday destinations will be open for business this year. 
Flights will depart for Faro, Portugal from 16 June, Wizz said, and for Zakynthos, Heraklion, Corfu and Rhodes in Greece at the beginning of July. 

Wizz became one of the first European airlines to restart commercial routes from London Luton and Vienna on May 1, carrying people from Bulgaria and Romania amongst other places, which the airline said was for work.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, as tensions between China and the U.S. appeared to ease and  more states and corporations looked to reopen for business.
At 07:10 AM ET (1110 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 32 points, or 1.2%, higher, Nasdaq 100 Futures up 110 points, or 1.3%. The Dow futures contract rose 270 points, or 1.2%.
Deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger said late Monday the United States is not considering “punitive measures” against China over its handling of the pandemic.
This contrasted with more aggressive comments over the weekend from the U.S. administration, which had raised fears of another trade war between the two most powerful economies in the world.
Now attention turns to the idea of a return to normalcy, as more and more states look to reopen for business. The latest to do so is New York, the state hardest hit by the pandemic, after Governor Andrew Cuomo Monday outlined seven requirements needed for each region in the state to reopen.
Some areas, including central New York and the sparsely populated North Country section of the state, are already meeting five of the seven requirements, he said. New York City is meeting only three.
Adding to this, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) announced late Monday that the coffee giant plans to reopen more than 85% of its U.S. stores by the end of this week. Starbucks stock gained 3.1% premarket.
The corporate earnings season continues Tuesday, with Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) the leading name, reporting after the bell. The company has been hard hit by the pandemic, with its theme parks unlikely to open until 2021, cruises suspended and advertising on live sporting events on ESPN cancelled. Can the new income stream from Disney+ offset this?
Elsewhere, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be in the spotlight after the iPhone maker on Monday borrowed $8.5 billion with a four-part bond deal. 
Shares of L Brands (NYSE:LB) fell more than 7% premarket after the company pulled out of its plan to take Victoria's Secret private, and Hertz (NYSE:HTZ) slumped 27% amid reports it could file for bankruptcy as early as this week.
Turning to economic data, the Institute of Supply Management will release its April non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The ISM services index is expected to have plunged to 36.8 last month from 52.5 in March. That would be below the all-time low for the index of 37.3 set in 2008.
Oil futures pushed higher, amid signs the short-term imbalance between supply and demand is easing. The American Petroleum Institute will issue its snapshot of weekly U.S. oil inventories after the bell. Last week’s numbers showed a build of 10 million barrels in crude.
At 7:10 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 9.8% higher at $22.38 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 7.6% to $29.27..
Elsewhere, gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,704/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0836, down 0.7%."

1113,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Oil spurt lifts stocks out of three-day losing streak,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Stock markets snapped a three-day losing streak on Tuesday and oil was on its longest run of gains in nine months as moves to ease major economies out of their coronavirus lockdowns lifted sentiment.
It was a turnaround from Monday, when bickering between Washington and Beijing triggered fresh selling, but traders have become used to sudden changes of direction in recent months and there were more to handle in Europe, too.
The pan-European STOXX 600 rose nearly 2% early as a more than 6% jump in oil prices boosted oil stocks, only to wilt on news that Germany's top court had ruled the European Central Bank's quantitative-easing programme had ""partially violated"" the country's constitution.
The euro and the region's government debt fell, too, although the court also said the ECB's measures didn't amount to monetary financing -- where a central bank bankrolls the government -- something banned in Germany.
The ruling also didn't apply to the bank's new coronavirus PEPP support programme.
""In practice, this should not restrict the ECB too much,"" said Holger Schmiedling, chief economist at Berenberg. ""However, Karlsruhe (German court) has emphasized that there are limits to bond purchases. This could make it more difficult for the ECB to expand PEPP.""
In addition, euro zone producer prices fell the most in March since the 2008 financial crisis, Eurostat data showed.
The drop was more than expected as the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for energy. Prices at factory gates in the 19 countries sharing the euro fell 1.5% month-on-month in March and 2.8% year-on-year. 
The euro traded down at $1.0889, stocks were up only half of what they had been and a sell-off in bond markets pushed Italy's government yields up past 1.83%.
That meant the U.S. dollar index pushed higher for a second consecutive day, though the big petrocurrencies like Canada's dollar, Norway's crown and Russia's rouble were all with stronger or holding steady. [/FRX]
Several countries, including Spain, Italy, Nigeria, India, and Malaysia, are tentatively easing lockdowns and the governors of California and New York sounded more optimistic on Monday about businesses reopening there.
Brent crude rose 6.5% to $28.97 a barrel, up for a sixth straight day, and U.S. crude rose 9% to $22.24 a barrel for its fifth consecutive rise.
Analysts at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (OTC:CMWAY) said the structure of the oil price rises, with bigger gains in nearer-dated contracts, suggested expectations of more production cuts and a restoration of fuel demand later this year.
They added, though, that this meant prices are unlikely to recover their big declines since the start of the year.
""From a very top-down perspective, markets are reacting positively to measures governments and central banks have taken,"" said Alistair Wittet, a European equity portfolio manager at Comgest.

""But we are still to see what the full economic consequences of all this be... the real test will be when the markets start opening up and governments and central banks start withdrawing (their support).""

1114,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",Hugo Boss expects 50% sales drop next quarter as crisis impact worsens,"By Emma Thomasson
BERLIN (Reuters) -  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) is seeing signs of a sales rebound in China and online, but expects the impact of the coronavirus crisis to worsen before any recovery kicks in after first quarter sales fell by 17%, which knocked its shares.
Although Hugo Boss has begun reopening stores in Germany and Austria in recent weeks, its chief executive Mark Langer said shoppers were still few and far between in German cities.
The company expects second quarter sales to fall by at least 50% as three quarters of its stores are still closed. But is confident the retail environment will gradually improve from the third quarter of the year, supporting sales and earnings.
Hugo Boss said online sales jumped 39% in the first quarter to account for 11% of total sales and accelerated again strongly in April, with sales more than doubling on its own site and via partner websites and demand particularly strong for sportswear.
Langer said on Tuesday that those who do venture into Hugo Boss shops are very willing to spend at the German fashion house, which is best known for its smart men's suits.
Hugo Boss also said all of its own retail stores and concessions have reopened in China since the end of March and sales in April were only around 15-20% below the previous year.
Hermes (PA:HRMS) has also said that business was picking up strongly in China after shops there reopened.
Hugo Boss said its first quarter sales were 555 million euros ($605 million), ahead of average analyst forecasts for 548 million, while it posted a loss before interest and taxation of 14 million euros, which was worse that the average forecast of 6 million euros.
Hugo Boss, whose shares were down 4.9% at 0817 GMT while the German midcap MDAX index (MDAXI) was 2.2% higher on Tuesday, said it is targeting extra cost savings of at least 150 million euros this year.
The company, which had already announced moves to protect its cash balance such as suspending store renovations and new openings and limiting the inflow of stock, has no plans to seek state aid, Langer told reporters on Tuesday.
It is aiming to cut the inflow of inventory by at least 200 million euros compared to its original plan, including cutting its own production.
The CEO said Hugo Boss has already actively shifted stock to markets where stores are open and to online platforms, and will seek to sell other items via its factory outlets in early 2021, 

Langer is due to leave Hugo Boss at the end of September, but stay on until the end of the year as a consultant while the company looks for a successor.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 05:16AM ET</span>",BNP warns of 2020 profit fall as crisis wipes out equity trading,"By Maya Nikolaeva
PARIS (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) set aside more than half a billion euros in loan provisions on Tuesday as the coronavirus crisis wiped out the French bank's revenue from equity derivatives trading and knocked a third off its first quarter profit.
However, Chief Executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe looked beyond the blow to trading in equity derivatives, which have traditionally been a source of pride for the French financial services industry, and focused on BNP's wider business model.
""The good resilience of revenues and results despite this shock demonstrates the robustness of the group's diversified and integrated model,"" Bonnafe said in a statement.
Provisions for expected losses due to the coronavirus crisis were 502 million euros, BNP said. Its cost of risk, which reflects provisions for bad loans, rose by 85.4% to 1.42 billion euros over the period. 
While BNP warned that its 2020 net income could be about 15% to 20% lower than in 2019, the bank's loans and repurchase agreements almost doubled during the quarter, with its balance sheet growing to 2.7 trillion euros from 2.2 trillion as it rolled out emergency loans to help businesses weather lockdowns.
""It's a key moment for them, as they've had goals to increase their market share in Europe, to be a leader is several activities,"" Thierry Le Clercq, fund manager at Mandarine Gestion, said.
Like its rival  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN), BNP's trading results underperformed those of European rivals such as  Barclays  (L:BARC) and UBS (S:UBSG), which both had a bumper quarter.
Paris-based BNP, whose net income fell to 1.28 billion euros in the quarter while revenue dropped 2.3% to 10.9 billion euros. said it would accelerate cuts to its operating expenses.
Shares in BNP, which had dropped by more than 13% since SocGen's first quarter loss last week, were up 4.96% at 0832 GMT.
Analysts said that the 2020 net income guidance, given by BNP, was higher than consensus estimates, which might prompt some upside revisions.
BNP's equity trading was ""badly hit"" by market falls at the end of March and revenue dropped to minus 87 million euros, versus 488 million euros in the same period a year ago.
""The extreme and exceptional volatility thus led to a dislocation in hedges, in particular due to the European authorities' restrictions on 2019 dividends,"" BNP said, adding that these had a one-off negative impact of 184 million euros.
RESILIENT REVENUES
Despite the blow to these ""exotic"" products, a stronger performance in fixed income trading and corporate banking kept BNP's investment bank in profit.
""BNP has one of the largest diversification of activities, no activity weighs too much in results. By default, it is one of the most balanced banks in the sector with a proven resilience,"" said François Chaulet, managing director at Montsegur Finance. 
Revenue at BNP's corporate and institutional banking business fell by 1.9%, while pretax income dropped 61%. Fixed income trading revenue rose by 34.5%.
The bank has beefed up its equity derivatives business in a bid to diversify its trading operations and make returns more stable by integrating structured portfolios from Credit Agricole (OTC:CRARY), RBS (LON:RBS) and ING.
It has also boosted its prime brokerage, which deals with hedge funds, by taking on clients and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn)'s IT platform. It said on Tuesday that the transfer of the first clients had already been achieved.
BNP, which has been run by Bonnafe since 2011, has taken advantage of overhauls at rivals such as Deutsche and  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) to grab market share in Europe and challenge Wall Street banks. 
Seen as a bellwether for the economy in Europe as the region accounts for 74% of its commitments, BNP said it had raised more than 115 billion euros in financing for clients in 2020 across bond, syndicated credit and equity markets.
It said it ranked number one in syndicated loans in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, with a 12.8% market share as of April 17.

But the bank has shrunk its commodity business and focused on Europe after paying a record fine in 2014 for violating U.S. sanctions.

Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica SA (OTC:ESLOY) said business is getting worse in the second quarter because customers are putting off buying sunglasses and prescription lenses, while Germany’s  Beiersdorf  AG (DE:BEIG) said sales of its high-end moisturizers and rejuvenation creams slumped as airports were closed.
German chipmaker Infineon (OTC:IFNNY) Technologies AG said its outlook for the second half is significantly weaker and BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) SA became the latest bank to see equities income wiped out amid the turmoil.
A bright spot once again came from the food-delivery sector, with meal-kit firm HelloFresh AG raising its guidance as people confined to their homes ordered more of its products.
First-quarter earnings for European companies are likely to fall fall 30% based on results so far,  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) strategists said in a note Monday, and the second quarter is likely to be worse. Yet European stocks, despite a rocky start to March, are still holding relatively strong and on Monday the Stoxx Europe 600 Index closed 17% above the lows hit in March.
This may have been helped by European companies having delivered a relative beat so far, albeit against lowered expectations, the Morgan Stanley strategists said.

1117,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",Italy's CNH Industrial aims for full production by end of May,"MILAN (Reuters) - Vehicle and equipment maker  CNH Industrial  (MI:CNHI) said on Tuesday it planned to return progressively to full operations at most of its facilities around the world by the end of May, in line with the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
The maker of farm machinery, Iveco commercial vehicles, construction equipment and powertrains, said in a statement that more than two thirds of its 67 plants were already operational ""to varying degrees"". 
In Europe, it said more than 75% of its production sites were operational.
Most of the group's assembly operations around the world were stopped in March, when governments restricted people's movements and economic activities to try to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
In resuming activities, CNH gave priority to agricultural and powertrain manufacturing, as they were considered essential industries by governments, and in response to local market demands, it said.
Production of commercial and speciality vehicles followed, given the importance of transportation and civil protection activities at this time, and then production of construction equipment resumed, CNH said.

""Modifications may be necessary if local or regional situations deteriorate or in response to specific critical issues,"" the statement added, citing supply chain issues, for instance.

1118,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 05, 2020 04:18AM ET</span>",Bank of China Tells Investors It Will Absorb Some Oil Losses,"(Bloomberg) --
Bank of China (OTC:BACHY) Ltd. told clients it’s willing to shoulder part of the $1 billion loss suffered by thousands of retail investors after a product linked to the price of oil collapsed last month.
China’s fourth-largest bank by market value dropped a claim to seek additional payments from clients to cover losses from its settlement of an investment product at a price below zero, mirroring a collapse in an oil futures contract, according to four retail investors who received phone calls from the lender this week. The bank will also return 20% of the initial investment to some clients, they said.
The proposal came after Chinese regulators pressured the lender to absorb some of the losses amid a public uproar and as other banks halted sales of similar commodity-linked investment products. The turmoil even reached the highest level of government, with Vice Premier Liu He on Monday issuing a statement calling on banks to strengthen controls over such products and protect investors.
Bank of China’s “Crude Oil Treasure” product had attracted thousands of retail investors seeking to speculate on West Texas Intermediate crude futures. The product collapsed on April 20, when the price of the May futures contract plummeted to a record minus $37.63 a barrel, not only wiping out bullish bets but also leaving some clients owing the bank money.
Bank of China declined to comment when reached on a public holiday in China. The Chinese retail investors interviewed by Bloomberg asked not to be identified because the matter is private and sensitive.
The Beijing-based lender said on April 24 that about 46% of the investors had liquidated their positions on April 20, while the remaining chose to either roll over their positions or settle at the expiration, including both long and short positions. The bank also said it will fully review its product design, risk control and related procedures and take responsibilities within the legal framework and make the best effort to safeguard clients’ interests.
The turmoil is drawing further attention to China’s $3 trillion industry for bank wealth products, which invest in everything from bonds and stocks to foreign exchange and commodities. They have become key building blocks of a shadow-banking system that exists largely off banks’ balance sheets.
The possible partial bailout also underscores the challenge to regulators, who have been trying to do away with the implicit guarantees often offered by banks and to instill more risk awareness among millions of retail investors. When wealth products struggle to meet their return targets in China, lenders that distribute them often make up the shortfall to protect their reputation and maintain social stability.
Bank of China hasn’t disclosed the size or performance of “Crude Oil Treasure” since launching the product in January 2018.
The investment vehicle had offered investors access to WTI oil futures without opening an offshore account and was pegged to the flat price of the front-month contract and settled in Chinese yuan. It required 100% margin and didn’t allow any leverage.
Industrial & Commercial  Bank of China Ltd  . also temporarily halted opening of new positions in products linked not only to oil, but also to natural gas, and soybeans from April 28. China Construction Bank (OTC:CICHF) Corp. and Bank of Communications Co. are among lenders that have also suspended opening of new positions on their WTI-linked products for individuals.
The oil price shock hammered retail investors also beyond China. In South Korea, mom-and-pop investors exposed to about 1.45 trillion won ($1.2 billion) worth of structured notes tied to Brent or WTI futures faced losses. In India at least three brokerages have petitioned the courts to challenge the settlement of contracts after their clients faced millions of dollars in losses from the negative prices.

Total SA (PA:TOTF) gained 5.8% after it maintained its dividend despite reporting a sharp fall in first-quarter net adjusted profit due to a plunge in oil prices.

1120,By Investing.com,"<span>May 05, 2020 03:31AM ET</span>",Stocks - Europe Gains; Banking and Oil Sectors Lead,"By Peter Nurse 
Investing.com - European stock markets pushed higher Tuesday, helped by gains in the banking and oil sectors as well as an attempt to reduce tensions between the United States and China over the coronavirus crisis. 
At 3:45 AM ET (0745 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 1.8% higher, France's CAC 40 up 2.5%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 1.7% higher, aheaqd of a crucial decision by the German Constitutional Court on the European Central Bank's bond purchases.
Deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger insisted Monday the United States is not considering “punitive measures” against China over its handling of the pandemic, taking a more conciliatory stance after the recent hostility toward Beijing from other members of the U.S. government.
The aggressive stance from the U.S. administration had raised fears over the weekend of another trade war between the two most powerful economies in the world, which would likely curtail global growth just when it’s most needed. 
Elsewhere, in corporate news,  BNP Paribas  (OTC:BNPQY) SA (PA:BNPP soared over 4% after saying its revenue remained resilient in the first quarter despite profit falling by a third as the eurozone’s biggest bank set aside more than half a billion euros in loan provisions.
This helped drag the whole banking sector higher, with French peers  Credit Agricole  (PA:CAGR) gaining 5.4% and  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN)  3.3%.
Turning to the oil & gas sector, Repsol (MC:REP) jumped over 6%, helping the whole sector higher, despite posting a drop in first-quarter profit of 28% as oil prices began their unprecedented decline.
The Spanish oil giant has already cancelled plans to unveil a new clean-energy strategy this month and halted its share buybacks, though it has maintained its dividend.
German fashion house  Hugo Boss  (DE:BOSSn) also climbed 2.5% after reporting that sales fell a currency-adjusted 17% in the first quarter, but added that it was seeing signs of a rebound in China and online.
Oil futures gained Tuesday, helped by the lessening of tensions surrounding a trade war and amid further signs of reopening, this time in India, the world’s second most populous country.
At 3:45 AM ET, U.S. crude futures traded 10.7% higher at $22.57 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 7.2% to $29.16

Earnings from the Spanish energy producer, like those of its peers, reflect what’s proving to be a historic moment for the industry. Crude’s collapse has forced companies to make drastic cuts in spending and, in some cases, slash shareholder payouts.
Repsol has already canceled plans to unveil a new clean-energy strategy this month and halted its share buybacks, though it has maintained its dividend.
Adjusted net income fell to 447 million euros ($488 million) in the first quarter, while earnings from oil exploration and production plunged to 90 million euros from 323 million euros a year earlier.
Benchmark Brent crude is currently trading below $29 a barrel. It’s down more than 50% since the start of the year as the coronavirus pandemic wipes out fuel demand, meaning oil companies that also refine crude are hit twice over. Repsol estimates an average Brent price of $35 from April to December this year.
Repsol relies heavily on its downstream business in Spain, where the government ordered one of Europe’s most stringent lockdowns in mid-March to slow the spread of the virus.
In its quarterly report, Repsol for the first time split its downstream units into two: industrial production -- including fuel refining and chemical production -- and commercial and renewable-energy operations, which include filling stations and electricity.

The company said in a statement that passengers would have to supply the masks themselves, and would be expected to keep them on for the duration of their flight.
Major airlines, among them Lufthansa, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), have already mandated face masks for all passengers.
Airlines globally have taken a severe financial hit from the COVID-10 pandemic and resulting slowdown in air travel, and are now seeking to reassure customers it is safe to fly.

Some though have resisted proposals to reduce passenger numbers on each flight to ensure social distancing, saying that would be uneconomic.

The latest retail sales reading due later Tuesday is expected to confirm another fresh low for the city’s battered industry, with the median estimate of a record 48% slump in the value of sales in March, according to a survey.
That would mean two straight months with declines greater than 40% -- an unprecedented period of weakness. The city’s wider economy contracted 8.9% in the first quarter from year-ago levels, suffering its worst quarter on record and extending the first recession in a decade. Private consumption sank 10.2% in the period while exports of services plummeted 37.8%, according to a the government release Monday.
“People aren’t buying because they are worried about their future,” said Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis SA. “Why would you spend in such circumstances?”
Hong Kong Was Already in Recession
While economies around the world are struggling with lockdowns from the coronavirus pandemic, the outlook for Hong Kong’s consumption industries is particularly bleak with the acute downturn due to the virus coming on the heels of a recession from months of anti-government protests. That tension -- which kept mainland tourists away -- means that even when restrictions to contain the virus are lifted, it’s unlikely to spur a return to previous levels of cross-border traffic and spending.
“China tourists will probably be half of what they used to be,” Michael Tien, a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and founder of fashion retailer G2000 Apparel Ltd., told Bloomberg Television. “The Chinese tourist will probably never come back because they obviously feel that with all the protests going on, there’s going to be a deep divide with Hong Kong and they may not be completely welcome in the future.”
With Hong Kong also stepping up border control measures due to the virus, visitor arrivals from China plummeted about 99% from a year ago in March to just over 30,000 people, according to figures from the Hong Kong Tourism Board. That’s down from a peak of more than 5.5 million visitors from the mainland in January 2019, the data show.
“We are in a very difficult time,” Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a regular briefing Tuesday. Lam also announced the city will soon relax some social distancing measures. “When compared with the financial crisis, the SARS crisis, the financial tsunami, it’s worse than those occasions.”
Removing some of the virus-related restrictions is a double-edged sword for retailers due to the threat of a resumption of the pro-democracy protests from last year.

“I don’t think we can survive it for very long,” said Douglas Young, co-founder and chief executive of lifestyle and fashion retail chain Goods of Desire, in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “I don’t see how the retail sector or the tourism sector could survive another six months of this kind of unrest and downturn.”
Bleak Future
The dire situation is prompting some retailers in the city to accelerate shifts in their business.
Kidsland International Holdings Ltd., which sells toys for children, has begun ramping up online ordering and home delivery services in Hong Kong, said Sherman Hung, an executive director with the firm. The company’s strategy had previously been adopted in China, but not in Hong Kong until the virus forced the company’s hand.
“Covid-19 is an accelerator in promoting us to adopt and evolve quickly,” Hung said on Bloomberg TV. “In the past, of course, a significant portion of our businesses is represented by cross-border travelers coming to Hong Kong to consume. But there’s also a very significant portion being represented by local demand.”
Assuming the virus crisis improves, Hong Kong will come out of recession gradually toward the end of the year, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said at a press conference Monday. The city potentially faces its worst full-year performance on record with a contraction of as much as 7%, after the economy shrank 1.2% last year.
“Our economic situation is very challenging, we are deep into recession,” Chan said. “Going forward, the second quarter, we believe that even if there is improvement, the improvement will be gradual and small.”

Investing.com – Asian stocks were up on Tuesday morning with some U.S. states and European countries re-opening their economies the day before after loosening lockdowns to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.
Down Under, the ASX 200 rose 0.97% by 11:14 PM ET (4:14 AM GMT), with the Reserve Bank of Australia due to announce its policy decision later in the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was up 0.37% even as investors continue to digest an 8.9% contraction in the city’s economy during the first quarter year-on-year.
Commenting on the decline, Hong Kong’s biggest since 1974, Financial Secretary Paul Chan said that the “external environment is still very challenging” even though the virus situation in the city “seems to be under control.”
“Going forward in the second quarter, we believe that even if there is improvement, the improvement will be gradual and small,” he added.
Investors are also monitoring the U.S.-China spat over the origins of the virus, with the World Health Organization jumping in during a briefing overnight to demand proof to back top U.S. officials’ accusations that the vrius originated in a Wuhan lab.
“At this point of time we think this is more of a risk to monitor rather than something that breaks the fundamental economic story,” Chetan Ahya, chief economist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), said in a Bloomberg interview.

(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) plans to cut at least 3,400 management and administrative positions in October as the coronavirus pandemic crushes air travel demand, and has told pilots to brace for changes as well, according to two memos seen by Reuters. 
Chicago-based United is among the U.S. airlines that have accepted U.S. government payroll aid that bans job or pay cuts before Sept. 30. However, United and other carriers have warned that demand is unlikely to recover to pre-crisis levels by that date, forcing them to shrink in the fall.
The United memos are the first indication of just how much major airlines might downsize due to the health crisis.
""We have to acknowledge that there will be serious consequences to our company if we don’t continue to take strong and decisive action, which includes making decisions that none of us ever wanted or expected to make,"" Kate Gebo, Executive Vice President Human Resources and Labor Relations, said in the memo to some 11,500 management and administrative employees. 
Affected employees will be notified in mid to late July for an Oct. 1 effective date, she said, while encouraging employees to consider a voluntary separation before that date.
In a separate memo seen by Reuters, pilots were told to prepare for a ""displacement"" that will affect roughly 30% of roughly 12,250 pilots.
One pilot union official said the group was interpreting the message to mean a 30% reduction as soon as Oct. 1.
United sent memos on Monday to a number of work groups about near-term changes and potential long-term implications, spokeswoman Leslie Scott said.
""Travel demand is essentially zero for the foreseeable future and, even with federal assistance that covers a portion of our payroll expense through Sept. 30, we anticipate spending billions of dollars more than we take in for the next several months, while continuing to employ 100% of our workforce,"" United spokesman Frank Benenati said in an email. ""That’s not sustainable for any company."" 

United and other airlines, which only months ago were mapping out growth plans, have parked jets and drastically cut flight schedules in an effort to reduce costs and shore up cash until demand recovers.

The Series A financing was concluded just three months after the Jakarta-based startup raised $10.5 million in a seed funding round co-led by Alpha JWC Ventures and Wavemaker Partners, with participation from Temasek Holdings Pte’s Pavilion Capital.
The new capital brings the startup’s total funds raised to $36 million in just 15 months since inception, and will help it meet heightened demand for daily essentials during large-scale social restrictions. GudangAda -- loosely translated as “we have everything in our warehouse” -- helps mom and pop stores buy goods such as cooking ingredients, instant noodles and beverages from wholesalers through its mobile app and website. The platform also lets wholesalers transact among themselves.
Covid-19 is chilling deal activity worldwide but investors continue to single out startups in areas that benefit from a surge in online activity, such as e-commerce and logistics. On Tuesday, Singapore’s Ninja Van said it raised $279 million from investors including France’s GeoPost SA and ride-hailing giant Grab Holdings Inc.
GudangAda will recruit more than 100 employees this year, adding to a workforce of about 350, according to founder and Chief Executive Officer Stevensang, who like many Indonesians goes by one name. “We do have plans to strengthen our mid-senior team throughout the rest of this year, especially in areas of technology and product management,” he said in an interview. “We are open to all levels of professional talents in Indonesia’s startup ecosystem.”

The tender offer was part of a $9.6 billion rescue financing package that SoftBank agreed with WeWork in October and gave it control of the company. Since then, WeWork's occupancy rates have plummeted amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
In April, SoftBank said it would not press ahead with the tender offer because several pre-conditions had not been met, frustrating WeWork's minority shareholders, who were expecting a payout. The investors included Adam Neumann.
""The abuses committed by (SoftBank) and SBVF (SoftBank Vision Fund) are so brazen that they have prompted legal action by a special committee of WeWork's board,"" the lawsuit filed in a Delaware Court said.
An independent special committee, comprised of Bruce Dunlevie, who is a general partner at WeWork shareholder Benchmark Capital, and Lew Frankfort, former CEO of luxury handbag maker Coach, had also filed a lawsuit, calling SoftBank's decision to terminate the tender offer wrongful.
SoftBank's lawyers had questioned the special committee's right to represent minority shareholders, an assertion the committee rejected last month. 
""In real time, SBG (SoftBank) and SBVF (SoftBank Vision Fund) are abusing their control of WeWork in an effort to stop the special committee's meritorious lawsuit from being heard,"" the lawsuit said.
Meanwhile, SoftBank's Chief Legal Officer Rob Townsend called Neumann's claims ""meritless"". Under the terms of the agreement, he said, SoftBank had ""no obligation"" to complete the tender offer in which Neumann – the biggest beneficiary – sought to sell nearly $1 billion in stock.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday said it would provide relief to smaller firms seeking to raise capital via online platforms to meet ""urgent funding needs"" due to the coronavirus-related disruption.
The SEC's measure seeks to temporarily amend existing crowdfunding requirements but only if a company meets ""the enhanced eligibility requirements"" while providing ""clear, prominent disclosure to investors about its reliance on the relief,"" which will apply to offerings launched between the effective date of the temporary rules and Aug. 31, the agency said.
The regulator in March proposed allowing smaller, private companies to access more capital before they meet a requirement to register with the agency - a lengthy and costly process.
At that time, some investor advocates expressed worries that even the stricter rules now in effect were not enough to encourage robust disclosure.
The agency has previously issued relief to address concerns by public companies and investment firms.
Monday's measure exempts issuers who have offered between $107,000 and $250,000 in securities within a 12-month period from an independent auditor review requirement of financial statements, the agency said. 
Issuers that have been organized and operated for at least six months prior to the commencement of the crowdfunding offering are also eligible for the agency's conditional relief. Firms must also have issued securities under the agency's current Regulation Crowdfunding offering rules in the past, the agency said. 
Issuers may only initiate crowdfunding after filing offering statements, but the firms' financial statements may be initially omitted, the agency said.
""In the current environment, many established small businesses are facing challenges accessing urgently needed capital in a timely and cost-effective manner,"" SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said in a statement.

""Today's action responds to feedback we have received from our Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee and others about the difficulties these companies may face in conducting an offering within a time frame that meets pressing capital needs, while continuing to provide appropriate protections for investors.""

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) co-founder Eduardo Saverin’s B Capital Group and Monk’s Hill Ventures joined Grab Holdings Inc. in the parcel delivery firm’s Series D round, completed after the pandemic drove a surge in online shopping among people sheltering in place. It brings Ninja Van’s total capital raised to roughly $400 million.
Ninja Van, which helps e-commerce clients deliver more than a million packages daily across six Southeast Asian countries, is benefiting from a spike in orders even while coping with the economic fallout of coronavirus lockdowns. Dozens of regional startups have shed jobs, while others like Oyo and Grab are furloughing workers or asking them to take unpaid leave. Ninja Van’s fundraising surpassed a $200 million target set about a year ago, according to Chief Executive Officer Lai Chang Wen.
The investor interest “shows that logistics is something which is around to stay,” Lai said in an interview. “Social distancing will have a profound effect. It may be an inflection point Southeast Asia needs for e-commerce.”
Lai, a 32-year-old former derivatives trader at  Barclays  (LON:BARC) Plc, founded Ninja Van in 2014 with two friends, aiming to use technology to make the logistics market more efficient. They picked the name Ninja Van to reflect the idea of working quietly to get things done. It now helps consumer brands from L’Oreal to Wing Tai Holdings Ltd.’s G2000 label digitize their businesses and sell to consumers, diversifying its clients beyond e-commerce platforms. The Singapore startup also aims to handle deliveries of merchandise for smaller merchants such as social media influencers.
Other backers in its latest round included Carmenta, Golden Gate Ventures Growth Fund and Intouch Holdings. Ninja Van operates in countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam and employs more than 30,000 people, including some 20,000 full-time drivers. It’s profitable in half of those markets but needs time for the whole business to become “solidly profitable,” Lai said. Ninja Van may do another round of funding before a sale or IPO, he added.
“It certainly isn’t the sexiest of companies but logistics has become a hot space since we invested five years ago,” said Lim Kuo-Yi, a managing partner of Monk’s Hill Ventures, the company’s first institutional investor. “Very few companies at this scale have shown the ability to cover the region comprehensively and is able to demonstrate a credible path to profitability.”

1132,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>","Apple borrows on the cheap to fund buybacks, dividends","By Kate Duguid and Joshua Franklin
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Apple Inc (O:AAPL) on Monday capitalized on the Federal Reserve's emergency measures in response to the coronavirus outbreak to issue its cheapest bonds in years, making it the latest blue-chip company to do so to fund stock buybacks and dividends.
Apple's offering illustrates how companies with the best credit ratings are boosting shareholder returns by tapping cheap debt made available through the Fed's backstopping of the credit markets. Apple shares are virtually flat year-to-date, compared with a 12% drop in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). 
The technology company raised $8.5 billion by selling four different bonds with maturities ranging from three years to 30 years. It sold a $2 billion three-year bond and a five-year $2.25 billion with coupons of 0.75% and 1.125% respectively, the lowest rates the company has paid on bonds with such durations since 2013, according to Refinitiv IFR data. 
The coupons on Apple's 10-year and 30-year bonds were also the lowest the company has paid in the past years, according to the Refinitiv data.
The funds will go toward general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and dividend payments, Apple said in a regulatory filing. During the six months ended March 28, Apple spent $38.5 billion to repurchase its own stock. 
The Fed slashed interest rates to almost zero in March and said it would act as buyer of last resort in the investment-grade corporate bond market, in a bid to help cash-strapped companies access capital markets roiled by the economic fallout from the pandemic. 
While the Federal Reserve has yet to buy a single corporate bond, the intervention has fueled record issuance by companies in need of funding, such as  Boeing Co  (N:BA), Marriott International Inc (O:MAR) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F).
The policy has also allowed financially strong companies such as Apple, which had just over $40 billion in cash as of the end of March, to reduce its cost of capital to the benefit of shareholders.
In the past week, drugmaker Biogen Inc (O:BIIB) and U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc (N:ANTM) have also sold new bonds at low rates, which the companies said were partly to fund share buybacks. 
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) & Co, BofA Securities, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) were joint book-running managers on the Apple bond offering.

Moovit will remain independent while its technology and the data it collects from more than 800 million users in 102 countries will be integrated into Intel's Israel-based autonomous car unit Mobileye (F:0ME). 
The price paid was nearly twice the $500 million valuation when Moovit last raised money in 2018. Intel owned about 7% of Moovit through a previous equity investment and paid about $840 million in cash to assume full ownership.
The deal talks started with Moovit seeking to do a capital raise before the novel coronavirus outbreak globally, according to a source familiar with the negotiations. Moovit had enough cash to sustain itself for about a year, and when the economic impact of the pandemic became evident, it decided to explore an outright sale to Intel, the source added. The deal was negotiated in 40 days through virtual meetings, according to the source.
""Moovit is an acquisition that fills some very critical gaps that we have going forward,"" Mobileye CEO Amnon Shashua told Reuters.
The initial goal, he said, was to have a small fleet of driverless taxis in countries like Israel, France and South Korea.
Moovit is popular for helping commuters or tourists find the best way to a destination by showing them bus and train routes, bike paths and car-pooling options.
Once integrated with Mobileye, the app will be a platform to order the robotaxis and the real-time data will ensure the vehicles are deployed in high-demand areas, Shashua said.
Intel forecasts robotaxis will be a $160 billion market by 2030.
The decision to buy now, when much of the world economy is at a standstill due to the coronavirus outbreak, stems from Mobileye's ability to more accurately predict when its technology will be ready, Shashua said. And the target is 2022.
""For a company like Intel, which has a very orderly plan of how the future should unfold, the coronavirus should not be a setback. On the contrary, you should look at the crisis then find opportunities,"" Shashua said.
Moovit has raised $133 million from investors including Intel, BMW iVentures, and Sequoia Capital. In 2018 it raised $50 million in an investment round led by Intel Capital.
Intel has made significant investments already in Israel, including its $15.3 billion acquisition of Mobileye in 2017. In December it bought Israeli artificial intelligence firm Habana Labs for $2 billion.

(Reuters) - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk appeared to qualify on Monday for a $700 million payday, just three days after he said the electric car company's stock price was too high.
Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) jumped more than 8% on Monday, putting Tesla's market capitalization at $141.1 billion at the close. More importantly for Musk, Tesla's stock market value reached a six-month average of $100.2 billion, according to an analysis of Refinitiv data.
Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion triggers the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of a pay package agreed in 2018. Musk has already met two other requirements by hitting a growth target and far exceeding a one-month average $100 billion market cap.
Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. At Tesla's closing stock price of $761.19, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares for a profit of $694 million.
Musk on Friday said on Twitter, ""Tesla stock price is too high imo,"" using an abbreviation for ""in my opinion"".
That tweet sent Tesla's stock tumbling 10%, shocking shareholders. Tesla, whose California factory is closed as part of the state's coronavirus-related lockdowns, posted its third quarterly profit in a row last week.
Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla's market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth. 
A full payoff of all tranches would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives.
When Tesla unveiled Musk’s package in 2018, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and last year it sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds.

Musk's subsequent options tranches would vest at $50 billion increments of Tesla market capitalization over the agreement's 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla's market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the high tech vehicle maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.

Investing.com - Stocks ended the day in the green as investors managed to shake off worries about potential U.S.-China battles, which could take months to materialize, if at all.
Tomorrow investors will get some more concrete data on the damage done by Covid-19 as the latest services activity figures are reported.
On the heels of Star Wars Day, there will be earnings from  Disney  , a company the sell side is very pessimistic about near term.
And there will be more on oil inventories for all those with supply jitters.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Historic Services Drop Seen
Data from the services sector highlights the economic calendar tomorrow, with activity in the largest segment of the economy expected to fall to its lowest level ever after the lockdown measures.
The Institute of Supply Management will release its April non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The ISM services index is expected to have plunged to 36.8 last month from 52.5 in March.
That would be below the all-time low for the index of 37.3 set in 2008 during the Financial Crisis.
2. Disney Facing ‘Perfect Storm’
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) leads the earnings parade tomorrow, with the company facing unprecedented effects from the Covid-19 pandemic on nearly all fronts.
Wall Street is concerned, with five downgrades on the stock coming in the past month, including today when Moffett Nathanson downgraded shares to neutral from buy, citing an “unrivaled earnings risk for the foreseeable future.”
On April 20, UBS cut the stock to neutral from buy and its price target to $114 from $162. The company is in the “eye of the storm” of the pandemic and theme parks likely won’t open until 2021, while Disney’s exposure to live sports will hit advertising hard, UBS analyst John Hodulik said.
Disney reports after the bell tomorrow, with analysts predicting a profit of 94 cents per share on revenue of about $18 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Also reporting after the bell will be Beyond Meat (NASDAQ:BYND), while DuPont (NYSE:DD) issues numbers ahead of trading.
3. API Stockpiles on Tap
Oil prices settled higher today, with WTI moving firmly above $20 per barrel. But analysts noted there are concerns about when the numbers in inventories and production cuts will start justifying the sharp recent rise.
Tomorrow the American Petroleum Institute will issue its snapshot of weekly U.S. oil inventories after the bell.
The API oil numbers have been a pretty good guide lately of what to expect from the official government numbers that arrive the next day.
Last week’s numbers showed a build of 10 million barrels in crude."

Bolsonaro was accused by former Justice Minister Sergio Moro of meddling in police investigations, and the Supreme Court has allowed federal prosecutors to investigate those claims. Now, prosecutors have asked for the court’s authorization to hear from three cabinet members close to the president: Chief of Staff Walter Braga Netto, Government Secretary Luiz Eduardo Ramos and Institutional Security Minister Augusto Heleno. Moro cited all three during his eight-hour testimony before prosecutors Saturday.
In addition to the cabinet members, prosecutors have also asked to hear from key actors in the political saga kicked off by Moro’s accusations. They include the former federal police chief Mauricio Valeixo, who was fired by Bolsonaro, drawing Moro’s complaint; Alexandre Ramagem, the Valeixo substitute whose nomination by Bolsonaro was vetoed by the Supreme Court; and lawmaker Carla Zambelli, who allegedly on behalf of the president tried to broker a deal with Moro for a Supreme Court seat in exchange for Valeixo’s removal.
According to a statement posted this Monday on the federal prosecutors’ website, prosecutors have also requested a video of an April 22 cabinet meeting in which Bolsonaro may have pressed Moro to intervene in police investigations. The federal police are conducting a number of probes that could potentially implicate members of Bolsonaro’s family, including for financial crimes and social media attacks, according to multiple reports in Brazilian media. The president and his sons have denied any wrongdoing.

1139,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",Wall Street snaps two-day slump on lift from tech titans,"By Lewis Krauskopf
(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended higher on Monday as increases in large tech and internet companies and oil price gains outweighed concerns about the latest U.S.-China tensions and downbeat sentiment from the annual meeting of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
Major U.S. indexes opened lower but moved higher throughout the afternoon to snap two-day losing streaks.
Stocks have rebounded sharply since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states trying to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak.
On Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo outlined a phased reopening of business in the state hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. California Governor Gavin Newsom said that retail businesses in the state may begin reopening as early as this week.
“Can you lift restrictions and begin to phase in economic activity and yet keep the number of cases at bay? That is what the market is focused on right now,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) in Newark, New Jersey.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) rose 26.07 points, or 0.11%, to 23,749.76, the S&P 500 (SPX) gained 12.03 points, or 0.42%, to 2,842.74 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) added 105.77 points, or 1.23%, to 8,710.72.
Gains in Microsoft (O:MSFT), Apple (O:AAPL) and Amazon (O:AMZN) were the biggest lifts for the S&P 500, following mixed reaction last week to reports from big tech names.
Energy (SPNY) was the best performing S&P 500 sector, rising 3.7%, as oil prices gained.
Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL),  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) fell between 5% and 8%, among the biggest decliners on the S&P 500 after Berkshire Hathaway dumped stakes in major U.S. airlines.
Shares of Berkshire (N:BRKa) itself fell 2.6% and weighed on the S&P 500 after the conglomerate posted a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50 billion.
Buffett, whose comments are closely followed by investors, acknowledged at Berkshire's annual meeting on Saturday that the pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
“His narrative was relatively sober compared to his posture over the years,"" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. 
A flare-up in U.S.-China tensions also pressured the market. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the new coronavirus emerged from a Chinese laboratory. An editorial in China's Global Times said he was ""bluffing"".
Investors are also digesting a difficult corporate results season. With more than half of S&P 500 companies reporting so far, first-quarter earnings are expected to have fallen 12.5%, according to Refinitiv data.
Shares of  Tyson Foods  Inc (N:TSN) tumbled 7.8% after the company said the coronavirus crisis will continue to idle U.S. meat plants and slow production as it reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter. 
Data on Monday showed new orders for U.S.-made goods suffered a record decline in March and could sink further as disruptions from the coronavirus fracture supply chains and depress exports.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.14-to-1 ratio favored advancers.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 14 new lows. 

About 9.5 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 12.1 billion-share daily average over the last 20 sessions.

PARIS/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Air France-KLM's (PA:AIRF) French unions on Monday criticised calls by their Dutch counterparts for KLM to be given greater autonomy, amid signs that a multibillion-euro coronavirus bailout is increasing tensions within the airline group.
""It's an illusion to think KLM would fare better without Air France,"" the French carrier's unions said in an open letter responding to comments last week by Dario Fucci, head of the KLM works council.
France agreed last month to issue or guarantee 7 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in loans to Air France, with another 2-4 billion pledged to KLM by the Dutch government.
But the rescue package, designed to see the group through the virus pandemic that has crippled the global airline sector, also stoked concern in the Netherlands over possible French nationalisation in a later capital increase.
The French and Dutch governments each own close to 14% of Air France-KLM, which declined to comment on the exchange of barbs between its unions.
In Dutch media interviews, the KLM union chief suggested the relationship between the airlines and the combined Air France-KLM holding company should be loosened in response to the ""exploding"" debt on the Air France side.
""The prenuptial agreement will have to change,"" Fucci was quoted as saying in De Telegraaf newspaper. ""We want to buy fuel and sell tickets together, but that's the end of it.""
The response from Air France colleagues was backed by nine of their unions including the main SNPL pilots' grouping.
""When Air France bought KLM in 2004, KLM was nearly bankrupt,"" their open letter said on Monday.
Since then, it added, ""KLM has experienced exponential growth, taking full advantage of access to the French market, which ... remains one of the largest, most attractive and most lucrative in the world."" 
The riposte came as Dutch lawmakers were preparing on Tuesday to discuss government plans to contribute up to 4 billion euros in direct and state-guaranteed loans for KLM.

The bailout was announced after Air France-KLM Chief Executive Ben Smith, who has pushed in vain for closer integration between the two airlines, gave up his 2020 bonus under Dutch government pressure.

AIG, one of the largest U.S. insurers, posted an underwriting loss of $87 million in its general insurance business in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $179 million a year earlier, mainly due to losses related to the outbreak. 
AIG set aside $419 million in catastrophe losses in the unit, which included $272 million of estimated COVID-19-related losses such as on travel, trade credit, and workers' compensation. The remainder was mainly weather-related, the company said.
Global insurers are waking up to the prospect of a double whammy - a sharp rise in payouts at a time of big investment losses as insurers' investments come under pressure and the investments they rely on to pay the claims unravel.
As recession threatens the global economy along with rising insolvencies, all sorts of companies with trade credit insurance, from airlines to retailers, are coming under strain. 
Adding to the pressure, U.S. commercial insurers are facing mounting political pressure to cover claims from businesses that are losing revenue because of coronavirus-led shutdowns ordered by state and local governments.
""We believe COVID-19 will be the single largest CAT (catastrophe) loss the industry has ever seen,"" AIG Chief Executive Officer Brian Duperreault said in a statement.AIG's total net investment income, on an adjusted basis, fell by $1 billion, to $2.7 billion, from a year ago.
The insurer's general insurance accident year combined ratio - which excludes changes from losses incurred in past years - was 95.5 for the quarter, compared with 96.1 a year ago. 
A ratio below 100 means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. 
AIG also said it decided to place Blackboard U.S. Holdings Inc, the company's technology-driven subsidiary, into run-off. AIG recognized a pretax loss of $210 million, mainly consisting of asset impairment charges. This charge did not impact adjusted pretax income, the company said. 
Adjusted net income attributable to AIG common shareholders fell to $99 million, or 11 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.39 billion, or $1.58 per share, a year earlier.

Investing.com – The Dow cut losses to end Monday in positive territory, buoyed by a wave of late buying ahead of the close in energy and technology stocks.              
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.11%, or 26 points, the S&P 500 gained 0.42%, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.23%.
Oil prices pared intraday losses to settle 3% higher for the day, spurring a sharp rise in energy stocks, with investors seemingly betting on a return in crude demand as the reopening of the economy continues.
 Valero Energy  (NYSE:VLO), Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) and Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), were among the biggest gainers, with the latter surging nearly 8%.   
Technology also underpinned the turn higher in the broader market, as FAANG names continued to attract demand following earnings from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last week.
Elsewhere, Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) cut losses to end the day 2% lower. Moffett Nathanson downgraded its rating on Disney to neutral from buy, just a day ahead of its earnings, on worries that its results were likely to suffer a worst-than-expected hit from coronavirus-led disruptions to its studio and theme parks businesses. 
Wall Street didn't have the best of starts to the session after U.S. President Donald Trump stoked U.S.-China tensions as he continued to pin blame on China over its handling of the coronavirus.  
In a virtual townhall on Fox News, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Beijing of making a ""horrible mistake"" and likening their actions to putting gasoline on an uncontrollable fire.
In recent days, The Trump administration has been exploring ways of moving supply chains away from China as the pandemic has highlighted how vulnerable the U.S. is to overseas producers in times of crisis.
As a matter of national security, many in the administration have been pushing to bring production of these lifesaving elements, including medical equipment and drugs, back to the U.S., Stifel said in a note.
Warning that the Covid-19 pandemic had changed the fundamentals for airlines, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Chairman Warren Buffett said the company had sold its major stakes in airlines stocks during the previous quarter.
American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) dropped 7.8%, United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) fell 5.11% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) lost 6.3%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are treating the U.S. equity market’s blistering rally with a dose of caution, socking away cash, staying on the sidelines or buying insurance against a reversal even as markets scream higher in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.
Fund managers and corporations have deployed over $1.1 trillion into money markets while the S&P 500 mounted a nearly 30% bounce from its March lows. Assets in such funds grew to a record $4.73 trillion in April. 
(GRAPHIC: Money fund assets hit a record high after a rapid rise this year - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/rlgpdwnaovo/Money%20markets.jpg)
Gold and other popular haven assets have edged higher, while surveys show investors remain largely pessimistic. And Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) CEO Warren Buffet, famous for buying on the cheap in past crises, revealed over the weekend that the firm had sold its entire position in four U.S. airline companies and not made any new purchases during the selloff. 
""There are a number of investors that think that maybe we have gone a little too far, a little too fast,"" said Mark Stoeckle, chief executive officer of Adams Funds.
Pessimism during rallies is not uncommon, and some argue that markets are more prone to reversals when euphoria predominates. Unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve and U.S. government have been a key factor in boosting investor confidence and alleviating market stresses. 
But many are worried that the lightning-quick bounce could easily reverse if markets are hit with bad news on any number of fronts, including the efforts of U.S. states and countries to gradually reopen their economies or a re-escalation of the U.S.-China trade war.
""Investors are pricing a reality that doesn't strike me as highly probable to unfold,"" said Hans Olsen, chief investment officer of Fiduciary Trust Company. ""We are beginning to think we should be reducing risk at this juncture.""
The rally's doubters include DoubleLine Capital's Jeffrey Gundlach, who said last week he had placed a bearish bet against the S&P 500 at 2863, and Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim Investments, who believes the stock benchmark could fall as low as 1,200.
“Many promising ... rallies fizzle as the initial euphoria clears and the grim realities of underlying fundamentals come to the fore,” analysts at Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) said in a report studying how stocks have behaved during bear markets over the past 150 years. 
The typical bear market has been slower to rebound from the bottom, averaging an 11% gain in the first three months after stocks hit a trough, the bank’s research found. 
Matt Forester, chief investment officer of BNY Mellon’s Lockwood Advisors, increased his firm's holdings in gold over the last several weeks, concerned that the market's recent gains have been concentrated in a cluster of big technology and communications companies.
The S&P's top 20 stocks accounted for 35% of its rally, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) said last month. The price of gold  - which tends to draw investors in uncertain times - has risen despite the market's surge.
Meanwhile, investors and corporations poured $512 billion into money market funds, typically viewed as low-risk, low-return investments, since March 25, more than in all of 2019, according to data from Investment Company Institute and Crane Data.
""Institutions … continue to build cash at a feverish pace,” said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data, which tracks the money market industry. “No war chest is big enough for the coronavirus.""
Robert Phipps, director at Per Stirling Capital Management, is maintaining a 9% cash allocation, versus a typical 3% to 5%. 
“I still think there’s got to be a pullback at some point,” he said.
Plenty of investors believe markets have already seen their lows. Michael Wilson, equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS), believes ""seemingly unlimited central bank support"" and fiscal stimulus will bolster equity performance.
Fed support and fiscal stimulus led analysts at JP Morgan to boost their weighting on U.S. stocks to ""neutral"" from ""underweight"" on Monday. 
Yet bearishness among retail investors remains high. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) sentiment survey for the week ended April 29 showed a 44% bearish reading. On a 4-week moving average basis, that reading hit a high of 50% in early April, its most bearish since 2009.
(GRAPHIC: AAII Sentiment Survey: Bearish - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/jbyprjkerpe/AAII.jpg) 
At the other end of the spectrum, hedge funds have stayed underweight in equities despite the rally, an analysis by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) found.
And while volatility has subsided in recent weeks, some investors are betting that markets will remain turbulent in coming months. 
Marc Odo, client portfolio manager at Swan Global Investments, has 15% of his portfolio invested in long-term put options to help hedge downside risk. He's concerned the market's gains don't reflect the U.S. economy's weakened state.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",EU's Vestager says German bailouts can be locomotive for Europe,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany's extensive bailouts of coronavirus-hit companies can work as a locomotive for Europe, the EU's competition chief said on Monday amid criticism from other, less wealthy EU countries about what they see as an unfair edge given to German firms.
To date, a whopping 52% of the 1.9 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in state aid approved by the European Commission has come from Germany, Europe's largest and wealthiest economy, channelling liquidity to its companies. In contrast, France and Italy account for about 17% each of the total.
Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who loosened the bloc's strict aid rules in March to allow governments to prop up their virus-battered economies, said German aid would have a ripple effect.
""I think it is important for us that Germany do what they do because to some degree that will work as a locomotive,"" she told European Parliament lawmakers during an online hearing.
Vestager has to date given the green light to Germany's 550 million euro state guarantee loan to carrier Condor and various other measures. ""It is absolutely fine what they do because no one can over-compensate,"" she said.
While bailouts are necessary in view of the widespread and deep impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are inevitable negative side-effects for some countries, said Alfonso Lamadrid, a partner at law firm Garrigues.
""Under the current temporary framework, all member states enjoy the same freedom to unleash their economic arsenal, but some may end up using bazookas, while others are stuck using slingshots,"" he said.
Vestager said a huge stimulus package touted by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to kick-start the EU economy once the pandemic ends could help level the playing field.
""The sad thing of course is that since not everyone has the same fiscal space as Germany, well, we have to find ways, and I think one of the most important ways to deal with this asymmetry is to have a strong European recovery plan on the architecture of the MFF,"" Vestager said, referring to the EU executive's seven-year budget.
She said there were sufficient safeguards such as a ban on dividends, bonuses and share buybacks built into her proposal to allow governments to take a stake in bailed-out companies without distorting competition. 
""That will enable states also to have an incentive to step out while also the businesses will have an incentive for the states to step out.""
However, sources have told Reuters that some EU countries are lobbying for even more relaxation of the rules for this measure.

1153,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 04, 2020 02:18PM ET</span>",JPMorgan Sees Room for Short-Covering to ‘Propel’ Risky Assets,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors rushing to close their bearish bets may drive the next rally in stocks and junk bonds, according to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co.
The $252 billion SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, ticker SPY (NYSE:SPY), remains “firmly in oversold territory” despite posting a record monthly surge in April, JPMorgan strategists wrote in a note last week. Meanwhile, though investors have unwound short positions against high-grade bonds, bearish bets are still elevated for high-yield ETFs such as BlackRock’s $20 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, ticker HYG, they wrote.
“We still find room for further short-covering,” strategists led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. “There is enough short base to propel risky markets further from here, in particular equities and HY credit.”
Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on SPY -- a rough indicator of bearish bets on the fund -- is currently 6.4%, according to data from IHS Markit Ltd. Short-interest reached a near-record of 7.4% on March 3.
SPY surged a record 12.7% in April, after declining 13% in March as the coronavirus outbreak rattled markets. Despite April’s advance, SPY is still down more than 12% year-to-date. The ETF fell 0.4% at 12:33 p.m. in New York Monday as the U.S. escalated trade rhetoric against China.
Investors are also wary on junk-rated corporate bonds despite the Federal Reserve’s pledge to backstop credit markets, the analysts said. Short interest as a percentage of shares outstanding on HYG is a still-elevated 19.7%, after hitting a record 39% in late February, IHS Markit data shows.
“The short base on HY ETFs remains elevated despite the past week’s decline, suggesting that credit investors remain more cautious on the lower rated sectors,” they wrote.

Investing.com –  Disney  is set to report quarterly earnings on Tuesday, but some on Wall Street are warning that the results are likely to signal the company's biggest businesses are in for rockier ride than many expect.
Moffett Nathanson downgraded Disney to neutral from buy and lowered its price target on the stock to $112 from $120, on worries that lockdown measures, including to social distancing, and a potential second wave of Covid-19 infections pose ""significant and unrivaled earnings risk for the foreseeable future.""
Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) fell 3%
""Our analysis makes it clear to us that Disney is in for a long stretch of significant negative revisions as estimates catch up to the grim reality, said Moffett Nathanson. ""Our Disney downgrade is also an admission that we believe the economic impact on the company will be longer than most anticipate, especially given the risks of a second wave of infections after reopening.""
The investment firm cut its estimates on Disney's earnings by $0.80 a share to $2.35 a share for 2020, by $1.40 to $2.95 for 2021 and by $1.05 to $4.40 for 2022.
Disney's theme parks and studio entertainment businesses, which together account for about half of overall revenue, and its media networks business would likely suffer a worse-than-first-projected advertising decline in the coming quarters, Moffett Nathanson said.
While the lockdown measures will boost other areas of the company's business, particularly in streaming – Hulu and Disney+ -- the units ""do not contribute free cash flow to offset the erosion elsewhere,"" the firm added.
Others on Wall Street also trimmed their outlook on Disney ahead of quarterly earnings, with  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) cutting its price target on the stock to $125 from $130. 
Disney is expected to report earnings of 94 cents a share on revenue of $18.08 billion."
1155,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Coronavirus will constrain U.S. meat supply despite Trump order: Tyson Foods,"By Tom Polansek and Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis will continue to idle U.S. meat plants and slow production,  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) said on Monday, signaling more disruptions to the U.S. food supply after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered facilities to stay open.
Tyson reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenue for the quarter ended on March 28, before processors shut massive slaughterhouses as the respiratory illness spread among workers. Shares fell more than 8% as Tyson also said meat sales will fall in the second half of the year because the outbreak has reduced restaurant demand.
Trump last week deemed meatpacking plants ""critical infrastructure"" that must stay open, in an executive order to protect the nation's food supply.
""There have been some shortages in some specific categories,"" Chief Executive Noel White told analysts on a conference call.
Tyson is working with government officials to resume operations at a massive beef plant it closed in Dakota City, Nebraska, White said. The company over the weekend was receiving results for COVID-19 tests it performed on employees of another shuttered beef plant in Pasco, Washington, he said.
Tyson also temporarily closed Iowa pork plants in Waterloo and Perry, and said on Friday it would re-open a pork plant in Logansport, Indiana.
When plants reopen, it is unknown how employees many will immediately return to work amid fears about the virus. One worker at Tyson's Waterloo facility told Reuters he planned to take three weeks of vacation time to stay away.
The country's capacity to slaughter hogs has dropped by about 50% from before the pandemic, Tyson President Dean Banks told analysts. The company consolidated its product offerings to help keep supplies flowing to consumers, he added later on a call with reporters. 
Retail demand for Tyson's meat has increased 30-40% as consumers stay home, but the company said sales will decline in the second half of the year because of lost foodservice and restaurant business. 
Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and Kroger (NYSE:KR) Co have limited meat purchases.
Tyson warned prior to Trump's order that millions of pounds of beef, pork and chicken would vanish from U.S. grocery stores because of plant shutdowns. Its chairman said the U.S. ""food supply chain is breaking"" as farmers began euthanizing pigs because they lost markets for them.
Sales rose 4.3% to $10.89 billion, in the second quarter ended March 28. Analysts had expected revenue of $10.96 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 

Excluding items, the company earned 77 cents per share, missing estimates of a profit $1.04 per share.

1158,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Alitalia suspends its last long-haul flight,"MILAN (Reuters) - Alitalia [CAITLA.UL] said it will suspend its daily direct flight between Rome and New York from Tuesday until the end of May, cancelling its last long-haul connection still operating during the coronavirus crisis.
Alitalia, which is being nationalised following financial problems, said in a statement on Monday that the move was due to a marked slowdown in demand in the last 10 days of April and a worrying level of Covid-19 cases in New York.
FNTA - a federation of three Italian flight crew trade unions - said it opposed the suspension of the New York flight, arguing it would push passengers to fly with rival Air France (PA:AIRF) instead.
FNTA wrote on Monday to Alitalia's top executives and Italy's transport and industry ministers, outlining its opposition. 
""We consider this decision to be absolutely inexplicable and unacceptable, both for commercial reasons and in general, because it deprives Italian citizens of the only direct connection still existing between Italy and the United States and diverts passengers to Air France-KLM,"" FNTA said in the letter seen by Reuters.
Alitalia's state-appointed administrator Giuseppe Leogrande said last week that the carrier was operating around one tenth of the 500 flights it ran every day before the coronavirus crisis.
He said the carrier had suffered a 95% fall in passenger revenue in the first three weeks of April, adding management was putting in place several measures to cut costs as the company prepared itself to be nationalised.
The Italian government has earmarked 500 million euros ($546 million) for the carrier and plans to take full control of it in June.

Alitalia has endured 11 years of difficult private management and three failed restructuring attempts, problems exacerbated by the coronavirus crisis that has devastated the global airline industry.

1161,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>","Ferrari slowed by coronavirus, but not driven off course","By Giulio Piovaccari
MILAN (Reuters) - Luxury sports car maker  Ferrari  (MI:RACE) still expects to make more than $1 billion in core profit this year, providing a relative beacon of stability in an auto industry ravaged by the coronavirus crisis. 
The company, known for its red Formula One racing cars and its prancing horse logo, cut its 2020 core earnings forecast on Monday, blaming a hit to motor sport revenues among other pressures, and warning of an extremely tough second quarter. 
But the Italian firm said it still expected to generate free cash flow this year, and its guidance contrasted with others in the industry - including U.S. electric carmaker Tesla (O:TSLA), Germany's  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) and Porsche-owner Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) - which have all suspended forecasting.
""This extraordinary level of stability in an economic crisis takes top place at the podium,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analysts said.
Ferrari shares closed up 1.5% at 154.50 euros, having fallen over 5% immediately after news of the downgrade. By contrast, Europe's auto index (SXAP) closed down 4.4%.
Car sales across the world have slumped as measures to contain the virus pandemic forced production lines to shut and showrooms to close. Data on Monday showed the biggest ever drop in business morale in Germany's auto sector.
Ferrari, which on Monday restarted operations at its plants in Maranello and Modena, predicted a ""harsh"" reduction of revenues linked to Formula One, where races have been suspended, as well as reduced turnover from brand projects and lower engine shipments to Maserati.
""Second quarter will be very weak,"" Chief Executive Louis Camilleri told analysts, as the company said it now expected adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) this year to edge down from 2019 levels to 1.05-1.20 billion euros ($1.15-$1.31 billion).
In February, Ferrari had projected an increase in 2020 EBITDA to 1.38-1.43 billion euros.
""While the Formula One hit to revenues and earnings is not an easy matter to digest, the good news is that the significant losses incurred should be short-lived and contained to 2020,"" Camilleri said.
The CEO said projections relied on Ferrari's ability to retain a ""very strong"" order book, adding that as of now it had not received any ""abnormal or untoward"" cancellations. 
GENERATING CASH
Ferrari, whose origins date back to 1929, said it now expected industrial free cash flow of 100-200 million euros this year, compared with 400 million euros or more previously.
The company, which like its former parent  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) is controlled by the Exor (MI:EXOR) holding company of the Agnelli family, cautioned its new guidance did not include a potential second wave of COVID-19 infections. 
In the first quarter of this year, adjusted EBITDA rose 1.9% to 317 million euros, broadly in line with a 322 million euro forecast in an analyst poll compiled by Reuters. 
Ferrari's two plants, both located in Italy's northern Emilia Romagna region, had been closed since mid March. 
Volumes rose despite delivery suspensions due to the virus outbreak, driven by 488 Pista and 488 Pista Spider models, along with the ramp up of the F8 Tributo, the company said.
The margin on adjusted EBITDA came in at 34% in the first quarter, up from 33.1% a year earlier. 
Ferrari said its total available liquidity at the end of March was 1.23 billion euros. Last month, it secured additional committed credit lines worth 350 million euros, with maturities up to 24 months, taking total committed, available and undrawn credit lines to 700 million euros, it said.

Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton predicted in an interview on Bloomberg TV that curtailing production in a process known as “pro-rationing” would fail to get the support needed from the three-member agency.

The announcement came hours after Uber said it was shuttering its Eats delivery business in several markets, including the Middle East, and laying off dozens of staff.
Careem, which operates ride-hailing and delivery businesses primarily in the Middle East, said it was prioritising the security of the company and that parent Uber continued to believe in its business model and was committed to the region.
""As we have discussed several times in the last few weeks, the crisis brought on by COVID-19 has put our dream and future impact at significant risk,"" Chief Executive Mudassir Sheikha said in a blog on Careem's website.
Sheikha, who founded the company in 2012, said business was down by more than 80% and that it was ""alarmingly unknown"" when it would recover. 
""In this new reality, the surest way to secure Careem for the long term is to drive towards self-sustainability within a reasonable time frame,"" he said.
Careem did not say how much it expected to save from the layoffs or which business units staff had been cut from. However, it said tech-colleagues were protected in relative terms so it could continue to invest in its products.
Affected employees would receive at least three months severance pay, a month of equity vesting and in some cases extended visa and medical insurance, including for family members, until the end of the year.
The Careem BUS mass-transportation operation has also been suspended, it said.
Careem has also found ""significant savings"" from pausing new benefits, it said without disclosing details.
Uber earlier announced it was closing its food delivery business in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other countries, while its United Arab Emirates operations would move to Careem.

LONDON (Reuters) - Like the myriad approaches governments are taking to tackle the coronavirus crisis, the way the world's top banks are calculating their potential losses also differs widely, with puzzling outcomes for investors.
These discrepancies are rooted in the interpretation of new accounting rules called IFRS9, which have been designed to promote transparency and stability by making banks account for loan losses earlier.
But rather than solving problems seen during the 2008-9 financial crisis, when markets were blindsided by a sudden deterioration in bank balance sheet health, IFRS9 is confounding the same investors they are meant to help.
While the rules aim to provide a more realistic and timely picture of bank exposures, some have described their application as more art than science. Critics go further; complaining the system is complex, opaque and vulnerable to abuse.
""It makes a mockery of financial reporting if banks can report better numbers simply by assuming a more benign outlook -either intentionally or unintentionally,"" Ed Firth, banking analyst at KBW, told Reuters.
A Reuters analysis of first quarter regulatory filings highlights the extent to which banks are basing their estimates of how bad loans will rise on differing economic forecasts.
For example,  Barclays  (L:BARC) used an 8% fall in UK GDP and 6.7% unemployment as its baseline scenario for 2020, while fellow British lender Lloyds Banking Group (L:LLOY) had a 5% contraction in GDP and 5.9% unemployment.
Barclays booked a larger-than-expected 2.12 billion pound ($2.63 billion) credit impairment charge, while Lloyds set aside 1.4 billion pounds. Diverging economic forecasts don't explain all of that variation, but they make it harder for investors to understand the banks' models. 
Lloyds' Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said last week that while his bank's 2020 forecast was comparatively less gloomy, its prediction for 3% growth in 2021 was more realistic. 
""We are assuming a prudent recovery in the second year of 3% only, so our combined impact on the two years is a negative 2% GDP,"" Horta-Osorio said.
Barclays, which expects a 6.3% bounce back in 2021, said its forecast ""reflects the most recent economic forecasts available in the market combined with internal assumptions"".
Filippo Alloatti, Senior Credit Analyst, International at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) said he was undecided on whether IFRS9 was a help or a hindrance to bank investors.
""We knew IFRS9 was untested in a recessionary environment. It gets complicated when banks are using a 'scenario cocktail' and not disclosing the relative weighting of each scenario,"" he said.
'PORTFOLIO RISKS'
With banks not obliged to provide full details of their models in the first quarter and little clarity over when and how lockdown measures will be eased, much hinges on how management opts to ""overlay"" economist forecasts with their own numbers.
This allows them to factor in the impact of measures not within normal GDP models, including the length of lockdowns, furlough schemes to protect incomes and loan guarantees.
""IFRS 9 requires management to come up with their best estimates, and if the models won't capture that you can use other techniques but it is not an exact science,"" said Karim Haji, Head of Financial Services UK at KPMG.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which provisioned 500 million euros for likely credit losses, based its calculation on a 6.9% fall in euro zone GDP, while Italy's UniCredit (MI:CRDI) made a 900 million euro provision based on a 13% GDP decline.
James von Moltke, finance chief for Germany's biggest bank, said last week he shared analysts' concerns about comparability of provisions and had discussed the issue with regulators.
But the new accounting standards and changes in methodology did not undermine the ability to assess whether each bank had made appropriate provisions, he told analysts.
""You've got to start with how you compare each bank on the basis of the portfolio risks that they have,"" von Moltke said, pointing to Deutsche Bank's far smaller unsecured lending book.
""It's entirely natural that you'd expect significant differences in the total provision level that we would take relative to some of our peers,"" he added. 
UniCredit said its loan loss provision reflected in-house macroeconomic assumptions on the impact of the coronavirus adjusted for mitigating actions by the government and ECB. It declined to comment further on the use of a management overlay.
PART ART, PART SCIENCE 
U.S. banks, which reported earlier in April, generally presented a more bearish, conservative picture of the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, analysts said.
Bank of America (N:BAC), JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM),  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) and  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) set aside an aggregate $14.2 billion in loan loss provisions.
That is partly because U.S. banks use an accounting standard which requires them to book expected losses for a loan over its lifespan whereas IFRS9, which is used in Europe, recognises different 'stages' of troubled loans.
Europe's biggest lender by assets, HSBC (L:HSBA), shocked markets with its $7 billion to $11 billion provision estimate for 2020, while Asia-focused rival  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) provisioned $956 million for the quarter.
Finance chief Ewen Stevenson said HSBC's provisions were ""part art, part science"", as bankers faced the impossible task of predicting in models how bad the pandemic slowdown will be.
""I wouldn't try and say, 'Look, here's a GDP forecast, a GDP recovery profile; and that gets you to X,' I think that's too simplistic,"" Stevenson added.
Bankers said IFRS9 can exacerbate crises by having a 'pro-cyclical' effect in which recognising losses earlier paints a darker picture, leading to a worsening of economic sentiment. 
Regulators have tried to provide clarity on how banks should report early signs of coronavirus distress among borrowers, amid fears that IFRS9 could hurt markets if mishandled.
But some say this has added to the confusion.
""Regulators and the European Commission have gone to big lengths in demanding the banks are not too trigger-happy,"" Alloatti said.
""The last thing they want is banks stopping refinancing the economy and impairing the transmission mechanism.""

1168,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 04, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Bad Start to May Is a Sign of Things to Come for Markets,"(Bloomberg) -- Sell in May and go away? The negative start to the month raises concern that the partial recovery in April is going to be about as good as it gets for risk assets.
For all the optimism stemming from the gradual easing of lockdown measures in some of the biggest economies, there are too many worries on the minds of traders to sustain the momentum from last month. The fear of a second wave of coronavirus infections, the collapse in corporate earnings and the shocks reverberating from the economic data are toxic enough. Now throw in a new eruption of political sparring between the U.S. and China, this time over the origin of the virus.
“A fresh threat of U.S.-China tariff escalation is yet another aftershock of the original crisis that is reinforcing a dollar-supportive backdrop,” said JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. currency strategists including London-based Paul Meggyesi and Meera Chandan.
On Monday, Asian and European markets provided a taste of how the week may unfold. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index tumbled 4.2%, while French and German stocks sank more than 3%. S&P 500 Index futures retreated as much as 1.8%. Japan and China’s onshore markets were shut for holidays.
The dollar and yen rose on demand for haven assets, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot index gaining 0.2%. The Indonesian rupiah led a drop in emerging-market currencies, posting its biggest decline in six weeks.
Warren Buffett on Saturday tempered his normally bullish optimism during a meeting for  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  . (NYSE:BRKa) shareholders. A lot of uncertainty hangs over the market, he said. Still, he expects equities will outperform Treasuries over the long run and urged investors not to bet against America.
Though U.S. stocks clocked up their best month since 1987 in April, prices slipped Friday as a string of companies issued profit warnings and President Donald Trump stepped up condemnation of China over trade and the handling of the Covid-19 outbreak. The S&P 500 retreated 2.8% and U.S. Treasury yields dropped.

“There is one clear implication: The era of tax cuts is over,” Millstein said Monday in a Bloomberg Television interview. It’s “inevitable” that the wealthy will face greater taxes, he said. “People who have been fortune enough to be able to make significant incomes are going to have to make a greater contribution.”

The restructuring banker, whose firm is working with companies in the travel industry burned by the pandemic, said he’s concerned about businesses taking on more debt while still unable to generate revenue during the economic lockdown.
He said unprecedented support by the U.S. Federal Reserve to backstop credit markets has benefited investors in a way they’ll eventually have to pay back.
“That kind of support for the investor class is ultimately something the investor class is ultimately going to have to pay for,” Millstein said. “If we’re really creating a backstop against credit losses then, you know, eventually, if this government is doing that much for that class, then that class is going to have to start paying for it.”
He said support for personal income is the best method of intervention, through direct payments to individuals.

(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said on Monday it was planning to cut the global workforce of its aviation unit this year by as much as 25%, or up to 13,000 jobs, including both voluntary and involuntary layoffs, citing prolonged aircraft reduction schedules caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The job cuts are the latest mounting woes for the aviation sector that are now expected to last into 2021 as U.S. passenger air travel demand has fallen by 95%.
Last week,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said it would cut 10% of its global workforce, or 16,000 jobs, as it has slowed some production rates, while supplier SpiritAero Systems Holdings (N:SPR) said on Friday it is cutting another 1,450 jobs in Kansas.
GE shares were down 4% on at $6.23.
The GE Aviation job cuts are part of the $3 billion in cost and cash savings announced by the company last month and include previously announced cuts, including a 10% cut to its U.S. workforce announced in March. 
GE Aviation Chief Executive David Joyce told employees on Monday the ""deep contraction of commercial aviation is unprecedented, affecting every customer worldwide. Global traffic is expected to be down approximately 80% in the second quarter.""
GE Aviation previously issued furloughs impacting about 50% of its U.S. maintenance, repair and overhaul employees and new engine manufacturing. It also imposed a hiring freeze, canceled a salaried merit increase and dramatically reduced non-essential spending.
Neither GE nor Boeing opted to apply for government assistance from a $17 billion U.S. Treasury fund for national security related companies. Boeing said it would rely on $25 billion raised in a new bond offering.

Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said last week he expects it will ""take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends.""

1171,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",U.S. airline shares tumble as Buffett sell-off adds to worries,"(Reuters) - Shares of the top four U.S. airlines dropped on Monday after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway (N:BRKa) offloaded its entire stake in the carriers last month, adding to the sense of crisis around the industry.
U.S. airlines posted considerable losses in the first quarter, and are on track for a dismal second quarter, as travel restrictions and government-mandated lockdowns across the world have brought demand to a virtual standstill.
""The world has changed"" for the aviation industry, Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday.
American Airlines (O:AAL) has posted a $2.2 billion net loss, its first quarterly loss since emerging from bankruptcy in 2013, while United Airlines (O:UAL) reported a loss of $1.7 billion for its first quarter.
Shares in Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) American Airlines and United Airlines fell more than 13% after the start of trading, but had pared losses by mid-morning. United was last down 6.9%, American was down 7.8% and Delta was down 8.5%. Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) had also pared losses and was last down 6.9%
“Investors looking at the (airlines) group, are technicians, traders, people buying distress for fairly quick bounces,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive at investment adviser Horizon Investment Services LLC, which held Southwest shares until a month ago.
“Long-term investors are saying ‘Do I want to sit with airline stocks, that may take four to five years for sustained moves upward, or put my money elsewhere,’"" said Carlson. ""They may feel some new opportunities have developed that are better than things they are holding and can rebound more quickly.”
The S&P 1500 Airlines index <.SPCOMAIR> has lost 57.4% this year, compared with a 12.4% decline in the broader S&P 500 (SPX).
Vertical Research Partners analyst Robert Stallard said the worst is yet to come for the sector given that many airlines have cut capacity around 90% for April and May.
""Until we get some clarity and stability from the global airline sector, we think it is hard to gauge how deep and wide this aerospace canyon is going to be,"" Stallard said.
Airline executives have warned of a slow recovery even after the virus is contained and have said demand may not recover to 2019 levels for years.
Airlines in the United States have seen a near 95% drop in domestic passengers and are now working to reassure customers about the safety of air travel by instituting new cleaning and social distancing procedures.
Data from Dealogic showed that globally airlines have about $10 billion in bonds due to expire in 2020 and $4.7 billion in loans.
Major airline bonds fell in mid-morning trade according to data from MarketAxess. United Airlines' (O:UAL) 5% February 2024 bond was down 5% in price to trade at 70 cents on the dollar, the second biggest downward movement among U.S. corporate bonds on Monday. Three of the top 10 downwards movers in price were Delta bonds. 

Berkshire Hathaway had held an 11% stake in Delta, 10% in American, 10% in Southwest and 9% in United at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.

1172,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 04, 2020 10:45AM ET</span>",Dirt-Cheap U.S. Mortgages Thwarted by $5 Billion in Margin Calls,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s emergency rescue of the U.S. mortgage market should have set off celebration among lenders trying to keep up with demand from borrowers. Instead, executives at Quicken Loans got a hefty margin call.
That was just a fraction of the pain the Fed unintentionally inflicted on lenders in mid-March when it announced plans to buy a massive amount of mortgage securities. The move, meant to steady the market, caught many lenders by surprise and tipped their routine hedges deep into the red.
It’s added to strains throughout the industry that have left the gap between mortgage rates and benchmark Treasuries the widest since 2009. Back then, bank failures and concerns about the housing market kept home loans from becoming cheaper for borrowers. Now, it’s obscure parts of the financial world that are holding back efforts to shave thousands of dollars from many Americans’ biggest expenses -- their mortgages.
“The Fed came in trying to help, but they overshot,” said Phil Rasori, chief operating officer of Mortgage Capital Trading Inc., which says it handles hedging for about 20% of the mortgage market. He estimates margin calls initially drained as much as $5 billion from lenders before the Fed eased off, posing “an existential threat” to some nonbanks that operate on thin cash cushions, selling off loans as soon as they’re made.
Mortgage lenders promise to lock in interest rates for borrowers weeks before loans are finalized, then hedge that risk by shorting mortgage-related securities. But the Fed’s buying drove up prices for those assets, turning the safeguards into sudden demands for cash. Quicken, among the largest U.S. mortgage lenders, met its obligations during the period, spokesperson John Perich said.
“Every responsible lender hedges their interest-rate risk,” with money shifting daily to keep the contracts in parity, Perich said. “The significant price fluctuations in March meant that large margin balances flowed back and forth between lenders and broker-dealers. Quicken Loans was able to easily meet these obligations thanks to our fortress balance sheet -- thus enabling us to continue originating record volumes.” He declined to comment on the size of the margin call Quicken received.
In a sign of the concern among investors, Quicken’s two 10-year bonds traded below 91 cents on the dollar in late March, from above par at the end of February. Those prices have mostly recovered, with both trading around 98 cents on Friday. For a time, market turbulence prompted lenders including Quicken to stop offering rate locks near the start of the mortgage process. Perich said that standard practice is resuming at Quicken.
As the coronavirus pandemic sent global markets into a tailspin, the Fed slashed interest rates almost to zero and embarked on a series of programs to pump cash into markets, opening up lending facilities and buying assets ranging from Treasuries to risky corporate debt. Mortgage bonds were among the first it targeted.
The opportunity to refinance into a cheaper rate is now grabbing headlines. But the trend captivating Wall Street is the canyon between the U.S. government’s cost of borrowing money and rates offered to homeowners. Normally, 10-year U.S. Treasuries set the tone for 30-year mortgages, but the gap between them is now 2.9 percentage points, near levels last seen in late 2008 and early 2009. In the last five years, it’s averaged closer to 1.74.
Consumers could grab rates as low as 2.25% on traditional 30-year government-backed mortgages if markets were behaving normally, according to Optimal Blue LLC, whose software is used by much of the industry. Bankrate.com was showing average rates above 3.5% on Friday.
The Fed’s aim is to support the smooth functioning of mortgage-securities markets so that American households can benefit from lower rates, Lorie Logan, who leads the central bank’s open-market operations desk in New York, said in a speech last month. She cautioned that the Fed’s support doesn’t mean “restoring every aspect of market functioning to its level before the coronavirus crisis.” A spokesperson for the New York Fed had no additional comment.
In interviews, executives at mortgage lenders, service providers and across the securitization industry said the margin calls created enormous tensions. The need to pony up cash set off a stampede by nonbank lenders to finish up loans and get them off their books. But to do that, they needed help from other parts of the industry facing their own challenges amid the pandemic.
Several senior executives said the impact of margin calls is abating but will continue to be felt through June, when mortgages from the spring are finally closed and sold. In the meantime, that means less competition to drive down rates.
United Wholesale Mortgage, one of the country’s biggest home loan providers, agreed to make a record number of loans in March but pulled back in April in response to the market turbulence, said Alex Elezaj, the company’s chief strategy officer. It cut underwriting time from a few days to just hours so it could close loans as quickly as possible.
The hurdles to offloading loans are myriad.
Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC), the government-owned mortgage giants that buy loans and bundle them for sale to investors, are offering to pay significantly less for debts than their implied value in related mortgage securities, industry executives said. The enterprises, bailed out by taxpayers a decade ago, guarantee mortgages they take on and are facing unprecedented uncertainty as the coronavirus pandemic costs tens of millions of Americans their jobs.
Data on Optimal Blue’s platform suggest the price cuts alone are forcing lenders to offer household mortgage rates up to 0.5 percentage point higher than normal.
A representative for Fannie Mae said the company’s pricing derives directly from mortgage-backed securities and reflects market rates. A spokesperson for Freddie Mac echoed that, adding that mortgage lenders’ capacity restraints are what’s driving the divergence between interest rates on new loans and yields on mortgage securities.
Other large financial institutions that normally buy mortgages from smaller lenders pulled back too, Rasori said. Some funnel key paperwork to offices in India that were temporarily shuttered by outbreaks. Those purchases are just starting to ramp back up.
Paperwork Snags
Government-ordered social distancing is tying up property appraisals and processing. One bottleneck formed at Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE:BK) Corp., one of the nation’s largest keepers of mortgage paperwork. Loan sellers need BNY Mellon to certify their documents before buyers such as Fannie Mae can wire the cash. What used to take two days has been taking five, industry executives said. Such waits force lenders to ease off on new loans, said Brian Gilpin, vice president of capital markets at Embrace Home Loans Inc.
“We are actively engaging with clients, partners and market participants regarding our processes given the extraordinary levels of market activity,” BNY Mellon spokesperson Madelyn McHugh said in an emailed statement. Chief Executive Officer Thomas Gibbons acknowledged in late March that some work was taking longer than usual, but said it had so far “been very limited.”
Interest rates on home loans are also tied to the health of the mortgage servicing industry, the low-margin business of handling monthly payments. The right to service mortgages is sold as an asset to companies that earn their money back by collecting fees over time. The pandemic drove down the value of existing rights by making it harder to collect debts and by prompting creditworthy borrowers to refinance.
When servicing rights drop in value, mortgage originators have to charge more to compensate, pushing up the cost of new loans, said David Battany, an executive vice president at Guild Mortgage Co.
Hedging is normally an obscure part of the $11 trillion U.S. mortgage market. Most home loans are backed by the government and packaged into securities, many of which are created via To Be Announced trades, in which investors agree to buy securities that meet generic criteria, sometimes months in advance.
The process helps almost everyone involved: Borrowers lock in rates much earlier; lenders sell loans long before they’re finalized; trading is easier for investors. But lenders assume a risk when they promise low rates far in advance. If interest rates rise before the loan is sold, it loses value. Most lenders set up hedges, often shorting mortgage securities issued by government-controlled home loan giants.
A group affiliated with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recommended in 2012 that lenders and dealers collect margin from each other on those trades, triggering early payments if prices move. A pending rule by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority mandating margin is scheduled to kick in next year.
The surge in margin calls in March came when the industry could least afford it, mortgage bankers and their advisers said. A drop in rates weeks earlier sent households rushing to refinance, generating record applications at some large lenders. Lenders piled on massive hedges.
The daily volume of rate locks logged by Optimal Blue during the first week of March peaked at nearly five times the level at the start of the year. Mortgage bankers typically hedge 75% to 80% of their pipeline, said Jim Glennon, director of secondary services at the firm. Its pipeline and market share imply lenders may have set up hedges on roughly $400 billion of committed mortgages in March alone.
Sudden Reversal
Those deals can sour quickly if asset prices jump. In just two days, Nations Lending Corp. went from being owed $1 million on hedges to owing dealers $5 million, CEO Jeremy Sopko said. Nations met its margin calls in part by speeding up loan closings and sales.
Shortly after the Fed’s announcement, the Mortgage Bankers Association warned that the purchases were prompting “unsustainable” margin calls. Lenders complained that indiscriminate buying was hurting more than helping.
An industry rule of thumb is that every point move higher in TBA prices on a $100 million pipeline of prospective mortgages results in $1 million of required margin. Prices for some TBA securities rose five points in five days, Optimal Blue’s Glennon said, which on a $20 billion pipeline would equate to a $1 billion margin call.
The Fed has since slowed its buying, prompting relief across the mortgage industry. Meanwhile, the pipeline of mortgages lenders are waiting to close is about double where it was as the year began, according to Optimal Blue.
“Lenders are holding their breath,” Battany said.

1173,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",BoE's Woods says banks have enough lending capacity in pandemic,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks should have more than enough available capital to back the expected volume of loans to help companies bridge the coronavirus pandemic, Bank of England Deputy Governor Sam Woods said on Monday.
The central bank has allowed lenders to tap 23 billion pounds ($28.6 billion) of capital known as the countercyclical capital buffer to support loans worth up to 190 billion pounds as Britain heads for deep recession.
""It should be enough to accommodate even a pretty upper-end estimate of what might be needed here,"" Woods told a City & Financial webinar.
Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) Chairman Howard Davies told the webinar that banks need more reassurance from regulators on the amount of time they would be given to rebuild capital buffers once the pandemic has passed.
""Without some reassurance about that, banks may be faced with constraints on lending in the recovery phase, which could be just the time you don't want those constraints,"" Davies said.
""That is something we need a further clarification on.""
Regulators and the government have put in place lending schemes and relief such as three-month mortgage payment holidays to help people and businesses ride out the pandemic.
The BoE announced on Monday that it would allow banks to exclude such loans from the calculation of their leverage ratio, a broad measure of capital strength, as an incentive to continue lending.
""No one knows quite how wide the chasm we are trying to work across is right now,"" Christopher Woolard, interim CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), told the webinar.
He said the FCA has received more than 600 requests from financial businesses for relief from rules of one kind or another, with most granted.
""We have to be realistic that not every firm is going to make the other side,"" Woolard said.
RBS Chairman Davies said that companies taking on the loans will not recover at the same rate and some may not survive at all, meaning discussions need to take place soon on how to exit the ""highly unusual schemes and highly unusual interventions"".
""My verdict on the regulatory response to the crisis ... is so far, so good, but perhaps we have done the easy bit and the tough mechanism for regulating as we move into the recovery phase has still to be resolved,"" Davies said.
Banks have already begun making large provisions for losses on their loans, though Woods reiterated that lenders should take into account mitigating factors such as government relief for businesses during the pandemic.
Woods, who also heads the BoE's Prudential (NYSE:PUK) Regulation Authority (PRA), said banks should still take a realistic view on what might happen to loans but avoid an overly mechanical adjustment.
Davies said the PRA has taken a ""very sensible"" approach to provisions at banks during the pandemic.

Lending through the Fed’s so-called secondary market corporate credit facility and primary market corporate credit facility via purchases of corporate bonds will begin soon thereafter, the New York Fed announced Monday on its website.
“Additional details on timing will be made available as those dates approach,” it said.
The credit facilities are backed by the more than $2 trillion economic relief package passed by Congress in March, to help shield the U.S. economy from the harm of the coronavirus pandemic. Businesses across the nation have shuttered to limit contagion and more than 30 million people have claimed unemployment benefits in the last six weeks.
Fed officials first announced the creation of the facilities on March 23. Though they’ve not yet been launched, the announcement has had an important stabilizing effect in financial markets.
“Many companies that would’ve had to come to the Fed have now been able to finance themselves privately since we announced the initial term sheet on these facilities,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said during an April 29 press conference. “The ultimate demand for the facilities is quite difficult to predict because there is this ‘announcement effect’ that really gets the market functioning again. Of course, we have to follow through, though. And we will follow through to validate that announcement effect.”
Investors have piled into bond ETFs in anticipation of the Fed’s purchases. BlackRock’s $20 billion iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, the largest junk-debt ETF, attracted a record monthly inflow of $3.7 billion in April. Meanwhile, the $46 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF has rallied roughly 12.5% since the Fed’s initial announcement in March.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 09:50AM ET</span>",VW's Skoda braces for second-quarter hit after earnings drop,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - Czech carmaker Skoda Auto, part of the Volkswagen Group (DE:VOWG_p), reported a 25% drop in first-quarter operating profit on Monday, but said the biggest hit from the coronavirus outbreak would come in the second quarter.
Skoda, the Czech Republic's largest exporter which counts China as its biggest individual market, started feeling the impact of the coronavirus crisis during the first three months of the year as its global sales fell by a quarter and it shut its domestic factories for 39 days beginning in March.
However, the company said the biggest impact from the pandemic was still to come and it had started measures to reduce costs and spending in the short term.
""We expect the greatest impact of the current crisis to be in the second quarter, followed by a gradual recovery in the third quarter and a possible return to the previous year’s level in the fourth quarter,"" board member Klaus-Dieter Schurmann said.
First-quarter revenue fell 1.4% to 4.85 billion euros, while worldwide deliveries tumbled 24% to 232,900 vehicles. Not including China, deliveries fell 16%.
Skoda has boosted annual deliveries above 1 million in recent years but like other carmakers has been hit hard the virus outbreak, which started in China around the turn of the year before hitting Europe in force in March.
Skoda relaunched production at a reduced pace on April 27 and the entire car sector in the central European country faces a shaky restart, with officials expecting the sector to run below capacity this year.
Skoda Chief Executive Bernhard Maier said the shutdown meant a loss in production of 100,000 cars. He said it was still difficult to forecast global car sales in the coming months but that the company was well positioned.

""We are fighting for every car, because our order backlog is still high,"" he said, adding Skoda was sticking to its medium and long-term development plans.

1178,By Investing.com,"<span>May 04, 2020 09:38AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Opens Lower as Trump Trade Threats Dampen Mood,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets fell to a two-week low at the opening on Monday, extending Friday's losses after President Donald Trump warned of reheating the trade war with China as a reprisal for its role in the Covid-19 pandemic.
By 9:35 AM ET (1335 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 333 points, or 1.4% at 23.390 points, while the S&P 500 was down 1.0% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.8%.
Trump told Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) News in a virtual town hall meeting that tariffs would be ""the ultimate punishment"" for its perceived shortcomings in relaying information about the origin and spread of the virus. He also threatened to rip up last year's 'phase 1' trade deal if China failed to buy the promised volumes of U.S. goods - even though its demand for many imports, notably oil, has fallen because of the pandemic's effect on its own and the world economy.
Airline stocks were prominent losers in early trading after Warren Buffett said his Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) company had sold all its investments in the sector due to the pandemic's transformational effect on the outlook for it. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) stock was down 8.2% and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock was down 8.5%, while Southwest (NYSE:LUV) stock was down 6.4% and United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) stock was down 7.1%.
Buffett's comments also shaved another 4.4% off  Boeing Co  (NYSE:BA) stock, leaving it flirting with a one-month low.  Berkshire's own stock drifted 2.9% lower amid disappointment at Buffett's comment that he still wasn't enthusiastic about major purchases even at the valuations seen over the last few weeks. 
The prospect of a long and uneven recovery from the pandemic also weighed on Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) stock, which lost 3.6% after long-time bull Michael Nathanson of MoffattNathanson downgraded the stock to 'neutral'. Nathanson said the company's theme park business in particular is vulnerable to successive waves of infection in the absence of a proven cure. 
On a largely quiet day for economic data, the figure of most note was that U.S. factory goods orders dropped by 10.3%, marginally worse than the 9.7% expected but not enough to shock a market that has supped full of data horrors over the last month.
Elsewhere, Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) stock, which had threatened to 'go parabolic' before the pandemic struck, fell by 7.4% after the company controlling shareholders filed to sell their stake of just under 60% at a maximum price of $17.52. The company will receive no proceeds from the sale.
Elsewhere, U.S. crude oil futures hit their highest level since the debacle on the expiry day for the May futures contract, rising 2.8% to $20.34 a barrel by 4:10 PM.  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron  (NYSE:CVX), both of whom announced lower production guidance on Friday, both outperformed. Exxon stock rose 0.8%, while  Chevron  stock was flat.

The e-commerce giant has shut its six French warehouses, which employ about 10,000 people on permanent and interim contracts, since April 16 after court rulings ordered it to limit deliveries to a list of essential goods during the coronaries pandemic or face fines. 
Amazon extended the closure of all six sites until Tuesday and is slated to give an update on the current situation soon. 
The group has said the latest French court ruling, which restricts deliveries to IT products, health items, food and pet food could lead to penalties of up to 1 billion euros ($1.09 billion) per week, compelling it to shut down the sites.
Unions have brushed off Amazon's arguments, saying the company was playing hardball with them by taking an all-or-nothing approach that impedes the start of proper negotiations.
The legal standoff followed a complaint filed by hard line union SUD, which said Amazon did not do enough to protect employees from COVID-19 contagion. 
""We're in contact with the authorities to keep them informed of the situation at our sites (following the ruling),"" Amazon said in a statement. 
""In this context, we've also requested the use of the partial activity system, as other companies have been able to benefit from it,"" it said. A spokeswoman also confirmed the request was rejected.

1187,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>","Disney, hit hard by coronavirus, to face Wall Street questions on impact on company","By Lisa Richwine
LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt  Disney  Co's (N:DIS) acquisitions spree that included swallowing much of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) last year, and a reputation for operational excellence, turned the company into the world's most powerful entertainment machine. 
That girth has now made it the most vulnerable among media companies during the global coronavirus pandemic. On Tuesday, Wall Street will assess the level of damage and look for signs of a bottom. 
With sports leagues dormant, Disney's ESPN cable channel has resorted to showing reruns of old games and fringe programming like stone-skipping competitions. Profit centers such as its theme parks and cruises are either closed or docked. Its powerful content engine has slowed dramatically as productions are on hiatus and movie theaters stay dark.
""Disney has a bull's eye on its back like no other media company,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich said in an interview. ""They are impacted greatly.""
Ehrlich on April 6 cut 2020 revenue estimates for Disney by 15 percent to $70.9 billion.
Disney declined to comment.
The company's fiscal second-quarter financial report on Tuesday will offer the first assessment of the damage the coronavirus has wreaked on Disney's global business.
Overall, analysts expect Disney to report $17.8 billion in revenue from January through March, up 19% from 14.9 billion a year ago, and earnings per share of 89 cents, down 45% from $1.61 a year earlier. 
The earnings report will also be the first outing in front of Wall Street for Bob Chapek, the former parks chief who moved into the chief executive's job in February just as the pandemic spread around the world. Chapek took on the new role as Bob Iger stepped down to become executive chairman.
Executives will face analysts looking for answers on how they plan to navigate out of the unprecedented global crisis. 
NEW REALITY
Disney has adapted to the new reality in several ways. It provided audiences sheltered at home with early access to ""The Last Dance,"" an ESPN documentary series about basketball great Michael Jordan that became an instant hit. National Football League draft coverage also drew record ratings for ESPN and Disney's ABC broadcast network.
Among other shifts, Disney moved Pixar movie ""Onward"" to video on demand early, and put ""Frozen 2"" and ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" on the Disney+ streaming platform ahead of schedule.
Ehrlich and many other analysts are optimistic about the company's long-term future. She is one of 13 analysts who rate Disney shares a ""buy.""
""They have incredible brands, and it's extremely well managed,"" Ehrlich said. When the health crisis subsides and the economy bounces back, ""there will be pent-up demand for sports and experiences, theme parks, movies and TV shows,"" she said.
Among other analysts, five rate Disney a ""strong buy"" and 10 a ""hold,"" according to data from Refinitiv.
A bright spot is the Disney+ streaming platform that debuted in November. Disney said on April 8 that the offering had attracted more than 50 million paid subscribers in five months. The service will expand to more countries in 2020. 
But Disney is spending heavily to build its digital future. Analysts expect the streaming division, known as direct-to-consumer and international, to report a loss of $861 million. Disney has said the unit will turn a profit by fiscal 2024.

1188,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",J. Crew files for bankruptcy as preppy retailer succumbs to COVID-19 fallout,"By Mike Spector
(Reuters) - J. Crew Group Inc filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday with a plan to hand over control to lenders, adding to a list of brick-and-mortar retailers pushed to the brink by widespread store closures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The New York-based chain, known for preppy clothing at times worn by former first lady Michelle Obama, filed for bankruptcy in a Virginia federal court with an agreement to eliminate $1.65 billion of debt in exchange for ceding ownership to creditors.
J. Crew is the first high-profile retailer to seek bankruptcy protection since the coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting government officials to order businesses deemed nonessential to temporarily close.
It is likely not the last. Department store chains Neiman Marcus Group and J.C. Penney Co Inc (N:JCP) are contemplating bankruptcy filings amid the crisis, Reuters previously reported. 
Anchorage Capital Group, Blackstone Group Inc's (N:BX) GSO Capital Partners and Davidson Kempner Capital Management hold significant portions of J. Crew's senior debt and are in line to take control of the company.
They are also providing about $400 million of fresh financing to aid J. Crew's operations, while it navigates Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the company said in a statement.
In addition to cancelling debt, J. Crew plans to permanently close some stores, though the final number it plans to shutter has not yet been determined, a person familiar with the matter said.
The virus outbreak forced the company to temporarily close its nearly 500 J. Crew, J. Crew Factory and Madewell stores. In addition, the economic fallout and market turmoil stemming from the public health crisis resulted in the company shelving plans for an initial public offering of its Madewell business.
Madewell will remain part of J.Crew Group and Libby Wadle will continue in her role as chief executive officer of Madewell, the company added.
J. Crew had planned to use proceeds from the IPO to reduce its debt rather than use bankruptcy to address its strained finances, the person familiar with the matter said.
Before the pandemic, J. Crew was already struggling along with other traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to compete amid a consumer shift to online shopping.
It also suffered after a strategic misstep of raising prices that turned off some shoppers. Talks in 2014 to sell J. Crew to Japan's Fast Retailing Co (T:9983), the owner of the Uniqlo apparel chain, fell apart.
J. Crew was taken private in 2011 by TPG and Leonard Green & Partners in a roughly $3 billion leveraged buyout, and their investments are now expected to be wiped out, according to the person familiar with the matter.
The retailer had avoided bankruptcy in 2017 in a deal with creditors that reduced total debt and pushed out due dates on obligations.
But its struggles continued. Millard ""Mickey"" S. Drexler, a longtime leader of the chain known for his fashion acumen who also at one point helmed Gap Inc (N:GPS), conceded he misjudged how technological developments would alter the retail landscape.
He stepped aside as J. Crew's chief executive officer in 2017, and last year relinquished his seat as board chairman.

J. Crew listed both assets and liabilities in the range of $1 billion to $10 billion in the voluntary Chapter 11 document.

U.S. plant shutdowns and slowdowns in the past month are set to continue, resulting in higher operating costs and lower volume for the rest of fiscal 2020, Tyson said in a statement on second-quarter earnings, which missed estimates. While the pandemic has meant higher retail sales volume, that hasn’t been enough to offset food-service losses.
“Due to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 impacts to our operations, we are currently unable to provide segment adjusted operating margin guidance,” Chief Executive Officer Noel White said in a statement Monday.

ITV said in a statement on Monday that the novel coronavirus outbreak meant it would not be possible to make the seventh season of Love Island in a safe way this year.
Love Island's popularity has boosted ITV's advertising revenues in recent years.
Last summer the reality show set in a villa in Mallorca, Spain, was watched by 6 million fans every night on TVs, tablets and smart phones, helping the company beat financial forecasts through extra sponsorship deals.
But travel restrictions and concerns over social distancing mean that viewers will this year be denied their dose of watching good-looking twenty-somethings enjoying the sun while looking for romance and fame.
""We are very sorry for fans of the show but making it safely is our prime concern and Love Island will be back stronger than ever in 2021,"" ITV's director of television Kevin Lygo said.
ITV is due to publish a trading update on Wednesday. Its shares were down 5% in midday trading.

1191,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",U.S. arms makers and medical device firms team up to make ventilators,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.
The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.
The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including  Lockheed Martin  Corp (N:LMT) and General Dynamics Corp (N:GD), teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.
A handful of ventilator makers including  ResMed Inc  (N:RMD), and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp (T:3407) company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.
Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.
The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts. 
At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker,  Medtronic  (N:MDT), released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL) was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.
The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi government dollar bonds posted losses on Monday after the finance minister said Riyadh would have to take painful measures to deal with the impact of the coronavirus and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) downgraded the country's ratings outlook.
Moody's cut Saudi Arabia's outlook to negative from stable on Saturday, citing higher fiscal risks due to the crash in oil prices, and uncertainty about the government's ability to offset oil revenue losses and stabilize its debt in the medium term.
By 0736 GMT on Monday, Saudi Arabia's 35-year bonds due in 2055 had lost 1.4 cents to trade at 89.8 cents on the dollar, while its 40-year bonds due in 2060 shed 1.6 cents to trade at 98.2 cents on the dollar, Refinitiv data showed.
The country saw steep losses on its other bonds as well, while most other sovereign bonds in the Gulf region saw smaller losses in early trade and some even strengthened marginally.
Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said on Saturday the government ""must reduce budget expenditures sharply"" and that the impact of the new coronavirus on Saudi Arabia's state finances would be felt from the second quarter of the year.
Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ (NYSE:MUFG) Financial Group Inc (MUFG), in an analyst report on Monday, said that large fiscal deficits could put pressure on the country's credit rating and borrowing costs.
Oil price fiscal breakeven rates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/qmypmnkqwvr/eikon.png
MUFG said it expected Saudi Arabia's real GDP to contract 3.2% this year, its worst performance since 1999. It also forecast public debt would rise to 31.6% of GDP - the highest since 2005 - and foreign reserves would fall by up to $47 billion.
Saudi Arabia's large capital buffers will allow it to weather low oil prices over the medium term, the bank said in its note, also commending the kingdom's forward guidance to markets regarding its policy responses to the economic shock.
Saudi Arabia has imposed strict measures to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, including halting flights and imposing curfews.
As of Sunday, the kingdom had reported 27,011 cases of the new coronavirus and 184 deaths, both the highest among the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
Saudi deficit projections at different oil prices: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/GULF-ECONOMY-OIL/0H001R8GWCD3/eikon.png
MUFG said that the Saudi riyal's peg to the U.S. dollar remained ""bullet-proof"" despite market fears over its long-term stability.
""While we expect the peg to be maintained, large fiscal deficits is likely to put pressure on the sovereign's credit ratings and cost of funds, which could build vulnerabilities over the medium term,"" the bank said.
An S&P Capital IQ model based on CDS prices currently shows markets pricing Saudi Arabia as BBB-, just one notch above 'junk', or sub-investment grade as it is formally known.
Saudi Arabia is rated A by Fitch, A2 by Moody's and A- by S&P.

Saudi Arabia increased its debt ceiling to 50% of GDP from a previous 30% in March and has already raised $12 billion in international bonds this year.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open lower Monday as the war of words between the U.S. and China over the coronavirus escalated, threatening the resumption of last year's trade dispute.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.9%, lower, Nasdaq 100 Futures down 75 points, or 0.9%. The Dow Futures contract fell 276 points, or 1.2%.
The latest outburst came from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday, who said there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the virus emerged from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Late last week President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on Beijing, who he blames for the spread of the virus.
The two economic superpowers signed phase one of a trade deal only in January, seemingly bringing to an end a costly trade war which had curtailed economic growth globally.
The corporate earnings season continues this week, although Monday is relatively quiet. 
Instead, the airline sector will be in focus after billionaire investor Warren Buffett said over the weekend that his company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) had sold all of its shares in the four largest U.S. airlines.
Speaking at the annual shareholders' meeting, Buffett said ""the world has changed"" because of the coronavirus.
Berkshire Hathaway had an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL), 10% of American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), 10% of Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), and 9% of United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), according to its annual report and company filings.
There was some positive news Monday, as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) analysts raised their rating on U.S. stocks to ""neutral"", saying they expected equity markets globally to consolidate from current levels, while not ruling out more weakness.
Turning to economic data, the latest U.S. factory orders data are expected to show a fall of 9.7% in March at 10 AM ET (1400 GMT). 
However, the main focus will be on the nonfarm employment report for April on Friday, with economists forecasting an astonishing loss of 21 million jobs for the month.
Oil futures retreated Monday, with the potential of a trade war and a freshhit to global demand weighing.
At 6:55 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 5% lower at $18.79 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract fell 2.5% to $25.77.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,714.80/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0934, down 0.5%.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Nissan to retrench further in new plan to focus on U.S., Japan, China","By Norihiko Shirouzu
(Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201) will pull back from Europe and elsewhere to focus on the United States, China and Japan under a plan that represents a new strategic direction for the embattled carmaker, people with direct knowledge of the plan told Reuters.
The ""operational performance plan"" is due to be announced on May 28 and goes beyond fixing problems from ousted leader Carlos Ghosn's aggressive expansion drive, the people said.
Pursuit of market share, particularly in the United States, led to steep discounting and a cheapened brand. Under the new, three-year plan - reported here for the first time - Nissan aims to restore dealer ties and refresh lineups to regain pricing power and profitability, the people told Reuters.
""This is not just a cost-cutting plan. We're rationalising operations, reprioritising and refocusing our business to plant seeds for the future,"" one of the people said.
The plan also aims to cut competition and expand cooperation with alliance partners, the people said. Nissan will follow Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:7211) in plug-in electric hybrid vehicle technology, with the smaller peer taking the lead in Asian markets outside China and Japan. France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) will likely focus on electrical vehicle technologies and Europe.
Nissan and Mitsubishi declined to comment. Renault did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The plan, led mainly by Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta rather than Nissan's low-key chief executive, Makoto Uchida, is aimed at freeing resources to invest in products and technology for the United States, China and Japan, the people said.
""The net effect is even though we reduce our R&D spend this year versus last year and make other savings, we pump those freed-up resources back into core markets and core products,"" said one of the people, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media on the matter.
The plan is likely to take up to two weeks to be finalised, with sales and earnings targets complicated by the anticipated long-term impact on auto sales of government measures worldwide taken to stop the coronavirus outbreak, the people said.
In July, Nissan targeted an operating margin of 6% on revenue of 14.5 trillion yen ($135.83 billion) by March 2023, versus 3% and 13 trillion yen forecast at the time for the year ended March 2020 - the results of which are scheduled for release later this month. Management has since changed, with Uchida and Gupata appointed in December.
To be sure, focusing on its three core markets does not mean a total retreat from elsewhere for Japan's second-largest automaker by volume after Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203).
Nissan will try to maintain a presence in Europe through stepped up efforts with its Qashqai and Juke crossover sport-utility vehicles (SUVs). In Asia, it plans to further expand sales in Thailand and the Philippines which, with Australia, generate roughly 90% of sales and profit in the region excluding China, Japan and India.
Still, its new plan calls for tighter, targeted lineups in countries such as India, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, Russia, Brazil and Mexico - such as focusing on the beefy Patrol SUV in Africa and the Middle East. That means Nissan might need to shutter more than the 14 assembly lines announced in July. In March, it also announced plans to stop production in Indonesia.
Nissan previously put its annual global production capacity at over 7 million vehicles based on three daily shifts per plant. The new plan is based on two shifts which, with the 14 closures, puts capacity at about 5.5 million, the people said.
Under the plan, the Yokohama-based automaker aims to remain in the U.S. market where it is tasked with eliminating the perception of being a bargain-basement brand. Though its North America sales have grown, its operating margin has narrowed.
""For several years, everything was based on volume growth, then we shifted our emphasis to quality of sales, and we did it overnight,"" said one of the people. ""We did it too fast, and that choked our business.""
Nissan's U.S. models have an average age of over 5 years. To lower that to 3.5 years, the automaker plans to launch new and significantly redesigned cars, including a next-generation Rogue crossover SUV, the people said. It will also reduce sales to rental and other fleet operators, they said.
Nissan has been slow to launch models in Japan too. Under the new plan, the automaker will introduce six new or redesigned models over the next three years to bring the average lineup age to under 2.5 years from an undisclosed figure, the people said. Domestically, the average age of lineups from competitive auto brands is generally two to three years.

In China, Nissan's new plan involves designing vehicles more specifically for consumers in the world's largest auto market, instead of offering cars designed for U.S. consumers. Its China-only Venucia brand will need to be re-positioned to better respond to competition from a multitude of indigenous brands, the people said.

1199,By Investing.com,"<span>May 04, 2020 05:32AM ET</span>","StockBeat: Trump, German Court Cast a Long Shadow Over Stretched Markets","By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- What could be worse for the stock market’s spirits than the resumption of a trade war and the crippling of Europe’s crisis response? While neither is real yet, the coming week will show how present the risk is.
On Sunday, President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo both launched attacks against China for its perceived role in unleashing the pandemic, Trump in particular highlighting the possibility and desirability of punishing it, not least through the imposition of new tariffs.
By 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), the benchmark Stoxx 600 was down 3.6% at 327.86, its lowest in over a week, making April’s rebound look more than ever like a bear-market rally. The German Dax, Europe’s best performer in April, was down 3.7%, while the FTSE 100 was the outperformer, falling only 0.5% thanks to some strong performances by virus-beating stocks such as Rentokil (LON:RTO) (office cleaning) and  Reckitt Benckiser  (LON:RB) (disinfectants) and to the stabilization of index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) and BP (NYSE:BP) after last week’s bloodbath.
There is evidence to suggest that the coordinated media blitz is an exercise in diverting attention rather than an earnest threat: the Trump administration has temporarily waived tariffs on a large range of Chinese imports since the crisis began, afraid of burdening U.S. consumers with higher prices as tens of millions lose their jobs or suffer cuts to their income.
“If President Trump’s attempts to get re-elected continue to rely on attacking China, investors will worry about whether this will bring additional costs to specific U.S. firms,” UBS Wealth Management chief economist Paul Donovan said in a morning note.
Pompeo, meanwhile, told ABC at the weekend that there was “significant evidence” that the Covid-19 virus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, without actually presenting any of that evidence – an approach that worked for his predecessor Colin Powell in rallying public opinion before the invasion of Iraq 17 years ago, but which may be difficult to repeat, given how that turned out.
While U.S.-China tensions have kept their ability to terrorize global markets, the more immediate threat to European markets is a more local one. On Tuesday, Germany’s Constitutional Court is set to give its final ruling on the legality of the European Central Bank’s asset purchase programs.
A couple of months ago, this looked likely to be waved through with little more than the usual grumbling from a court which has already backed away twice from challenging the ECB head-on.
However, the ECB last month cast aside all the restraints on its bond-buying that it had previously adopted to placate its German critics. That raises the risk of the judges handing down a ruling that could stop the German central bank from participating in QE, damaging the credibility of a policy that is the centerpiece of the euro zone’s crisis response.
This being the euro zone, the likeliest outcome is still a fudge that puts off answering the hard question – how willing are Germany and the rest of northern Europe to accept liability for their brethren in the weaker periphery of the euro zone.
Even so, it’s more than enough to keep markets on the defensive after a month-long rally that has found little justification so far in companies’ quarterly reports: data from Refinitive suggest that first-quarter earnings will be down 25% on the year for Stoxx 600 companies. The second quarter, of course, is likely to be much worse."
1200,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 05:10AM ET</span>",Norwegian Air shareholders back $1 billion rescue plan,"By Terje Solsvik
OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) shareholders backed its financial survival plan on Monday, with more than 95% of votes cast supporting the conversion of nearly $1 billion of debt into equity and raising more cash from its owners.
Approval of the scheme is a vital part of the struggling airline's plan to tap government credit guarantees as it seeks to overcome the coronavirus crisis, which has compounded its already deep financial problems.
Airlines around the world have been hit hard by the impact on travel of the pandemic, with many forced to turn to governments for state aid to avoid bankruptcy.
The airline, which at the end of last year had amassed debts of around $8 billion, said ahead of the meeting that it had won ""strong support"" from aircraft lessors for its plan.
With 95% of its fleet grounded due to the coronavirus pandemic, Norwegian Air has said it could run out of cash by mid-May unless shareholders supported the plan.
On Sunday it said bondholders had signed up to the plan, which was narrowly rejected in a vote on Thursday.
Norwegian Air said lessors are now willing to convert at least $730 million of debt into equity, up from $550 million earlier, and talks are ongoing for possible further conversion.
""With the significant contributions from lessors and bondholders, the company expects to convert more than 10 billion crowns ($958 million) in debt to equity,"" it said.
Based on the results from the shareholders' meeting, the company will now proceed with the conversion of bonds and lease debt to shares, as well as the public offering of up to 400 million ($38.4 million) from the sale of new stock, it said.
The debt conversion and share sale will allow Norwegian Air to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion crowns, which hinge on a reduction in leverage, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
The plan will hand majority ownership to the airline's creditors and could leave current shareholders with just 5.2%.
The loan could keep Norwegian Air going until the end of 2020, although further cash may be needed as it eyes a gradual ramp-up next year and normalisation in 2022, albeit with a reduced fleet.
Norwegian Air is only paying invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, such as salaries for staff still employed and critical IT infrastructure. It has put payments for ground handling, debt and leases on hold.

The Oslo Bourse said it had halted trade in Norwegian Air's shares until the outcome of the vote is presented.

The news came ahead of a conference call that Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold with representatives of the German auto industry on Tuesday to discuss the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on production and sales.
Ifo said its survey of 75 auto firms showed a current business index for the sector fell to -85.4 points in April from -13.2 in March. The April reading fell below a reading of -82.9 points registered in April 2009, during the financial crisis.
""We have never seen such bad figures for this key sector,"" said Klaus Wohlrabe, head of forecasting at Ifo.
Sub indices on orders, and production expectations and export prospects all fell, with capacity utilisation down to 45%.
Ahead of Tuesday's meeting with Merkel, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) have urged the government to help boost demand for cars.
The pandemic hammered first-quarter profits and forced both carmakers to drop their outlooks for the year.
Car sales across the world have slumped as measures to contain the pandemic forced production lines to shut and showrooms to close, starving manufacturers of much needed cash for investments.

Volkswagen restarted production at its Wolfsburg factory in Germany last week, the latest of a fleet of European carmakers to take advantage of eased coronavirus lockdown rules to resume manufacturing.

LONDON (Reuters) - European stock markets and oil prices fell on Monday as a spat between top U.S. officials and China over the origin of the coronavirus fuelled fears of a new trade war, derailing a rebound in global markets.
European shares opened down 2.5% with U.S. stock futures trading close to 1% in the red. 
Earlier, MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 2.5%, pulled down by Hong Kong where the Hang Seng returned from a two-session holiday with its biggest drop in six weeks.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the virus emerged from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Pompeo did not provide evidence or dispute an earlier U.S. intelligence conclusion that the virus was not man-made.
An editorial in China's Global Times said he was ""bluffing"" and called on the United States to present its evidence.
""Concern on the potential for another flare up between the US and China is dominating price action"", commented RBC strategist Adam Cole in a morning note.
Simon Black, head of investment management at wealth management firm Dolfin said investors were also adjusting their forecasts over the depth of the economic damage inflicted by the pandemic. 
""It's also the economic reality sinking in"", he said, adding that the rebound of over 20% from lows hit in March by global equities was likely not sustainable.

Companies listed on the pan-European STOXX 600 are currently expected to report a 40% decline in earnings in the second quarter.
Manufacturing activity in the euro zone collapsed last month as government-imposed lockdowns to stop the spread of the new coronavirus forced factories to close and consumers to stay indoors, a survey showed on Monday.
""We've just come off a rally of hopes, not a rally on fundamentals"", Black said, pointing to the massive monetary and fiscal stimulus pledged by governments and central banks around the world.
Recent economic data paints a dire picture of the global economy after weeks of lockdowns.
In the United States, manufacturing plunged to an 11-year low last month, consumer spending collapsed, and some 30.3 million Americans have filed claims for unemployment.
Oil prices fell again, paring last week's gains, on worries a global oil glut may persist even as coronavirus pandemic lockdowns start to ease.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell to $18.66 a barrel while Brent crude futures were down 1.7% at $26, after touching a low of $25.50. Brent rose about 23% last week following three consecutive weeks of losses.
In currency markets, the dollar rose 0.1% to 99.38 against a basket of currencies while the euro was down 0.48% at $1.0930.
The safe-haven yen fell 0.2% to 106.72 per dollar.

Global coronavirus cases have surpassed 3.5 million and deaths have neared a quarter of a million, according to a Reuters tally.

1203,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",Telefonica shares rise on O2-Virgin Media merger talks,"By Inti Landauro and Isla Binnie
(Reuters) - Shares in Spain's  Telefonica  SA (MC:TEF) rose on Monday to post the only strong gains on an otherwise almost entirely red Madrid index, after the company confirmed it was in talks with billionaire John Malone's Liberty Global Plc (O:LBTYA) over a possible merger of their respective businesses in Britain.
The two have started a negotiation process to merge Telefonica's British mobile operator O2 and Liberty's Virgin Media network company, the Spanish company said in a stock market filing.
There is ""no guarantee, at this point, of its precise terms or its probability of success,"" Telefonica added.
Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that talks were ongoing.
Telefonica shares rose shortly after Monday's market open and were trading 3.2% higher on the day at 0809 GMT. It was the only strong gainer, barring some small positive movements for stocks including communications tower firm Cellnex (MC:CLNX).
It would be ""potentially positive news for the stock if this is confirmed"" Madrid-based broker CM Capital Markets said in a note to clients, adding the integration of mobile-focused O2 with a major fixed broadband provider would be complementary.
Telefonica said it would keep markets informed if a ""satisfactory agreement"" were reached. The company reports first-quarter results on May 7.
Along with its large European peers, Telefonica has struggled to boost profit growth in the face of fierce competition and reassure investors it can manage a debt pile which stood at 37.74 billion euros at the end of last year. 
Shares are down 30% so far this year, having tracked broadly downwards for the past five years. 
Its UK business, which includes O2, generated 7.11 billion euros in revenue in 2019, around 14.7% of the group's total, and had 34.5 mobile connections on its network.
Virgin Media competes with UK pay-TV market leader Sky, owned by Comcast (O:CMCSA), in pay-TV, and with BT (L:BT), Sky, TalkTalk and others in broadband. 
It had 6 million cable customers and 3.3 million mobile customers as of the end of 2019.
Telefonica has been weighing options for the mobile business since 2016 when a previous 10.3 billion pound ($12.8 billion) O2 takeover bid from Three UK, controlled by CK Hutchison Holdings (HK:0001), was blocked by European antitrust regulators.
Combining O2 and Virgin Media would reshape Britain's telecoms industry, leaving Hutchison and  Vodafone  (L:VOD) without their own fixed-line consumer networks and raising pressure on BT.
Uncertainty around the fate of one Britain's biggest mobile operators, which has been repeatedly touted as a possible candidate for sale or a stock listing, would end.

The deal would also allow Telefonica a way to partially cash out from O2 while keeping a presence in Britain, where - along with Spain, Germany and Brazil - it aims to focus its efforts to boost revenue by 2 billion euros under a new strategic plan.

The S&P 500 rose 31% from its lows reached March 23, when concerns about the impact of coronavirus on public health, economies and financial markets peaked, through April 29. But after closing around 2,940 on Wednesday, the gauge fell 3.7% over the next two sessions., prompting technical strategists at JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. to say the index has likely formed a medium-term ceiling.
“The S&P 500 Index staged a bearish reversal week after moving deeper into the large confluence of resistance levels surrounding 2,900,” an area that likely caps the equity range through the second quarter, strategists Jason Hunter and Alix Tepper Floman wrote in a note Friday. “While the two-day pullback from that key resistance area is only tentative at this point, it at least marks a continuation of the trend deceleration pattern that started in mid-April.”
The longer-term fate of the equity market will likely be determined by factors such as the trajectory of the pandemic, regional policy implementation and preparedness for the potential of another wave in the fall/winter, and risk for subsequent regional shutdowns during that period, Hunter and Floman said. It’s still possible that the current pattern could switch to a more sustained bull trend in the second half of the year, they said.
Rick Bensignor of Bensignor Investment Strategies, who doesn’t see U.S. stocks falling below their March 23 lows nor rallying to new records for the rest of the year, said the market will be range-bound going forward.
“Just as the market rallies enough to hook in new long money, it will probably be closer to a trading top,” he wrote in a note Monday. “And, when things again look quite dire, it will likely be nearer the trading low.”

The move comes at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has put a series of deals at risk, as valuations have been severely impacted in a blow to funding prospects.
The tourism industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic, as governments globally restrict travel, leading to sharp declines in bookings. 
A consortium led by Mirae agreed last year to buy the hotels in U.S. cities, including in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, from Anbang, which had been selling some of its overseas assets after the Chinese government took control of the troubled insurer in 2018. 
But the asset manager said in a statement that Anbang did not remedy breaches of certain obligations regarding the September contract, resulting in the termination of the deal.
""Among other things, AnBang had failed to timely disclose and discharge various material encumbrances and liabilities impairing the Hotels and failed to continue the operation of the Hotels in accordance with contractual requirements,"" Mirae Asset said. 
Mirae Asset has also invoked its rights for the return of its deposit relating to the failed transaction.  
Anbang did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. 
A person close to Dajia, a new company formed to take over assets from Anbang, told Reuters that the contract termination itself is a violation of the deal and that Anbang did not breach any contract obligations. 
Dajia Insurance Group had last week asked a U.S. court to bar Mirae from terminating the contract. 
In its statement, Mirae Asset said that Anbang had filed litigation against it and affiliated entities in the United States last week, but did not give any further details. 

""Mirae Asset will protect its rights vigorously in accordance with the terms of the agreement,"" it said.

The move will allow London-headquartered HSBC, which gets the bulk of its revenue from Asia, to further expand its footprint in the world's second-largest economy, where it has deployed billions of dollars as part its Asia ""pivot"" strategy.
Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
The transaction to buy the stake in HSBC Life Insurance Co Ltd (HSBC Life China) from joint venture partner the National Trust Ltd will be structured as a transfer of equity interest and is subject to regulatory approvals, the lender said.
China is the world's third-largest insurance market after the United States and Japan - worth about $318 billion in premiums according to a Swiss Re (OTC:SSREY) Institute report.
A lack of majority control, with foreign ownership capped at 50% until last year, has long frustrated global insurers looking to expand market share in China, where individual wealth is rising and comparatively few people have life insurance cover.
Global insurers including Britain's  Prudential  (L:PRU) and Canada's  Sun Life Financial  (TO:SLF) have been in China for decades, but their collective market share remains below 10% as a result of ownership curbs and limited geographical presence.
But Beijing has been gradually easing access to its financial sector for foreigners. As part of that push, it allowed overseas companies to take full control of their local life insurance ventures from Jan. 1 this year.
""Despite the current difficult environment engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to take steps to implement our growth strategy,"" HSBC Chief Executive Officer Noel Quinn said in a statement.

Shanghai-headquartered HSBC Life China was formed in 2009 as a 50:50 joint venture between HSBC and the National Trust. It had a registered capital of 1.03 billion yuan ($145.89 million) at end-December, and has network in nine Chinese cities.

Investing.com - European stock markets slumped Monday, as investors returned from Friday’s May Day holiday to fresh tensions between the United States and China over the coronavirus crisis. 
At 3:55 AM ET (0735 GMT), the DAX in Germany traded 2.9% lower, France's CAC 40 down 3.5%, while the U.K.'s FTSE index traded flat, outperforming after having sold off during Friday’s session. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the new coronavirus emerged from a Chinese laboratory, without making available any details. This followed Friday’s warning from President Donald Trump of retaliatory measures, including new trade tariffs, against China over the pandemic.
Worries that this spat may turn into another trade war, just a few months after the first round of the trade deal between the two powers was signed ending the last damaging conflict, are hitting risk appetite.
More bad news came from the latest estimate of Spanish factory activity, with the country’s manufacturing PMI falling to 30.8 in April from 45.7 in March, the biggest drop in one month since the records started in February 1998.
In corporate news, Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) stock slumped 15% amid concerns over the deal to sell its elevators unit following a Financial Times report that Cinven and Advent are seeking other investors for the 17.2 billion euro deal, which was the biggest European buyout deal in a decade.
On the flip side, Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) climbed 2.3% after confirming Monday it has opened talks to merge its British mobile operator O2 with billionaire John Malone's Liberty Global’s Virgin Media network company.

1213,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 04, 2020 02:36AM ET</span>",U.K. Corporate Titans Get Extra Time at the Top in Virus Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- Some of London’s most influential investors are giving U.K. companies extra time to find new board members because of the coronavirus crisis, potentially offering a group of long-standing chairmen an unexpected extension to their careers.
Legal & General Investment Management will allow London-listed companies an additional 12 months to replace directors coming to the end of their recommended tenures, it said in response to Bloomberg queries.
That could affect companies ranging from wireless giant  Vodafone  Group (LON:VOD) Plc to $5 billion packaging producer DS Smith Plc, whose chairmen are close to the maximum nine-year length of service laid out in the U.K.’s guidebook for strong governance.
“As a long-term investor, LGIM will be flexible in its policies,” said Angeli Benham, an environmental, social and governance manager at the investment firm, which oversees about 1.1 trillion pounds ($1.4 trillion) globally. “We acknowledge that the current environment may hamper the nominations committee’s ability to appoint the best candidates.”
There are 15 companies in the FTSE 350 Index with combined market value of about $130 billion where the chairman is due for a change after being in position for eight to 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
LGIM’s views hold sway, as it’s the biggest U.K. fund manager and a dominant voice on corporate governance. The firm holds average stakes of about 2.5% in the country’s biggest companies.
Extra Time
It joins Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI) Inc., which has also modified its voting policies for the 2020 season of shareholder meetings in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Companies facing unprecedented challenges require strong and stable leadership,” Hans-Christoph Hirt, the asset manager’s head of equity ownership services, wrote in an April 15 letter to listed company executives. “We will therefore be more flexible around the re-election of key directors to avoid unplanned disruption to board composition at this critical time.”
RELX Plc, the $43 billion publisher that owns the LexisNexis database, said last month that it will take longer than expected to find a new chairman. The company first announced in February that Anthony Habgood, 73, had decided to retire from the board after more than a decade at the helm.
“I don’t think there’s a huge demand to move on with this process right now,” Paul Abrahams, a spokesman for RELX, said by phone. “Anthony’s track record of value creation has been exceptional.”
Seeking Continuity
Aircraft parts supplier  Meggitt  (LON:MGGT) Plc is also postponing a change, telling investors in March that chairman Nigel Rudd will stay until further notice to provide continuity during the Covid-19 outbreak. Rudd, who was appointed in 2015, had announced the previous month that he plans to step down after a successor is found.
Other companies are in the process of hunting for candidates. Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) said in May last year it’s seeking a successor for Gerard Kleisterlee, who will hit nine years as chairman this July. DS Smith also announced last year it would seek a replacement for chairman Gareth Davis, whose term ends in January 2021. Intertek Group (LON:ITRK) Plc, the $9 billion certification firm, is also due to find a new chairman as incumbent David Reid has been in place for more than eight years.
A spokesperson for Vodafone said a search is ongoing, while representatives for DS Smith and Intertek declined to comment.
Establishing Rapport
The Financial Reporting Council, the industry body that sets the U.K. Corporate Governance Code, requires companies that don’t comply with its director tenure limits to explain their reasons to investors. The code, which has been around in various forms since 1992, exists to help ensure chairmen and non-executive directors effectively carry out independent scrutiny of a company’s management.
A representative for the FRC said there has been no change to its guidelines since the coronavirus outbreak.
Some companies keep board members longer than recommended even during normal times. Pub owner Mitchells & Butlers Plc said in December that chairman Bob Ivell will stay past the usual limit, as it believes his industry knowledge is “invaluable” and his tenure hasn’t impacted his independence. Tim Martin, chairman of rival bar operator J D Wetherspoon Plc, has been in his role for more than 37 years.
Search processes for new chairmen continue, though companies are holding off from actually making appointments, according to Will Dawkins, who leads the U.K. board practice at recruitment firm Spencer Stuart.
“It’s very hard to establish that relationship with the CEO without actually meeting,” Dawkins said. “It’s common sense for chairs to stay on for a little more time at the moment, so long as there are no other difficulties within the company.”

The Exchange Fund, managed in its current form by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority since 1998, lost HK$111.5 billion on its portfolio of domestic and foreign stocks, while bonds gained HK$54.4 billion in the quarter, according to a presentation by HKMA Deputy Chief Executive Howard Lee to lawmakers Monday.
The HK$4 trillion fund acts as a backstop to ensure the stability of Hong Kong’s currency and as a stabilizer in times of crisis. It joins other funds around the world in posting losses at the start of the year as markets tumbled due to the coronavirus outbreak. The MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) global stock index slumped 22% in the first three months of the year.
The fund clawed back some losses in April, seeing gains of about HK$30 billion to HK$40 billion, according to Lee.
Chief Executive Eddie Yue said in the same briefing that the HKMA has been gradually lowering the fund’s assets in currencies other than the Hong Kong and U.S. dollars.
It also invests in private equity and real estate. It returned an overall 6.6% last year.

The bank created the “Volfefe Index,” a reference to the president’s mysterious covfefe tweet of 2017, to track the correlation between Treasury yields and Trump’s tweets. The sensitivity has since increased, with one measurement jumping by more than 60% since JPMorgan introduced the index in September, according to its analysts.
Volatility in the Treasury market linked to Trump’s tweets has surpassed that linked to traditional sources of monetary and economic policy announcements, as measured by the Baker, Bloom & Davis Policy Uncertainty Index, JPMorgan said.
“This intuitively fits the mood of the political moment, where policy decisions are frequently communicated via that channel with limited preliminary coverage or analysis in public media,” wrote interest-rate strategists led by Josh Younger.
At the same time, algorithmic and high-frequency traders also appear to have fine-tuned their strategies to take the tweeting into account. Market depth attributed to these traders tends to fall in the minutes after Trump’s tweets, the analysts said, suggesting that automated investors may be treating the postings similarly to major releases of economic news such as non-farm payrolls.
The sensitivity of the U.S. interest-rate market to the president’s tweeting appears to have deepened even as their composition has, up until last week, veered away from the trade-related threats that preoccupied investors for much of last year. Prices on Treasuries rose on Friday after the U.S. president threatened trade tariffs on China.
“The impact of Presidential tweets cuts both ways,” the strategists wrote. “Whereas this channel was a material driver of volatility for much of 2019, more recent shifts in content have significantly dampened their impact. That said, it is arguably more important to focus on market sensitivity to, rather than the level of this driver. In that sense if anything volatility is more exposed to shifts in sentiment driven by this channel, were their focus to shift.”

GM Korea is responsible for supplying some of GM's small SUVs to the U.S. market to meet a consumer shift away from sedans. Like peers industry-wide, however, it is grappling with shrinking exports as demand suffers from governments globally restricting movement to slow the spread of the virus.
GM Korea will run its BP1 plant in Incheon, near Seoul, for seven business days this month and idle it for the remaining 11, showed its internal production plan seen by Reuters.
A spokeswoman said the automaker has suspended the line until May 5 due to the virus impact on parts procurement and U.S. sales, and that its production plan for the rest of May is subject to change.
GM Korea started producing the Trailblazer in January and shipping it to the United States in February, but is yet to begin U.S. sales, she said. The model is currently sold only in South Korea.
On parts, the government's virus response in the Philippines since mid-March has disrupted supplies of wiring harnesses, company officials said.
South Korea recorded some of the earliest infections after the virus spread from China, where it was first reported at the end of last year. The export-reliant economy has since managed to control the outbreak and allowed manufacturers to resume production - only to be met with slumping overseas demand.
Total exports shrank 24.3% in April versus the same month a year earlier, trade ministry data showed on Friday - the quickest contraction since May 2009. Shipments of vehicles fell 36% and vehicle components dropped 50%.

 Hyundai Motor  Co (KS:005380), South Korea's biggest automaker by sales, has idled most of its five factories in Ulsan in the southeast from April 30 to May 5 - including a weekend and public holiday, when it would normally operate at times of strong demand - and extended the suspension of a line producing its Elantra sedan to Friday from May 1.

Investing.com – Asian stocks suffered losses on Monday morning as tensions escalated between the United States and China, prompting investor fears of a further obstacle to the global economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.
U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said overnight that there was “enormous evidence” showing that the COVID-19 outbreak began in a Wuhan laboratory, but he did not elaborate on what the evidence was.
Pompeo’s comment came after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded answers from China about the virus’s origin, even hinting at possible retaliation last Thursday. Trump added overnight that he believed that a Chinese “mistake” was the cause of the COVID-19 outbreak, though he also did not present any evidence for the claim. 
Beijing has denied the accusations.
The U.S.-China tensions dampened investors’ moods even as some countries loosened their lockdowns, raising hopes for a start to the global economic recovery.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dived 3.77% by 10:47 PM ET (3:47 AM GMT) as the U.S. -China tensions flared.
Down Under, the ASX 200 was the sole bright spot. It rose 0.51% as the Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to maintain its three-year yield target at 0.25% and the cash rate at the same level at its meeting on Tuesday.
South Korea’s KOSPI is down by 1.91%.
Meanwhile, investors’ moods were further dampened over fears of a second wave of COVID-19 cases even as some countries loosen lockdown measures implemented to curb the spread of COVID-19.
“Even as growth-stifling containment measures are set to be phased out in May, the global downturn looks to deepen in Q2. If prospects of hard-to-reverse job losses overwhelm, alongside Trump’s anti-China threats, ‘Mayday’ type of fear dynamics may rule the day.” Mizuho Bank economists said in a note. "
1220,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 03, 2020 10:27PM ET</span>",China Trade Deal Turns From Trump Re-Election Asset to Albatross,"(Bloomberg) -- The trade agreement President Donald Trump signed with China less than four months ago has gone from a cornerstone of his re-election bid to a potential political liability as the pandemic sours the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies.
The phase-one pact, which took effect in mid-February, is falling short on a number of fronts, including Beijing’s promises of large agriculture and energy purchases. But the Trump administration so far has been hesitant to ramp up the pressure or back away from the deal altogether, even as the rhetoric on both sides heats up.
As the U.S. economy craters, the death toll from Covid-19 passes 67,000 and some 30 million Americans join the ranks of the unemployed, Trump now finds himself boxed in. Respond too forcefully amid a growing public outcry to punish China -- with his favorite economic weapon of tariffs or other means -- and he risks hurting consumers and businesses already facing the deepest recession since the 1930s.
“The trade war was launched in good economic times, when additional tariffs could be absorbed,” said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Reimposing or expanding tariffs right now, in the midst of a global pandemic and U.S. unemployment at over 20%, would be far harder to justify economically or defend politically.”

Biden Ad
Campaign advisers to former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, are trying to exploit what they see as a glaring weakness in Trump’s approach.
“China at the moment has all the leverage,” said Jake Sullivan, former Biden national security aide who advises his campaign.
In a recent TV ad, the Biden campaign said “Trump rolled over for the Chinese” because “he took their word for it” when President Xi Jinping told him earlier this year that the virus was contained. Biden advisers argue that the economic and health catastrophe could have been averted or contained if the president had been tougher on China earlier this year instead of praising the trade deal.
“The timing of the deal could not have been worse from a public health perspective because it was precisely during this period in January and February when what we most needed was a demand for transparency, a demand of cooperation, a demand for answers from the Chinese,” said Ned Price, a former National Security Council official in the Obama administration.
Trump’s Approach
Trump said Sunday night, in a televised town hall from the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, that he was tougher on China than past administrations and achieved an “incredible” trade deal.
“China ripped off our country and I’ve told this to President Xi directly, in a nice manner and in a not-so-nice manner,” Trump said in the interview on Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) News. “President Obama and Joe Biden didn’t do anything. China just had a field day with our country.”
The political pressure to do something, however, is mounting within his own party. While Trump denied reports last week that his administration is planning to cancel part of the U.S.’s debt obligations to China, he said he had many other ways to punish the country.
On Sunday, he called tariffs the “greatest negotiating tool” but didn’t directly answer a question on whether he’d use it now against China for the country’s failure to limit the spread of the virus.
Over the past two years, Trump imposed duties on roughly $360 billion in Chinese goods, and China retaliated by hitting more than half of America’s exports. The agreement signed Jan. 15 served as a cease fire in the trade war, and it was supposed to usher in a new era of commercial partnership.
“A cooperative economic and trade relationship is the propeller of the overall China-U.S. relations,” Vice Premier (NASDAQ:PINC) Liu He said at the White House signing ceremony.
Take Action
But the warmth is fading rapidly as the countries feud over who’s to blame for a U.S. public-health crisis and an economy in a steep decline. With the Republican caucus calling for China to pay a price, Trump could be convinced to take action before the election.
“Trump will be both emboldened and compelled to take strong action against the Chinese as he realizes American voters, and in particular his political base, want accountability,” said Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign.
Whichever route the president takes, continuing to praise what he lauded as “the biggest deal anybody has ever seen” could backfire.
Two-thirds of Americans have a negative opinion of the country where the virus originated, a recent poll from the Pew Research Center found. That’s the most since Pew began asking the question in 2003. Seventy-two percent of Republicans say they see China unfavorably compared with 62% of Democrats.
Trump’s messaging on China’s handling of the virus, which first emerged in the city of Wuhan in December, has recently become more aggressive though he’s been careful to distinguish his displeasure with the country from harsh comments about President Xi.
Critics of the deal said its terms, especially the promises on purchases, were unrealistic from the get-go. That’s only been exacerbated by the slump in demand caused by the virus outbreak.
China committed to spend $52.4 billion buying U.S. energy over two years. The American Exploration and Production Council said last month that China had purchased “a de minimis amount of U.S. crude in the first months of 2020, while it has increased purchases of crude oil from Saudi Arabia and Russia.”
Bloomberg Economics: Remember the Trade Deal? China’s Not Buying
A senior USTR official, on a call with reporters last week, acknowledged that there have been hiccups related to purchases and that the Trump administration has been talking to China to make sure the country stays on track with its commitments. A required action plan on changes to China’s intellectual-property rights regime was published later than expected, and some U.S. officials view it as falling short on specifics.
Battleground States
The Trump campaign has long said Biden has a track record of being too soft on China. A recent TV ad by Trump’s Super PAC America First Action labeled him “Beijing Biden.”
The big question this fall is whose anti-China message resonates more with voters, especially in battleground states like Wisconsin.
Trump might have an edge because he has the power to act, said Nick Everhart, a Republican strategist in Ohio. “Unlike Biden, Trump can start doing things in real time to be aggressive,” he said. “Politically, he is in position to dictate the terms of engagement.”
Trump in 2016 narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton in Wisconsin by just under 23,000 votes, and with agriculture being an important part of the state’s economy, Democrats are hoping to seize on what they see as his failed trade policies that have exposed farmers to retaliation and resulted in more than $20 billion in subsidies for the sector.
With six months to go until election day, Real Clear Politics’s polling average shows Biden leading Trump by about five points in national surveys. Biden also holds narrow leads in battleground states: He’s three points ahead of Trump in Wisconsin, five points ahead in Michigan and six points ahead in Pennsylvania.
“Coronavirus will be the focus for the remainder of the election. No voter will say he made the right choice to pick a hollow trade deal over the American people’s health,” Sullivan said. “We think this will resonate across the country.”

The city’s traders have been off their desks for a holiday since Wednesday, before a global market recovery lost momentum and tensions between the U.S. and China flared up over the origin of the coronavirus. Futures on the S&P 500 were down 1.5% as of 8:38 a.m. in Hong Kong, signaling further losses after the underlying index dropped 2.8% to end last week. Hang Seng Index futures will start trading from 9.15 a.m. local time.
Hong Kong authorities are this week preparing to ease some lockdown measures amid signs the coronavirus outbreak has been contained. Still, concern remains over a collapse in corporate earnings in what could be the city’s worst economic slump on record. Renewed sparring between the U.S. and China is also adding to the nervousness, with President Donald Trump escalating efforts to pin blame on China for unleashing the pandemic.
The Hang Seng Index rose 4.4% in April, its first monthly gain of the year. The recovery came as investors made the most of a stabilization in global markets and the city’s cheap valuations -- the Hang Seng Index in March traded below book value for only the third time in almost as many decades.
Trading activity in Hong Kong is likely to be subdued Monday, which could further exacerbate moves in the city’s stock market. Links with exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen are shut through Tuesday due to a holiday in mainland China. Southbound trading was last open on April 27.

1223,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",Tighter scrutiny of derivatives clearers proposed amid standoff with banks,"By Huw Jones and David Henry
LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global regulators have proposed tighter scrutiny of clearing houses handling trillions of dollars in derivatives trades after calls from banks for them to be better funded to withstand extreme stress.
The Financial Stability Board (FSB) proposed on Sunday a more detailed checklist for regulators to assess whether clearers hold enough funds to deal with big losses, and asks whether there are still gaps to plug.
The FSB coordinates financial rules for the Group of 20 leading economies (G20), which commit to applying them in national practice. The G20 includes the United States, China, Japan and Germany.
Clearing transactions in the $640 trillion over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market became mandatory after the 2007-09 financial crisis to make trading more transparent.
A clearing house stands between two sides of a financial trade to ensure its completion even if one side goes bust.
Losses beyond certain limits are typically allocated to members, such as banks, and in some cases to their clients.
Mandatory clearing has led to a swelling in clearing houses, with London Stock Exchange's LCH clearing a record $402 trillion worth of interest rate derivatives in the first quarter.
Such volumes have raised concerns that clearing houses could put taxpayers on the hook in a crisis or have to draw heavily on users such as banks.
DEFAULT FUND
The FSB said regulators should analyse arrangements by which the default fund - the prefunded equity dedicated to cover default losses - and other minimum financial resources would be replenished after covering losses.
Clearers have just gone through extreme market volatility and record volumes without a major hitch as investors sold off in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Markets face further stress as the pandemic is likely to trigger a global recession.
The FSB proposal comes amid a years-long standoff between clearing houses and their customers.
Last month a group of nine global banks and investment management companies, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), BlackRock (NYSE:BLK),  Citigroup  (NYSE:C),  Barclays  (LON:BARC) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), said clearing houses need to have more of their own capital at risk as an incentive to limit risky trading.
The group also wants a bigger say in how clearing houses are run as they worry they will end up plugging the losses if clearers are not properly resourced.
They argue that the alignment of risk incentives was thrown out of kilter as major clearing houses shifted to being owned by investors instead of by their member users.
CME Group (NASDAQ:CME), which operates a derivatives clearing house, has said it is users that bring risk and that they should be putting money into the default funds.
The FSB paper said regulators should consider whether clearing houses should hold liabilities that can be ""bailed in"" or written down to plug holes from losses, echoing a requirement for global banks since the financial crisis to shield taxpayers.

Peru is the world's second largest producer of copper and is heavily dependent on the sector for economic growth.
The decree said that to restart activities, companies must implement rigorous health protocols to avoid infections. These will be set by local governments within the next five days and will be supervised by health authorities.
The country's mining sector and wider economy has been hit hard by the pandemic, which has seen 42,534 confirmed cases of the virus in the country - the second most in Latin America. The death toll from the disease in Peru is now around 1,200.
""It is necessary to begin the social and economic recovery,"" the government said in the decree.
""Therefore, it is a priority to address the transition to a resumption of activities that incorporates precautions and protective measures to prevent infections and minimize the risk of a rebound in the disease.""
Major local mine Antamina, controlled by global firms BHP Group Ltd (AX:BHP) and  Glencore  (L:GLEN), reported over the last week that some 210 company workers had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, of which 87% were asymptomatic.
The government of President Martín Vizcarra had previously said it would restart key activities in four phases starting this month, but without specifying which sectors.
The supreme decree on Sunday also included resumptions of production in the agricultural industry, industrial fishing, some areas of construction and the metal-mechanical sector.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2020 12:40PM ET</span>",TUI's China unit resumes domestic holiday offers,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The Chinese unit of Germany's TUI (DE:TUIGn), the world's biggest tourism group, said on Sunday it has resumed offering holiday packages in China and urged the European Union (EU) to lift travel restrictions in place to curb the coronavirus.
The resumption of business in China, three months after TUI's activities there were halted, is focused on short breaks in the mountains and beach resorts. 
Other packages include trips in the vicinity of big cities.
""Our offices in Peking and Shanghai were open during the crisis but were not allowed to sell holiday packages,"" TUI Chief Executive Fritz Joussen said in a statement. 
""We now see a significant backlog of demand for holidays. TUI China will in the coming weeks broaden its offers step by step.""
The global tourism industry is closely watching trends in China for clues to travel patterns in other major markets once the virus, which has infected 3.44 million people and killed 243,00 worldwide, is under control and curbs on movement ease.
Since April, there have been signs of a recovery in China's tourism market, and aviation experts expect domestic travel in most markets will recover before international travel.
Travel within China is also complicated by movement curbs retained in some regions, such as Beijing, the capital, to guard against a second wave of infections from aboard.
Joussen urged the EU to put in place a concept that allows for the resumption of holiday travel within the bloc, where border restrictions have been in place since March.
""The EU and its member states should develop a timetable for resuming travel within Europe and make holidays possible in 2020,"" he said, citing Greece, Cyprus, Spanish islands, Austria and Bulgaria which have made progress toward reopening resorts. 
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer ruled out reopening Germany's border with Austria to holidaymakers in an interview with mass-selling Bild newspaper, citing the risk of a second coronavirus outbreak.
The Ischgl ski resort has been linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases in Germany and Scandinavian countries.

As a result of the broker’s ultimatum, the Samsung (KS:005930) S&P GSCI Crude Oil ER Futures ETF will halt issuance of new shares starting Monday. The ETF also bought put options to protect against negative oil prices and will adjust its existing futures positions, moving from a 100% weighting in September West Texas Intermediate contracts to an equal weighting in September, October and December.
Samsung Asset Management (Hong Kong) Ltd., which disclosed the moves in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange, said it’s in “active discussions” to find a new broker. It didn’t disclose the name of the existing one.
Unprecedented oil-market volatility has wreaked havoc on ETFs and other products that were designed to give investors an easy way to bet on the direction of crude prices. The Samsung ETF and the $3.5 billion U.S. Oil Fund, which trades in New York, are among those that have upended their strategies to reduce the risk of getting wiped out by another plunge below zero.
While the moves may help protect existing investors, they’ve introduced new layers of complexity and may cause the funds to diverge from their original goal of simply tracking front-month oil futures.
The Samsung ETF’s announcement will likely be closely watched by oil traders given its moves can have an impact on futures prices. The fund contributed to a sell-off in June WTI futures last month after dumping its entire holdings to buy September contracts.
In its filing on Sunday, Samsung Asset said the latest changes are “in good faith and in the best interests of the unit holders” but have made it “impracticable” to meet the fund’s original investment objective. It repeated a warning that in a “worst case scenario,” investors could lose all their money.

GM's (N:GM) joint venture with SAIC Motor Corp (SS:600104), which manufactures Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles, said its sales in China grew 13.6% compared to a year earlier. It said it had sold 111,155 units in April, including exported cars.
Meanwhile, SGMW, a separate GM venture with SAIC and Guangxi Automobile Group which produces no-frills minivans and has started to make higher-end cars, said its sales jumped 13.5% to over 127,000 units last month.
U.S. automaker GM, which is China's second biggest foreign car company after Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p), said its sales in China fell 43.3% in the first three months of 2020 compared with the same period last year.
To attract customers, GM and SAIC have hired social media celebrities to promote its new models and are offering free medical masks to customers.

China's biggest automaker SAIC, which sold more than 6 million cars last year, said its sales rose 0.5% compared to the same period last year. As well as the GM venture, it also builds its own brand cars and operates a venture with Volkswagen.

Travel bans have forced the German group to ground 700 of its aircraft, leading to a 99% drop in passenger numbers and causing the group, which includes Swiss and Austrian Airlines, to lose about one million euros ($1.1 million) in liquidity reserves per hour.
""We estimate that these talks can lead to a conclusion soon,"" Chief Executive Carsten Spohr and board members wrote in the letter, adding that they are also checking alternative options but do not expect to need them.
""We remain nevertheless convinced that we will not have to fall back on alternatives given the talks with Berlin.""
Lufthansa is negotiating a 10 billion euro bailout that would result in the government taking a 25.1% stake in the airline, weekly paper Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Of that, 5.5 billion euros would be in the form of non-voting capital, for which the government wants a coupon of 9%, the paper said. 
A further 3.5 billion euros in loans would be provided by state bank Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KFW), the paper said, adding that Belgium, Austria and Switzerland might contribute towards the bailout.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that Lufthansa is negotiating a 9 billion euro bailout, with loans from Austria, Germany and Switzerland, citing a source close to the matter.
The slump in travel due to the coronavirus pandemic has led to a sweeping restructuring of the airline industry, with other carriers also seeking state bailouts.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told the Passauer Neue Presse newspaper at the weekend that ""taxpayers can count on us not to conduct these talks naively.""

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) said on Sunday it had secured support from enough bondholders for a $1.2 billion debt-for-equity swap, a vital step in helping it survive the coronavirus crisis.
The budget airline is poised to run out of cash by mid-May without approval for its plan, which involves handing over most of the company to its lessors and bondholders.
Airlines around the world have been hit particularly hard by the impact on travel of the coronavirus pandemic, with many forced to turn to governments for state aid to avoid bankruptcy.
The next step for Norwegian Air is to secure support from its lessors for its rescue plan, ahead of an extraordinary general meeting on Monday to get approval from shareholders.
Bondholders had turned down Norwegian Air's plan on Friday, but on Sunday the airline said it had now secured a written agreement with the largest bondholders of the NAS07, without naming them, to improve some of the terms.
Although holders of three of its four bonds had given sufficient backing on Friday, support among holders of the NAS07 bond had fallen short of the minimum requirement, with only 62% voting in favour, less than the 67% required. 
""I am pleased to confirm that we have reached an agreementwith the bondholders,"" CEO Jacob Shram said in a statement, which said that a vote will still need to take place on May 18 to ensure Norwegian Air secures the necessary 67% support.
The agreement will provide an improvement of terms for holders of the NAS07 -- whose collateral include slots to fly in and out of London's Gatwick airport -- so that the value of their bonds after the conversion may be increased by up to 38%, against 20% earlier, based on valuations of the Gatwick slots.
The same terms would apply for holders of another bond, the NAS08, but not for those of the NAS09, Norwegian Air said.
(Graphic: Norwegian Air stock has cratered - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/bdwpkredyvm/norwegian%202.PNG)
Also on Monday, Norwegian is set to decide the timeline for the launch of a share issue, which will end on May 18. The airline has said it plans to raise 400 million crowns.
If successful, the debt-to-equity plan allows the carrier to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion Norwegian crowns ($265 million), which hinge on a reduction in its debt to equity ratio, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
Norwegian Air is only paying invoices vital to maintaining minimum operations, such as salaries for staff still employed and critical IT infrastructure. It has put payments for ground handling, debt and leases on hold.

DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Germany's Thyssenkrupp (DE:TKAG) expects the coronavirus crisis to cause a new financial squeeze, scuppering hopes that selling its elevator business would deliver a swift cash respite for the embattled firm, its management board told staff in a letter.
The elevator division was sold in February to ease financial pressure on the conglomerate which has struggled for years after ill-fated investments. But the coronavirus crisis has dealt a blow before cash from that sale arrives in June.
Sources said last week that Thyssenkrupp had secured about 1 billion euros ($1.10 billion) in state aid to tide it over until sale proceeds arrive.
""In the medium term, the cash outflows caused by the corona (crisis) will in all likelihood result in the financial leeway created by the sale of the elevator business becoming much lower than what was originally anticipated,"" the board wrote to staff.
""We are preparing solutions for this,"" according to the April 30 letter signed by Chief Executive Martina Merz that was seen by Reuters and first reported by German daily Handelsblatt.
Thyssenkrupp agreed to sell its elevators division to a consortium of Advent, Cinven and Germany's RAG foundation for 17.2 billion euros in February, with proceeds expected to be received in June.
A source said the loan from state development bank KfW would assist the conglomerate, which has suffered from slow demand for auto parts after carmakers shut down production because of the pandemic. The loan expires at the end of September 
Car makers and suppliers have scrambled to shore up their liquidity as sales in Europe tumbled by more than 50% in March. 
Thyssenkrupp has been pummelled in recent years by a downturn in the car market, multiple leadership changes and an overly complex group structure. Its shares hit historic lows around 3.20 euros in mid-March.
As well as selling its elevator business, Thyssenkrupp's restructuring involves seeking buyers for its Plant Technology division, which builds cement, chemicals and fertiliser plants.

Debt-laden Delek, which last year bought  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX)'s British North Sea (NYSE:SE) oil and gas fields for $2 billion, said on Sunday it lost 311 million shekels ($89 million) in the final three months of 2019, compared with a loss of 219 million a year earlier as finance expenses widened.
Delek, whose stock price and bond prices have been hit hard this year, is in talks with bond and other credit holders to negotiate a settlement.
The company, which holds key stakes in Israel's two main natural gas fields, has sold a number of assets to raise cash and said it was seeking to sell its holdings in its Delek Israel unit as well as to receive royalties in two smaller gas sites.
Delek's ""auditors have added to the financial statements a note drawing attention to the issue of 'going concern',"" it said, noting it expects ""to reach an agreed plan concerning an update of the financial covenants and credit terms, strengthening of the collateral and reinforcing its capital.""
Bondholders, concerned over the firm's financial situation, have threatened to call for Delek to repay all of the 6 billion shekels owed them if the company did not immediately inject 400 million shekels to shore up its balance sheet.
CEO Idan Wallace said that in recent months, the global energy sector has experienced unparalleled and extreme volatility but that Delek ""is a strong company with quality assets and a clear positive net asset value.""

(Reuters) -  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa) sold its entire stakes in the four largest U.S. airlines in April, Chairman Warren Buffett said Saturday at the company's annual meeting, saying ""the world has changed"" for the aviation industry.
The conglomerate had held sizeable positions in the airlines, including an 11% stake in Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), 10% of American Airlines Co (O:AAL), 10% of Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and 9% of United Airlines (O:UAL) at the end of 2019, according to its annual report and company filings.
The conglomerate was one of the largest individual holders in the four airlines and in 2016 disclosed it had begun investing in the four carriers after avoiding the sector for years.
Airline stocks have been hard hit by the near collapse U.S. travel demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. airlines are cutting hundreds of thousands of flights, parking thousands of planes as U.S. travel demand has fallen by about 95% and there is no clear timetable for passengers to return to flights at pre-crisis levels.
Buffett said the airline industry's outlook rapidly changed. 
""We made that decision in terms of the airline business. We took money out of the business basically even at a substantial loss,"" Buffett said. ""We will not fund a company that -- where we think that it is going to chew up money in the future.""
Berkshire disclosed on April 3 it had sold about 18% of its Delta stake and 4% of its Southwest shares.
Buffett said Berkshire had invested around $7 billion or $8 billion amassing stakes in the four airlines including  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL).
""We did not take out anything like $7 or $8 billion and that was my mistake,"" Buffett said at the company's annual meeting which was livestreamed. ""I am the one who made the decision.""
Southwest, American and United declined comment.
Delta said in a statement it was aware of the sale and has ""tremendous respect for Mr. Buffett and the Berkshire team."" The airline added it remains ""confident that the strengths that are core to Delta’s business – our people, our brand, our network and our operational reliability – will endure and position Delta to succeed.""
Buffett said he previously considered investing in additional airlines.
""It is a blow to have essentially your demand dry up.... It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,"" Buffett added.
Buffett previously expressed grim sentiments about the financial outlook for airlines. He did invest in USAir in 1989.
""If a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down,"" Buffett wrote in his 2007 annual letter. ""Investors have poured money into a bottomless pit, attracted by growth when they should have been repelled by it.""

1238,By Reuters,"<span>May 03, 2020 02:56AM ET</span>","Warren Buffett says the coronavirus cannot stop America, or Berkshire Hathaway","(This May 2 story has been refiled to correct the spelling of ""towel"" in second paragraph)
By Jonathan Stempel and Megan Davies
(Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Saturday said the United States' capacity to withstand crises provides a silver lining as it combats the coronavirus, even as he acknowledged that the global pandemic could significantly damage the economy and his investments.
Over more than 4-1/2 hours at the annual meeting of  Berkshire Hathaway Inc  (N:BRKa), Buffett said his conglomerate has taken many steps responding to the pandemic, including providing cash to struggling operating units, and throwing in the towel on a multi-billion-dollar bet on U.S. airlines.
Buffett also said he remains keen on making a big acquisition, which he has not done since 2016, but has not provided financial support to companies as he did during the 2008 financial crisis because he saw nothing attractive enough, even after the recent bear market.
The 89-year-old opened the meeting in Omaha, Nebraska with 1-3/4 hours of remarks to soothe anxious investors, urging them to stay committed to stocks despite this year's bear market, even if the pandemic gets a second wind late this year.
Illustrating his remarks with dozens of plain black-and-white slides, Buffett called dealing with the pandemic ""quite an experiment"" that had an ""extraordinarily wide"" range of possible economic outcomes.
But he said Americans have persevered and prospered through such crises as the Civil War in the 1860s, the influenza pandemic a century ago and the Great Depression. American ""magic"" prevailed before and would do again, he said. 
""Nothing can stop America when you get right down to it,"" Buffett said. ""I will bet on America the rest of my life.""
The meeting was held virtually for the first time because of the pandemic, without shareholders in attendance, and streamed by Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance.
Buffett and Vice Chairman Greg Abel, 57, spent nearly 2-1/2 hours answering shareholder questions posed by a reporter.
Abel has day-to-day oversight of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses, and is considered by many analysts and investors a top candidate to eventually succeed Buffett as chief executive.
BERKSHIRE EXITS AIRLINES
The meeting began several hours after Berkshire reported a record $49.75 billion first-quarter net loss, reflecting huge unrealized losses on common stock holdings such as Bank of America Corp (N:BAC) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) during the market meltdown.
While quarterly operating profit rose 6%, several larger businesses including the BNSF railroad posted declines, hurt by the negative impact of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
Buffett said operating earnings will, through at least this year, be ""considerably less"" than they would have been had the pandemic not occurred.
Berkshire's cash stake ended the quarter at a record $137.3 billion, though Buffett said ""we're willing to do something very big,"" perhaps a $30 billion to $50 billion transaction.
But it won't be in U.S. airlines, after Buffett confirmed that Berkshire in April sold its ""entire positions"" in the four largest:  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL), Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL).
Buffett said he ""made a mistake"" investing in the sector, which the pandemic has changed ""in a very major way"" with no fault of the airlines, leaving limited upside for investors.
""It is basically that we shut off air travel in this country,"" he said.
The meeting was devoid of the surrounding three-day weekend of dining, shopping and other celebratory events that annually draw tens of thousands of people to Omaha for what Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists.""
ABEL SHARES THE STAGE
Abel stood in for longtime Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally joins Buffett to answer shareholder questions.
Buffett said Munger was in ""fine shape"" and ""good health,"" and looked forward to attending Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting.
Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, 68, who oversees Berkshire's insurance businesses and is also considered a possible CEO candidate, was also absent from the meeting. Abel lives closer to Omaha than Munger and Jain.
Berkshire has said its board of directors knows who would become CEO if Buffett died or became incapacitated.
Buffett's eldest son Howard would likely become non-executive chairman, and portfolio managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler could succeed Buffett as chief investment officer.
Abel told investors ""I don't see the culture of Berkshire changing"" after Buffett and Munger are no longer there.
He also said Berkshire was likely to expand its workforce, which totaled 391,539 people at year end, even though some businesses have furloughed employees and cut salaries since the pandemic began, and could start resorting to layoffs.
Berkshire wouldn't be alone. Nationwide jobless claims have since March 21 totaled about 30.3 million, or 18% of the workforce, a level not seen since the Great Depression.
Abel nonetheless said that in five years, ""we see our employment numbers being far greater than they are today.""

Shareholders also elected Kenneth Chenault, a former chief executive of longtime Berkshire holding  American Express  Co (N:AXP), to Berkshire's board, making him the company's first African American director.

(Reuters) - Roche Holding AG (S:ROG) received emergency use approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antibody test to help determine if people have ever been infected with the coronavirus, the Swiss drugmaker said http://pdf.reuters.com/htmlnews/htmlnews.asp?i=43059c3bf0e37541&u= on Sunday.
Governments, businesses and individuals are seeking such blood tests, to help them learn more about who may have had the disease, who may have some immunity and to potentially craft strategies to end lockdowns that have battered global economies.
Roche had previously pledged to make its antibody test available by early May and to boost production by June to ""high double-digit millions"" per month.
The Basel-based company, which also makes separate molecular tests to identify people with active COVID-19 infections, said its antibody test, Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, has a specificity rate of about 99.8% and sensitivity rate of 100%.
These rates help determine if a patient has been exposed to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, and if the patient has developed antibodies against it.
Other companies including U.S.-based  Abbott Laboratories  (N:ABT), Becton Dickinson and Co (N:BDX), Italy's DiaSorin (MI:DIAS) have also developed tests to identify antibodies that develop after somebody has come into contact with the virus.
Diasorin and Abbott recently got U.S. emergency authorization for their tests.
Countries have various plans to use such tests to better understand COVID-19, while also identifying those who were infected but showed only mild symptoms, or none at all.
An erroneous false-positive result could lead to the mistaken conclusion that someone has immunity. 
In developing its test, Roche scrutinized some existing products for reliability before rejecting them, its chief executive, Severin Schwan, had earlier said.
Schwan said there were about 100 such tests on offer, including finger-prick assays that offer a quick result. 
It declined to specify which rival tests it had studied, but said it was not referring to tests from established testing companies.
Roche has said its antibody test requires an intravenous blood draw to determine the presence of antibodies including immunoglobulin G (IgG), which remains longer in the human body, suggesting possible immunity.
As demand escalates for blood antibody tests, an array of distributors with no background or established competency in medical testing have joined experienced companies in an all-but-unregulated marketplace in the United States, according to a Reuters investigation.
The rush to obtain, advertise and find buyers for test kits follows the FDA's decision to allow any company to sell antibody tests in the country without prior review by the agency. 
This comes after the agency faced criticism that it did not act quickly enough with diagnostic tests. 

FDA has said the aim of its policy is to provide laboratories and healthcare providers early access to the tests, but that it will adjust the approach as needed.

U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer had sent a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) demanding a review of all loans made to Ashford, run by Trump donor and Dallas hotelier Monty Bennett.
According to media reports, the hospitality firm is the biggest known applicant of the government's small-business relief program.
The company said it would return the funds due to the SBA's ""recently changed rules"" and ""inconsistent federal guidance that put the companies at compliance risk.""
The group's publicly traded companies overseen by Bennett include  Ashford Inc  (A:AINC),  Ashford Hospitality Trust Inc  (N:AHT) and Braemar Hotels & Resorts Inc (N:BHR).
Schumer said in his letter that he was ""deeply concerned that large, publicly traded companies, like Ashford, may be exploiting the Program.""

1241,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",Buffett's Berkshire posts nearly $50 billion loss as coronavirus causes pain,"By Jonathan Stempel
(Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) Inc is being hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, posting a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50 billion on Saturday and saying performance is suffering in several major operating businesses.
Berkshire said most of its more than 90 businesses are facing ""relatively minor to severe"" negative effects from COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus and now punishing the global economy, with revenue slowing considerably in April even at businesses deemed ""essential.""
The BNSF railroad saw shipping volumes of consumer products and coal fall, while Geico set aside money for car insurance premiums it no longer expects to collect. Some businesses cut salaries and furloughed workers, and retailers such as See's Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart closed stores.
Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3 billion from $128 billion at the end of 2019.
That reflected the 89-year-old billionaire's inability to make large, ""elephant"" size acquisitions for his Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate, and caution in buying stocks.
Berkshire said it bought only a net $1.8 billion of stocks in the first quarter. It also said it repurchased $1.7 billion of its own stock, but that was less than in the prior quarter.
""Historically, Buffett has been so visible in times of crisis, and encouraged investors to take advantage of market selloffs, but if he doesn't see opportunities even in his own stock, what are we to think?"" said Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co in St. Louis.
Still, Shanahan said Berkshire is ""as well positioned as it can be,"" reflecting its diverse businesses and substantial liquidity and access to capital. He rates Berkshire ""buy.""
Berkshire released results before its annual meeting, where Buffett said Berkshire in April sold its ""entire positions"" in the four largest U.S. airlines: American, Delta, Southwest and United.
Buffett said Berkshire ""made a mistake"" investing approximately $7 billion to $8 billion in the sector, which was changed ""in a very major way"" as the pandemic shut down most air travel, through no fault of the airlines.
The meeting was streamed on Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Finance. It was held without the usual ""Woodstock for Capitalists,"" a weekend of festivities that normally draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha, and which Buffett canceled because of the pandemic.
BERKSHIRE STOCK UNDERPERFORMS
Berkshire's first-quarter net loss was $49.75 billion, or $30,653 per Class A share, reflecting $54.52 billion of losses on stock and other investments. Net earnings were $21.66 billion, or $13,209 per share, a year earlier.
An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized stock losses and gains with net results, causing huge swings that Buffett considers meaningless.
Quarterly operating profit, which Buffett considers a better performance measure, rose 6% to $5.87 billion, or about $3,624 per Class A share, from $5.56 billion, or about $3,388 per share.
But year-earlier results reflected a charge for investments linked to what prosecutors called a Ponzi scheme at a solar company, which Berkshire did not know about.
Operating profit at Berkshire's businesses fell 3%, with declines at BNSF, utilities and energy units, and manufacturing, service and retailing operations such as Precision Castparts, which Berkshire bought for $32.1 billion in 2016.
Geico was able to post a 28% gain in pre-tax underwriting profit because people drove less, resulting in fewer claims for crashes. Still, the insurer, like others, is offering relief on premiums to policyholders. 
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger told The Wall Street Journal last month that Berkshire might close a few small businesses.
Investors have been disappointed with Berkshire. Its stock price has fallen 19% in 2020, compared with a 12% drop in the Standard & Poor's 500, despite Buffett's prediction that Berkshire would outperform in down markets.
The decline came after Berkshire's stock lagged the index by more than 20 percentage points in 2019, including dividends.
In the first quarter, many Berkshire stock investments fared worse than the S&P, including  American Express  (NYSE:AXP), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC),  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) and the four airlines.

Falling stocks also caused a $1.39 billion pre-tax loss on derivatives contracts, where Berkshire is betting stock prices will rise over the long haul.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The ongoing U.S. travel crisis is causing thousands of job cuts as the aviation sector waits for passengers to return to the skies but braces for years of lower demand because of the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S. airlines are slashing hundreds of thousands of flights, cutting schedules by 80% or more through at least June and parking thousands of jets as demand for tickets has plunged by about 95%. Airlines are requiring facial coverings and implementing new cleaning procedures to try to convince passengers it is safe to fly again, but also fear the weakened economy may further drag down demand.
Late Friday, Spirit AeroSystems (N:SPR) said that in response to lower production rates from  Boeing Co  (N:BA) and Airbus SE (PA:AIR) it would layoff 1,450 workers in Kansas.
""This sudden drop in air travel has forced our customers to adjust to lower demand from airlines, many of which are seeking to defer or cancel airplane orders,"" Spirit AeroSystems Chief Executive Tom Gentile told employees in an email seen by Reuters. ""All indications right now tell us this lower demand for new commercial airplanes is likely to last for several years.""
On Wednesday, Boeing Co (N:BA) announced it would cut some production rates and eliminate about 16,000 jobs worldwide, or 10% of its workforce by year end.
Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said he expects it will ""take two to three years for travel to return to 2019 levels and it will be a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term growth trends."" The cuts in some areas, such as commercial airplanes, will be more than 15%, Boeing said.
Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said last week it does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years. More than 37,000 Delta employees have volunteered to take unpaid leave lasting from one month to a year.
American Airlines (O:AAL) Chief Executive Doug Parker told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that the airline will be ""smaller than we intended to be certainly into 2021.""
Labor union SEIU said Thursday at least 13,000 union members at airports have been laid off and another 1,000 layoffs are planned. The U.S. Treasury has not yet awarded $3 billion in payroll assistance cash grants approved by Congress for airport contractors such as baggage handlers and airplane caterers.
U.S. airlines last month collectively were awarded $25 billion in Treasury cash grants but as a condition must not fire workers or reduce through Sept. 30.
Numerous airlines have warned that without a dramatic turnaround in passenger numbers they will be forced to make new significant cuts before year end.
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) said in a research note on Friday that ""October 1st is likely to emerge as one of the darkest days in history for airline labor"" -- though it noted that Congress could opt to extend additional assistance.
United Airlines (O:UAL) is reducing working hours by 25% for 15,000 employees starting May 24, drawing criticism from an employee union and some U.S. lawmakers who contend that the move violates the terms of the $5 billion payroll assistance United is receiving from the Treasury.
""The taxpayers of this country have offered a generous bailout to your company and you should, in turn, honor this trust by keeping the promises you made to those you employ,"" Republican Senator Josh Hawley wrote United on Friday.
United declined to comment on Hawley's letter on Saturday but its chief operations officer Greg Hart told employees in an email on Friday that the reduction in hours does not violate the terms of the government assistance.
He said United is ""making similar changes for our management personnel"" and that those changes will be announced on Monday.

Last month,  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said it was furloughing 50% of workers in U.S. engine assembly and component manufacturing operations, a move that impacted thousands of employees. That followed the 2,600 U.S. job cuts announced in March by GE's aviation unit, which makes engines for Boeing and Airbus.

The dozen EU governments, including Paris, urged the European Commission on Wednesday to suspend rules forcing the cash-drained airlines to offer refunds instead of vouchers for future travel because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""I'm glad a very large majority of member states are supporting my request to authorise airlines and maritime groups to temporarily use vouchers when trips are cancelled, so as to relieve their cash reserves while protecting passengers' rights to a refund,"" French transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said in a statement.
Airlines across Europe, including Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF), have sought state rescues as coronavirus lockdowns have forced them to ground their fleets for more than a month, with no end in sight.
The European Commission, which is set to issue guidelines on how the broader transport industry could gradually restart, has said so far that airlines must follow EU rules and provide refunds for cancelled flights.
They should only issue vouchers if passengers accept them.

Governments in favour of a temporary waiver have said vouchers should be valid for a set period and include the right to reimbursement if they are not used before the expiry date. Protection should also be provided in the case of airline bankruptcies.

1247,By Investing.com,"<span>May 02, 2020 02:14AM ET</span>",Point/Counterpoint: Zoom Bulls Vs. Bears,"By Geoffrey Smith and Kim Khan
Investing.com - As parts of the globe begin to ease lockdown rules, with news cases of Covid-19 waning, it’s a good time to take stock of some of the companies that benefited from the new landscape.
Among the most well known of these quarantine stocks is video teleconferencing software provider Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM). Shares have doubled since the start of the year as companies across the globe adopted it to replace the office meeting room. As economies attempt to revert to past productivity, is Zoom still a good bet or will it fall back to earth?
Geoffrey Smith argues that Zoom has risen too far, too fast, while Kim Khan argues that if you say “Zoom” instead of “video meeting” you know how the landscape has changed and it’s attractive for the long term. This is Point/Counterpoint.
The Bear Case
The bear case for Zoom is that it has simply gone too far, too fast. Not just in terms of valuation metrics, although at over 50 times trailing 12-month revenue and 1,500 times earnings, the company is twice as expensive as Slack, another ultra-trendy alternative communications stock.
Zoom’s user numbers for the first quarter will obviously look stellar. CEO Eric Yuan has been quoted extensively as saying that they grew from a maximum of 10 million daily to over 200 million within a couple of weeks as lockdowns spread across Europe and North America.
But how much of this can Zoom turn into cold, hard cash? The first question a potential investor should ask themselves is – how much have you paid so far to use Zoom? If you’re just using it as an individual, the answer is very probably “nothing”.
Even if it isn’t, how much would you be prepared to pay to use Zoom in a world where Apple’s FaceTime, Google Meet and many others are available for free?  What, about the company, is truly unique? Remember, the pandemic that made Zoom will also leave us with no spare cash to throw around on services that we can get for free elsewhere.
Which leaves business customers. These, in fairness, have already helped to make Zoom profitable, in contrast to Slack. But the bear argument says that the company has already lost crucial trust from this segment with its by now well-documented security flaws. Regaining it will be hard, perhaps impossible.
For school boards organizing remote teaching, a single naked zoombomber exposing himself is one too many. For companies like  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn), the routing of data through servers in China fatally compromises its confidentiality. For government agencies from the U.S. Senate to the Indian and German governments, the thought of those Chinese servers and the crass monetization of data by forwarding it to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (Facebook!) has made it an immediate no-no.
Yuan has dismissed these mis-steps as bugs in the business model, but the bear case says they are features, a reflection of an all-too familiar Silicon Valley mentality that places no value on data privacy and indulges its desire to maximize revenue without restraint.
The company has given itself 90 days to fix its security problems. Investors should exercise extreme caution if it continues to generate negative security on this issue thereafter.
The Bull Case
 Zoom Video Communications  is facing what all trendy stocks – and indeed all trends – go through at some point: backlash.
Zoom has been the stock of the lockdown era and, as it reached what many have called an absurd valuation, it’s facing intense scrutiny.
Looking at the stock right now it’s clear the valuation is through the roof. Technical indicators are screaming short-term sell as well. It’s had an amazing run, but whether it’s still got plenty of long-term potential if you believe Zoom has had a transformation moment. And there’s a good case to be made that it has.
Zoom has become part of landscape, with the its name so synonymous with video conferencing people simply say, “Let’s Zoom.” That’s something that Facebook and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) can’t encroach on (like when Bill Gates brought out the Palm PC).
Years from now we may be talking about a Baby Zoomer generation.
And the landscape will be different when the economy reopens, making video conferencing and working from home more standard practice.
Despite the confidence from the White House, the United States and Europe are just starting to change their rules. Localities could quickly be back on lockdown at the sign of infections rising and speculation about a second wave will also leave businesses hesitant to revert to how things were pre-pandemic.
Many employees and employers will see the advantages of telecommuting, at least a couple of days a week, and with school closures extended and childcare harder to come by it will be necessity for some.
Business air travel should also decline, not just for safety reasons, as airfares jump and leaner carriers fly fewer routes.
Moving from the broader trends, Cantor Fitzgerald, earlier this month, initiated its coverage of Zoom with an overweight rating, noting they expect ""the virus to provide upside to estimates and for the platform and its products to drive increased market penetration and future cross-selling opportunities.""
Earnings projections are strong. Analysts, on average, expect that revenue will rise to about $930 million for the current fiscal year, up 49% from $623 million a year ago.
Fiscal 2022 revenue is seen climbing a further 34% to $1.25 billion."

Tesla suspended production at its Fremont, California plant on March 24.
The extension comes days after health officials from San Francisco County, along with five other Bay Area counties, said they would revise ""shelter-in-place"" orders that are set to expire on Sunday. 
The new orders will keep the restrictions in place and extend them through May, with limited easing for a small number of low-risk activities.

(Reuters) - Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) Inc was ordered by a U.S. judge on Friday to face a lawsuit claiming its illegal predatory pricing and other anticompetitive practices stifled competition, and drove rival Sidecar Technologies Inc out of business.
Chief Magistrate Judge Joseph Spero of the federal court in San Francisco said SC Innovations, the successor to Sidecar, could try to prove that Uber tried to monopolize the ride-sharing business, by crowding out smaller rivals including  Lyft  Inc (NASDAQ:LYFT) or making it harder for them to compete.
A spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Uber declined to comment. Spero had dismissed an earlier version of the lawsuit on Jan. 21.
Sidecar launched a ride-hailing service in 2012, and offered the first app to show passengers prices before booking rides, and to match passengers for car pooling.
The company, which was also based in San Francisco, shut down in December 2015, and sold its assets to General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) the following year.
According to the complaint, Uber initially offered above-market incentives to drivers and low fares to passengers to amass market share, and then cut driver payments and raised fares, including through ""surge"" and ""dynamic"" pricing, to recoup its losses after cementing its dominance.
Uber was also accused of having secretly booked and then canceled rides on competitors' apps, under programs known as ""Project Hell"" and ""SLOG,"" to induce frustrated drivers and passengers to work with the company.
""At this stage, the court finds Sidecar's allegations of market power to be sufficiently plausible to avoid dismissal,"" Spero wrote.

1251,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",How Boeing went from appealing for government aid to snubbing it,"By Kate Duguid, Joshua Franklin and David Shepardson
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In just six weeks,  Boeing Co  (N:BA) went from seeking government aid to announcing it no longer needed it. 
The company's $25 billion bond issue this week made all the difference. 
The upsized deal, this year's largest investment-grade bond issue and the sixth largest on record, surpassed Boeing's expectations. It underscores how the Chicago-based company capitalized on U.S. government support, even without having to accept taxpayer money as aid.
On March 24, Boeing's Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith told Reuters in an interview that the credit markets were ""essentially closed"" to the largest U.S. plane maker, and that the entire U.S. aerospace industry urgently needed capital to cope with the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.
A $2.3 trillion U.S. stimulus package, enacted into law at the end of March to provide relief to the U.S. economy which was hit hard by the pandemic, subsequently carved out $17 billion in aid for Boeing and other companies critical to national security. 
Boeing itself had lobbied extensively for aid and had called for at least $60 billion in government loans for the entire aerospace manufacturing sector. ""We can't let anything happen to Boeing,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said last month, in one of the many instances he expressed support for the company.
Several bond investors in interviews with Reuters cited the U.S. government's backstopping of Boeing, as well as the Federal Reserve's support of the credit markets in the aftermath of the pandemic, as reasons for the success of the capital raise. 
""Boeing is pretty vital to, not just the U.S. economy, but to national security interests. Also, you can't argue (with the fact that) the Fed support is what has been the primary driver of what is allowing risk assets to boom,"" said Mark Heppenstall, chief investment officer at Penn Mutual Asset Management. 
Already saddled with $39 billion in debt as of the end of March, Boeing started the week searching for cash, to cope not just with impact of the coronavirus outbreak on air travel, but with the long grounding of its flagship 737 Max aircraft as well, following a string of accidents.
Smith and Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun had taken what they called a ""balanced"" approach, reiterating on Wednesday that they were exploring a mix of government aid and commercial funding. 
One potential source of government aid, the $17 billion national security-related fund administered by the U.S. Treasury Department, came with significant strings, including the possibility of the U.S. government getting a stake in Boeing. That could have led to Boeing's shareholders getting diluted.
Then Boeing had a breakthrough. Its plan was to gauge investor interest for a bond issue of between $10 billion and $15 billion, according to people familiar with the deliberations. Yet demand for the bonds on Thursday peaked at more than $70 billion from over 600 investor accounts, according to the sources.
Credit rating agencies told Boeing it could borrow as much as $25 billion through a bond issue and just about retain its investment-grade rating, according to the sources.
This was important for Boeing, to reign in its borrowing costs and attract more investors to the bond offering, the sources said. Investors that traditionally invest in junk-rated debt, such as hedge funds, also flocked to Boeing's bond issue, because it was priced at premium to investment-grade deals, according to the sources.
Boeing priced different bond tranches spanning several maturities at between 450 basis points and 593 basis points, whereas the average spread for bonds of Boeing's credit rating is 306 basis points, according to ICE (NYSE:ICE) BofA Data.
""Let's face it, Boeing is not an investment-grade company by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Nick Maroutsos, co-head of global bonds at Janus Henderson Investors. 
Boeing declined to comment on its internal planning for the capital raise. 
But Boeing announced on Thursday that as a result of the strong response to its bond offering, it did ""not plan to seek additional funding through the capital markets or the U.S. government options at this time.""
CONCESSIONS
Boeing had to make concessions to cajole the credit rating agencies and bond investors. It agreed to increase interest payments by 25 basis points each time the two biggest credit rating agencies lowered its rating by one level into junk, according to the bond issue's prospectus. It capped these concessions at 100 basis points per credit-rating agency and 200 basis points in total. 
Boeing expects the money from the bond issue to cover its funding needs for the year, barring any unexpected event. Before announcing it would no longer seek government aid, it stress-tested its financial assumptions and considered numerous scenarios to ensure it has liquidity for the remainder of the year, according to the sources. 
Boeing has also had to take several cost-cutting measures, including announcing plans to shed about 16,000 jobs this year, about 10% of its workforce, through early retirements and likely layoffs.

On Friday, Smith told Boeing employees in a message he wanted ""to thank the administration for the actions they have taken to support our economy and the credit markets.""

(Reuters) - British aero-engine maker Rolls-Royce Holdings (L:RR) is considering cutting up to 15% of its workforce, a source close to the company told Reuters, as customers cut production and airlines park planes due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The size of layoffs has been mentioned internally by senior management, but is by no means finalised and there is a lot of negotiation still to be done, the source added.
The company's engines power Airbus SE (PA:AIR) and  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) widebody jets and Rolls-Royce is paid by airlines based on how many hours its engines fly.
The Financial Times earlier reported Rolls-Royce was preparing to lay off up to 8,000 of its 52,000-strong workforce.
An announcement on the final figure is not expected before the end of May, when the company will update employees, according to the FT report. (https://on.ft.com/2VSaQfD)
Last month, Rolls-Royce scrapped its targets and final dividend to shore up its finances to cope with the virus outbreak.
The company's Chief Executive Officer Warren East said in April Rolls-Royce would be looking at cutting cash expenditure, including salary costs across its global workforce by at least 10% this year.
Discussions with unions about the job cuts have just begun, the newspaper reported, citing sources.
The scale of job cuts is still likely to be larger than after 9/11 when the group cut 5,000 jobs and the vast majority of it is expected to hit the civil aerospace unit, the FT said.
While job losses are also expected in the unit's operations in Singapore and Germany, Britain's civil aerospace workforce is expected to bear the majority of the cuts, according to the report.

Unite, Britain's largest trade union, did not comment in response to a query from Reuters.

Pershing Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management, the New York-based hedge fund run by William Ackman that pushes companies to perform better, gained 13.6% in its Pershing Square Holdings fund in April, leaving it up 17.3% for the year, data released after the close of trading on Friday show.
Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund giant which relies on teams of traders to make bets on stocks, bonds, commodities and other securities, earned a 4% return in its flagship Wellington hedge fund last month, according to a performance estimate. The fund is now up 10% for the year, a person familiar with the numbers said.
Ackman and Ken Griffin, who runs Citadel, identified the coronavirus dangers early and positioned for shocks.
The S&P 500 has lost 10% for the year but jumped 13% in April. By the time the market recovered ground, many hedge funds benefited. Ackman, for example, put fresh money into stocks he already owned and once again bought into Starbucks (O:SBUX) just as the market recovered from heavy selling.
Verition Fund Management's Verition Multi-Strategy Fund returned 8.37% for the year to date, after a 3.7% gain in April, according to preliminary figures from an investor. 
On average, hedge funds gained 2.73% for the month through April 23 and are now off only 4.6% for the year, data from  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) show.
Some firms also benefited from volatility in oil markets where prices, for a time, fell so far that sellers had to pay buyers to take oil off their hands.
Benn Eifert's QVR Advisors' absolute return strategy gained an estimated 7.57% last month, leaving it up 59.44% for the year, an investor said. Hedged positions in dividend futures helped, as did option positions which benefited from the volatile move lower in oil prices, the investor said.
Franklin Parlamis' Aequim Alternative Investments, which specializes in relative value arbitrage, gained roughly 3% in April, leaving it up roughly 5% for the year, an investor said.
Boardman Bay Capital Management, which runs a fund focused on technology, media, and telecom investments, reported a gain of 17.65% before fees in April. That shrinks its loss to 5.09% for the year, an investor said.
Not everyone made money last month, however.
David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital extended losses, with a 1.1% drop in April, which leaves the fund down 22.3% for the year, an investor said. Looking ahead, Einhorn warned that technology companies, which fueled last month's gains, could be vulnerable if ongoing economic weakness hurts their advertising.
Hedge fund industry investors polled by law firm Seward & Kissel said there was demand for experienced managers, especially in distressed debt markets. New managers may have more trouble raising cash, especially after investors soured on the industry in the first quarter and pulled 1% of capital out, data from Hedge Fund Research show.

Most hedge fund managers are still finalizing their numbers for April.

(Reuters) - Some workers at Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN),  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT) and Instacart Inc staged protests and sick-outs on Friday to demand a safer work environment and better pay during the coronavirus outbreak.
The protests took place in New York, Pennsylvania, Oregon and other states, organizers said in social media posts and interviews. Labor groups and unions involved include the United Food and Commercial Workers and Workers United. Workers across the United States were invited to join by calling in sick.
May 1, known as International Workers' Day or May Day, is a worldwide holiday to celebrate working classes.
The protests were the latest by workers deemed essential in the pandemic who risk their lives working in warehouses and grocery stores. They argue that employers have fallen short in providing for their safety while making record sales.
Their demands include hazard pay and the shuttering of facilities with confirmed coronavirus cases. Workers at Target and Instacart are also requesting protective equipment like masks.
The number of workers that took part in the protests was unclear. Organizers said they were collecting signatures through Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Docs for a tally.
Amazon responded in a statement that while it respects the right of expression, it objects to ""the irresponsible actions of labor groups in spreading misinformation and making false claims about Amazon."" The e-commerce company said it did not see a measurable impact on operations as a result of Friday’s protest.
A Target representative said the company was aware of fewer than 10 workers who participated in the protests, compared with more than 340,000 workers it employs. Instacart, a grocery delivery platform, said it was moving quickly to obtain tens of thousands of personal protective equipment items for its shoppers.
One Whole Foods Market employee in Massachusetts, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, said he joined the sick-out because he believed the Amazon-owned grocer should expand its two-week paid sick policy to cover symptomatic workers who may still be seeking a COVID-19 diagnosis.
""We're acting in solidarity, because we all have similar demands for better safety practices, for protecting the workers and fairly compensating us for the risk we're taking,"" the employee said.
Amazon said it has prioritized workers' safety, spending nearly $700 million on higher pay and more than 150 measures such as providing masks and performing temperature checks.
Union leaders say such protests are meant to raise concerns to the companies, and to urge regulators to exercise more scrutiny on working conditions during the pandemic.
""The emphasis now is on putting pressure on our governments to take action against employers who are not doing enough to protect workers,"" said Patricia Campos-Medina, co-director at union federation AFL-CIO's New York arm, who helped coordinate the protests.

1255,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 06:05PM ET</span>","Ice cream maker Blue Bell to plead guilty, pay $19 million over listeria outbreak","By Nate Raymond
(Reuters) - Texas-based ice cream manufacturer Blue Bell Creameries has agreed to pay $19.35 million and plead guilty to charges that it shipped contaminated products linked to a 2015 listeriosis outbreak, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday.
Prosecutors also filed charges in federal court in Austin, Texas, against the company's former president, Paul Kruse, who they said participated in a scheme to conceal from customers what Blue Bell knew about the listeria contamination.
The Justice Department alleged Blue Bell distributed ice cream that was made under insanitary conditions and contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, a potentially life-threatening pathogen.
In February 2015, state officials in Texas notified Blue Bell that two ice cream products from a factory in Brenham, Texas tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes.
While Blue Bell took steps to remove the remaining stock of the two products from store shelves, it did not recall them or warn consumers about the contamination, nor did it after Texas officials found listeria in a third product, prosecutors said.
The company ultimately recalled the ice cream after 10 reported cases of listeria in four states were linked to its products. Three of the people sickened, all hospital patients in Kansas, later died.
Blue Bell in a statement said the plea deal involves events five years ago before it shut down and revamped its facilities. It said it was determined today to ""make the safest, most delicious ice cream available.""
""We apologize to everyone who was impacted, including our customers, our employees and the communities where we live and work,"" the company said.
Chris Flood, a lawyer for Kruse, said his client was innocent and with other Blue Bell employees ""did the best they could with the information they had at the time.""
As part of its plea agreement, Blue Bell agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of distributing adulterated ice cream products and pay $17.25 million.
It also agreed to pay another $2.1 million to resolve civil claims regarding ice cream made under insanitary conditions and sold to federal facilities in violation of the False Claims Act, the department said.

U.S.-listed shares of Canopy (N:CGC) were up nearly 13% in extended trading.
The warrants, which were originally issued on Nov. 2, 2017, were exercised at C$12.9783 per common share for a total of about C$245 million ($174 million), the companies said on Friday.
The common shares represented about 5.1% of the issued and outstanding common shares of Canopy.
Constellation now indirectly holds a total of 142.25 million common shares of Canopy, 139.75 million warrants to purchase common shares and C$200 million principal amount of senior notes.
""While global legalization of cannabis is still in its infancy, we continue to believe the long-term opportunity in this evolving market is substantial,"" Constellation Chief Executive Officer Bill Newlands said.
Constellation had said earlier in the year that it does not plan to make any additional cash contributions to Canopy beyond the exercise of the warrants. The company was one of the first major alcohol producers to enter the growing cannabis industry when it took the stake in Canopy in 2017. 
It has since had to record charges in various quarters due to the decrease in the fair value of its over $4 billion investment as Canadian weed producers struggle to turn a profit due to lower-than-expected demand, while expansions hit sales and lift costs.

1257,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>","Exxon, Chevron slam brakes on shale as oil demand tumbles","By Jennifer Hiller
HOUSTON (Reuters) -  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  Corp (NYSE:CVX) are slamming the brakes on oil output, as the top two U.S. producers plan for combined global shut-ins of 800,000 barrels per day in response to plunging crude prices and fuel demand. 
Both companies on Friday outlined deep cuts in investments in the Permian shale basin, the top U.S. oilfield where growth in recent years made America the world's top oil producer and a net exporter for the first time in decades. They each announced global shut-ins of up to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) this quarter due to lockdowns to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Exxon and Chevron have been sidelining Permian drilling equipment since the market started crashing in March. U.S. crude prices have plunged nearly 70% this year to under $20 a barrel, and traded in negative territory on April 20 for the first time ever. 
Oil and gas output at both U.S. producers rose in the first quarter with the companies racing to produce 1 million barrels per day in the Permian. Then fuel demand sank nearly a third due to travel and business lockdowns, while a flood of Russian and Saudi oil hit the market when they abandoned production cuts. 
""We would intend to bring activity back to the Permian when we see prices recover,"" Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber said in an interview.
The two oil majors spent heavily in the last two years to expand in the Permian. Shale production can be brought on faster than deepwater and other oil exploration projects but requires near-constant drilling to maintain output. 
Exxon's biggest cuts will come in the Permian, ""where the short-cycle investments are more readily adjusted,"" said Exxon Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods. 
He added that because shale wells produce big volumes at first and then decline rapidly, it is ""beneficial in long term"" to ensure ""we're bringing those high production rates into a market that's more conducive."" Exxon will sideline 75% of its Permian drilling rigs, keeping 15 working.
The company posted a $610 million first-quarter loss, its first quarterly loss in three decades, on a nearly $3 billion inventory writedown reflecting lower margins and prices. Chevron posted a $3.6 billion profit on asset sales and improved refining results, and also said it would further reduce spending this year.
(For a graphic on Exxon's earnings, click here: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/ygdpzydkyvw/index.html)
Both companies will slash spending budgets by 30% this year. Chevron cut its capital spending budget to $14 billion and Exxon has set 2020 spending at $23 billion, the lowest in four years. 
Even though their results topped Wall Street's reduced estimates, Exxon shares fell 7% to $43.14 while Chevron dropped 2.8% to $89.44.
Chevron’s additional spending cuts will help it pay for its dividend and make it ""a defensive energy holding and a relative safe haven in very stormy seas,"" said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones.
Exxon’s balance sheet ""is strong enough to withstand the current environment,"" but it needs oil prices around $75 per barrel this year to break even versus around $50 on average for its peers, said Biraj Borkhataria of RBC Europe Limited.
U.S. crude futures have recovered a bit since settling in negative territory on April 20, but the current price of around $19 per barrel remains below the cost of production for many. International oil prices are around $26 per barrel.
Both Chevron and Exxon maintained their quarterly dividends.

Other oil majors are also slashing investments and seeking ways to conserve cash. Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two and reported first-quarter profits down nearly half compared to a year-ago. BP (NYSE:BP) Plc's first-quarter profit tumbled by two-thirds and its debt climbed to its highest on record.

1258,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>",GCP's largest investor also sought control of board before backing Starboard,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss
BOSTON (Reuters) - GCP Applied Technologies (N:GCP) said on Friday that its largest investor had wanted to take control of GCP's board itself before backing activist investor Starboard Value, which also wants to replace most GCP directors.
That investor, Standard Industries Inc and its affiliated entity 40 North Management LLC, which together own 24.4% of GCP's stock, asked to appoint six of nine directors at GCP, the company said in a presentation.
Four directors would have come from the investor group and the other two would have been Starboard nominees. Starboard, which is pushing ahead with a proxy fight this year, was handed two GCP board seats last year.
The 40 North group also wanted assurances that David Millstone and David Winter, the co-chief executives of Standard Industries, would lead the GCP board, the filing said.
40 North's plans have not been previously reported.
GCP said it tried to engage with 40 North through dozens of meetings and calls. It proposed a settlement that would have handed three board seats to 40 North representatives with an understanding that the two sides then settle on a mutually agreeable fourth independent director.
But 40 North insisted on control of the board, something that GCP was not willing to hand over, the filing said.
Standard Industries and 40 North did not immediately reply to a request for comment. 
Earlier this week 40 North threw its weight behind Starboard, which owns 9% of GCP and has also been pushing for control via its nomination of eight directors earlier this year.
The 40 North group said it had no choice but to ""support Starboard Value's call for an almost complete replacement of GCP's Board."" It said it has been patient with the company since its spin off from W.R. Grace four years ago and said the current board is ""incapable of making sound strategic and tactical decisions."" 
Together Starboard and Standard Industries, a privately held global industrial business, and 40 North, its related investment vehicle, own more than a third of GCP's shares putting them in a very strong position to push for changes on the board.
40 North has indicated to GCP that it would like to use GCP as a vehicle alongside its portfolio company, which operates in the same sector, a person familiar with the negotiations said.
GCP also said in the filing that it has been trying to settle with Starboard. ""Both 40 North and Starboard rejected any settlement that would involve any independent directors identified by an independent search firm,"" the filing said.
Companies are traditionally unwilling to hand over the majority of board seats to any one entity, and corporate governance experts do not like it either arguing that other shareholders would be disadvantaged.
Unless the two parties reach a settlement, shareholders will have a chance to vote on the Starboard nominees at GCP's annual meeting later this month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street sold off sharply on Friday after President Donald Trump revived a threat of new tariffs against China in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought global economies to a grinding halt.
All three major U.S. stock averages closed down well over 2%, and for the week they all lost ground.
May is often marked by sell-offs, and on the month's first day, with jitters on the rise as some U.S. states begin easing coronavirus shutdowns, the adage held true. 
""Markets had a very strong April as they looked through the valley of economic weakness to a point when stimulus will reignite economic growth,"" said David Carter, chief investment officer at Lenox Wealth Advisors in New York. ""But it could be a longer and deeper valley than many hoped.""
Indeed, stocks had a remarkable run in April, with the S&P 500 and the Dow both posting their strongest monthly percentage gains in 33 years. 
Trump said his administration was crafting retaliatory measures against China as punishment for the coronavirus outbreak, once again sparking tariff fears that rattled markets through much of the last two years. Trump has blamed China for what he says is ""misinformation"" when the virus emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan and then quickly spread around the world.
""Trump poking China was the last thing markets needed given so much present economic and financial uncertainty,"" Carter added.
A mixed bag of earnings, particularly a disappointing report from Amazon.com (O:AMZN), along with a fresh round of dismal economic data, also weighed on sentiment.
U.S. manufacturing activity skidded to an 11-year low last month as lockdowns shuttered factories, according to the Institute for Supply Management's purchasing managers index.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 622.03 points, or 2.55%, to 23,723.69, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 81.72 points, or 2.81%, to 2,830.71, and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 284.60 points, or 3.2%, to 8,604.95.
All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 closed in the red, with energy companies (SPNY) suffering the largest percentage drop.
The corporate reporting season has crossed the midpoint, with 275 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results. Of those, 68% have beaten consensus estimates.
In aggregate, first-quarter S&P 500 earnings are seen having fallen 12.7% from a year ago, a stark reversal from the 6.3% annual growth forecast that stood on Jan. 1.
Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) plunged 10.3% after company Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a tweet that the electric car maker's stock price was ""too high.""
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) shares slid 7.6% after the online retailer warned pandemic-related expenses could lead to its first quarterly loss in five years.
Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) quarterly results beat expectations, but the iPhone maker declined to provide current-quarter forecasts. Its shares lost 1.6%.
 Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) dropped 7.2% after the company reported a drop in profit due to a massive $3 billion writedown on plummeting oil demand and prices.
Rival  Chevron  Corp (O:CVX) posted a 38% profit increase, boosted by asset sales, and slashed spending plans. Its shares dipped 2.8%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ), a 4.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and two new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 17 new highs and 12 new lows.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.17 billion shares, compared with the 12.19 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

1261,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2020 04:36PM ET</span>",Automakers Avoid Disaster Using 0% Financing Like Never Before,"(Bloomberg) -- Zero-percent auto financing deals hit a record last month as carmakers kept the U.S. auto market from collapsing.
More than one in every four new vehicles that sold last month did so with 0% loans, according to market researcher Edmunds. By opening up the lending spigots, the U.S. avoided a reprise of the almost 80% drop automakers experienced in China in February, the month that the coronavirus hit the world’s largest car market hardest.
Both 0% offers and longer-term loans are rescuing demand at a time when large swaths of the country are under stay-home orders and many dealerships are forced to keep showrooms shut. While the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate cuts are making it easier for automakers to dangle the deals, their lenders are still forgoing revenue they’d make in more normal times.
“I think 0% is an important tool in our toolbox and will continue to be offered for a while,” said Randy Parker, the vice president in charge of sales for Hyundai Motor Co.’s U.S. subsidiary. After other automakers offered no-interest financing, the company “wanted to remain competitive in the marketplace.”
Hyundai’s U.S. sales fell 39% last month, while  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp. and Honda Motor Co.’s both plunged by more 50%. Through May 4, the South Korean carmaker is offering zero-interest financing for seven years on the Tucson crossover and Elantra sedan, and for six years on the Santa Fe sport-utility vehicle.
Toyota changed its incentive and marketing programs on April 22 to better align with deals elsewhere in the industry, including offering 0% for five years on core vehicles such as the RAV4 SUV, Camry sedan and Tacoma mid-size pickup.
But it has resisted offering terms longer than 60 months, viewing that as harmful to resale values and car buyers’ budgets. “We’re not into zero-for-84 months,” said Bob Carter, executive vice president for sales at Toyota Motor’s North American unit. “It’s not only not healthy for the industry, but also for the consumer.”
Even with all the discounts, April was a painful month. Edmunds estimates industrywide deliveries fell 53% from a year ago, the worst month in at least three decades.
“April is likely the bottom for auto sales, so hopefully there’s only room for improvement from here,” Edmunds analyst Jessica Caldwell said in a statement. “Although automakers are doing their part by offering landmark incentives, those might not be enough if consumers cannot recover financially from this crisis.”

1262,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",Will U.S. exchange trading floors still be relevant post-coronavirus?,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has upended U.S. equities trading with unprecedented market volatility and forced bourses like the New York Stock Exchange to close their trading floors, raising questions about the need for such spaces.
The NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc (N:ICE), closed its stock and options trading floors in New York and San Francisco in March 23 after traders and an ICE employee tested positive for the virus. Rivals CME Group (O:CME), Cboe Global Markets Inc (Z:CBOE) and Nasdaq Inc (O:NDAQ) also closed their options and futures pits in Chicago and Philadelphia.
Despite the move to all-electronic trading, none of the exchange operators experienced any major technical glitches amid record volumes, and all of them reported first-quarter profits that beat analysts' expectations.
Cboe aims to reopen its options trading floor on June 1 after acknowledging that some customers were frustrated by the exchange's electronic trading tools and were unable to get the most risky and complex types of orders completed, it said on Friday.
At the same time, Chief Executive Ed Tilly said Cboe will soon roll out new electronic solutions that will replicate benefits of the floor for those more complex orders, prompting analysts to question the need to reopen the spaces at all.
""Our position has always been that when our customers tell us that there's no utility in the trading crowd, when brokers provide no service to their customers, the electronic solution will close the trading floor, not Cboe and not its management team,"" Tilly said.
The NYSE is the only U.S. exchange that still operates stock trading floors alongside electronic trading. It released a study on Thursday showing that floor traders dampen volatility by providing tighter bid-offer spreads, especially at the market close, saving investors millions of dollars a day.
While the floor distinguishes NYSE from its competitors, the closure has not led to a significant drop in market share, according to an analysis released Friday by industry trade group, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.
""Only time will tell if investors feel the difference in execution of their trades with or without the human interaction on the floor,"" the study said.
The NYSE plans to reopen its San Francisco-based options floor on Monday. It has not given a date for the reopening of its iconic floors at 11 Wall Street.
CME, which runs the world's largest futures exchange, said on Wednesday it was unclear when it would reopen its trading floors, where about 10% of its business was done.
""We will not do anything irrational either way until we know exactly where health officials and government officials are going to come down as far as multiple people getting together in a single location,"" CEO Terry Duffy told analysts on a call.
The closure had little effect on trading activity, CME said. 

""Participants can trade any strategy today as easily as they could prior to the closure of the floor,"" said Sean Tully, a senior managing director at the exchange.

Gilead was up 1.8% in after-hours trade.
""It is reasonable to believe that the known and potential benefits of (remdesivir) outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug for the treatment of patients hospitalized with severe Covid-19,"" the FDA said in a letter.
The rapid approval comes just days after a clinical trial showed that the treatment had shortened Covid-19 recovery times.   
The results of the clinical trial showed a mortality rate of 8% for the group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% for the placebo group, according to a statement from the National Institutes of Health released later Wednesday.
In an effort to boost the efficacy of remdesivir, Gilead said it was looking into ways of combining its treatment with other drugs."

The Small Business Administration even temporarily shut Wall Street out of the loan effort on Wednesday, allowing applications only from small community banks to give them a larger share of the final chunk of the $670 billion in funding.
“What we did in 2008 is not lost on us,” said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, a lobbying group for large and mid-sized lenders, including those that have come under fire. “This is our time in 2020 to show America that we wanted to lead in this crisis, and the process at times has been so utterly frustrating.”
The Trump administration has deemed the Paycheck Protection Program a success and crowed about getting much needed money into the hands of tens of millions of small business workers. But the largest banks are concerned that the legacy for them will include a flurry of litigation and state and congressional investigations. For that, lenders blame lawmakers, the Treasury Department and SBA for how the program was designed and implemented.

This overview of lenders’ frustrations with the coronavirus loan initiative is based on more than a dozen interviews with bank executives, industry lobbyists and government officials. Most asked not to be named to speak candidly about their experiences.
All banks have been doing, they say, is handing out the money. Under the $2 trillion Cares Act passed by Congress in March, the loans are guaranteed by the SBA and meant to be forgiven as long as they are used to pay workers, mortgage interest, rent and utilities.

Big banks know they aren’t likely to get much sympathy for their complaints, especially when mom-and-pop businesses are struggling to survive. And some of Wall Street’s pain has been self-inflected by moves like aiding well-heeled clients before customers with smaller accounts.
Bankers’ Fees
In addition, the 5,000 or so banks working on the SBA effort are being paid for their work, though there is dispute about whether it will end up being a profitable venture. Wells Fargo has said it plans to donate its fees to nonprofits that serve small businesses, and JPMorgan said Friday that it doesn’t intend to make any money off of PPP.
Still, the industry’s collective fees could run into the billions of dollars, said Marcus (NYSE:MCS) Stanley, policy director at Americans for Financial Reform, a Washington-based group often critical of Wall Street banks. That should have motivated banks to be more thoughtful in distributing funds, rather than prioritizing their profitable existing clients, he said.Many of the program’s issues have arisen at the SBA, an understaffed agency that has never faced such a massive job. In fiscal 2019, for example, it approved just $28 billion of loans. The flood of applicants wreaked havoc on the agency’s software, often causing loan processing to grind to a halt.
During the second round of funding, the SBA also restricted banks to sending in 350 applications an hour, a requirement that’s not ideal for large lenders whose systems can push through applications much faster in greater volumes. Alongside that requirement, the SBA said banks could submit batches of thousands of loans, which the largest firms did take advantage of.
‘Frustrating Pace’
It turns out the 350-application limit was an ambitious goal at times. Wells Fargo’s head of small business, Steve Troutner, said in an internal memo Tuesday that his bank had been able to submit just 80 applications per hour. “While that pace is more than a little frustrating for us all to see, we’ve heard from peers across the industry and they are seeing similar or worse response rates,” he wrote.
The industry also noted that SBA and the Treasury issued more than a dozen revisions to the program –- many while loans were going out the door. And the agencies refused to take some industry suggestions -- like relaxing required anti-money laundering checks -- that slowed lending and made it challenging for banks to service anything but existing customers.
Privately, much banker scorn has been directed at Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. They say he spurred a massive rush for loans by deeming them first-come, first-served and set unreasonable expectations for many businesses by repeatedly saying there was enough money in the program after Congress passed a second round of funding. Lenders in contrast suspected that the money would run dry. By Friday afternoon, however, banks were more optimistic that they could serve all applicants.
A Treasury spokesman pointed out that any revisions or lack of guidance didn’t stop the PPP program from providing some $350 billion in loans in the first two weeks it was operational. The SBA is continuing to quickly process requests and has enough money to fund large batches of loans sent in by the big banks, the spokesman added, noting that overall the program is expected to aid 60 million workers.
Shamed Companies
As the rules kept changing, banks and their lawyers began fielding anxious requests from large public companies that wanted to give money back because they were being shamed on social media. The public fury contributed to the SBA’s decision to kick all but the smallest banks out of the program on Wednesday for several hours.
“With the SBA blocking nearly 800 banks, relief for potentially thousands of small business owners and their employees will be delayed,” Financial Services Forum President Kevin Fromer, whose group represents the chief executive officers of Wall Street lenders, warned in a statement. “A better solution would be a fully operational system that allows banks of all sizes to provide support to Main Street.”
To be sure, the largest lenders do point to some successes from the program. JPMorgan announced Friday that it has secured $29 billion in funding for over 239,000 small businesses. Bank of America said in a memo earlier this week that it sent 184,000 applications at the start of the second round, while Wells Fargo said it sent over 100,000.
But with that activity has come scrutiny. Prominent Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jack Reed of Rhode Island have called for probes and audits. Reed, in a statement this week, said he was “outraged” over reports banks had prioritized big customers and large-dollar loans to win higher fees.
Investigations, Lawsuits
In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey wrote directly to the CEOs of  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) SA’s U.S. business, Wells Fargo, Bank of America and TD Bank, after hearing similar complaints. She asked for details on how the loans were handed out and what types and sizes of businesses received funding.
JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo have all been sued by small businesses who say they were shut out because the lenders cherry-picked clients seeking large loans in processing applications. The Department of Justice has also launched a preliminary investigation into borrower fraud. While banks aren’t the targets, the development will likely add to their headaches.

Facing so much heat, some bankers now wish they had tried to stay clear of the Paycheck Protection Program. They also say the Trump administration probably should have used a more direct approach, providing money to deserving businesses through the Internal Revenue Service, much like the relief checks that went out to tens of millions of Americans.
Using the IRS “would have been much better,” said Consumer Bankers President Hunt.

Investing – The Dow ended the week on a sour note, as investor sentiment was rocked by fresh U.S.-China worries as President Donald Trump threatened action against Beijing over the Covid-19 pandemic.
The {{169|Dow Jones Industrial Average}} fell 2.55%, the S&P 500 lost 2.81%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.2%.
Trump suggested that his administration could place tariffs on China or cancel part of its debt obligations to Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus, claiming to have evidence showing the virus had originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
The threat of new tariffs on China stoked investor jitters about a fresh U.S.-China trade war, overshadowing some of recent optimism over the partial reopening of the U.S.
The lockdown measures to contain the outbreak have wreaked havoc on the economy, wiping out all the jobs created since the financial crisis and pushing the economy to contract by more 4% in the first quarter, with fears running high that a prolonged recession looms.
With a vaccine still at the minimum months away, drugmakers are in a race against time to produce Covid-19 treatments that can support efforts to get the wheels of the economy turning once again, with Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD) remdesivir leading the pack.
The Food and Drug Administration granted the drug emergency use authorization, President Donald Trump said Friday, according to CNBC.
The latest data on manufacturing activity, however, was better than feared, though the sector continued to remain in contraction.
The impact of the virus has also been evident across quarterly earnings reports as companies have pulled guidance, citing coronavirus-led uncertainty.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 7.4% after the e-commerce giant late Thursday reported lower first-quarter earnings and said it expected an operating loss of $1.5 billion to an operating income of $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to a jump in Covid-19-related expenses.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, fell 1.6%, after reporting flat revenue growth and ditching its custom of proving guidance for the June.
Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) slumped 11.4% after the manufacturer reported a decline in quarterly earnings and revenue.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the biggest decliners, shrugging off a climb in oil prices as major oil-producing countries got their agreed output cuts underway in a bid to offset falling demand.
Elsewhere, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) slumped 10.2% after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that the stock price was ""too high."" The remark comes just days after the electric automaker reported a surprise quarterly profit."

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (SA:EMBR3) may obtain credit lines between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from the country's development bank, BNDES, and other lenders after a deal to sell its commercial aircraft division to Boeing (N:BA) fell through, two sources close to the matter said on Friday.
Proceeds from the loan would be used as working capital and export finance, the sources said, asking for anonymity because the negotiations remain private. Embraer may also be included in a relief program for national airlines affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, they said. 
Last week, Boeing announced the cancellation of a 2017 agreement to buy control of Embraer's commercial jets division for $4.2 billion, raising doubts about the Brazilian company's future and motivating it to commence arbitration proceedings against the U.S. company.
""Embraer was not contemplated in our efforts to help the airline industry. ... Then there was the issue with Boeing and it became a candidate"" for support, one of the sources told Reuters.
The source said there is consensus among a bank syndicate including the BNDES that Embraer would be eligible for financial aid, noting talks are in an early stage.
Having a dispersed ownership structure, the loan structure could involve an instrument that is convertible into company stock, the source said.
BNDES and Embraer declined to comment. 
When Boeing canceled the agreement, Embraer had stated the company would adopt measures to preserve liquidity and keep a solid financial position, alluding to ""turbulent times.""

Embraer's commercial aviation chief executive, John Slattery, on Friday said the company had incurred pain and costs in separating jetliners from defense and business-jet activities in preparation for the deal with Boeing, including a loss of deliveries in January.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",Fund managers fish for dividend plays amid sharp cuts,"By David Randall
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some dividend fund managers are wading back into the shares of battered railroad stocks, energy companies and other economically sensitive, cyclical names, even as a host of companies have slashed their payouts. 
Cyclical stocks were among the worst-hit S&P 500 sectors in March's sell-off, with the group (SPLRCD) losing as much as 33% from its highs amid fears that a coronavirus-fueled economic slowdown will deal an outsized blow to companies' businesses. 
More than 15 companies in the benchmark S&P 500 - many of them cyclical names - have either suspended or cut their dividends in the last four weeks. On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell PLC (L:RDSa) cut its payout for the first time since World War Two as part of a plan to save $30 billion to help it weather an unprecedented decline in oil demand. 
Yet some managers of divided funds - which seek to give their clients exposure to a steady stream of income - believe the beaten-down sector may hold companies that are likely to keep their dividends intact and see their share prices rise. The sector has rebounded 28.5% from its March lows, compared with 26.3% for the S&P 500. 
""The initial moves were very emotionally based and now we're getting back to fundamentals,"" said Scott Davis, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments who oversees $24 billion in income strategies. ""There is still going to be volatility but we think you can pick your spots."" 
Davis has recently added to positions such as  Home Depot  Inc (N:HD),  Chevron  Corp (N:CVX) and  Union Pacific  Corp (N:UNP) that have attractive free cash flows despite being in industries that have been among the hardest-hit by the slowdown. Both companies offer a dividend yield of approximately 2.5%. 
Companies like Walmart Inc (N:WMT) and Home Depot that have free cash flow growth above 6% will likely be able to invest and grow their market shares during a recession, while those such as Macy's Inc (N:M) could end up in bankruptcy, he said. 
""I have a feeling that some of those trends that were already in play will only get accelerated,"" said Davis. 
U.K. and European companies will likely cut dividends more than their U.S. counterparts, which are more likely to reduce share buybacks first, said Mark Peden, investment manager, Equities, at Kames Capital. 
Companies like cruise line operator Carnival Corp (N:CCL) and British retailer Marks and Spencer Group PLC (L:MKS) likely will not restore their dividends to previous levels, but other companies will want to increase theirs as early as possible to demonstrate their financial health, he said. 
While dividend-paying stocks may provide the cushion of a payout, their dividends - and share prices - could be in jeopardy if a subsequent wave of the virus deals another blow to growth by forcing countries to reinstate or extend lockdown measures. 
Analysts at BofA Global Research urged investors to focus on companies whose dividends are likely to be secure, rather than comparatively rich.
""The massive economic disruption brought on by COVID-19 questions the sustainability of dividends,"" the bank's analysts wrote.
At the same time, historically low borrowing costs have prompted many companies without strong balance sheets to initiate dividends since the end of the 2008 financial crisis, noted Linda Bakhshian, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes (NYSE:FHI). 
While many of those companies will be forced to cut their dividends, cash-rich firms in growing sectors like healthcare and technology are the most likely to maintain or even increase their payouts through what could be a painful recession ahead, she said. 
""You're going to see soon which companies are going to come out of this on the other side stronger,"" she said.

Investing.com – The Dow declined on Friday, paced by declines in Amazon and Apple, after their earnings reports failed to live up to investor expectations, and fresh worries over U.S.-China tensions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.37%, the S&P 500 lost 2.76%, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 3.07%.
With many seeing the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic in the rearview mirror, investors sentiment was dealt a blow as President Donald Trump renewed the prospect of a fresh U.S.-China conflict.  
Trump insisted Beijing would be held accountable for its role in the pandemic after alleging that the virus originated from a lab in China.
White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told CNBC there was ""no question"" Trump would follow through on his threat.
On the earnings front, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) fell 6.6% after the e-commerce giant late Thursday reported lower first-quarter earnings and said it expected an operating loss of $1.5 billion to an operating income of $1.5 billion in the second quarter due to a jump in Covid-19-related expenses.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), meanwhile, fell 1%, after reporting flat revenue growth. It did not offer guidance for the June quarter, citing coronavirus uncertainty.
Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL), meanwhile, slumped 10% after the manufacturer reported a decline in quarterly earnings and revenue.
Energy stocks, meanwhile, were among the biggest decliners, shrugging off a climb in oil prices as major oil-producing countries got their agreed output cuts underway in a bid to offset falling demand.

1273,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",Tesla tumbles after Musk tweets stock too high,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) tumbled 9% on Friday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the electric carmaker's high-flying stock was overly expensive.
""Tesla stock price is too high,"" Musk said on Twitter in one of several unusual messages, including ones quoting parts of the U.S. national anthem and that he would sell almost all his physical possessions. 
The subsequent share drop erased around $13 billion from Tesla's market value and nearly $3 billion from the value of Musk's stake. Still, shares remain up almost 50% from the start of April.
More than two hours after the tweets began, Tesla had not responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk had responded to an email asking whether he was joking or whether his tweet was vetted by saying, ""No"".
Musk has a history of sending provocative tweets. In August 2018, he tweeted that he had secured funding to possibly take Tesla private at a big premium, which led a fraud case by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk settled by agreeing to pay $20 million and have a Tesla lawyer pre-screen tweets with important information about the company.
Last month, a federal judge said Tesla and Musk must face a lawsuit by shareholders over the going-private tweet, including a claim that Musk intended to defraud them.
In April 2019 Musk tweeted, ""My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point.""
""We view these Musk comments as tongue in cheek and it’s Elon being Elon. It’s certainty a headache for investors for him to venture into this area as his tweeting remains a hot button issue and the Street clearly is frustrated,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives said by email. 
Tesla's stock has surged in recent weeks, but is down since Wednesday after the company reported an unexpected quarterly profit, despite manufacturing interruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Musk's latest tweets follow others this week. On Tesla's quarterly conference call on Wednesday, he called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak ""fascist"". Those restrictions have forced Tesla to shutter its car plant in Fremont, California.
""Musk has recently expressed some strong and, at times, controversial, views on COVID-19 and some elements of the response to the crisis and we believe is attempting to use his broad following and visibility to bring attention to some economic factors that he believes may be overlooked,""  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a client note on Friday.
Musk's iconoclastic stance has helped him attract over 33 million followers on Twitter and is seen as a marketing boon for Tesla.

Tesla's recent rally has put Musk on the verge of a payday of over $700 million. The six-month average of Tesla's market capitalization is just short of $100 billion, a target that would trigger the vesting of a tranche of options granted to Musk to buy 1.69 million shares as part of his two-year-old pay package.

1274,By Investing.com,"<span>May 01, 2020 02:19PM ET</span>","Amazon Down, but Not Out, as Wall Street Backs Stock to Shine","By Yasin Ebrahim
Investing – Amazon is nursing heavy losses on Friday after warning it would spend its entire second-quarter profit on Covid-19 related expenses, but that has done little to drown out the optimism from several Wall Street analysts who upgraded their outlook on the e-commerce giant.
""While we expect heightened investments related to Covid-19 to compress margins for the remainder of 2020, the pandemic will likely accelerate several trends benefiting Amazon over the long term, including eCommerce, cloud computing, and digital advertising,"" Canaccord said in a note as it upgraded its price target on the stock to $2,750 from $2,600.
Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was down 7%.
The company said it would spend its entire second-quarter profit – expected to be in about $4 billion –  on Covid-19 related expenses and forecast operating income will range from a loss of $1.5 billion to a profit of $1.5 billion.
But there were plenty of positives to take from the quarterly report, according to Canaccord.
Amazon Web Services has been the company’s golden goose for many a quarter and grew revenue 33% in the quarter year on year, just below consensus, but margin expanded to its highest level since the third quarter of 2018.
The e-commerce giant's venture into advertising to rival Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has also garnered attention, with other revenue, which primarily consists of advertising revenue, growing 44% year on year during the first quarter, a trend which is likely to continue.
""While management observed a modest pullback of ad spend in March due to Covid-19, the company continues to take share of digital ad spend globally,"" Canaccord added.
Others on Wall Street echoed the bull case on Amazon, with UBS and Susquenna raising their price targets on Amazon to $3,000 from $2,440 and $2,500 respectively."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said on Friday that the U.S. Small Business Administration gave it the green light to make $15 billion in new loans to some 211,000 business customers hurt by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
The largest U.S. bank said it expects to process a total of $29 billion in loans for around 239,000 customers as part of the government's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The average of these loans is for $123,000, according to a press release. 
Congress gave the Small Business Administration (SBA) nearly $660 billion over the past two months for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans that businesses hurt by the epidemic could apply for at participating banks.
Faced with high demand from many of the country's roughly 30 million small businesses, the program's success was hindered by technology failures, a lack of clarity on the rules and paperwork required, and by banks' struggles to quickly launch platforms to process the high volume of loan requests.
""Thousands of dedicated (staff) worked tirelessly over the past 30+ days to support the federal government in one of the largest and most ambitious emergency lending facilities in history,"" JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement.
Big banks have faced criticism from policymakers for approving loans to businesses considered to be at the larger end of the small businesses range. This fueled concerns that the program's funds would be exhausted before smaller, needier companies could apply.
Congress attempted to address this concern this week by ring-fencing $30 billion for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. But pent-up demand meant those funds were exhausted by Tuesday.
For its part, JPMorgan said on Friday that half of the PPP loans it processed went to companies with fewer than 5 employees, and 75% of the loans were for less than $100,000. 
""We've followed (the government's) direction to deploy this relief as quickly as possible and agree with their tightening of eligibility requirements so that funding goes to those that need it most,"" Chief Executive of Chase Business Banking Jennifer Roberts said in a statement.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Jetmaker Embraer focuses on future after Boeing divorce 'pain',"By Tim Hepher and Marcelo Rochabrun
PARIS/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The head of Embraer's (SA:EMBR3) commercial aircraft unit defended the benefits of a $4.2 billion tie-up abandoned by  Boeing Co  (N:BA) last week, but said the Brazilian aerospace group was focusing on its future as a re-united company.
Commercial Aviation Chief Executive John Slattery said Embraer had incurred pain and costs in separating jetliners from defence and business-jet activities in preparation for the merger, including a loss of deliveries in January. 
He declined to comment on an arbitration process Embraer launched after Boeing abruptly cancelled the deal on Saturday.
Speaking in a webinar hosted by Aviation Week, Slattery said he was convinced the commercial aerospace partnership with Boeing would have provided ""extraordinary benefits"" to airline customers who had expressed disappointment at its collapse.
Boeing has said Embraer failed to meet conditions for closing the deal.
Slattery said Embraer was burning cash but had capacity to raise more if needed. ""I am not concerned about liquidity.""
It was the first public appearance by the company's commercial boss since the deal collapsed in acrimony.
The breakdown, first reported by Reuters, has captured the attention of an industry already facing its worst crisis over the drop in travel caused by the coronavirus pandemic, with 2,000 people tuning into the previously arranged webinar.
Slattery quipped that the audience was dominated by lawyers from each side as the two companies head for what is widely expected to be a bitter divorce case.
Embraer carved out its commercial unit and shut activities for 40 days in preparation for folding it into a new venture to be 80% owned by Boeing.
It also invested $30 million on a new headquarters for the remaining core of the Brazilian aerospace champion.
Slattery said the carve-out had resulted in some duplication between core Embraer and its commercial spin-off, but that the world's third largest plane-maker would rebound as ""one Embraer"". 
ARBITRATION ROW
The arbitration is expected to involve fierce debate over Brazilian claims that a tie-up cost Embraer spin-off costs and lost sales for its E2 against the Airbus A220, a Canadian-designed jet acquired from Embraer's historic rival, Bombardier (OTC:BDRBF).
Analysts say Boeing is expected to argue that Embraer needed to carry out reorganisation to prepare for potential alliances and that it failed to invest enough in the commercial arm.
Neither company agreed to comment on the case.
Slattery played up future demand for the E2, a regional jet sitting below the Boeing 737 MAX, as airlines turn post-crisis to smaller, less financially risky models.
Southeast Asia, one of the top markets for giants Boeing and Airbus, could see a move to such jets, he said.
Top aircraft buyers had backed the Boeing tie-up, saying Embraer lacked deep enough pockets to compete alone with Airbus, which can discount other jets to win A220 sales.
Brazil's government, which used to own Embraer and is its top military client, has suggested China could be a potential new partner for Embraer, even though several senior Brazilian government figures have attacked Beijing over the pandemic.
Slattery said Embraer had not initiated talks with anyone, but that he could not ""legislate for the inbound calls that could come"". The board will study next moves ""in a very thoughtful way,"" he added.
Tentative plans for a new regional turboprop to compete with Europe's ATR (PA:AIR) (MI:LDOF), half-owned by Airbus, are no longer a priority because of the current crisis, Slattery said.
While the airliner's business case looked strong, he said, ""it is hard to consider a new programme in this environment"".

The prop plane joins other planemaker projects on the back-burner as the health crisis dents balance sheets.

1280,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2020 01:18PM ET</span>",Charting the Global Economy: ‘Contraction’ Becomes Common Theme,"(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic is shutting the lights off for the global economy.
The health crisis has morphed into economic catastrophe for Europe. The sum of all goods and services produced in the U.S. shrank the most since the last recession and a gauge of factory output last month was the worst in the post-World War II era, data this week showed.
Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week, offering insight into the latest developments in the global economy:
U.S.
The record-long expansion of the world’s largest economy is all but officially over as the government’s initial estimate of first-quarter gross domestic product showed a 4.8% annualized rate of contraction. While that’s the weakest performance since 2008, the current quarter is likely to be much worse.
The April Institute for Supply Management manufacturing survey underscores the economy’s rapid descent at the start of the second quarter. A measure of factory output plummeted to the worst in records back to 1948, while the purchasing managers group’s employment gauge dropped to an almost 71-year low.
Europe
The euro-area economy plunged into a record contraction, an outcome that will only add more urgency to controversial demands for joint government fiscal support.
France’s economy is set to shrink by 8.6% this year in Bloomberg Economics’ central forecast, and that assumes the pandemic is brought under control and government support limits any lasting damage. The real danger is that the administration does too little or that support fails to reach those who need it, weoghing on GDP and pushinh up debt.
Asia
China’s first official data for April suggest the economy has split into two tracks, with a domestic rebound undercut by weak overseas demand.
The Bank of Japan took further action Thursday to reduce its large-scale buying of stock funds crowding out private investors.
Emerging Markets
More African central banks joined the global rate-cutting trend this week, with Guinea, South Sudan, Rwanda and Botswana easing for the first time in 2020. Zimbabwe reduced borrowing costs for the second time this year and Kenya for the third time.
Turkey’s central bank lowered its inflation expectations for the end of this year, opening up more space for additional interest-rate cuts as policy makers seek to prop up the economy at the risk of weakening the lira.
World
The world economy is entering a new stage of the coronavirus crisis as governments inch toward easing restrictions. It’s a phase that entails stark trade-offs between economic growth and risking another wave of infections and death.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 12:55PM ET</span>",Auto suppliers warn Michigan on new delays in resuming production,"By David Shepardson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Major U.S. auto suppliers told Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer they are ready to restart production and raised alarm about new delays to resuming operations.
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, most auto suppliers halted operations in late March as automakers closed their factories. Now uncertainty about when Michigan will allow the resumption of operations is causing delays throughout the U.S. auto industry.
The Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association and Original Equipment Suppliers Association told Whitmer in a letter late on Thursday seen by Reuters that ""delays in re-opening facilities would increase liquidity risk for suppliers and jeopardize long-term capital investment and employment for Michigan.""
The group asked Whitmer ""to provide clear authority for automotive suppliers to restart their operations in Michigan at least five days before OEM production begins.""
Auto suppliers in Michigan employ about 125,000 people and are generally paid 45 days after production. Automotive industry executives say that means some smaller suppliers are in danger of running out of money in the coming weeks.
Earlier this week, both Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) pushed back the planned resumption of U.S. auto production and cited auto supplier issues as a factor.
Whitmer's office did not immediately comment but she has held regular talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union and top executives of Detroit's Big Three automakers, officials say.
U.S. automakers hope to begin production as early as May 18, which would mean auto suppliers would need the green light to resume operations on May 11. The letter said the ""Michigan supplier community is ready to re-start and we are committed to working with your Administration to build public confidence in our ability to safely reopen our places of business.""
The UAW said last week that it was ""too soon and too risky"" to reopen auto plants in early May.
The letter noted the dependence of U.S. auto production on Michigan-based suppliers.
""Vehicle manufacturers throughout the country and the world depend on parts and components manufactured in Michigan. Because of this integration, Michigan suppliers are a vital link to the industry’s economic recovery,"" the letter said.

It included a list of chief executives of auto suppliers and senior executives from the North American-units of foreign firms supporting the requests including  Continental AG  (DE:CONG), BorgWarner (N:BWA), American Axle (N:AXL),  Lear  Corp (N:LEA), Magna International (TO:MG), Denso Corp (T:6902), Robert Bosch LLC, Nexteer Automotive (HK:1316) and LG Electronics USA (KS:066570).

1282,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2020 12:54PM ET</span>",Buy-and-Hold Investors Pull Record From ETFs During Epic Rally,"(Bloomberg) -- After hanging tough throughout this year’s historic market swings, long-term investors pulled the plug on ETFs last month as stocks rallied the most in three decades.
Those exchange-traded funds suffered an almost $4.5 billion exodus in April -- the first monthly drawdown in six years and the most since at least 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nearly $3 billion left the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, or VOO, in the span as the U.S. equity benchmark soared more than 12%. It was the first withdrawal for the $133 billion fund since October.
During the furious sell-off in stocks last quarter amid the coronavirus pandemic, many retail buyers kept their faith in the market. As the S&P 500 bottomed on March 23, mom-and-pop darling VOO enjoyed three weeks of inflows. Since then, the trend has shifted -- with the fund seeing withdrawals week after week.
“The recent price recovery in VOO and other low-cost equity ETFs has provided them an opportunity to reduce their risk profile and take some profits if they are concerned that the impact of Covid-19 proves even larger,” said Todd Rosenbluth, the New York-based head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.
Read: ‘It’s Like Gambling’: Tiny Investors Win Big in Stock Recovery
A flood of retail investors, although tiny individually, have collectively helped boost the rebound in stocks, with E*Trade Financial (NASDAQ:ETFC) Corp., TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) Holding Corp. and  Charles Schwab  (NYSE:SCHW) Corp. seeing record sign-ups in the three months ending in March.
After the solid inflows, the recent withdrawals could also signal that ETF investors are rebalancing into bonds -- with some profit-taking, noted Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.
“Taking a little out of risk and putting into bonds would have been giving up if it were done mid-March,” he said. “Doing it now smells more like rebalancing either by models or advisers.”

1283,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>","McDonald's to reopen 15 outlets in UK this month, fast food fans relieved","(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) said it would reopen 15 restaurants in the United Kingdom this month, only for delivery, leaving some fast food fans cheering.
The company said it would announce the locations of the restaurants next week, with plans to open them on May 13. 
The new restaurants will employ stringent social distancing measures, including having perspex screens and floor markings to separate employees working in close quarters and temperature tests on arrival, McDonald's Chief Executive Officer for UK and Ireland, Paul Pomroy said in a statement.
The restaurants will have a limited menu and would not be serving its popular breakfast items to reduce complexities that arise in kitchens on changing menus from breakfast to lunch.
""When we return it will be different as we all adjust to this new normal,"" Pomroy said, adding that the company was working hard towards opening more restaurants but at the ""right pace"" with the wellbeing of employees, suppliers and customers being front of mind. 
The news comes just three days after the world's largest restaurant chain denied a report that it would reopen some outlets in May, but confirmed that it was testing out a new restaurant model where social distancing measures were properly enforced.
It also follows moves by rivals such as KFC, Burger King and Pret-a-Manger, which reopened some locations for delivery in late-April.
However, on Thursday, bakery chain Greggs reversed its decision to reopen about 20 outlets after it stoked a social media frenzy, which led to fears of overcrowding.
McDonald's UK restaurants closed on March 24, with social media rife with images of long snaking lines of people queuing outside of restaurants trying to score their last Big Mac ahead of a three-week lockdown, that has since been extended. 
On Friday, McDonald's UK's tweet about the reopening had already garnered nearly 2,000 likes, with users anxious to know if their neighbourhood outlet would be one of the 15 reopening. 
""How do we know which ones are opening?"", Twitter user Joanne(@jo_Emma) of Birmingham, UK asked, while there were several other questions related to the opening locations in London.
Though some were disappointed that the limited offering didn't offer breakfast items, some were happy that they were just reopening.

""(It's) Better than nothing, don't moan about it,"" Twitter user Claire Willicombe (@bearthegooner) tweeted in response.

1289,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Britain hires Morgan Stanley to advise on aviation rescue plan, sources say","By Clara Denina and Pamela Barbaglia
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has turned to  Morgan Stanley  for advice on a package of measures to keep its airlines in business during the coronavirus crisis, after warnings that the industry might implode, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The Wall Street investment bank, originally drafted in to handle a possible bailout of Virgin Atlantic, has been awarded a broader mandate to examine ways to support the entire airline sector in Britain, the sources said.
""The situation was more complicated than expected,"" the second source said, adding that any bailout of Virgin Atlantic might prompt other airlines to request state aid.
Morgan Stanley's expanded role comes as British Airways-owner IAG (L:ICAG) began a sweeping restructuring and the boss of London Heathrow Airport's boss warned that Britain risks destroying its aviation sector by not propping up airlines as countries such as the United States and France have done.
Airlines around the world are struggling with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, with some such as Germany's Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) seeking urgent state assistance as air travel has been brought to a virtual standstill, threatening thousands of jobs.
""We have been clear that we are prepared to enter discussions with individual companies seeking bespoke support as a last resort,"" a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said of British airlines which have exhausted other funding measures to cope with the crisis.
Morgan Stanley (N:MS) declined to comment, while Treasury representatives were not immediately available to comment on the investment bank's appointment.
Global airline losses from the coronavirus pandemic are estimated at $314 billion, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates.
Virgin Atlantic, which is 51% owned by billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Group and 49% by U.S. airline Delta (N:DAL), has warned it will only survive if it gets state aid, while its staff have taken a temporary wage reduction.
Johnson's government has so far been wary of bailing out travel companies and in March let regional carrier Flybe collapse, marking one of the first big corporate casualties of the coronavirus outbreak.
'CONSTRUCTIVE' TALKS
Morgan Stanley is working closely with Rothschild, which won a similar government mandate earlier this year to handle talks with airlines and other British companies bearing the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic, the sources said.
Any bailout of Virgin Atlantic would only come after all other possibilities, including a sale, had been fully explored, one of the sources said.
A spokeswoman for Virgin Atlantic said it was exploring all available options to obtain additional external credit, adding it was working with Houlihan Lokey (NYSE:HLI) on private sector funding and ongoing discussions with stakeholders were ""constructive"".
Meanwhile, Branson and the Virgin Group were committed to the airline and were not looking to sell it, a representative for the group said on Friday.
But if no bailout is granted and Virgin Atlantic ends up collapsing, then the government will need to review the competitive landscape on transatlantic flights as British Airways would emerge as a winner, another source said.
Virgin Atlantic has increased its routes between London and North America over the past few years to win more U.S. customers and boost profitability.
British Airways' parent company IAG warned it may cut up to 12,000 jobs after reporting an operating loss before exceptional items of 535 million euros for the first quarter, but ruled out any plan to ask the British Treasury for state support. 

However, IAG's Spanish airlines Iberia and Vueling have taken a different path and on Friday secured 1 billion euros of government-backed loans.

1295,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>","Think Wall Street's back to normal? Not so fast, options markets say","By April Joyner
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Options investors are preparing for more volatility ahead despite last month's sharp rebound in U.S. stocks, reflecting doubts that markets will be quick to return to their former highs in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Market turbulence has plunged alongside stocks' climb since late March, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as ""Wall Street's fear gauge,"" last at 37.19 on Friday after peaking above 80 in mid-March. The S&P 500 (SPX) rose 12.7% in April, its biggest monthly percentage gain since 1987, and has climbed more than 27% from its March 23 closing low.
In another bullish sign, the front end of the S&P 500 volatility term structure, which plots volatility expectations over time, is no longer inverted, suggesting that worries over a near-term stock reversal are subsiding.
But while the lightning-quick rebound has taken the S&P to within 16% of its all-time high, some investors are betting market gyrations may return in coming months as the economic consequences of the coronavirus become more apparent. Those wagers run counter to the expectations of more bullish market participants, who believe stocks are unlikely to revisit their March lows. 
""There's more systemic risk being priced, which would be more consistent with concerns over an economic recession,"" said Benjamin Bowler, global head of equity derivatives research at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).
Expectations of more volatility to come are partially reflected in the VIX, which is still comparatively high - the index stood at less than half its current level in late February, before worries over the coronavirus's spread outside of China shattered a months-long period of relative market calm.
And medium- and long-term VIX futures have risen over the past month, indicating that investors expect markets to remain volatile despite April's dramatic rally. 
Such longer-term volatility would be consistent with past global crises, when markets were hit with multiple waves of selling over many months, investors said. 
""To us, it doesn't feel like a true risk-on-type environment,"" said Matt Thompson, managing partner at options firm Thompson Capital Management.
Possible triggers for such turbulence run the gamut from a resurgence in cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, signs that the U.S. economy has taken a worse-than-expected hit from shutdowns across the country, or political risk tied to the U.S. presidential election later this year. 
Investors are also continuing to hoard put options, used for downside protection, despite the market rally. Over the past few weeks, skew, a measure of demand for puts versus calls, which are used for upside positioning, has risen on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (P:SPY), a popular exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P 500.
Volatility markets are behaving similarly to past global economic shocks, such as the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 and the Greek debt crisis of 2011, Thompson said. The S&P 500 took about 10 months to return to its 2011 highs after the Greek debt crisis and more than five years to mark fresh record highs after the global financial crisis. 

""Going back to the financial crisis, a VIX of 20 or 30 was relatively normal,"" said Jon Cherry, head of options at  Northern Trust  (NASDAQ:NTRS) Capital Markets. ""That's the neighborhood we live in today.""

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Big Macs delivered on meal trolleys, hand sanitizers at the entrance and designated waiting spots to separate customers could become a feature of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) restaurants in the Netherlands when they are allowed to reopen. 
In a trial at a restaurant in the city of Arnhem, McDonald's has been looking for ways to maintain social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is relaxed.
""We have tried to figure out how to keep our customers and employees safe, while maintaining a restaurant atmosphere,"" McDonald's Netherlands spokeswoman Eunice Koekkoek told Reuters.
""These are drastic changes, but we hope to make them in a way that customers don't notice them too much.""
Restaurants, bars and other public places in the Netherlands have been closed since March 15. As of Friday, 39,791 coronavirus cases had been confirmed with 4,893 deaths.
But new infections have been dropping, prompting calls to loosen the lockdown after its current deadline of May 19.
A decision on whether to reopen restaurants and bars is expected around May 12, but Prime Minister Mark Rutte has ruled out a return to normal.
If they do reopen, they will have to keep customers and staff at least 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart to avoid a new wave of infections.
McDonald's says it could introduce table service, with burgers and fries wheeled to customers on trolleys from which they can pick up their orders. 
Other new features would include hand-washing stations at the entrance and a host behind a plastic screen showing customers their place in line.
Many restaurant owners in the Netherlands fear social distancing will simply put them out of business.
But McDonald's expects its new set-up will work at 180 larger restaurants out of its 252 franchises in the country.
""On average this will allow us to serve around 66% of our normal number of customers,"" Koekkoek said.
""We don't expect reopening to be allowed before June. But even then, we will move in steps. Readjusting 180 restaurants is a tall order."" 
About three quarters of McDonald's 39,000 restaurants worldwide were operational as of Thursday, including almost all its nearly 14,000 outlets in the United States, where drive-throughs are common.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower Friday, consolidating after record gains in April, hurt by President Donald Trump threatening new tariffs on China in retaliation for the coronavirus crisis. Disappointments from tech giants Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also weighed.
Trump said late on Thursday his trade deal with China, the first phase having been signed only in January, was now of secondary importance to the pandemic, which he blames Beijing for.
White House NEC Director Larry Kudlow played down the likelihood on tariffs in the near term, saying in a CNBC interview that he doesn't believe there will be a ""rush"" to slap China with tariffs, but he wants them to be held accountable.
By 9:40 AM ET (1340 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 425 points, or 1.75%, while the S&P 500 was down 2%. The Nasdaq Composite underperformed, losing 2.1%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 posted their best monthly gains since 1987 in April, and the Nasdaq Composite booked its best month since 2000.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock was down 4.9% after the e-commerce behemoth said it would spend its entire second-quarter profit, seen at around $4 billion, on Covid-19 related expenses. 
CEO Jeff Bezos was unapologetic, saying ""if you're a shareowner in Amazon, you may want to take a seat because we're not thinking small.""
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell 1.8% after failing to provide an earnings forecast given the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus, the first time it has done so in more than a decade. 
Honeywell (NYSE:HON) stock fell 3.7% after the aero supplier became the latest in the sector to pull its 2020 outlook on weak demand.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock fell 2.8% after posting its first quarterly loss following its 1999 merger, driven by a $2.9 billion charge linked to writedowns from the collapse in oil prices, while rival oil giant  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) stock fell 2.2% pledging to further slash spending."

1310,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Long lines, lots of kids, and plenty to touch: How does Disney reopen its parks?","By Helen Coster and Lisa Richwine
(Reuters) - For a glimpse at how  Disney  recovers from the coronavirus pandemic, look no further than Shanghai, where the entertainment giant has staged a limited reopening of Shanghai Disney Resort. Adults, kids and senior citizens wear masks while wandering among staff and security guards who carry contact-less thermometers and hand sanitizer.
As some U.S. states lift stay-at-home orders, investors and park fans are watching to see how Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) Co -- which makes a third of its revenue from parks, experiences and products -- reimagines the “happiest place on earth” for a world altered by the coronavirus. 
The high-touch, high-volume, kid-centered nature of the parks, and Disney’s need to prevent damage to a brand synonymous with safety and families, will make reopening difficult, experts said. 
Disney’s ability to reopen its parks in Asia, the United States and France will also be a powerful signal about how the world can get back to a semblance of normal as it deals with COVID-19.
""This is the greatest challenge that the industry has ever faced,"" said Phil Hettema, founder of The Hettema Group, which designs theme park rides and other experiences. 
Disney, which has not announced any plans to reopen the parks, declined to comment for this story. 
Executive Chairman Bob Iger recently said checking guests’ temperature could become routine at Disney park entrances. Among other plans under consideration, according to a source briefed on Disney’s thinking: Rides like the Space Mountain roller coaster could stagger guests in each “rocket” to enforce social distancing. Guests could be notified via app or another technology when they can go on a ride or in a restaurant to eliminate lines. 
Staffers, known as cast members, and guests could be required to wear masks. But in true Disney fashion, employees' masks would be fun, not scary, the source said.
Disney on Thursday began online sales of face masks featuring Mickey Mouse, Baby Yoda and other characters and said up to $1 million in profits would go to charity. 
Masks, now worn commonly across China, are ubiquitous in the shopping district outside Shanghai Disney, where workers disinfect a playground for 5- to 12-year-olds at noon and 3 p.m. daily. Temperature checks are mandated by local regulations, according to Shanghai Disney's website. 
Business and political leaders in Florida, home to Walt Disney World, have floated ideas such as limiting capacity at all theme parks during an initial re-opening phase.
The question that health experts and financial analysts are asking is whether any of these measures will be enough to protect employees, guests or Disney’s bottom line. 
Social distancing could come at a steep price.
In April, UBS downgraded its rating on Disney and lowered its division profit estimates to $500 million in fiscal 2020 and just $200 million in 2021 compared to $6.8 billion in 2019.
Disney parks need to be running at roughly 50% of capacity to be profitable, according to the firm.
Investors will see a fuller impact of coronavirus when Disney releases its second-quarter results on May 5; Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) said on Thursday that if its Universal Studios parks remain closed for the entire second quarter, the company would suffer an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization loss of roughly $500 million.
Financial analysts have predicted reopen dates for Disney ranging from as early as June to Jan. 1. Guidelines will be set by governors in California and Florida, where Iger and Walt Disney World Resort President Josh D’Amaro sit on state reopening task forces. The rest is up to Disney.
Although Disney and other large venues face an unprecedented challenge protecting guests from an easily spread airborne virus, experts and a former executive pointed to its experience handling crowds. 
More than 157 million people visited Disney parks in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association. 
""If anybody can figure it out, Disney will,"" said Dave Schmitt, founder of MR-ProFun, a consultant to theme parks.
Safeguards have limits. Temperature checks will not catch everyone infected, and most vaccines are not 100% effective, said Dr. Megan Murray, a global health professor at Harvard Medical School.
Even so, a vaccine would provide some reassurance for park-goers, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from April 15-21. While a fifth of respondents said they would attend an amusement, theme or water park whenever they reopen, about 30% would go if a vaccine was available. The poll, which surveyed 4,429 American adults, noted that a vaccine might not be available for more than a year. 
Loyal fans are counting on Disney to get this right. Chicago resident Kelly Alexis, 50, has been to Disney resorts 35 to 40 times and plans to go to Disney World with her family in October if the park is open. 

“It’s just the feeling that they do things so perfectly and they will take every precaution,” Alexis said. “They’re not going to want to have an epidemic where everyone gets sick at Disney. They would never let that happen.”

1311,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Shareholder advisor recommends not endorsing Deutsche Bank chair,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Top shareholder advisor Glass Lewis has called on  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) investors to vote against ratifying the actions of the bank's chairman, Paul Achleitner, at this month's annual general meeting, citing ""performance"" concerns.
The recommendation not to endorse his actions is a blow to one of Europe's most prominent bankers as Germany's largest lender tries to reverse five years of losses, attempts a major overhaul, and navigates the coronavirus outbreak.
Glass Lewis, in a report published on Friday, said that removing Achleitner was not in the bank's best interests but that the company's failings should be at least partially attributed to Achleitner given the numerous changes in leadership and strategy shifts that he has overseen.
""We believe that a vote against the ratification of Dr. Achleitner for the past fiscal year is warranted,"" Glass Lewis said in its report to shareholders.
Deutsche Bank wasn't immediately able to comment, but it did say last month that the ""entire supervisory board continues to have no doubts concerning Dr. Achleitner’s comprehensive personal and professional skills and integrity.""
Last year, Achleitner received approval from 71.63% of shareholders.

1312,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 01, 2020 08:36AM ET</span>",How a Goldman Sachs Manager Is Preparing For a Post-Covid World,"(Bloomberg) -- Chaos has ruled markets for months. With a pandemic pummeling the economy, and everyone from central banks to mom and pop investors trying to push asset prices back up, it’s a setting guaranteed to strain the insights of fund managers.
Consider a quantity called dispersion, or how varied individual stock returns are. Bashed around in earnings season, differences between winners and losers in the S&P 500 are right now almost twice the average of the last decade.
That creates openings for active managers who can hunt beyond indexes for companies positioned to bounce, according to Katie Koch, co-head of fundamental equity at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Asset Management. Funds advised by Koch, whose firm has about $1.8 trillion under supervision, are beating their benchmarks at an 80% rate in 2020.
“You want to take advantage of this dispersion and possibly find these names that haven’t been as resilient as the rest of the market, therefore providing higher upside,” she said by phone this week. “You need to look beyond the mega-cap, very resilient tech names to find those recovery opportunities.”
That big gaps would open in valuations is one thing people got right when trying to forecast the current earnings season, which has come without the aid of reliable estimates. Indeed, many professional traders were excited by the prospect of a market thrown into chaos by the pandemic’s economic consequences, believing it would be an opportunity to exploit their real-time edge.
Equity markets have shown tremendous resilience in the face of tough economic data thanks, in part, to intervention by the Federal Reserve. The central bank’s balance sheet has ballooned in recent weeks, passing $6 trillion, with some economists projecting it could top 50% of U.S. GDP by the end of the year. Thus, one time-honored rule rings loudest at Goldman.
“Don’t fight the Fed,” Koch said by phone this week. “The sheer volume of monetary support and also what they’re buying has really removed a lot of the left-tail risk for equity markets and that’s being reflected in the current relatively resilient levels of the S&P 500.”
Her recommendation to clients? Stay invested but be aggressively active in the pursuit of “abundant” opportunities that exist at the company level.
Companies should, most importantly, have balance sheet strength to manage through a protracted shutdown. From a valuation perspective, Koch looks for firms that have been heavily discounted relative to their value. Lastly, she looks for businesses that might be attached to secular growth opportunities her team believes will eventually recover.
Here are some of the areas Koch and her team are exploring:
Back To Work
While greater work-from-home adoption might become a post-crisis legacy, large swaths of employees will likely be returning to the office. That should benefit areas such as childcare, catering, industrial cleaning and small-business solutions, including companies that provide payment solutions for smaller businesses.
Koch also says a number of company executives she’s been in touch with have voiced a desire to localize some of the most vulnerable parts of their supply chains. Should that happen, advanced manufacturing companies and 3-D printing firms might be well positioned to reap the benefits because they can help control for labor costs, she said.
Having Fun, Again
One of the most visible and alarming emblems of the current crisis has been the escalation in jobless claims and the accompanying plunge in consumer confidence. Fears the consumer might be slow to bounce back are everywhere, with Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, saying this week that the downturn’s depth and duration remain extremely uncertain, with the burden falling most heavily on those least able to carry them.
Koch and her team expect a gradual recovery but find comfort in historical precedent. Crises, including the current one, tend to make people eventually want to go out and live life to the fullest. “We do expect a gradual resurgence of the millennial consumer preference for experience over things,” she said.
Highly select travel names and second-derivative plays in the travel space -- such as tech companies that enable travel planning as well as restaurants -- could be beneficiaries.
Data Domination
As businesses shuttered in March, millions migrated to working from home -- and many may continue to do so even once the coronavirus outbreak has been conquered.
One of the legacies of this crisis is going to be demand for getting data and getting it faster, said Koch. A greater number of people might live their lives online than they did before the outbreak -- and it’s a trend that could resonate across multiple generations.
This may expedite 5G capex spend in the U.S. and potentially around the world. While many data-related names have been resilient, there is a dislocation between price and value in select semiconductor companies that are focused on 5G solutions, she said.

The vendors tried to sell respirators to officials in Florida, Wisconsin and Indiana at highly inflated prices, 3M said, adding that they were not connected with the company.
N95 respirators, which are designed to filter 95% of airborne particles, are among personal protective gears most needed by medical professionals battling the coronavirus outbreak.
The company said one case claimed to have up to five billion respirators at inflated prices, falsely affiliating themselves with 3M.
""We will continue to take legal action in cases like these and are working closely with national and international law enforcement to help stop the perpetrators of these unlawful and unethical schemes,"" 3M Senior Vice President Ivan Fong said.

3M said it would donate any damages recovered to COVID-19-related nonprofit organizations. It has filed a total of 10 lawsuits in April in its effort to combat fraud.

1316,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 07:25AM ET</span>","As meat plant infections rise, Canada lets packers choose when to close","By Rod Nickel
WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - In Cargill Inc's High River, Alberta plant, supplier of more than one-third of Canada's beef, 391 workers were sick with coronavirus when the company suspended operations, according to provincial health officials.
But Maple Leaf Foods (TO:MFI) decided to idle a poultry plant for eight days, in Brampton, Ontario, after just three workers were infected.
In Canada's fight against the pandemic, public health officials are mostly leaving decisions on closing meat plants to the companies, even though the authorities have power to do so. Alberta Health Services (AHS), for example, could close a plant with unsafe conditions, spokesman Tom McMillan said.
The impact of such decisions extends beyond plant walls. They are at the heart of Alberta's two largest community outbreaks, and could foreshadow dilemmas likely to emerge as other industries restart. 
Canada's stance contrasts a more active U.S. political role with infected plants, as close-quarters work has led workers in numerous North American plants to fall ill or walk off the job. President Donald Trump ordered meat plants on Tuesday to stay open, and state and local officials earlier pushed successfully for some to close, including Smithfield Foods' South Dakota slaughterhouse. 
Jon Nash, President of Cargill Protein North America, said Cargill reduced production at its Alberta plant on April 13 and remained open before closing entirely a week later to avoid wasting food, and because ranchers needed a market for cattle.
Factors outside the Cargill plant, such as crowded households and carpooling, contributed to the spread in High River, health officials said. 
Cargill said on Wednesday that High River would resume reduced production on May 4 after a two-week closure for cleaning and additional safety measures.
Cargill's decision to operate as long as it did before the temporary closure rankled some workers.
""It absolutely pisses me off,"" said Jamie Welsh-Rollo, a single mom who seals meat in plastic in the High River plant, and is a United Food and Commercial Workers Union (UFCW) shop steward. ""We're looked at as numbers.""
At least eight Canadian meat plants have closed temporarily due to the pandemic. As of Wednesday, 821 Cargill workers at High River, about 37% of the workforce, were infected, including one death.
And Cargill is not alone. A JBS SA (SA:JBSS3) beef plant in Brooks, Alberta slowed production but remains open after 276 infections and one death. 
CAUTION AT MAPLE LEAF
Maple Leaf, in closing its Ontario plant, considered that the city of Brampton itself was a coronavirus hotspot and that the company was short of face masks to supply all 340 workers, said Randy Huffman, its chief food safety officer.
The few initial cases eventually tallied 26 after more testing.
""There were some challenging discussions,"" Huffman said in an interview. ""We needed to have greater confidence that the plant could operate safely.""
A deadly illness outbreak 12 years earlier due to contaminated meat in a Maple Leaf plant factored in its response, he said.
While Maple Leaf made the decision to close, it consulted widely, Huffman said - with an occupational health doctor, local and federal health authorities.
""I don't think leaving it up to any one entity is the best outcome.""
In rare examples of Canadian authorities stepping in, British Columbia health regions closed United Poultry on April 21 after 28 cases were found at the Vancouver plant, and shut Superior Poultry on April 24 after two initial cases.
In High River, Welsh-Rollo feared passing the virus to her four-year-old son, who has an auto-immune deficiency, and saw problems with Cargill's precautions. 
Cargill asked health screening questions in English to workers entering the plant, many of whom are immigrants or foreign workers, she said. The 31-year-old plant was too cramped to make distancing measures effective, she said.
Cargill's Nash said the company has worked closely with AHS on safety protocols, including face masks for workers.
Adrienne South, spokeswoman for Alberta's Labour Minister, said multiple ministries helped ensure the plant's safety but added that ""the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is responsible for the plant.""
CFIA said in a statement that it cannot suspend plant operations over coronavirus, since its authority to stop food production over health risks is limited to food safety concerns.
The decisions to prolong operations baffle Sylvain Charlebois, director of the Agri-Food Analytics Lab at Dalhousie University, an institute that analyzes food and agriculture issues.

""I don't understand why it took so long (to close) at High River and I don’t understand why Brooks is still operating,"" he said.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) aims to conclude talks with Boeing (N:BA) on a new plane order in the next two weeks, but possible price cuts or cancellations related to an existing 737 MAX order are also part of the discussions, its chief executive said on Friday. 
Ryanair, which has 210 737 MAX jets on order, has given Boeing a deadline of May 18-19 to secure a ""comprehensive new agreement,"" Michael O'Leary told Reuters in an interview. 
Ryanair in February said it had made an offer for an order of the MAX 10, which has 230 seats compared with 197 on the MAX200 jets it has already ordered.
""We are in advanced stage of those discussions. The focus is on taking the MAX delivery and the possibility of a new aircraft order,"" he said. ""Pricing is part of the discussion, cancellations are part of the discussion.""
Deliveries of the MAX jets have been repeatedly delayed due to its grounding a year ago in the aftermath of two fatal crashes. 
Ryanair, which on Friday announced 3,000 job cuts and struck a pessimistic tone on the length of coronavirus disruption, is making the argument that the blow to profitability dealt by the health crisis meant it needed cheaper planes.
""We are facing the reality that we will be flying a lot less passengers in the next 12 months and over the next 2-4 years we'll be flying a lot more passengers but at much lower prices and that is going to have to be reflected in lower aircraft costs,"" O'Leary said. 
The CEO said he believed the grounded MAX would be back flying by July or August and that he expected Ryanair to take its first deliveries of the plane by next summer. 
""I would be very optimistic that we would have some MAXs next summer, the question is whether we will have 30 MAXs or 10. At this stage I am not quite sure."" 
Asked whether the coronavirus crisis would undermine Ryanair's long-term growth plans, O'Leary said those plans ""were always going to go back on track.""

O'Leary said Boeing's raising of $25 billion in a bond offering on Thursday ""removes any doubts about Boeing's survivability.""

1324,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>","For cloud giants, usage soars but tech investment delays hobble revenue growth","By Paresh Dave and Stephen Nellis
(Reuters) - As lockdown orders force billions of people to work, learn and play from home during the novel coronavirus outbreak, usage has surged for the cloud computing services that power video conferencing, streaming television and online games.
The world's three leading cloud services providers - Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) Amazon Web Services,  Microsoft Corp 's (O:MSFT) Azure and Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google Cloud - have all seen demand for their services jump.
In particular, peak daily usage for Google's Meet videoconferencing tool has shot up 30-fold since January while the number of daily users for Microsoft's Teams chat system has more than doubled to 75 million since early March.
But at the same time, the companies have seen a drop-off in new contracts from big clients for server storage and to overhaul technology, company executives and analysts said this week. The massive, multi-year deals normally account for a greater portion of revenue than contracts for workplace software such as Teams and Meet. 
Delays in setting up new servers and generous free trial offers also capped sales growth in the first quarter. 
For instance, Microsoft said it put limits on how much cloud computing new customers could consume because of equipment shortages due to lockdowns.
""We're generally utilizing servers and infrastructure that we'd already bought...because the ability to get tons and tons of new servers in with the supply chain out of China was constrained,"" Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told Reuters in an interview.
The cloud provider sector saw first-quarter revenue growth of about 34%, less than the 37% growth in the fourth quarter, according to research company Canalys. It added there had been little change in market share for the top three in the $31 billion global industry.
""Cloud investment in the worst-affected vertical segments, such as hospitality, aviation, construction, tourism and manufacturing, is being scaled down or delayed,"" Canalys said in a report on Thursday. ""This has offset some of the short-term growth enjoyed during the quarter.""
Whether the cloud providers see a boost to overall revenue growth from the pandemic in the current quarter or later this year remains unclear.
Businesses and governments have begun to transition from rolling out emergency measures to preparing for re-opening in the coming months, but their virus-hammered budgets could curtail spending and force cloud providers to extend giveaways. 
Market researcher IDC last week downgraded its forecast for global IT spending in 2020 to a 2.7% decline compared with a previous estimate of a 3.6% rise because of the pandemic.
DELAYS ABOUND
Microsoft Azure, which is No. 2 in cloud revenue after Amazon Web Services, saw its sales growth rate slow the most, at 59% in the first three months of the year from 62% in the prior quarter, company data showed. 
One of Microsoft's biggest sources of revenue is large businesses tackling complicated technology problems, like moving entire financial software systems to Microsoft’s cloud from their own servers.
Microsoft executives said this week that while large companies like Anheuser Busch InBev NV (BR:ABI) are continuing with these migrations, growth in consulting revenue that often accompanies these complex projects had tapered as customers postponed projects.
As much as a fifth of Microsoft's cloud revenue could face volatility in the coming quarter because of those delays, the company said.
Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai also said this week that it is taking longer to close cloud deals but did not offer revenue guidance.
In the first quarter, revenue for Google Cloud, which includes sales of storage services as well as workplace software, grew 52% from a year earlier compared with 53% in the prior quarter.
John Dinsdale, a chief analyst at Synergy Research Group, said though some buyers are delaying, their plans to adopt more cloud services have not changed.
""The signs for the leading cloud providers remain very positive,"" he said by email.
Amazon, which saw Amazon Web Services revenue growth drop to 33% in the first quarter from 34% a quarter earlier, pointed to an increase in future spending commitments from customers as evidence its business remains healthy.
But pandemic-related restrictions and shortages may crimp future revenue growth. Google said it could face delays on developing new data centers, and Microsoft's Hood told Reuters that construction delays for data centers will persist.

""We'll just continue to follow government guidelines and get back to construction when it is safe to do so,"" Hood said.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ryanair (I:RYA) will shut down the main Vienna base of its Austrian airline Lauda and bring in Ryanair jets instead unless staff there agree to a pay cut and a new labor agreement, Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said on Friday. 
Ryanair bought the Austrian airline from Former Formula One racing champion Niki Lauda in 2018 as part of a move to a broader structure with several airline brands but it has struggled to get costs down in line with its main fleet. 
""Lauda is having a very difficult conversation with the Austrian Airlines union down there. We have given them until May 20 to accept significant pay cuts and a new CLA"" (collective labour agreement), O'Leary told Reuters in an interview. 
If they refuse, the airline's Austrian base will close and Ryanair will step up in Vienna, he said. 
""If you close Lauda, it will return as Ryanair: bigger and badder than Lauda ever was.""
Lauda's Airbus A320 fleet would be replaced at the airport by Ryanair Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s, he said. Ryanair said earlier on Friday that it was in talks with Lauda's lessors about cutting planned aircraft deliveries. 
Ryanair has already transferred all of Lauda's slots in Vienna to Ryanair ahead of the labor talks deadline but Lauda's base would be retained if the new terms were accepted by its staff, O'Leary said.

""If the unions sign the revised deal ... then the Lauda A320 base will stay in Vienna and it will grow,"" he said. ""I would hope that the unions down there will see sense.""

1327,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>","Poor stay poor, rich get richer? Virus aid weighs on EU market competition","By Gabriela Baczynska and Belén Carreño
BRUSSELS/MADRID (Reuters) - Germany accounts for more than half of the emergency coronavirus state aid approved by the EU executive, prompting concerns that countries with the deepest pockets might be getting an unfair advantage in the bloc's single market. 
Ensuring a competitive level playing field within its cherished single market of some 450 million people is a central EU tenet and has long been a key condition for opening up to foreign players from China to, more recently, Brexit Britain.
But the executive European Commission suspended the normally-strict state aid restrictions in mid-March, allowing the 27 EU states to pump cash into their economies and companies battered by coronavirus, with more than 1.9 trillion euros ($2.1 trillion) worth of national schemes approved so far. 
It is not an even game, however, as richer or less indebted states have more scope to channel funds.
While Germany makes up for about a quarter of the EU's GDP, it accounts for some 52% of the total value of the emergency coronavirus state aid cleared so far, Commission data shows.
France and Italy share joint second place, each with 17% of the total, and the Commission plans to maintain its hands-off approach till at least the end of 2020.
""There is clearly a risk of a breakdown of... the internal market in Europe,"" a senior Spanish government official said.
""Not all the countries of the internal market have access to this liquidity. Germany has deep pockets and can afford it.""
Germany granted a 3 billion euro government-backed loan to sports retailer Adidas (DE:ADSGn), a 1.8 billion euro loan commitment to holiday operator TUI (DE:TUIGn) and is in talks with Lufthansa on a 9 billion euro rescue package, among others.
""The state aid that some European countries are discussing with airlines risks distorting competition and creating benefits for some when the sector restarts,"" said Carlo Amati of Italian flight attendants union ANPAV. 
""The market shares that existed before COVID19 should be defended.""
Announcing plans to cut 3,000 jobs on Friday, Ryanair's Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said he would challenge in European courts what he described as more than 30 billion euros in state aid to flag carrier rivals of his Irish budget airline.
INEQUALITIES
The Commission's competition chief, Margrethe Vestager said on Wednesday the suspension of usual state aid rules was ""fully legitimate"" now to save jobs and businesses and that competition distortions were kept to a minimum. 
""There are differences in how much member states can spend depending on their fiscal space,"" she told a virtual debate. ""But... we preserve the single market because we really need the single market for our recovery.""
An EU official, speaking on condition of anonymity, was more frank: ""... if you look at the scale of what Germany in particular, but also some others, are doing - any notion of level playing field or single market integrity has gone out of the window.""
That underpins the ailing south's demand for joint EU financing to spur a recovery. Otherwise, they fear, not only will they have suffered more severely in the health crisis but will also take longer to get their economies back on track.
With euro zone preliminary data showing an economic contraction of 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 2020, the EU is considering issuing debt by the Commission to raise more funds to help member states kickstart growth in 2021-22.
Guntram Wolff of the Bruegel think-tank said central EU borrowing could allow Brussels to make demands on how the money is spent after the Commission also came under pressure to attach climate strings to coronavirus state aid packages.
""The more decentralised these schemes, the more political considerations kick in - whether and what conditions to put on aid, whether states should take on voting shares, what sectors to help - the bigger the threat to the single market,"" he said. 
Spain said in a note ahead of EU leaders' talks last week that while ""increased flexibility for national responses is needed and welcome, it is vital to avoid this leading to a more unequal EU.""
To restore the level playing field between countries and companies, Madrid has said countries like Spain should now be compensated as the EU looks to its next long-term budget to help restart economic growth. 

""Europe needs more fiscal firepower and we need it now,"" said Ana Botin, head of Spain's banking giant Santander (MC:SAN).

LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks pulled back further on Friday on grim U.S. economic data, mixed company results and President Donald Trump's threat to impose new tariffs on China over the coronavirus crisis.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s index of global stocks fell 0.5% after a tumble late Thursday broke a six-day winning streak for the index.
London-listed stocks fell as data showed the UK housing market was grinding to a halt, with the FTSE 100 down 2.2%, wiping out much of the strong gains earlier in the week.
British Airways operator IAG (LON:ICAG) shed another 2.6% as details of its plans to cut staffing, including a quarter of its pilots, to weather the collapse in air travel caused by the coronavirus.
Trading volumes were thin with many European markets closed for a May 1 public holiday.
In Asia, with many markets closed, the benchmark Nikkei index fell 2.8%, with declines led by chipmaking firms. Australian shares fell 5%, their most in five weeks.
The negative sentiment was set by comments from Trump on Thursday that he was concerned about China's role in the origin and spread of the novel coronavirus and that his hard-fought trade deal with China was now of secondary importance to the pandemic. He threatened new tariffs on Beijing, as his administration crafted retaliatory measures over the outbreak.
Meanwhile, U.S. initial jobless claims totalled 3.84 million for the week ended April 25 and personal spending tumbled 7.5% in March, the biggest decline on record. All that came a day after figures showed the biggest quarterly contraction for the U.S. economy since the Great Recession.
The U.S. Federal Reserve widened a key program to help the economy, agreeing to lend to even larger firms, bringing the dollar under some selling pressure. The currency, which has so far been remarkably resilient, fell to two-week lows and is set for a 2% weekly loss. It has steadied somewhat this morning, however.
The dollar was down slightly against the Japanese yen, trading at 107.07 yen, though another metric of distress in the markets -- the Australian dollar -- fell by 1% to 0.6447, its weakest since Tuesday.
Oil prices rose, helped by major producers starting output cuts to offset a slump in fuel demand and by data showing U.S. crude inventories expanded less than expected.
Brent crude for July delivery, was up 22 cents, or 0.8%, at $26.70 a barrel, after rising about 11% in April. It has still slumped around 60% this year. U.S. crude for June delivery rose 34 cents, or 1.8%, to $19.18 a barrel. But U.S. oil fell for a fourth month in April and is down 70% this year.

Tokyo Inflation Goes Negative for the First Time Since 2017
While consumer prices excluding fresh food across the capital fell for the first time in three years in April, microwave prices jumped 29% from a year earlier following a record 42% leap in March. Oven prices had fallen in 36 of the past 37 years.
Demand for microwaves has rocketed as more Tokyo residents work and eat at home amid requests from the metropolitan government to stay put to avoid the spread of coronavirus infections.
“Supply restraints and factory shutdowns may also be affecting the price of some home electric devices,” said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-Ichi Life Research Institute. “Prices will naturally rise if many people want to buy these items under the emergency circumstances. But over the longer term prices overall are likely to weaken.”
Oil Plight Could Drive Japan’s Inflation Below Zero in April
The Bank of Japan on Monday slashed the lower end of its range of inflation forecasts for the year through March 2020 from 1% to -0.7% to reflect crashing oil prices and feeble demand as the economy takes a huge hit from the virus.
Other price points in the Tokyo data showed that the travel industry was one of the hardest hit by Covid-19. Prices of hotel accommodation slipped 7.7% in April, the largest drop on record for data going back to 1971. Overall core Tokyo prices fell 0.1%, intensifying concerns over a possible re-emergence of deflation.

OSLO (Reuters) - The fate of Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) was in the balance on Friday after a deadline passed overnight for bondholders to vote on a rescue package for the transatlantic budget airline.
Bondholders were set to start a meeting at 1400 GMT on Thursday to vote on the airline's debt-to-equity plan, the first major test of its rescue efforts amid the coronavirus outbreak. 
But the airline sent a revised offer at 1359 GMT, calling it final, and pushed back the deadline to accept to 2100 GMT. Since then, Norwegian Air has sent no messages about the outcome. 
""We have nothing to communicate for the moment. We will issue a message to the Oslo stock exchange when we do,"" said a Norwegian Air spokeswoman.
The carrier may run out of cash by mid-May unless its plan, which involves a swap of up to $1.2 billion of debt into equity and hands over most of the ownership of the firm to lessors and bondholders, is approved by creditors and shareholders.
If the company wins backing from bondholders, it needs the support of leasing companies by Sunday and for shareholders to approve the proposal at an extraordinary general meeting on Monday.
If successful, the plan would allow Norwegian to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion crowns ($260 million), which hinge on a reduction in its ratio of debt to equity, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
Norwegian warned on April 27 that taking the company through an alternative route of bankruptcy proceedings in Norway would destroy much of the value left in it and that most creditors would likely recover little of their claims.
Some bondholders had said ahead of Thursday's vote they would vote in favour of the plan.
Norwegian grew rapidly in the last decade to become Europe's third-largest low-cost airline and the biggest foreign carrier serving New York and other major U.S. cities, but it also accumulated debt and liabilities of nearly $8 billion. 
Before the new coronavirus outbreak all but shut down air traffic due to government-imposed travel restrictions, the airline had taken steps to cut costs and routes, aiming to make a full-year profit for the first time in four years.

Currently only paying invoices vital to its minimum operations, such as salaries for staff still employed and critical IT infrastructure, Norwegian has put payments for ground handling, debt and leases on hold.

At 3:12 AM ET (0735 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 125 points, or 2.1% lower, while France's CAC 40 and the DAX in Germany were both closed due to holidays. 
Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 1.2% lower, the S&P 500 lost 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.3%.
U.S. President Donald Trump ratcheted up Sino-U.S. tensions late Thursday, threatening new trade tariffs on Beijing amid retaliatory measures over the outbreak of the coronavirus, which he blames on China.
It was only in January that Trump signed a first phase of a multibillion-dollar trade deal with China, seeking to quell what had become a damaging trade war.
Another fight would likely limit global growth prospects, exactly what isn’t needed during these troubled times, and may push fragile economies in Europe further into recession.
The region’s recession is likely to be deep enough as it stands, according to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. She said Thursday that eurozone GDP could slump 15% in a “severe” scenario, which places the near 4% contraction in the first quarter firmly into the shade.

Ryanair shares dropped 3.8%.
Shares in J  Sainsbury  (LON:SBRY) fell 1% after the U.K. retailer said late Thursday that it expects to take a £500 million ($628 million)  hit to annual profits due to the cost of keeping open during the pandemic, and it may have to close some stores if the situation worsens.
Economic data were thin on the ground in Europe Friday, with the standout number being the U.K. manufacturing PMI for April, at 04:30 AM ET (0830 GMT), which is expected to show a sharp contraction in the sector.

The data is the latest indicator to show the widening impact of the virus on the world's third-largest economy. Sales totalled 270,393 vehicles last month, data from the Japan Automobile Dealers Association and an association representing dealers of so-called ""kei"" mini cars showed.
That compared to sales of 378,687 vehicles in the same period a year earlier.

Most cars sold in Japan are produced domestically.

Tesla, which started delivering cars from its $2 billion Shanghai car plant in December, said in a statement it has cut the starting price for its Standard Range Plus Model 3 sedans to 271,550 yuan ($38,463.17), after receiving 20,250 yuan per car as EV subsidies.

China had announced plans in 2015 to end subsidies for electric vehicles this year, but said in March it would extend them. However, it said the subsidies will apply only to passenger cars costing less than 300,000 yuan.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 09:40PM ET</span>",Amazon sees possible second-quarter loss as it forecasts $4 billion in COVID-19-related costs,"By Jeffrey Dastin and Akanksha Rana
(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) on Thursday said it could post its first quarterly loss in five years even as revenue surges because it is spending at least $4 billion in response to the coronavirus pandemic, including plans to test its workforce for COVID-19.
Shares of Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, fell 5% in after-hours trade.
Jeff Bezos, the company's founder and world's richest person, said in a statement, ""we're not thinking small,"" a sign that the e-commerce company would invest heavily during the pandemic. Rival brick-and-mortar retailers have had to shut stores while Amazon hired 175,000 people.
This quarter, with government-mandated lockdowns in full swing, Amazon said it could see a 28% rise in revenue to $81 billion.
Under normal circumstances, Amazon would earn an operating profit of at least $4 billion in the current second quarter, but its costs will rise by that amount or more so it can respond to the pandemic, the company said. The Seattle retailer forecast operating income will range from a loss of $1.5 billion to a profit of $1.5 billion, versus earnings of $3.1 billion in the same period a year prior.
Amazon has unsettled investors in the past with heavy spending on cloud data centers, streaming video and voice-controlled gadgets, which often paid off in the form of new businesses. Since mid-February, Amazon's shares have risen by more than 10% including Thursday's after-hours drop, while the broader stock market has sunk.
Bezos' personal stake alone has grown by some $5 billion in that time.
The company is increasing investments because of the novel coronavirus in a similar way, said Kim Khan, U.S. markets analyst at Investing.com.
""Amazon built its commanding position by spending all its cash to grow before it became the profit-making machine it is today. It's doing the same thing during this lockdown period and will likely come out a winner again,"" Khan said.
At the same time, Amazon is facing new labor risks. The virus has infected workers at dozens of locations, igniting small protests and prompting labor organizers to demand site closures. Amazon has rolled out masks and temperature checks to all its U.S. and European warehouses, announced software to monitor for social distancing and taken other measures to ensure it stays operational.
BOON TO GROCERY, 'MIXED BAG' FOR ADS
Revenue for the first quarter rose 26% to $75.5 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $73.6 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Grocery sales in March were a bright spot for Amazon, which owns Whole Foods Market, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts. Household staples and home office supplies have been in high demand, while interest in discretionary items like apparel dipped, he said.
Last month, the number of people who streamed video on Amazon for the first time nearly doubled, Olsavsky said. 
Subscription revenue grew 28% to $5.6 billion in the first quarter.
Still, advertising, a lucrative business in which merchants pay for top placement of their goods on Amazon, was somewhat of a ""mixed bag,"" Olsavsky said.
Merchants had less reason to sponsor products in March when the company paused accepting non-essential items into warehouses for delivery. Some pulled back on placing ads, the price of which went down; however, strong traffic to Amazon's websites helped offset the trend, Olsavsky said.
Advertising and other revenue was up 44% in the first quarter to $3.9 billion. 
Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing unit, also is seeing demand vary by industry. Hospitality and travel customers quickly and severely cut their spend. Remote education and entertainment services had much higher AWS usage, and overall, revenue increased 33% to $10.2 billion, short of analysts' estimate of $10.3 billion.
In the midst of the change, Amazon expects to spend $300 million in the second quarter to develop the capability to test staff for the virus, Olsavsky said. That could approach $1 billion for the full year if the early effort is successful, with the goal of ""making testing widely available,"" he told reporters earlier on Thursday.
Meanwhile, social distancing at worksites has made Amazon less efficient, and warehousing challenges have taken a toll on a year-long effort to halve delivery times to one day for Prime members, Olsavsky said.
Total operating expenses rose 29% in the first quarter to $71.5 billion.

Internationally, the pandemic has hit Amazon the hardest in India, where the company has had to forgo sales to comply with the government restricting delivery to essential goods such as groceries, Olsavsky said.

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 09:40PM ET</span>","Apple, Huawei boost market share, as first-quarter China smartphone shipments fall: Canalys","SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] each captured a higher share of China's smartphone market in the first quarter, according to data from research firm Canalys released on Friday.
Total smartphone shipments in the country in the three months ended March fell 18% from a year earlier to 72.6 million, the data showed, as the coronavirus outbreak took a toll on Chinese supply chains and consumer demand.
China's Huawei, the No.2 smartphone seller in the world by volume, grabbed 41.4% of the domestic market, up from 33.9% a year earlier. Its overall unit shipments rose about 1% to 30.1 million.
That growth came at the expense of Android rivals Oppo, Vivo, and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp. The three companies saw shipments plunge by 26%, 19%, and 26%, respectively.
All four companies rely significantly on overseas sales for revenue, although Huawei will depend on the domestic market increasingly as its latest devices do not run the complete suite of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Mobile Services due to restrictions placed on it by the U.S. government.
Apple shipments sank more than 4%, marking a significant dip but below the industry average. However, its share of the market grew, hitting 8.5% from 7.3% last year.
Apple reported sales and profits that beat Wall Street expectations on Thursday, with Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook saying China sales were ""headed in the right direction"" as the country reopens from restrictions imposed to curb the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Apple is expected to release its first 5G phone later this year. Online retailers in China recently slashed prices of the iPhone 11, and analysts said the company's new, mid-range iPhone SE was selling better than expected in the country. 
After enduring years of market contraction, Chinese Android smartphone players were hoping that releasing new 5G models would prompt consumers to purchase new devices. 
But analysts now expect consumers will delay purchasing 5G phones, opting instead for cheaper, still serviceable 4G devices as a coronavirus-induced recession looms.
“Looking ahead, we remain cautious about the speed of recovery in China’s smartphone market this year, and maintain our best-case scenario of 326 million shipments for 2020, including 137 million 5G smartphones,"" said Nicole Peng, vice president of mobility at Canalys.
""The macroeconomic situation is a huge red flag for China’s market players this year.""

Market research firm TrendForce said on Thursday it expects 2020 smartphone output globally to slump 11.3% to 1.24 billion.

1339,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>","Boeing raises $25 billion in blowout debt sale, eschews government aid","By Joshua Franklin and David Shepardson
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) raised $25 billion in a bond offering on Thursday, a blowout result for the planemaker, which it said helped the company avoid taking government aid during the coronavirus-induced travel downturn.
Boeing's capital raise, first reported by Reuters earlier this week, is the sixth-largest investment-grade bond offering of all time and the biggest year-to-date, according to Refinitiv data. The Federal Reserve's intervention in the credit market has boosted prospects for troubled borrowers such as Boeing.
The U.S. central bank has slashed interest rates to zero and rolled out around $2 trillion in lending commitments. While it has not yet snapped up any corporate bonds such as Boeing's, its openness to doing so has buoyed credit markets.
The planemaker has been trying to bring its 737 MAX jet back into service after two fatal crashes, while the coronavirus pandemic has hammered aviation and other industries. Business shutdowns around the world to curb the outbreak have dried up demand for air travel.
Earlier this week, Boeing was hoping to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion in the bond offering, but increased the size of the deal to $25 billion due to the strong investor demand, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Demand was stoked by high yields relative to Boeing's other bond issues, Boeing's earnings report on Wednesday and provisions in the offering that protect investors in case of a credit rating downgrade to junk status. 
Following the bigger-than-expected bond offering, Boeing, which had been weighing seeking government aid, said it had no further plans to raise funds. 
""As a result of the response, and pending the closure of this transaction expected Monday, May 4, we do not plan to seek additional funding through the capital markets or the U.S. government options at this time,"" Boeing said in a statement. 
""We will continue to assess our liquidity position as the health crisis and our dynamic business environment evolve,"" the company added.
Credit ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service Inc estimated this month that Boeing’s funding needs could top $30 billion in 2020. The company secured about half of this by drawing down on a $13.8 billion credit line in March, Moody's said.
Chicago-based Boeing sold seven new bonds with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2060. The new funds came at a higher price for Boeing than prior bond offerings, a sign of the company's precarious financial situation. 
Among the debt sold was a 10-year bond with a 5.15% yield and a 450 basis point premium to U.S. Treasuries of a comparable duration, according to Refinitiv IFR data. By comparison, Boeing sold a 10.5-year bond in July with a 2.96% yield and at a 90 basis point premium to U.S. Treasuries. 
Given the higher yields on offer, there was around $75 billion's worth of demand for the new bonds, one source said 
S&P on Wednesday lowered its credit rating for Boeing to BBB-minus, one step above junk. 
To placate investors over the risk of a potential downgrade to junk status, the bonds contained a provision that raises the coupon paid to bondholders if Boeing loses its investment-grade status. 
Boeing had faced a May 1 deadline set by Treasury to seek priority funding from a $17 billion fund for national security-related companies. A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on Boeing's decision to forgo aid.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly vowed to provide financial assistance to Boeing. The company in March had said it backed $60 billion in government loans and loan guarantees for the entire aviation industry and its chief financial officer had warned the ""markets essentially"" were closed to Boeing. 
Boeing said this week it would cut its 160,000-person workforce by about 10%, further reduce 787 Dreamliner production and try to boost liquidity as it prepares for a years-long industry recovery from the pandemic, which drove its second consecutive quarterly loss.
The 737 MAX jet is expected to remain grounded at least until August due to software issues, people briefed on the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
Boeing shares closed up 1.5% on Thursday at $141.02.

 Citigroup  (NYSE:C), BofA Securities, J.P. Morgan and  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) Securities were the joint book-running managers on the bond offering.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 08:05PM ET</span>",Gilead to work with partners to ramp up production of potential coronavirus treatment,"By Deena Beasley
(Reuters) -  Gilead Sciences Inc  (O:GILD), maker of the closely-watched experimental coronavirus drug remdesivir, on Thursday said it will work with international partners to expand production of the potential COVID-19 treatment.
The company said it still expects to have more than one million remdesivir treatment courses manufactured by December, ""with plans to be able to produce several million treatment courses in 2021.""
By the end of next month, Gilead said it expects to have manufactured enough of the drug to treat more than 140,000 patients, and it plans to donate that supply to hospitals.
The company said it has been in constant dialogue with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about making remdesivir, which is given to hospitalized patients by intravenous infusion, available to patients as quickly as possible.
""There is a big sense of urgency here,"" Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said during a conference call with analysts.
He said the FDA could issue an emergency use authorization for remdesivir, but Gilead is also seeking standard regulatory approval of the drug.
O'Day declined to answer questions about whether Gilead plans to eventually profit from the COVID-19 treatment rather than just donate the medicine. The company has made billions of dollars on its drugs for HIV and hepatitis C.
""There has been no other time like this in the history of the planet,"" he said.
First quarter sales of Gilead's HIV drugs rose to $4.1 billion from $3.6 billion a year earlier. 
Gilead also reported flat first-quarter earnings and its shares fell 2% in extended trading.
The U.S. National Institutes of Health on Wednesday said preliminary results from its trial of remdesivir showed that COVID-19 patients given the drug recovered 31% faster than those given a placebo.
In that 1,063-patient trial, patients who received the Gilead drug recovered in 11 days compared with 15 days for those who received a placebo.
While the data will need more analysis to know just how well the drug might work and for which patients with COVID-19, it was hailed by U.S. health officials as highly significant since it clearly had an effect on the disease for which there are currently no approved treatments or vaccines.
Data from a trial run by Gilead, also unveiled on Wednesday, showed similar clinical improvements in patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, regardless of whether they received five or ten days of treatment.
If the drug works just as well in half the time, there would be twice as much available for patients and the cost of therapy would be less.
More detailed results of the U.S. study are expected next month. There are several other studies also looking at remdesivir for the coronavirus.
On Thursday, The European Medicines Agency said it has started a 'rolling review' of data on the use of Gilead's antiviral drug for the treatment of COVID-19.
A rolling review allows the agency to speed its assessment of promising experimental medicines during a public health emergency.
Gilead said its first-quarter profit was largely flat from a year ago as a 5% increase in sales was offset by higher costs, including spending related to development of remdesivir.
Gilead posted adjusted earnings of $1.68 a share on revenue of $5.55 billion in the quarter. Wall Street analysts, on average, forecast a profit of $1.57 on revenue of $5.45 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>","American Airlines, Delta, United to require facial coverings on U.S. flights","By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three of the largest four U.S. airlines said Thursday they will require passengers to wear facial coverings on U.S. flights, joining JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) in taking the step to address the spread of the coronavirus and convince reluctant passengers to resume flying.
United Airlines (O:UAL), Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL), along with the smaller Frontier Airlines, which is owned by private equity firm Indigo Partners LLC, announced they will require facial coverings next month.
Delta and United's new rules start May 4, while Frontier's start May 8 and American's requirements begin May 11. The policies exempt young children from wearing masks or other facial coverings.
Many U.S. airlines are also requiring pilots and flight attendants to use facial coverings while on board aircraft.
Airlines in the United States have seen a nearly 95% drop in U.S. passengers and have slashed flight schedules. They are now working to reassure customers about the safety of air travel by instituting new cleaning and social distancing procedures.
Some airline unions and U.S. lawmakers have urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to require facial coverings for all passengers and crew.
United said it will provide complimentary masks to passengers. Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), one of the largest U.S. airlines, has not required facial coverings.
The FAA has declined to implement the requirement, and it is not clear if the agency has the authority to compel passengers to wear face masks. The FAA said Wednesday it is ""working with air carriers to ensure they have processes in place for addressing public health risks for their crews and passengers.""
Representative Peter DeFazio, who chairs the House Transportation Committee, called on the FAA Wednesday to ""require masks or other face coverings for all crewmembers and passengers on U.S. flights"" and to require airlines ""adopt reasonable, sound procedures for ensuring that passengers are spaced at safe distances from one another.""
Delta said the airline will require face coverings ""starting in the check-in lobby"" and at ""Delta Sky Clubs, boarding gate areas, jet bridges and on board the aircraft for the duration of the flight – except during meal service.""
Delta added their use ""is also strongly encouraged in high-traffic areas, including security lines and restrooms. People unable to keep a face covering in place, including children, are exempt.""
American said the rules will prioritize ""customer and team member well-being.""
German airline group Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) also said this week it would require facial coverings for all passengers starting May 4.
Sara Nelson, international president of the Association of Flight Attendants union, praised the carriers adopting the requirements and added ""absent federal action, we need every airline to require passengers wear face coverings to keep everyone safe in aviation.""

Investing.com - A down day for stocks got a little gloomier after the bell today as the company everyone expected to clean up during the lockdown came up a bit short.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares slid postmarket after its missed profit expectations. It also said it would reinvest its entire second-quarter profit, which might have some resonance for those who have been following the stock since its early days.
Earnings will be about energy tomorrow and there will be the latest numbers on rig activity.
And April manufacturing data will arrive before the bell.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Oil Megacaps Highlight Earnings
All the earnings reports will come before the bell tomorrow, as it’s a Friday. But it’s still a very busy calendar.
Oil majors will be closely watched as U.S. giants  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) report.
Both companies will be scrutinized on how they are dealing with a historic drop in demand and prices. The White House has expressed its support for the oil industry and but has yet to come up with a concrete plan of action, although the president was reportedly mulling a bailout plan presented this week.
Exxon has maintained its dividend, unlike some of its peers.
The company is expected to report a Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) of 4 cents per share, down from 55 cents per share in the year-ago period, on revenue of about $54.8 billion, according to analysts’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Analysts are looking for Chevron to have earned 65 cents per share in the quarter, with revenue coming in at about $29.8 billion.
Consume products giant Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) will also issue numbers.
Stifel upgraded the stock to buy from hold at the end of March, saying it sees “upside risk to organic-sales growth near term, reflecting coronavirus-related buying, particularly in home care and pet nutrition”.
It's expeted to report a profit of 73 cents per share on sales of about $4 billion.
Biotech AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) is on the schedule as well.
A profit of $2.25 per share is expected on revenue of about $8.3 billion.
2. ISM Manufacturing Seen Tumbling
Manufacturing numbers will be in focus of economic indicators tomorrow.
The Institute of Supply Management will issue its April purchasing managers’ index (PMI) at 10:00 AM ET (14:00 GMT).
The ISM manufacturing PMI is expected to have dropped to 36.9 last month from 49.1 in March, according economists’ forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
The index hit a record low below 30 in 1980.
At the same time, March construction spending will be reported, with economists predicting a drop of 3.5%.
3. Oil Rig Count on Tap
Can oil keep its big run going? WTI futures jumped another 25% today and are closing in on $20 per barrel.
But there’s still almost three weeks until the June front-month contract expires and storage worries could build as that approaches.
Tomorrow traders will get some more insight into how production may be falling in the U.S.
Baker Hughes will issue its oil rig count at 1 PM ET (17:00 GMT).
Last week the number of rigs in operation fell to 378 from 438."

1347,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",Bond investors batter bloodied Pemex with no relief in sight,"By Stefanie Eschenbacher and Rodrigo Campos
MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Since Petroleos Mexicanos lost its coveted investment grade rating earlier this month, bond investors have punished the Mexican state oil company, with no clear sign of how the government plans to turn its fortunes around.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised to revive the company known as Pemex, but it remains saddled with more than $100 billion in financial debt. In the first quarter, it posted a staggering $23.6 billion loss.
The grim outlook is becoming increasingly costly, with spreads between Pemex bonds and those of its nearest peer, Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) (SA:PETR4), widening sharply.
""Bond holders are pricing in a higher probability of default for Pemex than for its high yield peers,"" said Patti McConachie, an analyst at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, which invests in Pemex.
""When you compare Pemex to peers that are also exposed to oil price volatility, and owned by sovereigns, their spreads to their sovereign bonds are much tighter relative to Pemex.""
Through March, investors sought some 330 basis points more yield on average to hold a 6.5% Pemex bond due in 2027 <71654QCG5=> than a Petrobras 7.375% bond due the same year <71647NAS8=>.
The gap jumped to 470 bps through April, Eikon Refinitiv data shows. Relative to the U.S. five-year note, the 2027 Pemex bond has a spread of 1,090.8 basis points while Petrobras' stands at 661.5 - a near 430 bps difference, even though both companies have the same credit rating. A year ago, the gap was 77 bps.
(GRAPHIC: https://tmsnrt.rs/35judkI)
Once Pemex began nearing junk status last year, banks warned that investors whose mandates required them to hold investment grade assets would start dumping billions of bonds.
As many as 75% of active investors, including the majority of pension funds, have done so already, Citi estimated. Passive investors, which track indices, will follow suit once Pemex drops out of indices at the end of April.
Investors said Lopez Obrador needs to give some indication he will either change tack, or find some way of finding breathing space for the company.
But he has so far refused to allow new private sector tie-ups for Pemex or water down his plans for an $8 billion new oil refinery - policy shifts that could cheer the market.
Meanwhile, the price to insure against the risk of a Pemex default has risen sharply. Credit default swaps insuring Pemex five-year bonds rose by 255.1% over the year on Thursday and by 164.7% for the 10-year bond, Refinitiv data shows.
Investors with strong nerves see a buying opportunity, arguing Pemex will be propped up. But the rising risk perception increases borrowing costs for Pemex, making it harder for Lopez Obrador to finance plans to increase crude output, boost refining or contain liabilities.
TOO BIG TO FAIL
Fitch Ratings downgraded Pemex's bonds to junk in June. 
The second junk downgrade, by Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Services, came after months of warnings that Lopez Obrador was not doing enough to put Pemex's finances on a sustainable footing.
Lopez Obrador has not addressed the descent to junk status and his finance ministry responded only by saying Mexico itself still had favorable access to credit markets. The government has yet to say what new measures it will take to stop the rot.
In a letter to investors, Pemex reiterated it had the ""absolute backing"" of the government.
Pemex also said ratings agencies had cited the impact from the coronavirus outbreak as a reason for the downgrade. In fact, Moody's had cited Lopez Obrador's policies only days earlier, and underlined the pandemic was not the decisive factor.
The president's single-mindedness and tendency to dismiss orthodox economic arguments he associates with privileged elites have reinforced expectations he will not change course.
""The market is reflecting the fact that (Lopez Obrador's) flagship policies are key drivers of the company's need for material sovereign support, and that his economic policies make it more difficult to deliver that support,"" said Gorky Urquieta, co-head of the emerging markets debt team at asset manager Neuberger Berman, which invests in Pemex bonds.
Noting that Mexico's sovereign bonds are almost trading flat to Brazil, whose debt is rated junk, Urieta said the downgrade appears to have had ""no impact"" on Lopez Obrador.
But having hitched his fortunes to Pemex, investors may take some consolation in knowing the president is highly unlikely to allow the company to go under.
""The bad news is the government has still not gotten the message from rating agencies and markets, which means things will probably get worse before they get better,"" said Aaron Gifford, an analyst at asset manager T.Rowe Price, one of the top investors in Pemex bonds.

""Pemex is too big to fail, which means extraordinary support will ultimately be forthcoming,"" he added.

1348,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 05:27PM ET</span>",Fed’s Expanded Lending Plan Leaves Private Credit in the Cold,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s expanded Main Street Lending Program will do little to help private credit firms step in as lenders to some of Americas small and mid-sized companies.
The Fed expanded the scope of the program Thursday to enable firms with higher revenues and more employees to access financing, while a third loan option was added that will allow companies with higher debt loads to be eligible. A start date for the $600 billion plan will be announced soon, the Fed said in a statement.
But the support doesn’t apply to the $800 billion private credit industry, including direct lenders and business development companies, because they don’t fall under the Fed’s regulatory purview. Some had hoped that the Fed might incorporate the lenders after receiving feedback from businesses since the initial plan was rolled out earlier this month.
“It has to be disappointing to that industry, but not entirely surprising,” said James Kaplan, partner at law firm Quarles & Brady (NYSE:BRC) LLP. “They’re not regulated by the Fed, they’re not familiar to the Fed and the Fed seems confident it can do this through the traditional financial institution lenders.”

It’s not a disaster for shadow banks as they’re sitting atop nearly $300 billion in cash, and have shifted their focus away from financing buyouts to a more patient approach amid havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Yet the companies they lend to still need help. To that end, a new option available to small and mid-sized firms under the wider Fed program is getting additional loans from banks to help see them through the pandemic that has shuttered businesses and sent revenues into freefall.
Borrowers will now be able to count adjusted earnings, which they’ve been using in droves and make profits look rosier. That will make it easier to meet criteria under a new loan option whereby lenders would retain a 15% share of loans that when added to existing debt do not exceed six times earnings adjusted for interest, taxes and depreciation.
Many mid-sized companies may qualify for that option as well as the previously announced expanded loan facility. In 2019, middle-market borrowers on average carried net total leverage of 5.25 times, according to Covenant Review.
As companies consider that a recovery may be a long haul, more borrowers may seek the Fed’s help.
“We’re looking at more of a U-shaped recovery, so companies have started to look at borrowing more, realizing it could be an extended rough spot of a very challenging six months or more,” Kaplan said.
But there’s one major drawback: The loans carry restrictions on business activity including layoffs, executive compensation and dividends.
“Some companies will choose not to take advantage of these programs because of that, but this is an emergency situation and there are a lot of companies that will have to bite the bullet because they need the money,” said Scott Pearson (NYSE:PSO), a partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips.

1350,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>","United Airlines posts quarterly loss, shores up $9.6 billion in liquidity","By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) on Thursday posted a first-quarter loss of $1.7 billion, including charges against investments in Latin America that have soured as the coronavirus pandemic jolts travel industries worldwide.
Airlines including United have parked jets and slashed flight schedules as demand has virtually vanished due to the pandemic, forcing them to suspend growth plans and shift their focus to saving cash.
Chicago-based United said it had $9.6 billion in liquidity as of April 29, up from $7.2 billion at the end of March, and that its cash burn would range between $40 million and $45 million per day in the second quarter.
United is set to receive $5 billion in payroll aid under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and will likely decide in the third quarter whether to tap a $4.5 billion loan under the same package.
The terms of the payroll aid bar airlines from cutting pay or jobs through Sept. 30, but many including United have said they will have to downsize in the fall if demand has not recovered.
""While we are still in the midst of this crisis, we will not hesitate to make difficult decisions we believe will ensure the long term success of our company,"" CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement.
The airline industry has said it could take two to three years for demand to reach 2019 levels.
United's net loss to March 31 compares with a $292 million profit a year earlier. On an adjusted net basis, United's net loss was $639 million, or a loss of $2.57 per share.
Total operating revenue declined 17% to $8 billion.

United's shares closed down 5.2% at $29.58 before the results were released.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>",Hard-hit energy companies' bonds rise after Fed expands loan program,"By Kate Duguid
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bonds of hard-hit oil and gas companies such as Occidental Petroleum (N:OXY), Antero Resources (N:AR), WPX Energy (N:WPX), HighPoint Resources (N:HPR) and Western Midstream Partners (N:WES) rose in price on Thursday after the Federal Reserve announced it would expand its Main Street Lending Facility to larger and riskier companies affected by the coronavirus pandemic. 
The central bank said it would widen its lending to firms with 15,000 employees and $5 billion in revenue, versus initial limits of 10,000 workers and $2 billion. The program now will extend loans to more precarious companies, if banks agree to take on 15% of the loan.
In afternoon trade, seven of the 10 biggest upward movers in the U.S. corporate bond market were oil and gas companies, according to MarketAxess data. WPX Energy's 5.75% June 2026 bond was up 6.7% on the day, last trading at 88 cents on the dollar. Occidental's 6.45% September 2036 issue traded up 5.7% on the day, last trading at 74 cents on the dollar. 
The lending project is aimed at companies that were financially stable prior to the crisis and have since been hit. The program's expansion to include riskier companies could allow recent downgrades into the junk sector to participate. 
Energy companies have been hit hard as fuel demand worldwide has dropped by roughly 30%. More than half of the so-called fallen angels - companies downgraded from investment grade to junk - from the first quarter are in the energy sector, and the bonds of each of those traded higher on Thursday, with particularly notable moves in Occidental and Western Midstream.
Is it unclear whether companies whose bonds rose will apply - or meet all of the Fed's criteria. None of the companies immediately responded to a request for comment. 
""Energy companies could benefit,"" said Nicholas Follett, manager of investment management and research at Commonwealth Financial Network. Other beneficiaries could be ""formerly investment grade companies that are being chased out of the investment grade index.""
Follett pointed to Occidental, which he said had ""a fine balance sheet about six months ago, but had ""been taken completely offsides.""
While the public debt market has remained open, issuers across the credit spectrum have had to pay more to borrow. For smaller oil and gas names with lots of leverage on their balance sheet, current borrowing costs may be too high.
""I think the kinds of companies that would use this are those that can't use the public markets because they are a little too small or they are in a more affected industry and thus, public markets are expensive,"" said Tom Graff, head of fixed income at Brown Advisory.

1352,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 04:36PM ET</span>",Wall St. caps best month in decades with broad sell-off,"By Stephen Culp (NYSE:CULP)
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks lost ground on Thursday as grim economic data and mixed earnings prompted investors to take profits at the close of the S&P 500's best month in 33 years, a remarkable run driven by expectations the economy will soon start recovering from crushing restrictions enacted to curb the coronavirus pandemic.
While risk-off selling pulled all three major U.S. stock averages into the red, the S&P 500 and the Dow posted their largest monthly percentage gains since January 1987, with the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) having its best month since June 2000.
The three indexes remain well within 20% of record highs reached in February, having quickly rebounded since shutdown efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic brought the economy to a grinding halt.
The five-week tally of unemployment claims topped 30 million and consumer spending has plummeted, according to the latest round of dismal indicators providing another snapshot of the crushing economic effects of the widespread shutdown.
""We've had a tremendous run but we've had the worst economic data since the Great Depression,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago. ""Business and earnings might not be snapping back as quickly as the v-shaped recovery on Wall Street would imply."" 
The Federal Reserved announced that it would broaden its ""Main Street Lending Program"" by lowering the minimum loan size and expanding eligibility. 
""Wall Street is liking all the programs that the government and the Fed are putting together,"" Nolte added. ""So Wall Street is doing fine but Main Street is going to be a longer process."" 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell 288.14 points, or 1.17%, to 24,345.72, the S&P 500 (SPX) lost 27.08 points, or 0.92%, to 2,912.43 and the Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) dropped 25.16 points, or 0.28%, to 8,889.55.
Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, all but consumer discretionary (SPLRCD) and communications services (SPLRCL) closed in negative territory, with energy companies (SPNY) suffering the largest percentage loss.
Earnings season continues apace, with 236 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported quarterly results. Of those, two-thirds have surprised consensus estimates to the upside, according to Refinitiv data. 
But there have been 90 negative pre-announcements in the first quarter, compared with 40 positive, and analysts see aggregate S&P 500 earnings dropping by a year-on-year rate of 14.4% in the first three months of 2020, per Refinitiv.
Amazon.com (O:AMZN) reported results after the closing bell. In post-market trading, its shares were down nearly 5%. Apple Inc (O:AAPL) earnings were expected soon.
 Facebook Inc  (O:FB) climbed 5.2% after the social media company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue.
American Airlines (O:AAL) posted its first quarterly loss since emerging from bankruptcy in 2013, sending its shares down 4.9%.
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.58-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.81-to-1 ratio favored decliners.
The S&P 500 posted three new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and four new lows. 

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.80 billion shares, compared with the 12.3 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Investing.com – The Dow notched its best month since 1987 despite ending the month on a sour note, paced by declines in financials and materials as investors mulled over further signs of the coronavirus-led damage on the economy.
The {{169|Dow Jones Industrial Average}} lost 1.2%, the S&P 500 fell 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 0.3%.
With signs that the U.S. consumer, the backbone of the economy, is in trouble as the jobless claims continue to mount, investors seemingly pulled their bullish bets on stocks.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims slowed to a pace of 3.8 million, compared with 4.4 million last week, but still above economists' forecasts of 3.5 million.
Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 7.5% last month, the steepest monthly decline on record.
Financials were among the biggest decliners, giving up its recent gains, as the weaker economic data cooled expectations that a partial economic reopening would kickstart the labor market and potentially lead to a decline in credit losses for big Wall Street banks.
But large-cap tech stocks proved a resilient, led by Facebook, as investors cheered bullish earnings.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rose 5.4% after the social media giant reported revenue that topped consensus estimates and said it was seeing signs of stability in ad revenue after a coronavirus-led slowdown in March.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained 1.1% as the tech giant beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.

Amazon.com shares lost 4.5% in after-hours trade following the report.
In a blow to margins, the company said it would spend its second-quarter profit on Covid-19 related expenses. 
""Under normal circumstances, in this coming Q2, we’d expect to make some $4 billion or more in operating profit. But these aren’t normal circumstances. Instead, we expect to spend the entirety of that $4 billion, and perhaps a bit more, on Covid-related expenses getting products to customers and keeping employees safe,"" said CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement.
""This includes investments in personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning of our facilities, less efficient process paths that better allow for effective social distancing, higher wages for hourly teams, and hundreds of millions to develop our own Covid-19 testing capabilities,"" Bezos added.
Amazon.com announced earnings per share of $5.01 on revenue of $75.45 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $6.34 on revenue of $72.9 billion.
That compared wtih an EPS of $7.09 on revenue of $59.7 billion in the same period a year before. Amazon.com had reported EPS of $6.47 on revenue of $87.44 billion in the previous quarter. 
Total revenue in North America was $46.1 billion, above consensus estimates of $44.3 billion, while international revenue was inline with Wall Street forecasts at $19.1 billion.
Amazon Web services, its cloud business, reported revenue of $10.2 billion, just below consensus of $10.3 billion consenses.
Looking ahead, the company guided second-quarter revenue within a range of $75 billion to $81 billion, compared with consensus estimates of $76.57 billion.
""The current crisis has separated Amazon from the rest of the pack,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. ""Even with the economy slipping into a deep recession and unemployment rates surging, consumers are flocking to Amazon to buy essential health and household products."""

BOSTON (Reuters) - An heir to a microwave snack fortune and a former chief executive of investment firm Pimco cannot use the coronavirus pandemic as a reason to avoid prison time for convictions in the U.S. college admissions scandal, a federal judge ruled on Thursday, although they can delay starting their sentences.
U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston said that while the public health crisis warranted delaying when Michelle Janavs and Douglas Hodge would report to prison, he would not allow them to serve their sentences at home instead.
Janavs, whose family's company created the microwavable food Hot Pockets, and Hodge, who served as CEO of Pimco from 2014 to 2016, had been scheduled next week to begin serving prison sentences of five and nine months, respectively.
They were sentenced in February after pleading guilty to participating in a scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a college admissions consultant through fraud and bribery to secure the admission of their children to top universities.
William ""Rick"" Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty in March 2019 to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and helping bribe university sports coaches to present his clients' children as fake athletic recruits.
As the COVID-19 outbreak worsened, lawyers for Janavs and Hodge asked the judge to allow them to serve their sentences in home detention, citing concerns about how the virus can spread within prisons.
Gorton said he was ""cognizant of the particular transmission risk in penitentiary facilities"" but would not ""forfeit his obligation to impose a sentence that is warranted by a defendant's criminal conduct.""
He instead said they could wait until June 30 to report to prison. If at that time the crisis remains, Gorton said they could renew their requests.
Their lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.
Since March 2019, 53 people have been charged connection with the college admissions scandal, including ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin, who is fighting the charges.
Janavs's father co-founded Chef America Inc, which created the microwave snack line Hot Pockets before being sold to Nestle SA (SIX:NESN) for $2.6 billion in 2002.
Prosecutors said Janavs paid Singer $100,000 to have a proctor correct her two daughters' ACT entrance exam answers and agreed to pay $200,000 to have one daughter admitted to the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California as a fake beach volleyball recruit. 

Hodge conspired to pay $850,000 in bribes to have four of his children admitted to USC and Georgetown University as fake athletic recruits, prosecutors said.

All of Greggs' more than 2,050 shops have been closed since March 24 when Britain went on coronavirus lockdown even though the government allowed takeaway outlets to stay open.
Greggs had said on Monday it planned to reopen 20 shops in the Newcastle, north east England, area from next Monday in a trial to see if it can operate effectively with social distancing measures as the lockdown is eased.
However, it has now had a change of heart.
""Due to significant interest in our 20-shop trial, and the risk that excessive numbers of customers may plan to visit Greggs, we will now initially operate these trials behind closed doors in order to effectively test our new operational safety measures,"" said a Greggs spokeswoman.
""We will continue to review this and will invite walk-in customers into our shops only when we can be confident of doing so in the controlled manner we intended.""
The reversal of the plan was first reported by the Financial Times.
Greggs had hoped that if feedback was positive from the trial it could move to phase two with 700 shops reopening.
It had cautioned that phase two would only be possible if the government has taken a first step in relaxing the lockdown which could be to reopen schools, allowing more people to return to work.
Greggs' working assumption was that schools would reopen on June 1, allowing the phase two shops to reopen on June 8.

The final phase of its initial plan was to open all shops with new operational measures in place by July 1, which is when the government's job retention furlough scheme is currently scheduled to end.

CHICAGO/BANGALORE (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is fueling demand for cardboard boxes - a boon for global food company Archer Daniels Midland Co's (N:ADM) industrial starches business - as consumers rush to order goods online amid widespread shutdowns, company executives said onThursday.
The starches, made from corn or wheat, are used as an adhesive in making corrugated cardboard.
Demand for ethanol biofuel the company produces has plummeted along with gasoline use, meanwhile, as the pandemic wrecks havoc on the global economy. But biodiesel demand was strong in North America as big-rig trucks raced to haul goods to warehouses as airlines grounded planes.
""These are extraordinary times,"" ADM Chief Executive Officer Juan Luciano said on an analyst call. 
ADM's first-quarter results on Wednesday beat analysts' expectations even as revenue slipped, offering the first look at how the pandemic is affecting the world's largest grain traders.
Global food supply chains are breaking, U.S. meat plants are shuttering, farmers are forced to destroy crops and animals, and thousands of U.S. meat and food-processing workers have been infected with the coronavirus.
While Luciano said the pandemic had not significantly interrupted ADM's operations, what the company has faced in recent weeks and months underscores how such disruptions are reshaping the global supply chain. 
Take corn oil, which is a byproduct of ethanol production. As U.S. ethanol production slowed, so did corn oil supply, Chief Financial Officer Ray Young said. Yet prices rose as demand surged from food manufacturers trying to meet consumer demand for fried snacks such as chips. 
Demand for soybean oil, used in food service, weakened, however.
ADM had its first coronavirus-related fatality among employees two weeks ago, Luciano said. The pandemic also prompted ADM to cut capital spending plans for 2020, putting it closer to $800 million and lower than initial guidance, Young said.
While ADM executives are encouraged by agricultural purchases made by China so far, the company does expect its second-quarter results from its Ag Services and Oilseeds unit - its largest business in terms of revenue - to be lower sequentially.
Rival  Bunge  (NYSE:BG) Ltd is scheduled to report its first quarter results on May 6. Last month, rival commodities trader Cargill Inc (CARG.UL), which is privately held, canceled its fiscal-third-quarter earnings release due to the pandemic. 
ADM executives said they are already seeing consumer trends shifting in Asia as cities there reopen, restaurants resume business and people return to work.

While Asia's food service sector has not fully rebounded, ""we have started to see, over the last two weeks, that things are becoming a little bit better"" as businesses begin to reopen, Luciano said.

The insurance scheme, which costs 15 euros to 20 euros a month, allows new car buyers to delay monthly payments until they are rehired, Emilio Herrera, chief operating officer for Kia Motors Europe, said on Thursday.
""We are in discussions over how to implement it in the majority of markets in Europe. We want it in place as soon as markets reopen in May,"" Herrera said.
Santander (MC:SAN) Consumer Finance provides the insurance for Kia customers in several European markets, including in Germany, Kia said.
Government stimulus measures will also be needed to revive the economy, Herrera said. 
""We need to put in place scrappage plans like in 2009,"" Herrera said. Combined with measures like unemployment insurance these steps may become confident enough to purchase a car,"" Herrera said.
Potential stimulus plans should help cut carbon pollution, but also incentivise customers to buy all categories of car, not just electric and hybrid vehicles, he said. 
""Electrified cars are much more expensive than combustion-engined vehicles,"" Herrera noted, adding that in times of a crisis, consumers tend to make conservative buying choices. 
The crisis has already hit demand badly, with sales down more than 25% in the first quarter. April will be the worse, showing declines of around 70%, with demand expected to improve thereafter, Herrera said. 
In Germany, where smaller car showrooms have been allowed to open for the past week, traffic is 50% below pre-crisis levels, Herrera said.

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 03:15PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Wells Fargo shifts energy bankers to focus on bankruptcies,"By Imani Moise and David French
(Reuters) -  Wells Fargo  & Co (N:WFC) has revived its special group for bad energy loans in recent weeks as the bank braces for more pain from the sharp downturn in oil prices, people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Sitting inside the credit-resolution group, where Wells Fargo handles struggling borrowers, the team includes many bankers who previously worked with the same oil and gas producers in its investment bank.
They work alongside bankruptcy specialists who have been reassigned to focus exclusively on energy to help Wells Fargo wade through the expected flood of restructurings.
""It's a bloodbath,"" said one person with knowledge of the bank's oil and gas portfolio, who was not authorized to speak publicly.
Wells Fargo spokeswoman Michelle Palomino said Wells Fargo maintains a strong energy and power group within its corporate and investment bank. The bank is committed to helping borrowers in the energy industry during this challenging time, she added.
Global energy markets are awash with crude oil because of a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia that boosted supply while demand was cratering due to the global coronavirus outbreak. The U.S. benchmark oil price briefly traded negatively last week for the first time in history.
The U.S. energy industry was already struggling with high debt levels and profitability problems before this maelstrom.
Bankruptcies have begun, with an April 7 survey of producers by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City forecasting 40% would be insolvent within a year if oil prices were $30 per barrel. That is nearly double the current value. [O/R]
Banks have worried for months about their loans to U.S. oil and gas producers, which could not tap other avenues to raise money. Lenders have been trying to pare back exposure by, for instance, ascribing less value to the collateral behind reserve-based loans (RBLs), the energy industry's main source of cash.
Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) are considered to be the two largest lenders to U.S. energy companies.  Citigroup  Inc (N:C) had the largest energy loan book of any U.S. bank at the end of 2019 because of its international business.
As of the end of March, Wells Fargo had $14.3 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding, according to filings.
REVIVALS
Roughly 15% of Wells Fargo's oil and gas team now reports to the credit resolution group on a special energy team, two bank sources said. The corporate banking energy group had already been reduced by about 7% after a round of layoffs last summer.
Bart Schouest, who heads Wells Fargo's energy lending unit, and Michael Thomas, a restructuring executive, are leading the new team.
It is reminiscent of another workout team Wells Fargo assembled in 2015, as oil was plunging from over $100 per barrel the prior year to a nadir of $26 in early 2016.
That group wound down in 2017 as the market recovered, although not before Wells had experienced billions of dollars in losses on its energy book.
Wells Fargo's exposure to the industry has fallen by roughly $3 billion since then and bank sources say the bank learned lessons that should help it navigate this storm, but many are still preparing for the worst.
The industry's largest lenders have studied how they would take ownership of energy assets if borrowers proved unable to repay their debts to banks, and some are preparing to set up legal entities which would own stakes in seized properties.

Wells Fargo is instead hoping to capitalize of its internal resources. The special workout team is a way for Wells Fargo to manage relationships during the current downturn, hoping to maintain ties with those that survive, sources said.

1371,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 03:11PM ET</span>","Ford wants to restart U.S. car plants shut by coronavirus, if it can convince union","By Ben Klayman
DETROIT (Reuters) -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Thursday outlined the safety measures it will institute to restart its most profitable U.S. plants amid the coronavirus pandemic, expanding on similar efforts by General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) to convince leaders of the United Auto Workers union to send members back to work. 
The UAW so far has not agreed to endorse reopening U.S. auto plants, even as workers in Europe and Asia are going back to their jobs. Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. 
Billions of dollars in revenue and profits are riding on how quickly Ford and its U.S. rivals can convince the UAW and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer that it is safe to return to work. The UAW declared that early May was too soon to reopen, and since then has not agreed to a date.
Without Michigan, the Detroit Three and other automakers operating in the United States cannot build vehicles. Ford executives highlighted that the U.S. auto sector accounts for 6% of U.S. economic output.
Ford has the largest unionized workforce in the United States with about 56,000 UAW members. The F-series pickup trucks UAW workers build account for $50 billion in annual revenue, Ford said.
""It's just really now getting the clarity from our government leaders because we're ready,"" Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said on a conference call with reporters.
Farley added he would ""absolutely"" be comfortable having his family work in a Ford plant given the steps the company has taken to ensure employee safety. 
UAW President Rory Gamble said the union is negotiating with the Detroit automakers about safely reopening their U.S. plants. Among the issues on the table are what types of protective gear workers should have, how fast assembly lines should move and how much testing should be done. 
""The UAW is asking for as much testing as is possible to prevent exposure to the virus,"" Gamble said in a Thursday statement.
Ford's human resources chief Kiersten Robinson said the automaker will not have a ""reliable and scalable testing solution"" for COVID-19 for several weeks if not months and the company was forming a task force to see how it can move faster to achieve that. 
""Longer term, we think it will be critical,"" she said. ""Hopefully, in coming weeks or months, it will be part of our protocol."" 
Ford manufacturing chief Gary Johnson said any worker who worried they had been exposed would be sent to a hospital for testing and the UAW had agreed to that process.
Johnson said the company was not planning to provide workers with N95 respiratory masks, which are designed to filter 95% of airborne particles, as the regular face masks and shields were good enough. 
Slowing the speed of production lines in plants would be too complex, he added. Some union leaders have suggested lines could be slowed to allow for greater physical separation between workers. 
What Ford will do in its plants is no-touch doors, require use of personal protective equipment like face masks and shields, install barriers where employees must work closely together, use thermal scanning to screen employees for fevers and do heavy sanitizing of work areas.
Ford executives said they have been using the same safety protocols already in China, where production restarted in late February. 
The Dearborn, Michigan-based company did not provide a date for restarting U.S. factories. Ford did say white-collar workers would likely return to their offices in late June or early July.
Officials in Whitmer's office could not immediately be reached to comment on Thursday. She extended the state's stay-at-home order through May 15 but has lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio is allowing manufacturing to resume on Monday.
In its restart playbook, GM's strategy relies heavily on many of the same approaches as Ford, but does not address assembly line workstations. The No. 1 U.S. automaker has not provided a target for a U.S. restart.
FCA has retreated from its plan to restart North American operations on May 3 given Michigan's extended stay-at-home order. It is using similar measures to Ford. Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk was highly critical on Wednesday of the various states' stay-at-home orders, which have idled the electric carmaker's California plant. He called the policies ""fascist.""

Investing.com – Wall Street fell on Thursday as investors weighed up earnings from corporates against further data underscoring the Covid-19 hit to the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.52%, the S&P 500 lost 1.35%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.83%.
The reopening of the economy has stoked some investor hopes the downturn in the economy may not be as bad as many fear, but the ongoing surge in jobless claims and signs the consumer is trouble has weighed on sentiment.
The U.S. Department of Labor reported Thursday that initial jobless claims rose by 3.8 million, compared with 4.4 million last week, missing economists' forecasts of 3.5 million.
Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, fell 7.5% last month, the steepest monthly decline on record.
The grim economic background overshadowed a surge in large-cap tech stocks, led by Facebook, as investors cheered bullish earnings.
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) rose 4.5% after the social media giant reported revenue that topped consensus estimates and said it was seeing signs of stability in ad revenue after a coronavirus-led slowdown in March.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gained 0.5% as the tech giant beat estimates on both the top and bottom lines.  
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), meanwhile, fell 9% on fears its slowing ad revenue, which fell 27% from March 11 to March 31, is set to continue.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), both of which report earnings after the bell, were up 1.28% and 2.44% respectively.
Beyond tech, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) gave up some gains to trade 4% lower even as the electric automaker's surprise quarterly profit triggered a wave of price target upgrades from Wall Street firms.
Energy, meanwhile, was among the biggest decliners, shrugging off a jump in oil prices, even as concerns of supply constraints persist.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Embraer and Boeing's $4.2 billion deal ruled out pandemic as pretext to cancel,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's recently aborted $4.2 billion agreement to buy the commercial jet-making operations of Brazil's Embraer specifically forbade either party from calling it off because of a pandemic or a global economic recession, Reuters has found. 
As the aviation industry grapples with its worst crisis in generations due to the coronavirus pandemic, analysts now say the deal's contract backed Boeing into a corner when financial conditions worsened globally, pushing it to find a different exit route on the deal. Boeing says it backed out because Embraer failed to meet unnamed conditions. 
Potential dealbreakers are often described in contracts as material adverse events. But Boeing and Embraer wrote out a laundry list in the contract signed in January 2019, which Reuters reviewed, of 10 conditions that would not qualify as the kind of material adverse events that could be a pretext for cancelling the deal. A pandemic and any changes to the global economy were among them.
On Wednesday, S&P lowered Boeing's credit rating to just one notch above junk. Meanwhile, the U.S. planemaker announced it would lay off 16,000 people - close to the total number of workers Embraer employs - and that it had already drawn down its entire credit line and was working on a bond offering.
""We will be a smaller company for a while,"" Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said on Wednesday after the planemaker disclosed quarterly results. 
However, just days earlier, when Boeing called off its deal with Embraer, the U.S. planemaker did not mention adverse conditions within the company or the economy. Instead, it said its ex partner ""failed to satisfy a number of important conditions in the contract."" 
Boeing has not publicly disclosed what those conditions were, but sources told Reuters over the weekend that the U.S. planemaker raised objections about funding and legal matters. 
Embraer says it did indeed meet all conditions and has taken Boeing to arbitration. 
Either way, the contract says Boeing could have waived any unmet conditions on the part of Embraer, but the U.S. planemaker decided not to do so and canceled the deal instead. 
Both Embraer and Boeing declined to comment on the contract. 
""Boeing couldn't afford this deal and they found a way to get out of their obligations,"" said Scott Hamilton, a longtime aviation consultant at Leeham Company. ""They just had to find a way to axe the deal and retain those $4 billion.""
Under the contract signed in January 2019, Boeing would have taken over Embraer's commercial aviation unit, paying $4.21 billion for an 80% stake. At the time, demand for jets was soaring with no end in sight and Embraer was feeling the pinch of fighting against titans Boeing and Airbus as an independent planemaker. 
The coronavirus crisis worsened in March and Boeing started openly discussing some form of U.S. government assistance, as it was also getting nearer to closing the Embraer deal. Several countries had granted antitrust approvals and Embraer had finished carving out its commercial aviation unit as well as built new headquarters for after Boeing's takeover.
Besides ""epidemics or pandemics,"" and changes in the world's economy, wars and natural disasters were also barred as reasons to cancel the deal. 
Embraer's market value fell by over two-thirds to $1 billion during the crisis, leading analysts to begin worrying that the deal would fall apart or at least be renegotiated.
""On an ordinary basis, Boeing would have repriced the deal,"" Hamilton said. 
But the contract banned Boeing from walking away due to ""any change in the market price"" of Embraer shares. Other conditions that would not allow Boeing to walk away included if Embraer's credit ratings were downgraded or if it failed to meet its own revenue or earnings forecasts. 

It is unclear who requested that the contract be this restrictive.

Buffett, who is Berkshire's chairman and chief executive officer, has been notably quiet about the coronavirus, ever since calling the COVID-19 outbreak and plunging oil prices ""a big one-two punch"" in early March.
He has also eschewed the kind of splashy investments, such as in  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (N:GS), he made during in the 2008 financial crisis.
Shareholders nonetheless said they expect Buffett to show Berkshire can successfully weather a deep recession.
""He's an optimist,"" said Paul Lountzis, president of Lountzis Asset Management LLC, who invests 11% of assets he oversees in Berkshire stock. ""He will reflect on the country's resilience, and how we'll overcome this, as we have overcome so many other challenges. That's how he looks at the world.""
ABEL TAKES STAGE
Buffett, 89, will be joined by Greg Abel, 57, a vice chairman overseeing Berkshire's non-insurance operating businesses, in answering shareholder questions at the meeting.
Abel and Ajit Jain, another vice chairman, have long been viewed as Buffett's likeliest successors as CEO.
Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 96, who normally answers shareholder questions with Buffett, and Jain, 68, will not be in attendance. Unlike Abel, both live far from Omaha.
Berkshire is also likely on Saturday morning to report a huge first-quarter net loss, as investments such as  American Express  (N:AXP), Bank of America (N:BAC) and the four largest U.S. airlines sank in value.
Many investors will focus on the quarterly performance of Berkshire's more than 90 operating businesses, which in 2019 posted an average $6 billion of quarterly profit.
The pandemic's impact may be evident in falling volumes at the BNSF railroad, premium waivers and lower accident claims at the Geico auto insurer, and store closures by retailers such as See's Candies and the Nebraska Furniture Mart. 
""As goes Berkshire, so goes the economy,"" said Lawrence Cunningham, a George Washington University law professor who has published several books on Berkshire.
UNDERPERFORMANCE PERSISTS
Investors will also look for how far Berkshire dipped into its $128 billion year-end cash hoard, whether through investments in other stocks or repurchases of its own.
Munger told The Wall Street Journal two weeks ago that Berkshire's phone is not ""ringing off the hook"" with companies seeking support.
Bill Smead, chief executive of Smead Capital Management in Seattle, likened the environment to the 1974 bear market, when Buffett told Forbes magazine he felt like an ""oversexed man in a harem"" when looking for investment opportunities.
Berkshire, however, was then far smaller than the $461 billion behemoth it has become.
""You can't pour water from a barrel into a teacup,"" Smead said, while adding he wished Buffett would admit stockpiling cash was a mistake: ""He needs to work for the benefit of those who, like him, have over 90% of their net worth in the company.""
Through Wednesday, Berkshire's stock price was down 16% in 2020, versus a 9% drop in the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPX).
And last year, Berkshire lagged the index by 20.5 percentage points, including dividends.
Berkshire said Buffett and Abel will not be given shareholder questions in advance, and will not talk about specific Berkshire investments. That suggests that Berkshire's holdings in banks, airlines and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) may be off-limits.

Cunningham said it will be important for Abel to show how his core values align with Berkshire's, and to ""convey a sense of himself.""

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>","Macy's reopening 68 stores, targets all within six weeks as U.S. curbs loosen","By Melissa Fares
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Macy's Inc (NYSE:M) plans to reopen 68 U.S. stores on Monday in states that have loosened coronavirus lockdowns, the department store operator said on Thursday, as more retailers sought to get business going after a crushing month of closures.
Cincinnati, Ohio-based Macy's, the largest U.S. department store operator by sales, said it expects to have all of its roughly 775 stores reopened in six weeks, if infection rates taper off as projected and state and local governments allow it. 
The next batch of roughly 50 stores is scheduled to reopen on May 11, it said. At this time, the company is not naming which store locations will reopen, a spokeswoman said.
All of its stores have been closed since March 18.
However, the shopping experience will be greatly changed, as many shoppers remain wary about the virus. For instance, the number of fitting rooms offered to shoppers at one time will be reduced and sanitized frequently. Plexiglas will be at each cash register, signs will alert shoppers to keep 6 feet apart, beauty consultations will be ""no-touch"" only, and more. The reopened stores will operate on reduced hours from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Shares of Macy's, which also owns the Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury chains, were down roughly 6.5% in afternoon trading.
Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Macy's hired investment bank Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) Ltd to explore options for bolstering its finances after the department store operator lost most of its revenue because of its decision to shut down all its stores amid the outbreak, people familiar with the matter said.
The reopening plan, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, follows moves by other major retailers judged ""non-essential"" in the crisis to get business at their physical stores going again, albeit slowly and with restrictions in place. 
Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG), America's biggest mall operator, expects to open 49 properties starting Friday based on current state and/or local stay-at-home or closure orders. The majority of reopenings are expected in the South, where restrictions have loosened up the most thus far in the United States.
 Coach  handbag maker Tapestry (NYSE:TPR) Inc also said on Thursday it would start reopening some stores in North America, as it tries to recover from the damage to its sales caused by the lockdowns.
""Keeping stores closed isn't helping the retailers or malls. ... They don't have cash to last too much longer,"" Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at  Forrester Research  (NASDAQ:FORR), said of retailers starting to reopen stores for business. ""Opening them may help to salvage some sales especially so long as they can generate more revenue than their labor costs.""

The most cash-constrained will likely reopen soon, Kodali added, while others ""may have the luxury to hold out longer.""

Google announced the $2.1 billion deal in November, as it seeks to compete with Apple (O:AAPL) and Samsung (KS:005930) in the market for fitness trackers and smart watches. The deal is being evaluated by the U.S. Justice Department to ensure it complies with antitrust law.
Public Knowledge and the Consumer Federation of America wrote in a letter to Attorney General William Barr that because Google has few direct competitors that nascent or potential competition becomes more important.
""It is critical to consider what assets could very effectively offer an avenue for expansion ... if allowed to remain independent and team up with dominant platform adversaries,"" they wrote in the letter, which was dated on Wednesday and released on Thursday.
Fitbit, whose fitness trackers and other devices monitorusers' daily steps, calories burned and distance traveled,would give the U.S. tech giant access to a trove of health data.
The groups also argued that although Google says it does not plan to use data collected by Fitbit for advertising, it could be valuable to others.
""By keeping the ongoing data streams that Fitbit has access to out of the hands of a competitor or potential competitor, Google may prevent competition it could otherwise face,"" the letter said.
Google declined to comment on the letter but has previously noted that it has no products in the fitness wearables sector, and provides tools for users to control their data, including exporting it to other platforms.
A European Union privacy watchdog, the European Data Protection Board, warned that the purchase could pose privacy risks.

The Justice Department had no immediate comment on the letter.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 12:20PM ET</span>",JPMorgan says it has handled $17.8 billion under emergency aid program,"By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall and Michelle Price
NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (N:JPM) said it has submitted roughly 220,000 applications worth $17.8 billion to the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses hurt by the coronavirus shutdown. 
The bank shared the number in a memo sent to customers late on Wednesday that was apparently meant to address a decision by the government to temporarily shut the program to big banks. In an email to Reuters on Thursday, JPMorgan said the average loan size was around $81,000, and roughly half of the applications were filed by businesses with fewer than five employees.
About 80% of the applications, which were submitted earlier this week, were for less than $100,000 and about 40% were for less than $25,000, the bank said. 
The SBA said that as of 5 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, 5,300 lenders had originated 960,000 loans worth nearly $90 billion in total, suggesting JPMorgan could account for nearly 20% of the value of all loans submitted as of Wednesday. 
However, big banks say they are still in the dark about the status of one-off bulk submissions of 5,000 or more loans they made this week as a result of a last-minute change to the submission rules. The SBA is processing those for the banks to reduce strain on the system, but it remains unclear if they have been approved, banks said. 
The SBA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
JPMorgan's memo followed a decision by the SBA and U.S. Treasury to shut banks with more than $1 billion in assets out of the SBA's loan processing portal from 4 p.m. EDT until midnight on Wednesday, in order to ensure ""fair access,"" they said. 
The SBA move aimed to address worries that small lenders which predominantly serve minority-owned businesses would have to compete with big banks for the program's more than $310 billion in funds after they exhausted money ring-fenced for them on Tuesday.
The decision angered big banks, which are sitting on hundreds of thousands of applications from small businesses and which had been criticized by policymakers for failing to get funds to needy clients during the program's first round.
Created as part of a $2.3 trillion congressional economic relief package, the program allows small businesses hurt by the epidemic to apply for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans with participating banks.
Wednesday's announcement was the latest twist for the program, which has been beset by technology and paperwork issues and subject to intense scrutiny due to worries the money was not getting to the most-deserving companies.
During a second round announced on Monday, Congress ring-fenced $30 billion of the funds for banks with less than $10 billion in assets and other community lending groups that predominantly serve minority-owned businesses, amid fears that the country's biggest banks would suck up the funds.

With so much pent-up demand, that pot of cash was exhausted just one day later, sparking worries businesses owned by people of color may miss out on the loans.

The ratings agency said the trailing 12-month speculative-grade default rate for emerging market firms would rise to between 7.8% and 11.2% by the end of 2020, from the low level of 2.2% in March.
The rate will then rise further by March 2021 to the 8.3% to 13.7% range, it forecast.
""The global spread of the coronavirus has led to business closures and restrictions on social interactions in many countries,"" Moody's said in a report. 
""The collapse in domestic aggregate demand and export demand has weakened EM (emerging market) corporate profitability and liquidity.""
Many low-rated emerging market governments were poorly prepared to deal with a large public health crisis and had limited fiscal and monetary capacity to stimulate their economies, it said.
Depressed oil prices will likely persist during the year, adding another strain to exporters of the commodity, it added.

Alexander von zur Muehlen, currently head of strategy at the loss-making bank, will replace Werner Steinmueller, who is retiring in a long-expected move. 
Von zur Muehlen, who has been with Deutsche since 1998, was instrumental in merger talks with rival Commerzbank (DE:CBKG), that were aborted and in plan to shed 18,000 staff in a 7.4 billion euro ($8.05 billion) overhaul.
Deutsche, still in the throes of that revamp, is expected to post a sixth consecutive loss this year, according to analysts, and is reeling from the shock of the coronavirus outbreak.
Deutsche believes Asia-Pacific, with 13% of the bank's revenue and 22% of staff, offers growth potential, particularly for its corporate bank as it serves German heavyweights like Siemens in the region.
Deutsche Chairman Paul Achleitner said in a statement that Von zur Muehlen ""possesses all the skills and attributes needed to ... further advance our regional strategy.""
The decision was finalised on Thursday at a meeting of the bank's supervisory board.

He will be based either in Singapore or Hong Kong and will assume responsibilities in August.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",British Airways plans to lay off a quarter of pilots: letter,"PARIS (Reuters) - British Airways is seeking to lay off a quarter of its pilots as it slashes costs to weather the coronavirus crisis, according to a letter sent to their union and seen by Reuters.
BA intends to cut 1,130 of its 4,346 flight captain and co-pilot jobs, the IAG-owned (L:ICAG) airline's head of flight operations told the BALPA union in the letter.
Under plans revealed on Wednesday, the airline is also planning ""significant"" cuts to its 16,500 cabin crew in response to the pandemic, which has all but halted traffic.
""In a short space of time the situation has significantly deteriorated,"" BA's flight operations chief said in the April 28 letter to pilots. ""There are no clear signs of improvement in air passenger demand.""
BA declined to comment on the planned layoffs, which were first reported by Sky News. 
Rivals Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) are putting off redundancies until they finalise government bailout deals worth billions of euros. But IAG has set a different course - pursuing 12,000 job cuts and productivity gains from the remaining 30,000 employees, without seeking rescue aid.
The BA letter invoked rivals' aid to justify proposals for pilot cuts that go deeper than fleet reductions, by assigning fewer flight crew to each plane on more flexible terms.
""It is worth noting that many of British Airways' competitors in Europe and globally are receiving state aid in various forms,"" the flight operations executive wrote to BALPA union negotiator John Moore.
""The resulting competitive environment will create a distorted market where some of those competitors will have the option to provide overcapacity and lower fares.""
IAG, which also owns Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, has reaped the rewards of past cost-cutting that its main European rivals have struggled to match.
Chief Executive Willie Walsh, who postponed his retirement to steer the group through the crisis, has been a vocal opponent of state support over the years. Like many other major carriers, however, BA has used public funding to furlough tens of thousands of staff.
In a move that some union officials described as provocative, BA told pilots they should expect no more than their minimum entitlements in severance pay.
""Under the current circumstances, the cost of delivering any enhanced voluntary redundancy programme will now be prohibitively expensive,"" the letter said.
""Subject to consultation, we are proposing to meet minimum statutory obligations only, along with any contractual notice pay.""
Besides reducing its planned fleet, BA told pilots it was pursuing ""flexibility and efficiency changes"" that would account for 15% of the redundancies. ""Those remaining in employment are also likely to be impacted,"" the letter added.
In a separate message to British Airways staff this week, the airline's CEO Alex Cruz had warned there was ""no government bailout standing by"" and jobs would have to go.

1394,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Equality key to rescuing U.S.-China business ties: U.S. business lobby,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Recent strains in the relationship between the United States and China make it especially important to establish a policy of 'competitive neutrality' the American Chamber of Commerce in China said on Thursday.
The chamber, long considered a steadying hand in a relationship fraught with geopolitical tension, has advocated a harder line on China's trade practices and investment policies over the past few years.
Progress was made earlier this year towards resolving a bitter trade dispute with an initial deal and the rollback of some tariffs, but a blame game on how the COVID-19 pandemic has been handled has raised tension again.
In a near 500-page long annual white paper, the Chamber, also known as AmCham, listed hurdles to what it described as a truly level playing field that could restore trust and stop a downward spiral in bilateral relations.
President Donald Trump has long railed at China for not allowing U.S. companies the same access as Chinese companies get in the United States; the chamber said questions were also being raised internationally about the issue.
""Enacting a policy of 'competitive neutrality' is especially important given the increasing scrutiny facing the US-China commercial relationship,"" the AmCham said.
Beijing has repeatedly said it treats foreign and domestic firms equally and welcomes foreign investment.
The chamber said long-standing structural issues underlining a lack of transparency in China's economic system remained unresolved.
""U.S. companies continue to face an uncertain operating environment in China,"" said the AmCham, which found in a February survey that nearly a third of U.S. companies had seen revenues slashed as the coronavirus outbreak disrupted activity.
While a new foreign investment law and other measures were encouraging, it said, opaque regulatory processes, the favoring of domestic champions under a state-led development model, and weakness in intellectual property protection continued to hamper the operations of U.S. businesses.
It also expressed concern about the general nature of many of the provisions of the foreign investment law, saying implementation could be sketchy.
""Unfortunately, previous bilateral dialogues and other mechanisms have not generated the results that are needed to sustain healthy, balanced, and mutually beneficial economic relations,"" said Greg Gilligan, the chairman of AmCham China.
COMMUNIST PARTY CELLS
In a sign of Beijing's greater control, over 50% of U.S. companies surveyed for the new white paper said they had been required to establish Communist Party cells. However, the survey showed only 7% reported a negative impact from having done so, with 5% saying they had benefited from the measure.
The white paper detailed operational challenges encountered by sectors ranging from auto to finance alongside a list of recommendations for Chinese policymakers. Over 80 percent of the companies surveyed cited market access restrictions, particularly in the consumer and technology sectors.
For example, some foreign companies still met hurdles during business license application procedures despite moves by China to lift equity caps and lift joint venture restrictions.
Chinese regulatory authorities should recognize distinctive characteristics of foreign bank operations and apply differential regulatory procedures accordingly, the chamber said.

It urged greater inclusion of foreign financial institutions in the onshore fixed income market, approval for financial firms' foreign entities to serve as Bond Connect market makers, and expanded access to hedging and derivatives tools for onshore A-share markets.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 11:15AM ET</span>","American Airlines posts $2.2 billion loss on pandemic, first since bankruptcy exit","By Sanjana Shivdas and Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - American Airlines (O:AAL) on Thursday posted a $2.2 billion net loss, its first quarterly loss since emerging from bankruptcy in 2013, and warned of a roughly $70 million per day cash burn in the second quarter as the coronavirus pandemic halts travel.
Shares were down 4% at $12.11.
Airlines - among the sectors hardest-hit by the pandemic - have grounded jets, canceled flights and suspended dividends and share buybacks among measures to shore up cash. 
""We all expect that recovery will be slow and demand for air travel will be suppressed for quite some time,"" Chief Executive Doug Parker told investors. 
The U.S. airline swung to a net loss of $2.2 billion in the first quarter to March 31 from a $185 million profit a year earlier. 
Excluding items like fleet retirement costs, the net loss was $1.1 billion, or $2.65 per share, below analyst estimates of a $2.33 per share loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Total operating revenue declined nearly 20% to $8.5 billion.
The pandemic ended one of the longest expansion in U.S. history, with the nation's economy contracting at its sharpest pace since the Great Recession in the first quarter. Airline executives have warned that demand may not recover to 2019 levels for years. 
American has already reduced its passenger flight schedule by about 80% in both April and May and is running some cargo-only flights. Its June capacity will be down 70%, including a much-reduced international schedule.
The carrier has also extended flight cancellations in and out of the New York area, one of the hardest hit by COVID-19 cases, into May, according to a memo to pilots seen by Reuters.
American sees liquidity at $11 billion in the second quarter, up from $6.8 billion in the first, and Parker said on a conference call that the daily cash burn should slow to about $50 million in June.
Its overall cash position will be helped by a $4.75 billion government loan under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, for which it will have to pledge a portion of its assets as collateral.
The U.S. Treasury is negotiating the terms of those loans with each airline based on each company's credit ratings. For American, the interest rate will be a little over 4%, Parker said.
Following a recent appraisal, American said it believes its unencumbered assets are worth over $10 billion, excluding the value of its AAdvantage loyalty program.
It is also receiving $5.8 billion in payroll aid, which bars airlines from cutting pay or jobs through Sept. 30.
However, Parker warned that in the fall, ""we'll have more team members than we have work for.""

""Hopefully we can manage through that without having to do furloughs.""

Investing.com - Hedge fund manager David Einhorn tweeted out Thursday another letter sent to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk questioning the automaker’s financial results.
Greenlight Capital founder Einhorn, who tweeted out a letter in November questioning whether Tesla’s accounts receivable “even exist,” tweeted out another letter today asking for explanations about its auto gross margin reported yesterday.
“This quarter your production was lower and split across two factories, affecting cost absorption, particularly in Fremont,” Einhorn wrote. “Your average selling price was lower. Your mix had fewer high margin models S/X. You ramped up Model Y. Both factories were interrupted driving up costs. And, though you didn’t discuss it, currency should have hit your margin 2-3% compared to last quarter.”
“All of these factors appear to be headwinds to your auto gross margin (excluding Regulatory credit sales) – which barely budged,” he said.
Tesla reported first-quarter auto gross margin of 25.5%, up from 22.5% in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Tesla rose 4.3% in morning trading.

BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (N:BLK) on Thursday said it named London-based financial executive Sandy Boss as its new head of investment stewardship, bringing a more international structure to the top asset manager's voting on topics like climate change and social issues.
Boss, an American, will remain in London and take over duties previously held by the company's vice-chair Barbara Novick, who is stepping back from her day-to-day roles, according to a memo from the firm's Chief Executive Larry Fink provided by a spokesman.
Boss is currently member of a risk committee for the Bank of England and a director of two public companies, according to BlackRock and to her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Under Novick, BlackRock - with roughly $7 trillion in assets under management - largely took a behind-the-scenes approach in its dealings with the large companies in its portfolios.
But under pressure from activists, this year Fink vowed to take a more aggressive approach especially on climate issues and other topics at companies where BlackRock is often among the top investors.
For instance, just on Tuesday BlackRock disclosed early details of its votes against four directors at  Boeing Co  (N:BA) over safety lapses.
BlackRock said Boss was not available to be interviewed.
Fink said in his note that Boss will join the company on Monday, reporting to him as Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Investment Stewardship. 
Among her reports will be Michelle Edkins, another high-profile BlackRock executive, who ""will be responsible globally for institutional relations, policy on investment stewardship issues, and communications related to BlackRock’s investment stewardship perspectives and activities,"" Fink said in the note.
Boss is also a former senior partner at McKinsey & Co. focused on financial institutions, capital markets, and risk management in Europe and the United States.

Output at the site, which made just under 350,000 vehicles last year and builds the Qashqai, Juke and Leaf models, has been suspended since March 17. 
""During this period the majority of plant employees will remain furloughed, and we are grateful for the government support that has enabled us to take this action,"" the company said in a statement.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>","McDonald's profit misses estimates, shares drop 4%","By Nivedita Balu and Hilary Russ
(Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday as some restaurants in Europe and elsewhere remained closed to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
Shares of McDonald's, a Dow 30 (DJI) component, fell more than 4% after Wall Street opened. The stock has lost about 5% so far this year.
Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski also said he believed the world's largest fast-food company ""reached a trough in terms of number of restaurants closed in late March.""
About 75% of its 39,000 restaurants around the world were operational as of Thursday, including almost all of its nearly 14,000 restaurants in the United States.
The company also said it had resumed operations in nearly all of its restaurants in China, where the virus was first detected late last year, although demand remained low as consumers had not fully returned to their routines.
In the United States, the company's biggest market, drive-thru orders have risen to 90% of sales during the outbreak, up from about 66% normally, and its ability to offer quick, affordable food will be an advantage in coming months, executives said.
""As markets start to open up, this desire to really return to familiar favorites, to brands that are known, is very, very powerful,"" Kempczinski said during an earnings call.
The health crisis, which has infected over a million in the United States and killed about 60,000, has forced government-led lockdowns.
That has led to losses for restaurants as they close completely or shift to carry-out, drive-thru and delivery, particularly in the United States. 
Earlier this month, McDonald's withdrew its outlook for the year, joining other restaurant chains, citing uncertainties related to the health crisis and its impact on global economic conditions.
The burger chain had pre-announced a 3.4% fall in first-quarter comparable store sales, with U.S. sales rising just 0.1% powered by strong demand before the pandemic.
In March alone, global comparable sales fell 22.2%, the company had said in early April.
Net income fell to $1.11 billion, or $1.47 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $1.33 billion, or $1.72 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.57 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Revenue fell 6.2% to $4.71 billion, but were above Wall Street estimates of $4.65 billion.
Even so, some analysts see the company as a safe bet for troubled times.

McDonald's offers ""appealing blue chip characteristics amid a fluid near term set-up,"" including ""the cleanest balance sheet in (quick-service restaurants), the benefits of scale that manifest in superior customer value perceptions and industry-leading U.S. franchisee cash flows,"" wrote Cowen analyst Andrew Charles in a note.

The average rate for a 30-year loan was 3.23%, down from 3.33% last week and the lowest in almost 50 years of data-keeping,  Freddie Mac  (OTC:FMCC) said in a statement Thursday. The previous record was 3.29%, reached in early March.
The pandemic-driven rush to the safety of Treasuries in the past two months has helped push down borrowing costs, making home purchases more affordable for buyers who can qualify for a loan. It’s a group that’s getting smaller as the economic standstill puts tens of millions of Americans out of work. Even those with the means to buy have held back while hunkered down in quarantine.
Contracts to purchase previously owned U.S. homes plunged in March by the most since 2010, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.
Buying will bounce back as the economy slowly reopens, according to Lawrence Yun, the Realtors group’s chief economist. Still, he projects a 14% decline in home sales for the year.

1404,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Crisis-torn airlines scramble to convert empty cabins to cargo,"By Allison Lampert and Jamie Freed
MONTREAL/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Once the airline industry's ugly ducklings, air freighters are now flying high as some of the only airplanes still criss-crossing the skies during the global coronavirus crisis. 
While these aerial juggernauts hauled freight for low margins, airlines lavished advertising on business travellers and tourists. But with these customers grounded, airlines are rushing to turn passenger planes into temporary cargo carriers.
Half of air cargo normally travels in the belly of passenger jets rather than dedicated freighters. But the grounding of two-thirds of the world's fleet has led to a scramble for cargo capacity for medical supplies and other goods.
Airlines saddled with the cost of unused planes are looking to modify cabin interiors to adjust to the new reality. And that is providing a surprise windfall for aircraft maintenance companies deprived of their normal trade of keeping passenger jets flying, industry executives told Reuters.
Germany's Lufthansa Technik AG, Canada's Avianor, Hong Kong's HAECO Group and Belgium's Akka Technologies are among those stripping out seats or adding nets and storage devices to cabins to cram in cargo instead of tourists.
""We have great demand. We have more than 40 airlines requesting a proposal,"" said Jens Weinreich, product manager at Lufthansa Technik, which has converted 18 cabins for various carriers and expects to modify 100 more.
Lufthansa-owned Austrian Airlines has begun to remove most passenger seats in some 777s, while Polish LOT and Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) are also examining freight makeovers.
Leeham analyst Bjorn Fehrm said airlines could keep running mixed cabins with passengers and cargo sharing the space even after the crisis, like a flying station-wagon.
""Freight prices can go back down quite a bit and it still makes sense,"" Fehrm said of the conversions. 
But while freight Investor Services said China-U.S. freight rates rose 22% last week due to demand for protective gear, cargo demand has been fickle in the past and the outlook for trade is uncertain in the wake of the pandemic.
""We have seen a real resurgence of freight in the past month ... but we are on the edge of a global recession and the normal pattern of recession should start to take hold,"" Stuart Hatcher, chief operating officer of IBA Aero, told a webinar
CARGO MINDSET
Avianor, which specializes in maintenance and cabins, said demand from Air Canada has helped overcome the slowdown, while European planemaker Airbus has come up with a scheme to turn cabins into temporary bays for freight pallets.
This is a change of mindset for airlines, who focus obsessively on cabin layouts to promote their customer brands.
Some previous Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737s operated by specialists like France's ASL Airlines allow three people to do a ""Quick Change"" in just 20 minutes, with rows of seats taken out through a side door to allow passengers to fly by day and cargo by night.
Newer jets tend to be optimised for passenger service and it takes a week to prepare one for cargo. 
But there could be other benefits to a mixture of cargo and people. HAECO said its product allows for a mix of passenger seats and freight, which would help with social distancing.
The surge in demand for cargo conversions has led airlines to appeal for a global set of rules from aviation authorities.
Akka Technologies is helping Franco-Italian ATR turn turboprops into medical equipment vehicles. It is also working on plans approved by EU regulators for A330s and Boeing 777s.
""For the time being, this will generate business for engineering houses such as ourselves. In the mid-term, the traffic will take time to recover,"" board member Charles Champion, a former Airbus engineering head, said.
Cabin modifications will not compensate entirely for the crisis that has caused widespread jobs cuts and forced airlines like Lufthansa to seek help, but will deliver some work, Lufthansa Technik modifications chief Henning Jochmann said.

""That will not save our lives ... but we do what we have to do.""

PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) PA> has put one of its historic buildings up for sale in Boulogne-Billancourt, the birthplace of the carmaker, to cut costs, three sources close to the company told Reuters.
The five-story building, located in the old part of Boulogne-Billancourt, a suburb on the outskirts of Paris, houses trade unions, sports facilities and archives.
The tenants have been told they can stay on after a new owner is found, the sources said.
""The goal is to sell the building, if possible this year. Management of the property division is currently working on a few projects of that kind,"" one of the sources said.
The French carmaker's plans to upgrade and expand its ""Technocentre"" in Guyancourt outside Paris, its largest research and development centre, could also be on put on hold, two of the sources said.
Renault declined comment.
Renault was already struggling before the coronavirus crisis hit sales and brought production to a halt. 
In February, the company reported its first loss in 10 years on faltering demand and lower income from its Japanese alliance partner Nissan (T:7201). 
Renault is due to outline some 2 billion euros in cost cuts from mid-May, alongside a joint strategy update with Nissan on how to revitalise their alliance, as the company tries to tackle shrinking margins.
On Wednesday, two sources close to the company told Reuters that Renault was also considering cutting the number of sub-contractors it uses to develop car models in its engineering division. That would potentially save the carmaker between 100 million to 200 million euros.
Renault, which is 15% owned by the French state, has been put under more pressure by the pandemic, and the government said last week it was working on a 5 billion euro aid package for the group. 
Renault's upgrade of its Technocentre includes the re-design of 12,000 workstations spread over seven buildings for an estimated cost of several hundred million euros.
To date, the group has started construction on one new building and expansion of parking lots. The company is now reviewing the rest of the project, initially projected to run until 2022.

""The project has not been stopped but put on pause,"" one of the sources said.

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened lower on Thursday, retracing some of Wednesday's gains after another big rise in initial jobless claims dented optimism about a quick recovery for the economy.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said another 3.84 million filed initial claims for jobless benefits last week, above expectations of 3.5 million but still a fourth straight weekly drop. Continuing claims at 17.99 million were below expectations but still a record high for recent history.
By 10:15 AM ET (1415 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 220 points or 0.9% at 24,414 points, while the S&P 500 was down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite outperformed, losing only 0.1%, insulated by stronger-than-expected quarterly updates on Wednesday evening from large caps Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). 
Gains were concentrated in the megacaps, with most of the rest of the market running out of steam after a relief rally that many say has baked in too optimistic a recovery scenario.
Facebook stock was up 6.6% after the social media giant reported that advertising revenue stabilized in April, supported by e-commerce and gaming companies aiming to cash in on the inability of the public to get out of the house for either recreation or shopping. 
Microsoft stock rose 1.0% after the software giant reported an across-the-board increase in revenue and a rise in earnings. Demand for its cloud hosting business Azure was a particular beneficiary of businesses' need to do more of their stuff online. Tesla, which reported a surprise profit for the quarter late on Wednesday, was also up 6.1%, despite not being able to name a date for the reopening of its Fremont factory (much to the disgust of its CEO Elon Musk).
On the busiest day of the earnings season, however, there were just as many low points. McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock fell 2.3% after reporting a 6% drop in quarterly sales, while Macy’s (NYSE:M) couldn't get a break even after announcing it aims to reopen 68 of its stores from Monday, and the rest of its chain within six weeks. Macy's stock fell 3.0%.
Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) fell 7.2% as the signs of economic reopening took away what the lockdowns had given, while the biggest decline was in Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) ADRs, which tumbled over 11% as the company cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War. The stock got no support from another sharp rise in U.S. crude prices as traders moved to price in an easing of the supply/demand imbalance.

1421,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>","MENA managers to boost Egypt funds, say Saudi Arabia and UAE most vulnerable: Reuters poll","By Nafisa Eltahir
DUBAI (Reuters) - Middle Eastern fund managers plan to increase investments in Egypt in the current quarter, according to a Reuters poll, and say Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are most vulnerable to tumbling oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic.
The region, which is mostly under lockdown as it deals with the outbreak, is home to many oil producers, who have seen the price of their main resource tumble as they spend to help support their economies.
""Overall we expect the combination of COVID-19 and low oil prices to weigh on regional GDP growth, stress some of the weak corporate balance sheets and filter into earnings downgrades over the next few quarters,"" said Mohamed Eljamal of Waha Capital.
Dubai, whose stock index (DFMGI) has fallen 27% this year, has been the worst-hit Gulf market, as a coronavirus-related shutdown choked its tourism and aviation industry.
The main index in oil producer Abu Dhabi (ADI) is down nearly 17% this year as well.
The majority of the managers said that the UAE, and particularly Dubai, would be the market worst hit by the coronavirus crisis.
However, the managers point to a rebound in share prices this month as evidence that some stocks are now seen as undervalued, and that investments pulled out of harder-hit sectors are finding new homes.
Four of the seven managers polled said they would still increase their allocations in the UAE this quarter. Dubai is up about 14% since March 31, and Abu Dhabi is up 13%.
Managers said they had pulled out of stocks in the tourism, trade and service sectors.
""We have instead purchased some fundamentally strong names with strong balance sheets across markets which we think were unfairly punished due to a combination of corona and oil slump,"" said Richard Lee, Senior Portfolio Manager, Emirates NBD Asset Management.
Eljamal said: ""We have ... significantly raised cash and (are) currently ready to hunt for bargains over the next few months.""
Most managers said that Saudi Arabia would be the market most affected by the oil price slump.
Data this week showed Saudi central bank foreign reserves had fallen in March at their fastest rate in at least 20 years and to their lowest since 2011, while the kingdom slipped into a $9 billion budget deficit in the first quarter.
Four of the seven polled said they would keep their levels of allocation steady for the upcoming quarter, although at least one had reduced levels in the last quarter.
The Saudi stock index (TASI) is down 15% year-to-date, but up around 9% this quarter.
Despite reducing exposure to vulnerable stocks in the petrochemical sector, ""it also gave us an opportunity to invest in interesting names that were earlier trading at lofty valuations but are trading at more reasonable valuations now"", said Lee.
The majority of fund managers polled said they would increase their allocations in Egypt, despite that market's exposure to coronavirus due to its dependence on tourism and remittances from the Gulf.
Despite losing almost a quarter of its value this year, Egypt's main (EGX30) index is up 10% this quarter.
One manager polled said that, although Egypt was exposed, it is one of the few countries that could potentially register positive growth this year, because of foreign reserves and credit lines with international financial institutions.
Earlier this week, Egypt said it had asked the IMF for financial support to help it deal with the coronavirus crisis.

(Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages gave a resounding thumbs-up to Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) first-quarter numbers on Thursday, lauding the electric carmaker's improved gross margins and sending its shares 8% higher in trading before the opening bell.
Slipping into profanity on a call with analysts after the results on Wednesday, Musk called current stay-at-home orders ""fascist"" and said it was a serious risk to the business. 
His remarks come around a year after Tesla managed to end a series of legal and regulatory rows over Musk's social media posting by agreeing restrictions with regulators.
A morning round of research notes from major investment banks saw analysts avoid the issue and focus on the fundamentals of Tesla's business.
Analysts with J.P. Morgan said important take-aways, included its ""unexpectedly higher"" regulatory credits of $354 million in the quarter.
Regulatory credits is the money Tesla receives from other automakers that buy the company's carbon emissions credits to meet stricter regulation.
""The highlight of the result was a solid gross margin beat,""  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analysts wrote, saying gross margins on both the Model Y compact utility vehicle and its China-made Model 3 had come as a positive surprise.
Tesla's market cap currently stands at around $147.38 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
The company's third profit beat in a row comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has hammered auto sales and production in the United States. 
Canaccord Genuity said the strong gross margin at 20.6% was proof of ""a meaningful operational improvement that the company has made over the past several quarters"".
Company-wide automotive gross margins in the first quarter jumped to 25.5%.
Tesla said on Wednesday it would revisit its outlook for net income and cash flow in its next quarterly earnings.
Another brokerage, Wedbush, predicted that Tesla would miss its 2020 vehicle delivery target of 500,000, saying it was a ""virtual impossibility"" that the carmaker would hit those numbers, given the worldwide slump in demand. 

""Although the rest of the world is essentially shutdown and in lockdown mode, strong Model 3 demand out of China remains a ray of light for Tesla in a dark global macro,"" the brokerage said.

""SIA has always flown Singapore's flag high all over the world and made us proud. We will spare no effort to enable it to do so again,"" Lee Hsien Loong said in his May Day speech.
In late March, state investor Temasek Holdings and others put together a funding package of up to S$19 billion ($13.5 billion) for the airline, which has been slammed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Singapore is facing the deepest recession in its 55-year history, and authorities have warned that unemployment is likely to rise and wages drop.
The city-state has among the highest number of infections in Asia due to mass outbreaks in cramped migrant worker dormitories. It has extended widespread curbs to contain the spread of the virus, which include the closure of most workplaces and schools until June 1.
Authorities will ease curbs and progressively restart the economy once the number of cases come down, Lee said.
""We have kept essential services going. But the rest of the economy will have to open up step by step, and not all at once,"" Lee added.
He said industries such as those critical to the domestic economy will open up earlier and recover sooner. But others that attract crowds such as entertainment outlets and large-scale sporting events will have to wait.
The virus has hit Singapore's bellwether trade-reliant economy hard. The government's 2020 forecast for GDP is –4% to –1%, but the central bank has warned that risks of a sharper contraction are growing.
Lee said the pandemic would cause significant structural changes to the Singapore economy, which is among the most open in the world. He said the movement of goods and people will be less free.
""Companies will have to change their business models to survive. Some jobs will simply disappear,"" he said.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>",Banks dust off no-deal Brexit plans as December deadline looms,"By Huw Jones and Sinead Cruise
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks are dusting off their no-deal Brexit plans as concerns deepen that Britain and the European Union won't agree a trade deal by December as the COVID-19 pandemic compounds fundamental disagreements over future relations.
Financial services exports to the EU are worth about 26 billion pounds ($32.51 billion) a year, and although Britain left the bloc in January it still has unfettered access until the end of December under a transition agreement, allowing banks, asset managers and insurers to continue serving their biggest export market.
But that leaves the UK with just a few months to negotiate a trade deal with the EU that would come into effect in January to avoid a ""cliff-edge"" in business activity. If it wants an extension to the transition period, it must ask Brussels by the end of June.
""Brexit is firmly back up the agenda, people are talking about it and are very conscious of the very short time to get any deal agreed,"" said Catherine McGuinness, political leader of the City of London financial district, adding that financial industry groups met in recent days to discuss preparations.
""I don't think anybody is expecting a transition extension at the moment, but the timetable is very tight. We are dusting down our papers on the various solutions to the cliff-edge problems.""
Despite fundamental disagreements in the talks and political focus shifting to the pandemic, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted he won't request an extension.
""Brexit has not gone away. It's full steam ahead. The trade negotiations are not going smoothly and we have to assume some chance of an exit without a deal,"" a source at a major global bank said.
The government's firm no-extension stance has killed off lobbying efforts by the financial industry, the source added.
Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, which promotes Britain as a financial centre, said the government had to be taken at ""face value"", and bankers said the sector would not ask for an extension.
""People are looking at no deal preparedness again,"" said Rachel Kent, a financial services partner at Hogan Lovells law firm who was present at the industry talks on Brexit.
Banks are largely reviving plans they had when a no-deal Brexit loomed several times in 2019 before Britain and the EU signed off on a divorce settlement and transition period.
Under the plans banks would move more staff and activities to their new EU hubs to serve customers inside the bloc rather than from Britain.
A source at a second major global bank said that although the coronavirus pandemic had eclipsed Brexit for now, its no-deal plans were still at hand.
""All the plans are there, it's not like they didn't exist,"" the source said.
JUNE MILESTONE
The source at the first major global bank said everybody was aware that financial market access under the EU's patchy ""equivalence"" system was the best the sector could expect.
Brussels grants direct financial market access if it deems a foreign country's regulations are in line with its own. The EU has said it would look to complete its assessment of UK equivalence also by the end of June.
""June is a key time politically and the key priority is those equivalence assessments being in place sufficiently in advance of the end of the transition period,"" a European banking industry official said.
Obtaining equivalence is critical for clearing houses in London to avoid them having to tell EU clients in September to move positions worth billions of euros out of Britain by the end of the year.
""Although we would love to see progress by June, I am not holding my breath because, let's deal with COVID first,"" the City of London's McGuinness said.
There is already talk that Britain may prefer not to have a trade deal to avoid having its hands tied while supporting an economy thrown into deep recession by the pandemic, Hogan Lovells' Kent said.
""There is a feeling that can best be done without the constraint of being in the EU with issues like state aid and the need to have consent before supportive measures can be taken.""
Britain also has to decide whether to grant equivalence type access to EU financial firms that want to serve UK customers.
Bankers and McGuinness said Britain should go ahead and grant such access regardless of what the bloc decides on financial market access for Britain in coming months.
""We should be an open trading nation, we always have been and ought to remain so. It would be cutting our own nose to spite our faces if we keep people out,"" McGuinness said.

(Reuters) -  Zoetis Inc  (N:ZTS), the world's largest animal health company, unveiled a new insurance unit in a bid to take advantage of rising pet ownership as Americans adopt furry companions to help relieve the loneliness of coronavirus lockdowns.
Adoption rates at animal shelters around the world have jumped as people try to cope with the isolation from shelter-at-home orders to avoid the spread of the new coronavirus.
New Jersey-based Zoetis on Thursday said its Pumpkin Insurance Services subsidiary will offer insurance plans to cover medical bills and veterinary visits for cat and dog owners.
""Pet insurance is, more than ever before, top of the mind for pet owners who just got a new pet,"" Alex Douzet, chief executive officer of Pumpkin, told Reuters.
Historically, spending on pets has been found to increase during periods of recession and economic uncertainty, said Darryl Rawling, chief executive officer of  Trupanion Inc  (O:TRUP), a rival pet insurance company.
This is ideally when pet owners would consider seeking options such as pet insurance to avoid the risk of having to pay for costly medical procedures, Rawling added.
Pet insurance, although not new in the United States, is an under-penetrated industry, and only 2% of owners have any sort of insurance for their pets, Pumpkin estimates. 
""If the pets go outside and become sick, or have an accident, pet insurance is one of the best ways to make sure that you can provide the right amount of care to your pets,"" Douzet added. 
Companies such as  Metlife Inc  (N:MET) have also recently entered the pet insurance market, betting on a trend of ""pet humanization"" where owners are more willing to pay for expensive treatments for diseases including cancer.
Depending on the pet's age, breed and location, Pumpkin pet insurance members would pay around $1 to $3 a day for their premium, which covers 90% of eligible vet bills after members meet their annual deductible.
Apart from that, it also offers an optional plan for $15.95 per month for dogs and $10.95 per month for cats, covering the full cost of an annual check-up, vaccines, as well as a 12-month supply of Zoetis' parasite prevention products that would be shipped to members' homes.
Over 63 million American households owned dogs and nearly 43 million homes had cats as pets, according to a 2019 national survey by the American Pet Products Association.

1430,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>","BlackRock, Voya Revive a Credit Trade That Returned Double-Digits","(Bloomberg) -- Money managers are reviving one of the most profitable credit trades of 2009, thanks to the Federal Reserve.
Dozens of firms, from BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK). and Voya Financial (NYSE:VOYA) Inc. to credit specialists Palmer Square (NYSE:SQ) Capital Management and Varadero Capital, are raising funds to deploy into a central bank lending program that’s being resurrected to support the flow of consumer credit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
They’re seeking to replicate the windfalls many enjoyed in the aftermath of the financial crisis when, by taking advantage of low-cost loans via the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, they were able to notch double-digit returns purchasing top-rated ABS as the economy recovered.
It’s the latest example of how credit managers who spent much of the past decade battling low yields are now raising cash to seize on deep discounts created by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Investors, for their part, have been happy to oblige, piling billions of dollars into funds targeting distressed and dislocated securities as they aim to make up for steep losses elsewhere.
“If you look at what you’re getting an opportunity to invest in, it’s AAA rated paper that’s offering really healthy yields for the risk,” said Chris Long, president and founder of Palmer Square. “This go around, the TALF program is a bit more of a known entity. The fact that TALF proved so successful in 2009 really bodes well for demand.”
Lower Returns
Still, some market watchers are already warning that replicating the gains of the last crisis may prove easier said than done.
On the heels of the U.S. housing collapse, asset-backed securities looked a lot more fragile in early 2009 than they do today. Average risk premiums on AAA rated ABS deals reached nearly 8%, according to Bloomberg  Barclays  (LON:BARC) index data. This year, they peaked around 3% in March and have since fallen to about 1.4%.
“You’re not going to get 20% to 25% returns like you did in 2009,” said Greg Leonberger, director of research at investment consulting firm Marquette Associates. “The return potential is lower because spreads are lower.”
Representatives for BlackRock and Voya declined to comment, while Varadero didn’t immediately respond to requests seeking comment.
Some of the same firms that accessed the original program are now seeking to set up funds similarly focused on mispriced assets more than a decade later.
Pacific Investment Management Co., which is looking to raising billions of dollars to capitalize on dislocations in the fixed-income market, was among the biggest borrowers under the previous incarnation, tapping it 96 times for $7.3 billion. BlackRock also borrowed the last go around, according to Fed records. So did Angelo Gordon & Co., which is seeking $750 million for a TALF fund.
Other asset managers are looking to get involved, too. Hildene Capital Management is raising a TALF fund, Bloomberg previously reported. Kennedy Lewis Investment Management is also considering participating after receiving interest from existing investors, said the people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the details are private.
And Voya’s alternative asset management arm is targeting as much as $500 million in commitments for a new fund to take advantage of the program, according to an investor document seen by Bloomberg.
Representatives for Pimco and Kennedy Lewis declined to comment on their current fundraising activities.
Eye-Popping Returns
The Fed announced the original TALF in 2008 to help support liquidity in the ABS market, where lenders bundle consumer debt like auto loans and credit card obligations into bonds that can be sold to investors. The industry was effectively frozen post-crisis, threatening consumers’ access to credit.
The central bank revived the program last month, already helping thaw the market after a similar halt in new debt issuance.
Under the terms of the new program, investment firms pledge certain types of top-rated asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations or commercial mortgage-backed securities as collateral and receive cheap loans from the Fed to buy new ABS.
By purchasing the securities with borrowed money and holding them as the market recovered, firms were able to net eye-popping returns from some ultra-safe securities in 2009 and 2010.
The Pimco TALF Investment and Recovery Fund, set up in 2009, posted a net 34.3% internal rate of return, according to a recent investor presentation seen by Bloomberg.
‘Collateral Damage’
While potential returns may be slimmer than they were in 2009, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co. analysts wrote in a note earlier this month that TALF investors could gain 17% to 23% returns on ABS backed by subprime auto loans, private student-loan debt deals and car dealer inventory. But they expect most types of bonds would return in the 5% to 10% range, and said banks may ultimately do the most additional buying because their funding costs are likely lower than non-banks.
Marquette’s Leonberger estimates that many TALF funds can net between 8% and 14% in this iteration. Those are the kind of numbers that may look appealing to investors like endowments and family offices that can tolerate illiquidity, he said.
The extent money managers participate in the program will depend on their cost of capital, said Greg Cioffi, head of the asset securitization and CLO practice group at Seward & Kissel LLP in New York. His firm is in the process of helping set up a number of new funds.
“ABS is collateral damage because of Covid -- there’s not the same taint as there was in 2009,” Cioffi said. “TALF is going to be broadly utilized, but it comes down to some key issues,” he said, adding that “a lot of funds will be eligible for TALF but will have other purposes. They may be buying other ABS where there are market dislocations.”

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open mixed Thursday, consolidating recent gains amid tech sector strength and more hints of policy easing from the Federal Reserve.
At 7:15 AM ET (11:15 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 7 points, or 0.2%, lower, Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) futures up 25 points, or 0.3%. The Dow Jones 30 Futures contract fell 37 points, or 0.2%.
The DJIA cash index is on track for its best month since January 1987, while the S&P 500 is looking at its biggest monthly gains since October 1974.
The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged on Wednesday, but expressed a willingness to do more to support the economy if this was needed.
""It may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the recovery is to be a robust one,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said.
The need for more support could well be illustrated with the release of the latest weekly jobless claims data, at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to have risen by 3.5 million, down from a rise of 4.43 million the week before. This follows the hefty 4.8% slump in first-quarter gross domestic product, the first time the U.S. economy has contracted in six years.
The U.S. coronavirus death toll has surpassed 60,000, with more than one million confirmed cases, representing about a third of all cases from around the world.
Yet the move to reopen the economy is getting stronger after President Donald Trump said federal guidelines aimed at limiting the spread of the virus would be “fading out”, putting the onus firmly on the state officials to allow the reopening of businesses.
Optimism has also been driven by positive partial results from a trial of Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD)'s antiviral drug remdesivir, which suggested it could help speed recovery from Covid-19.
The corporate earnings season continues Thursday, with the likes of McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD)reporting early and tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) after the close.
Staying with the tech sector, shares in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) traded over 9% higher premarket as the social media giant reported late Wednesday that its ad sales stabilized in recent weeks, part of a strong earnings report.
Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares climbed 2.6% premarket after the company reported fiscal third-quarter sales growth of 15% after Wednesday’s close, fueled by its cloud business.
Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares climbed 8% premarket after surprising with a first-quarter profit amid the broad economic destruction wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.
Oil futures pushed higher Thursday, helped by stockpiles of U.S. crude rising less than expected last week - in a clear weakening of the recent trend.
At 7:05 AM ET, U.S. crude June futures traded 17% higher at $17.62 a barrel. The international benchmark Brent contract rose 8.3% to $26.24.
Elsewhere, gold futures rose 1% to $1,729.70/oz, while EUR/USD traded at 1.0877, largely flat.

1442,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","Nigerian funds switch to stocks, hoping for rebound as foreigners exit","By Chijioke Ohuocha
ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian funds are switching back to equities from fixed-income securities, hoping for a stock market rebound later this year after a coronavirus-induced rout in oil prices prompted foreign investors to sell-off their holdings, market players said.
The stock market, once a darling for frontier market investors, has seen foreign funds take flight as the coronavirus pandemic hit oil prices, Nigeria's main export, weakening its currency and hammering the main equity index to an eight year low this month.
Adeniyi Falade, managing director of pension fund manager CrusaderSterling Pension, said domestic funds were betting on equities to stay ahead of rising local inflation.
""I believe the worst is over. We are positioning for a rebound which will come at some point ... before the end of the year,"" he said by phone.
""This is a period to go long on equities and short on bonds, whether corporate or sovereign.""
An equity analyst, who declined to be named, said that view was shared by other local pension funds.
Over the past five years, Nigerian pension funds have cut back their holdings of local equities in favour of fixed-income instruments, blaming a lack of reforms to spur growth in Africa's largest economy following a recession.
But excess liquidity, brought about by the issuance of high-yielding securities to attract dollars to prop up the naira, has helped to depress yields as treasury bills mature and foreign players refuse to re-invest.
Falade said 13% of his 300 billion naira ($833 million) pension fund was invested in equities, up from 10% last year. He expects to be at 15% as prices recover, a level last reached more than five years ago.
Most funds like Falade's have increased their equity holdings, market players said, betting on the recovery of a stock market that is currently down about 16% this year.
Meanwhile, stock exchange data shows foreign investors have been net sellers of Nigerian equities this year, with the pace of outflows accelerating in February as the coronavirus pandemic rattled global markets.
Brokers say that sell off is likely to continue even after Nigeria eases a lockdown aimed at containing the virus outbreak, as foreign investors queue up for dollars to repatriate funds. Backlog dollar demand is estimated at around $1.5 billion, the equity analyst said.
Foreign investors have dumped shares across board. However, heavyweight stocks such as Dangote Cement (LG:DANGCEM), Guaranty Trust Bank (LG:GUARANT), Zenith Bank (LG:ZENITHB), Nestle (LG:NESTLE) and MTN (LG:MTNN) have seen buying interest from locals, Falade said.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Visa (N:V) and  Safaricom  (NR:SCOM) have agreed a deal which will connect the Kenyan telecom operator's M-Pesa financial services platform with Visa's global network of merchants and cards.
Under the deal, which requires regulatory approval, announced on Thursday by both companies, M-Pesa's 24 million users and 173,000 local merchants will be linked to Visa's 61 million merchants and its more than 3 billion cards.
""This has been the missing link to integrate M-Pesa into the global payments system,"" said a source at Safaricom, which is Kenya's biggest telecoms operator and is part-owned by South Africa's Vodacom (J:VODJ) and Britain's  Vodafone  (L:VOD).
The mobile phone-based M-Pesa will serve as a virtual card, allowing users to make payments abroad when they travel and also letting them transfer cash from their Visa-linked debit cards to their M-Pesa wallet even when they are abroad, the source said.
Peter Ndegwa, Safaricom's CEO, said in a joint statement that the deal with will facilitate global electronic commerce, while Andrew Torre, President of Visa Central Europe, Middle East and Africa, said it was committed to creating new and improved payments experiences.
""Safaricom and M-Pesa have already ... put Kenya on the map as a global leader in mobile money,"" Torre said.
There have been attempts by governments to encourage use of cashless payments to enhance security, while more recently they have been promoted as a way of slowing the spread of the coronavirus through bank notes.
M-Pesa, which was started by Safaricom in 2007, allows users to transfer cash, make payments for goods and services, as well as save and borrow through partnerships with local lenders.
Previous attempts to integrate it with the global payments system include a 2018 deal with  Western Union  (NYSE:WU), which allows M-Pesa users to send money around the world.

International money transfers, which also include PayPal (O:PYPL) and Alipay, were one of the fastest growing segments for M-Pesa revenue last year, although it remains quite small, Safaricom said on Wednesday.

The nuggets, said to match the texture and taste of meat, were available in three KFC outlets, in the cities of Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, from April 28 to April 30 and were quickly sold out, said Cargill.
It plans to offer more plant-based products to the food service sector and also introduce a consumer brand called PlantEver at the end of June with both online and offline retailers.
Some producers of plant-based protein foods say demand is surging as the new coronavirus drives some consumers to rethink their diets.
Demand had already been growing, with consultancy Euromonitor predicting last year that China's ""free from meat"" market, including plant-based products meant to replace meat, would be worth nearly $12 billion by 2023, up from just under $10 billion in 2018.
Leading coffee chain Starbucks (O:SBUX) has also recently included  Beyond Meat Inc 's (O:BYND) products in a new plant-based lunch menu in China.

1450,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Nokia makes small profit in face of supply disruption,"By Tarmo Virki and Supantha Mukherjee
(Reuters) - Nokia Oyj (HE:NOKIA) eked out a small profit in the first quarter, backed by demand for its new high-margin 5G telecoms equipment, and predicted a strong second half of the year, sending its shares higher.
The Finnish company said the bulk of the coronavirus impact will be felt in the current quarter. Its revenue slipped 2% in the first three months of the year as it took a hit of about 200 million euros ($217 million) largely because the pandemic disrupted supply from operations in China.
Nokia (NYSE:NOK), battling with China's Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb), is trying to strengthen its 5G slate and looking especially to deployment by U.S. telecom companies for growth.
Ericsson and Huawei both increased their revenue in the first quarter, helped by strong demand as telecom services help to keep businesses working remotely during the pandemic.
Nokia expects a seasonally strong second half when it will have new leadership as former executive Pekka Lundmark from energy group  Fortum  (HE:FORTUM) is due to replace Chief Executive Rajeev Suri in September.
It trimmed its full-year earnings forecast to 23 euro cents from 25 cents, but shares in the company were up by 2.7% by 0900 GMT.
China has been a weak spot for Nokia but CEO Suri said the company had won a 10% share of China Unicom (NYSE:CHU)'s 5G core network order, with Huawei and ZTE (SZ:000063) taking most of the order.
""We are the only foreign supplier in China Unicom for 5G core,"" Suri told Reuters in an interview. 
According to media reports, Nokia did not win any 5G radio contracts from Chinese telecom companies - China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Unicom and China Telecom (NYSE:CHA) - in recent bidding rounds.
CHALLENGES
Nokia reported January-March revenues falling to 4.9 billion euros, missing the 5.1 billion euro consensus figure, according to Refinitiv data. 
""We did not see a decline in demand in the first quarter. As the COVID-19 situation develops, however, an increase in supply and delivery challenges in a number of countries is possible and some customers may re-assess their spending plans,"" Suri said in a statement. 
Nokia generated first quarter underlying profit of 1 cent per share, broadly matching analysts' forecasts, according to Refinitiv data based on 10 analysts. It had posted a loss of 2 cents per share in the same period last year.
Nokia, which axed its dividend after a profit warning last October, has been trying to tackle costs and delays in shipments and pointed to progress for its new 5G ReefShark equipment.

""As was expected, new uncertainties have been added to the outlook due to the pandemic but solving the company's internal problems seems to progress on schedule,"" Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen wrote in a note.

1451,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",Stocks head for best month on record ahead of ECB,"By Marc Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks headed for their best month on record on Thursday, as encouraging early results from a COVID-19 treatment trial and expectations of more European Central Bank (ECB) stimulus later in the day helped ease the pain of February and March.
Europe saw a cautious start with oil firm Shell (LON:RDSa)'s first dividend cut in 80 years, a record drop in French first quarter GDP and surge in German unemployment all giving traders an excuse for some pre-ECB profit taking. 
Not that it mattered. Easing coronavirus worries mean the STOXX 600 (STOXX) is up more than 25% over the last six weeks. April will be Europe's best month since 2009 and for MSCI (NYSE:MSCI)'s World Index, it could be best since it started in the late 1980s.
""We have gone back to a turbo-charged version of the great financial crisis,"" said Simon Fennell, a portfolio manager in William Blair's global equity team, referring to how markets have surged on mass central bank and government stimulus.
""Today we will also see if the ECB is going to go to 1 trillion or beyond with its PEPP programme,"" he added, a reference to the central bank's beefed-up bond buying scheme.
A 1.4% rise in MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan, (MIAPJ0000PUS) kept it tracking towards a weekly gain of more than 5%, its best in three weeks.
Optimism was also driven by positive partial results from a trial of Gilead's (O:GILD) antiviral drug remdesivir, which suggested it could help speed recovery from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.
Japan's Nikkei (N225) jumped 2.8% to a seven-week high and Australia's ASX 200 (AXJO) rose 2.7%, with the mood further supported by South Korea reporting no new domestic coronavirus cases for the first time since its Feb. 29 peak. 
More caution was evident in other asset classes, with the U.S. dollar steady against most of the other major currencies and German Bund yields - which move inverse to price - dipping to a one-month low ahead of the expected ECB moves.
""It's a hope-based rally rather than an evidence-based rally,"" said Anthony Doyle, cross-asset specialist at fund manager Fidelity International in Sydney.
There were still worries about a second wave of infections, he said, adding that huge piles of cash waiting to go back into the markets suggest investor confidence remained subdued.
BOND MARKET NOT BUYING IT
Markets have been excited by the prospect of a COVID-19 treatment because it may help economies emerge from lockdowns.
Partial results from the 1,063-patient U.S. government trial of Gilead's remdesivir were hailed as ""highly significant"" by the top U.S. infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci.
They showed hospitalised COVID-19 patients given the drug recovered in 11 days, compared with 15 days for patients given a placebo, and a slightly lower death rate.
But since treatment hopes don't seem to take into account regulatory and distribution difficulties, should a treatment be found, currency and bond markets were more circumspect.
""Any positive medical development is helpful,"" said Westpac FX analyst Sean Callow.
""But no-one should be counting on a major breakthrough - the key for markets is control of the spread of the virus.""
The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries (US10YT=RR) stayed parked at 0.6170%, after the U.S. Federal Reserve left interest rates near zero and gave no indication of lifting them any time soon.
The dollar held its ground against the resurgent Australian dollar  for the first time in a week and barely budged against the euro (EUR=) at $1.0875. [FRX/] 

Gold  was a touch higher at $1,715 per ounce [GOL/], though things were still wild in oil markets. Brent crude (LCOc1) and U.S. crude (CLc1) futures each rose about $1.7 - or 7% - a barrel amid optimism that a storage squeeze is not as bad as first feared, and that demand for fuel may soon return.

1452,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 05:12AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Shell's Dividend Disaster Spells a New Age for Big Oil,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa) shares slumped in London and Amsterdam as the company cut its dividend for the first time since the Second World War, a stark illustration of the acute and long-term challenges facing the oil and gas sector.
The Anglo-Dutch giant was the biggest payer of dividends in the FTSE 100 last year, and pensio funds across Europe have relied on the steady income it has generated for decades. It’s the first of the global ‘supermajors’ to break what has previously been an inviolable taboo. After falling 8% at the open, it pared losses to be down only 5.0% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT), adding to a chilling wave of economic data from Europe that pushed the benchmark Stoxx 600 down by 0.3%.
Like all companies whose revenue is subject to sometimes violent price swings, Shell had had cash squeezes before. It had resorted to paying much of its dividend in the form of new shares, or scrip, after the oil crash of late 2015 caught it wrong-footed, just after it had used up most of its available cash in the $76 billion purchase of rival BG Group.
But Thursday’s action is a whole different kettle of fish. In cutting the quarterly payout by two-thirds to 16 cents, the company is not just reacting to the acute, but likely temporary, collapse in demand, nor even positioning for a slow and uneven recovery in crude prices.
Chief executive Ben van Beurden took pains to call the move a “reset” of dividend policy – a new normal for the long term.  In other words, it’s acknowledging the risk that it will never be able to generate the kind of shareholder returns in the future that it did in the past. Had it thought otherwise, it would surely have reverted to the tactic of using scrip dividends again.
In that regard, Covid-19 is more the catalyst rather than the underlying cause of today’s share price slump. The pandemic has, for example, sharpened the focus on the long-term future of aviation. The sustainability of the explosive growth in air travel was already under question before February. Production cuts at Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Airbus (PA:AIR) show very clearly which way that debate is going.
Similarly, the coverage given to improvements in air quality caused by lockdown measures have given environmentalists some potent statistical ammunition in their campaign for the electrification of mobility, a long-term threat to gasoline demand. That too can be expected to accelerate as Covid-19 passes.
That said, human memories are short, and pent-up demand for travel may well create a short-term bounce in fuel demand later in the year. Crude prices are already up smartly from their lows of earlier in the month. An optimist could also argue that Shell’s balance sheet conservatism will give it more space to snap up still-viable assets on the cheap later, when the crisis is past. Gearing, at under 29%, looks substantially better than BP’s 36% - the result of BP (NYSE:BP) defending its payout at the cost of higher borrowing.
But growth by acquisitions are theoretical and, in any case, far off in the future. The pain -  a sharp drop in output and a 46% fall in underlying profit, with worse to come – is real and immediate. The company may yet surprise with its ability to squeeze value out of an asset base that the world economy will need for many years. But the days of gushing dividends are gone, quite possibly for ever."
1453,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",Pandemic-hit Macau casinos look to play the long game with cash pile,"By Farah Master and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Light on debt and cash rich, Macau's Galaxy Entertainment (HK:0027) is bleeding $3 million daily in operating cost as the coronavirus crisis upends its casino business. 
Such a jolt could sink most companies - a risk not taken lightly by global policymakers who have delivered various measures over the past two months to help cushion corporate losses. 
Yet Galaxy and many of its counterparts in the world's biggest gambling hub have enough cash on hand to ride out the storm and, surprisingly, even survive on zero revenue for several months to a few years. 
Having enjoyed robust earnings growth in recent years, thanks to insatiable gaming demand from mainland Chinese, the balance sheets of Macau's casino operators stand tall over those in Las Vegas, which are saddled with much higher debt. 
A Reuters calculation shows the Macau casino operators came into 2020 with a cumulative cash position of just over $12 billion, providing a solid buffer to tide over the lean times.
Galaxy's (HK:0027) cash pile is a case in point. 
Its policy of not dishing out regular dividends has seen it amass a war chest of around $5.7 billion over the past several years - allowing it to burn through $3 million daily on operating cost and weather the coronavirus for a lengthy period on zero revenue.
The survival of Macau’s gambling industry is crucial for the Chinese-ruled territory where the sector employs about three quarters of its 600,000 population, either directly or indirectly. 
""It’s very difficult to predict how this is going to work out,” Robert Drake, Galaxy’s chief financial officer said at its full-year earnings briefing at the end of February during the height of the virus outbreak. 
The coronavirus is also expected to delay a pipeline of multi-billion-dollar projects in Macau that were due to start this year. 
While Sands China (HK:1928),  MGM China  (HK:2282), Melco Resorts (O:MLCO) and  Wynn Macau  (HK:1128) have lower buffers than Galaxy, they can still go without revenues for around 6-24 months, say analysts. All players can survive a minimum of half a year without having to tap debt financing, but anything longer could spell trouble. 
MGM, Galaxy, Melco, Wynn and SJM declined a Reuters request for comment.
MARATHON, NOT SPRINT
To curtail the coronavirus, Macau barred all visitors from the mainland, neighbouring Hong Kong and Taiwan who had travelled overseas in the previous 14 days. Visitors from the greater China region make up more than 90 percent of its tourists.
The numbers trickling in so far are telling.
Although Macau’s casinos have reopened after a two-week suspension in February, revenues have plummeted between 80%-90%, hit by travel curbs and health regulations. 
April’s gambling revenues, to be released on Friday, is expected to show a plunge of 95% year on year. 
Daily visitors to Macau number around 200 versus over 100,000 a year earlier
""It's a marathon, not a sprint, and we can see that there's been a gradual improvement in mainland China, that hopefully, will trickle down into Macau,"" Galaxy's Drake said. 
Fortunately, a solid period of growth for Macau's six casino operators, which have raked in over $200 billion in gaming revenues since 2014, has strengthened the industry's capacity to deal with the pandemic's far reaching impact. 
Their average debt to equity ratio at 53% also compares favourably to the near 87% ratio for the Las Vegas players, according to  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Eikon. 
Sands, which suspended its dividend payment due to the pandemic's impact, is bleeding nearly $4 million a day in operating costs. However, with cash reserves of around $1.4 billion, it can keep going for two years without any revenues, said DS Kim, an analyst at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong. 
Sands Chairman Sheldon Adelson said any resumption in dividend payment would depend on income going forward. 
“I assure you I have not said yay dividends and yay buybacks for the last time,” Adelson said during an investor call following first-quarter results on April 22.
Sands reported a $166 million quarterly net loss, with others due to announce results in the coming weeks. Analysts expect to see only a gradual recovery in the second half once travel restrictions are loosened.
If casinos did move to tap the capital markets, bankers caution it would be a tough sell.

“All of the deals that we have seen in Asia have been in sectors where there has been visibility on what the future will look like, we don’t even know when people are going to be able to go to Macau again.”

Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Apple Inc (O:AAPL) will retain their first and third spots on the leaderboard, but are both expected to lose market share to Chinese rivals, the market research firm said on Thursday.
That follows a 10% drop in output worldwide in the March quarter, when the outbreak spread and peaked in China before sweeping through Europe and the United States.
TrendForce cut its annual output forecast to 1.24 billion smartphones, down 11.3% from 2019, from 1.35 billion.
""The pandemic is now making its effects felt on the demand side of the smartphone market by tanking major economies worldwide,"" TrendForce said.
Apple, which is expected to report March-quarter results on Thursday, has slashed prices of its iPhone 11 in China, the only major market where its stores are open. It also launched a $399 iPhone it hopes will find takers in a frugal economy.
TrendForce estimates iPhone production fell nearly 9% to about 38 million units in the March quarter, and expects a further drop of 2 million units in the current one.
Apple's market share will slip to 12.6% this quarter from 13.5% in the last, TrendForce said.
Samsung's share of the market will ease 3 percentage points to 20.3% in the June quarter.
""Chinese brands are exerting continuous pressure on Samsung's presence in the Southeast Asian and Indian markets by the day,"" the firm added.
On Wednesday, the South Korean tech giant warned of significant declines in its mobile business in the second quarter.
China's Huawei, which saw revenue growth slow sharply in the first quarter, is expected to make about 48 million phones in the June quarter to meet recovering domestic demand, up 2 million from the March quarter, TrendForce said.

Chinese firms Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), Oppo and Vivo will each gain market share in the June quarter. TrendForce added that Vivo was the only smartphone brand among the top six to see volumes increase in the March quarter but warned things things were set to change in light of lockdowns in Southeast Asia and India.

1455,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>","Airbus in talks with French state, no liquidity concerns at present, says CEO","By Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus (PA:AIR) is in talks with the French state regarding possible support for aircraft deliveries, even though it has no liquidity problems at present, Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on Thursday.
""In crises of such importance, and crises which are as global as this, one needs states to help. States have an absolutely essential role to play,"" Faury told RTL radio.
""We are holding very frequent discussions. The state is very willing to listen, and is very understanding of our position,"" Faury said. 
Airbus shares rose 9%.
Last month Airbus (PA:AIR) boosted its liquidity with a 15-billion-euro expanded credit facility.
""We are no longer in a problem of liquidity but one of adapting to the situation,"" Faury said.
""What we need to survive is to have a certain number of deliveries of aircraft. So the first priority is to get traffic moving and help airlines who have been impacted in a very brutal and severe fashion to survive and resume their activities.""
Faury, who last week told Airbus employees that the company's survival was in question without immediate action, told RTL that there was a need for export financing support.
Export credit agencies played a key role in keeping deliveries moving during the 2009 financial crisis, but their role has since diminished. European nations withdrew the support during most of a four-year corruption investigation culminating in a record 3.6-billion-euro fine against Airbus in January.
The scheme was revised last year on a case-by-case basis but volumes of activity have remained lower than in the past.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said earlier this week that the French state was ready to provide ""massive"" support to Airbus, if the circumstances arose.
On Wednesday, Airbus said it did not immediately see a need for further government support as it posted sharply lower first-quarter profits.
FURLOUGHS
Airbus has cut production, implemented furloughs and slowed future development spending but is not shielded from further problems as the industry faces its worst crisis, Faury told RTL.
Airbus expanded furlough schemes this week by sending home 3,200 workers in Britain after putting 3,000 workers on government-backed partial unemployment schemes in France, and the group said thousands of German staff could also be affected.
The company has not ruled out mandatory job cuts but says it is taking time until around June to understand airline demand and the shape of the economic recovery to assess further steps.
Faury said the crisis threatened the situation of roughly 3,200 aerospace suppliers in France and called for joint industry action to protect the fragile sector.
Airbus is producing at a slower rate as it adapts to new health restrictions, he said. 
Industry sources said have said Airbus is producing few aircraft due to social-distancing measures and gaps in the supply chain and must speed up production to meet a newly revised target of 40 narrowbody planes a month, down from 60.

Faury said he was in favour of passengers wearing masks rather than airlines being forced to block middle seats as flights resume.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",Shell cuts dividend for first time since World War Two,"By Ron Bousso and Shadia Nasralla
LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSa)  cut its dividend for the first time since World War Two on Thursday as the energy company retrenched in the face of an unprecedented drop in oil demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Shell also suspended the next tranche of its share buyback programme and said it was reducing oil and gas output by nearly a quarter after its net profit almost halved in the first three months of 2020.
Shell's shares in London had slumped 7% by 0753 GMT, sharply underperforming rival  BP  (L:BP) which was down 2.2%.
For years, Shell has taken pride in having never cut its dividend since the 1940s, resisting such a move even during the deep downturns in the oil market of the 1980s. 
Some investors, however, had called on major oil firms to break an industry taboo and consider cutting dividends, rather than taking on more debt to maintain payouts. 
""Given the risk of a prolonged period of economic uncertainty, weaker commodity prices, higher volatility and uncertain demand outlook, the Board believes that maintaining the current level of shareholder distributions is not prudent,"" Shell Chairman Chad Holliday said.
He also said the cut in Shell's payout was a long-term ""reset"" of the company's dividend policy.
Shell said it would reduce its quarterly dividend by two-thirds to 16 cents per share from the 47 cents it paid each quarter in 2019. If maintained for 2020 as a whole, Shell would save about $10 billion.
Shell is the first of the five so-called Oil Majors to cut its dividend because of the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. BP and  Exxon Mobil  (N:XOM) have said they will maintain their first-quarter dividends while  Total  (PA:TOTF) and  Chevron  (N:CVX) have yet to report first-quarter results.
Graphic - Shell dividends: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/ygdpzywmnvw/Shell%20dividends.png
'NECESSARY EVIL'
The dividend cut also comes after Shell this month laid out the oil and gas sector's most extensive strategy yet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.
""The 66% dividend cut is a necessary evil to reinforce Shell's capital frame and position it for the offence on the energy transition,"" JP Morgan analyst Christyan Malek said.
Shell paid about $15 billion in dividends last year making it the world's biggest payer of dividends after Saudi Arabia's national oil company  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222).
Dividends paid by Shell and BP last year also represented 24% of the 75 billion pounds ($94 billion) in total paid out by companies in the FTSE 100 index (FTSE) of leading shares.

Graphic - Shell's profits: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/yzdpxorxxvx/Pasted%20image%201588230264111.png
Following years of deep cost cuts after its acquisition of BG Group for $53 billion in 2016, Shell had previously planned to boost payouts to investors through dividends and share buybacks to $125 billion between 2021 and 2025.
Outside the Oil Majors, Norway's Equinor (OL:EQNR) became the first large oil company to cut its dividend in response to the current downturn, reducing its first-quarter payout last week by two-thirds.
Global energy demand could slump by 6% in 2020 due to coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions in what would be the largest contraction in absolute terms on record, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.
Shell last month said it would reduce capital expenditure this year to $20 billion at most from a planned level of about $25 billion and also cut an additional $3 billion to $4 billion off operating costs over the next 12 months.
Its first-quarter net income attributable to shareholders based on a current cost of supplies and excluding identified items, fell 46% from a year earlier to $2.9 billion, above the consensus in an analyst survey provided by Shell.
Shell's fourth-quarter net income was also $2.9 billion.
The company said it cut activity at its refining business by up to 40% in response to the demand shock.
Shell said it expected to cut production of oil and gas in the second quarter to between 1.75 million and 2.25 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from 2.7 million boed in the first quarter.

Shell's gearing, or its debt-to-capital ratio, inched down to 28.9% in the first quarter from 29.3% in the fourth quarter, but was up from 26.5% in the same period a year earlier.

BANGKOK (Reuters) -  Thai Airways  International PCL (BK:THAI) aims to seek a 58.1 billion baht ($1.80 billion) emergency loan to maintain liquidity and see it through a coronavirus-induced drop in demand, showed a document from the airline detailing its plan.
The proposed bridge loan, guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance, was approved on Wednesday by a committee chaired by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and will be put to Cabinet for final approval as early as next week, a person involved in the decision to seek the loan told Reuters.
Thai media has reported the airline was seeking a multi-billion baht loan. The document seen by Reuters reveals the carrier's detailed plan for the first time.
After the loan, the money-losing national carrier will raise 77.04 billion baht in capital by issuing new shares around November, and use the proceeds to pay off the loan plus interest and maintain liquidity, the document showed.
Thai Airways had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. The document's authenticity was confirmed by two people involved in the decision to seek the loan, who declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.
Thai Airways was already facing financial trouble before the coronavirus outbreak, having reported losses since 2017.
The national carrier suspended flights in March as travel demand slumped, with governments worldwide imposing restrictions on movement to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Its president then resigned after less than two years in the job.
Thai Airways, which marks its 60th anniversary this year, will receive the emergency funds gradually based on operational plans, said one of the people.
The plan also includes reducing the number of aircraft to 84 from 103 by 2024 and the types of aircraft to six from seven.

Southeast Asia's second-largest economy stands to lose 1.3 trillion baht, mostly in the tourism sector, due to the virus which has infected more 3.13 million people globally.

1458,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Nissan shakes off virus woes in China sales with rebound in April - sources,"By Norihiko Shirouzu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co's (T:7201) vehicle sales in China this month almost recovered to the prior year's level after a coronavirus-related 45% plunge in March, two sources with knowledge of the Japanese automaker's preliminary data said.
The data reinforces growing optimism that the world's biggest car market is stabilising fast as businesses return to normal in China, making it a rare bright spot as most dealerships in Europe and the United States remain shut due to lockdowns.
Nissan's vehicle sales in China, which include Nissan, Infiniti and China-only brands, as well as light commercial vehicles, contracted just ""a few percent"" in April from a year earlier when it sold roughly 121,000 vehicles, said the people who saw the data.
Sales of the Nissan brand alone showed a ""small growth"", one of the persons said.
Nissan declined to comment on the April sales numbers but said the data will be made public on May 11. The people declined to be named as the data is preliminary and not public yet.
The estimated results mark a sharp improvement from a 44.9% plunge in March and 80.3% fall in February that Japan's No.2 automaker reported earlier.
""We're putting all efforts on China and the U.S. market to regain momentum,"" said the other source, adding Nissan is ramping up marketing and offering incentives to dealers to improve sales.
He also pointed to what he described as nascent signs of ""changing views"" on public transit and ride-hailing services resulting from the coronavirus outbreak which might have encouraged some consumers to shun such services and opt to buy cars instead.
In China, Nissan makes cars with state-owned  Dongfeng Motor Group  (HK:0489). The Japanese automaker said in January it aimed to sell 1.6 million vehicles in China this year.
Nissan's improving sales also follow upbeat data released by an auto industry group in China, cementing optimism that the momentum that started building up from the start of this month has gained a solid foothold.
The China Passenger Car Association said earlier this week sales of passenger cars jumped 12.3% between April 20 and 25, helping sales in the first 25 days of the month to drop just 1.6% from the same period a year earlier.
China's auto sales tumbled 43.3% in March in their 21st consecutive month of decline, but improved from a 79% plunge in February.
For Nissan, which had been reeling from falling global sales even before the pandemic due to an aggressive expansion plan pursued by ousted leader Carlos Ghosn, a solid business recovery in China would offer a much needed relief, as it scrambles to engineer a turnaround.
The pandemic has piled on pressure to renew efforts to downsize, and Nissan's management has become convinced that the company needs to be much smaller, arguing for a recovery plan that will likely cut 1 million cars from its annual sales target, Reuters reported earlier this month.

Nissan expected on Tuesday an annual operating loss of as much as 45 billion yen ($420 million) for the year ended March 31, its first such loss since the 2008 global financial crisis.

Investing.com - European stock markets have traded in a mixed fashion Thursday ahead of the latest meeting of the European Central Bank, with losses from heavily-weighted Shell (LON:RDSa) hitting the U.K.
At 4:130 AM ET (0830 GMT), the U.K.'s FTSE index traded 0.1% lower, while France's CAC 40 was up 0.4%, while the DAX rose 0.1%. The broader based Stoxx 600 Europe index was flat. 
In a busy day for corporate news, oil major Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDSb) stole the limelight, and not in a good way, by cutting its dividend for the first time in 80 years and suspending the next tranche of its share buyback program. Shell shares dropped 8.3%.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 02:05AM ET</span>",The devil's in the detail for junk debt investors facing coronavirus defaults,"By Yoruk Bahceli
LONDON (Reuters) - Before the coronavirus, investors hungry for returns piled into risky corporate loans and bonds with precious little protection for creditors. Now they're frantically scouring the terms to see just what firms can get away with to survive the fallout.
At the same time, firms starved of cash and funds thinking about lending to them are also poring over the fine print to see what room they have to shift assets away from other creditors, pay dividends or borrow more while staving off default.
With the coronavirus pandemic threatening to trigger a surge in corporate loan defaults, borrowers and investors in so-called covenant-lite loans and high-yield bonds with weak protection for creditors are taking stock fast.
""The number of questions have just skyrocketed since March 1. People are just poring over the documents,"" said Charles Tricomi, head of leveraged loan research at Xtract Research in New York, which analyses debt covenants for investors.
Covenant-lite loans are a form of junk debt stripped of so-called maintenance covenants designed to warn investors of potential financial trouble ahead for the borrower.
Often used by private equity groups to fund leveraged company buyouts, their prevalence has rocketed.
Over the past decade, the leveraged loan market has trebled to about $1.4 trillion. Whereas only 15% of loans in 2010 were deemed covenant-lite, now more than 80% lack clauses that might trigger warnings about a company's finances or stop it stripping out assets, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.
Covenants on European high-yield bonds have also became more than twice as permissive over the past decade, according to financial intelligence provider Reorg.
Tricomi said the main questions from investors spooked by the impact of the crisis on balance sheets were how much extra debt borrowers can raise, which assets can be moved out of their reach and what actually counts as collateral for their debt.
Graphic - European deal terms become more aggressive: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/nmovanzopab/eikon.png
THE FINE PRINT
The Bank of International Settlements, the U.S. Federal Reserve and the International Monetary Fund, among others, have all warned about the deterioration in lending standards and with defaults set to spike to up to 10% according to Moody's (NYSE:MCO), buyers of covenant-lite debt may soon find out how risky it may be.
""The use of flexible covenants has not been tested in a stress environment,"" said Lisa Gundy, senior covenant officer at the ratings agency. ""What we potentially have is a market-wide test of how (issuers) react.""
The game changer for leveraged investors has been the gradual whittling away of the maintenance covenants that require borrowers to comply with periodic tests of debt to earnings ratios to remain compliant with lending agreements.
Michael Dakin, a partner at Clifford Chance, said it was like driving your car with the warning indicators for the oil, gas and engine all switched off.
""I can be cruising along down the road but if I'm not managing those things separately and any of them go, it's a real catastrophic result,"" he said.
Rob Mathews, a partner at Baker McKenzie, said the issue for investors in covenant-lite debt was that they might only find out about a company's difficulties when there's an actual default, or a request for an interest payment delay.
""The repercussion of that might be that by the time these defaults are identified, it's too late to take proactive steps to fix things,"" he said.
Graphic - Covenant-lite loan recovery rates: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/jbyvrjaoveo/eikon.png
MASSAGING EARNINGS
Another crucial change to debt agreements has been the modification of the definition of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a metric underlying many of the tests borrowers much pass to avoid breaching agreements.
Many deals now allow firms to add one-off costs or projected earnings increases to their current earnings to make them appear healthier financially, potentially even staving off default. 
According to Reorg, 85% of the high-yield bonds sold in Europe in 2019 allowed for so-called cost add-backs, up from about 50% in 2016.
Lawyers specialising in leveraged finance deals said corporate clients were now considering how they could use one-off cost add-backs due to the coronavirus crisis to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on their earnings.
""They have clear flexibility to do it in a number of deals we have looked at,"" said Mathews at Baker McKenzie.
Another focus point for investors is debt capacity. While junk borrowers have typically drawn down credit lines first to raise liquidity, loose covenants also allow them to raise debt that pushes existing lenders further down the repayment queue. 
Theme park operator Merlin Entertainments, which has had to close most of its venues during the health crisis, sold 500 million euros ($543 million)of bonds on Friday that subordinated owners of bonds it issued only in October with terms Moody's has ranked as some of the loosest ever. 
U.S. private equity giant Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and the investment company that owns the Lego brand, which both took Merlin private last year, declined to comment.
While creditors might normally resist being pushed further down the queue, they may feel they have to comply if there is no other way to keep a company afloat through the pandemic. 
""If your alternative is for the company to go into liquidation, maybe you don't mind being subordinated,"" said David Newman, chief investment officer of global high-yield at Allianz (DE:ALVG) Global Investors.
'J CREW BLOCKER' 
The risk for creditors is that if a company fails to survive the pandemic despite raising more cash, they'll be further down the pecking order when it comes to trying to salvage anything.
Besides tweaking earnings and loading up on debt, some covenant-lite deals also give companies the leeway to strip collateral out of creditors' reach. Some can then use revenues generated by the stripped asset to keep paying dividends, or use it as collateral again to raise more debt.
While bankers selling these deals often say the terms are unlikely to actually be used, there is precedent.
Take U.S. retailer J Crew. In 2017, it moved the intellectual property of its brand into a new company, stripping investors who had lent against the asset of their collateral.
It was so infamous that terms added to subsequent financing deals to avoid a repeat are now known as the ""J Crew Blocker"".
J Crew did not respond to requests for comment.
One partner at a law firm in London, who asked not to be identified, said at least two clients have asked recently if they can strip assets away from creditors, just as J Crew did. In one case, the aim was to use the stripped asset as collateral to raise more money from a new investor.
Lawyers said it was too early to say how far companies and private equity firms might test the limits of how they can use loose covenants as the full impact of the pandemic was not yet clear. But they said the longer it lasts, the more aggressive they're likely to be.
""There's lots of money that is being written off right now, so there's a huge reason for sponsors to try and pull out as much collateral as possible,"" said Azhar Hussain, head of global credit at Royal London Asset Management. 
Some bankers said investors hungry for high yields lapped up covenant-lite debt even though they had misgivings about the terms, allowing arrangers to push through deals ever more favourable for borrowers.
""We would engage with people on the basis of being serious and try to work around some of their issues. And then we became much more blasé,"" said the head of syndication at a European bank who has arranged bond deals with weak covenants.
""When the rubber met the road in terms of the book-building and we were going gangbusters, they would come in anyway.""

The world's third biggest brewer behind Anheuser Busch InBev (BR:ABI) and  Heineken  (AS:HEIN) suspended guidance earlier this month, after sales at bars and restaurants especially in Western Europe were severely impacted as many countries were in lockdown.
""While we're starting to see signs of recovery in our largest market, China, and initial signs of governments cautiously lifting restrictions in some Western European markets, other markets remain in lockdown,"" Chief Executive Cees t'Hart said in a statement.

TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984) said it sees a loss of around 700 billion yen ($6.6 billion) in the year ending March on the portion of its WeWork investment held outside the Vision Fund, as the virus compounds woes at one of the firm's biggest bets.
The hit extends the group's expected net loss to 900 billion yen as investments made via the $100 billion fund sour, with the latest writedown illustrating how the group is racing to keep pace with the deteriorating value of its portfolio.
""Every writedown takes Wework's carrying value closer to reality. Clearly the value is zero,"" said Kirk Boodry, an analyst at Redex Holdings. 
SoftBank is embroiled in a legal dispute with directors at WeWork after backing out of a $3 billion tender offer agreed when it bailed out the office-sharing firm following a flopped IPO attempt last year.
The tech conglomerate has poured more than $13.5 billion into WeWork, one of a string of troubled bets by CEO Masayoshi Son that have laid waste to SoftBank's full-year earnings. 
The group maintained its forecast of a record annual operating loss of 1.35 trillion yen announced earlier this month.
The darkening future for WeWork with customers in lockdown comes as deep-seated problems from SoftBank's cash-fuelled push for rapid expansion are being compounded by the coronavirus outbeak.
SoftBank shares were up 2.8% in early afternoon trading, in line with the benchmark index <.N255>. The group has launched a record 2.5 trillion yen buyback to support its share price. CEO Son uses his SoftBank shares as collateral for loans. 
The highly leveraged conglomerate has been forced into selling major assets to raise funds, but could receive a big boost from the Bank of Japan's plan to expand corporate bond buying, which would support its predilection for borrowing.
SoftBank was sitting on around $160 billion of interest-bearing debt at the end of December and has seen yields on its bonds rise as high as 4.5% this month. 

Portfolio companies are continuing to retreat from a SoftBank-cash fuelled push for breakneck growth, with Indian hotel chain Oyo planning to offload more properties around the world, people familiar with the matter told Reuters this week.

1468,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 11:55PM ET</span>",Tesla's Elon Musk calling coronavirus lockdowns 'fascist' overshadows profitable quarter,"By Akanksha Rana and Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - Tesla Inc's (O:TSLA) outspoken CEO Elon Musk on Wednesday called sweeping U.S. stay-at-home restrictions to curtail the coronavirus outbreak ""fascist"" as the electric carmaker posted its third quarterly profit in a row.
His remarks overshadowed an otherwise successful quarter that took many investors by surprise as automaker peers were hit by a slump in consumer demand and forced factory shutdowns.
Shares of the company were up 8.8% at $871 in extended trade.
Tesla's profitable quarter comes just a day after Detroit-based rival  Ford Motor Co  (N:F) reported a $2 billion first-quarter loss and forecast losing another $5 billion in the current quarter as the coronavirus pandemic hits demand.
General Motors Co (N:GM) on Monday suspended its dividend and share buybacks and will report earnings May 6.
How Tesla fares in the current quarter and the remainder of the year will be an important test of the company's durability. If Tesla can limit its losses, or even continue its profit streak and outperform legacy automakers, it will be in a stronger position to take sales from rivals weakened by the coronavirus disruption.
Tesla produces a fraction of the cars of its rivals but has a much larger stock market value on expectations of tremendous growth.
On the biggest disruptions to Tesla has been the government-ordered shutdown of its factory in Fremont, California, which sits idle since March 24 with stay-at-home orders running until at least May 31. 
On a conference call on Wednesday, Musk said he did not know when Tesla could resume production in California and called the state stay-at-home order a ""serious risk"" to the business.
""To say that they cannot leave their house and they will be arrested if they do, this is fascist. This is not democratic, this is not freedom. Give people back their goddamn freedom!""
Late on Wednesday, the Tesla CEO doubled down on his stance, in response to a journalist's tweet that quoted Musk's remarks of calling the stay-at-home orders fascist. ""Hell yeah!!"", Musk said on Twitter.
Musk tweeted on March 6 that ""the coronavirus panic is dumb"" but later offered to supply hospitals with free ventilators.
Tesla said it could not predict how quickly vehicle manufacturing and global supply chains will normalize, saying it would revisit full-year guidance for net income and cash flow when it reports current-quarter results in three months. 
Musk said that while other carmakers were cutting back, Telsa was ramping up investment. He said Tesla might announce the location of a new U.S. factory in one to three months. 
Tesla in January said it expected positive quarterly cash flow and positive net income going forward. The company on Wednesday did not update its previous forecast of delivering half a million vehicles by the end of 2020. 
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus has disrupted demand for cars, with automakers including Tesla forced to furlough workers and close factories. 
Vehicle demand in the United States has dropped as much as 80% in some hard-hit areas in March, but some analysts said sales appeared to recover slightly in April.
Tesla on Wednesday said it expected production at its vehicle factories in Fremont, California and in Shanghai, China to ramp up gradually through the second quarter.
The company said operations at its Shanghai plant were progressing better than expected, with production rates of its Model 3 sedan expected to hit 4,000 units per week, or 200,000 per year, by mid-2020.
Company-wide automotive gross margins in the first quarter jumped to 25.5%.
But of the $5.1 billion in overall automotive revenue, nearly 7% were due to regulatory credits - money Tesla receives from other automakers that buy the company's carbon emissions credits to meet stricter regulation. Revenue from those credits nearly tripled from the last quarter.
 Hargreaves  Lansdown (LON:HRGV) analyst Nicholas Hyett also flagged that Tesla's free cash flow was negative last quarter and improved only modestly on a yearly basis.
""The immediate future doesn’t look like the ideal time to be selling premium priced cars, so perhaps it’s no surprise guidance has been paused,"" Hyett said.
Tesla said its free cash flow had been impacted by growing inventory due to coronavirus shutdowns.
Tesla shut down the California factory just as it was ramping up production of its new electric crossover utility vehicle Model Y, which it expects to generate record demand and higher profit margins. 
Tesla on Wednesday said the Model Y was already contributing profits, marking the first time in the company's history that a new vehicle is profitable in its first quarter.
Excluding items, Tesla posted a profit of $1.24 per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 36 cents per share. 
Tesla shares are up 91% for the year to date as of Wednesday's close, after recovering from a sharp slump in March.
The Tesla CEO in particular appeared critical of the coronavirus-related restrictions in California as he agreed with a tweet suggesting the state's hospitals were laying off staff and going bankrupt. He also referenced data saying hospitals in California ""have been half empty"".
Musk seemed to be supportive of the way the lockdown was being lifted in Germany as the European nation began to gradually and tentatively reopen. 

""Very sensible,"" Musk tweeted late on Wednesday responding to a media report on how Germany was lifting its restrictions.

1469,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 11:25PM ET</span>",Big U.S. banks cry foul over temporary exclusion from small business lending program,"By Michelle Price
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wall Street banks criticized the U.S. government on Wednesday after the Small Business Administration said it would temporarily close its Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses hurt by the novel coronavirus to all but the country's smallest lenders.
The agency said it would only accept loans from banks with assets of $1 billion or less from 4 p.m. EDT (2000 GMT) until midnight on Wednesday. It said 5,300 lenders had originated 960,000 loans worth nearly $60 billion in total by Wednesday at 5 p.m. EDT.
""In addition to ensuring access for the smallest lenders, we expect that providing this reserved processing time today will enhance the SBA’s loan system performance,” the SBA and U.S. Treasury said in a statement, referring to technology problems the program has been experiencing.
The move appeared to be aimed at addressing fears that small lenders which predominantly serve minority-owned businesses would have to compete with big banks for the program's more than $310 billion after they exhausted money ring-fenced for them on Tuesday.
There are approximately 3,862 commercial banks with assets of less than $1 billion, according to 2019 regulatory data, although many credit unions and other community lenders would also be small enough to use the new reserve window.
But the decision angered big banks, which are sitting on hundreds of thousands of applications from small businesses and had been criticized by policymakers for failing to get funds to needy clients during the program's first round.
""With the SBA blocking nearly 800 banks, relief for potentially thousands of small business owners and their employees will be delayed,"" said Kevin Fromer, CEO of the Financial Services Forum which represents  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), among others.
""A better solution would be a fully operational system that allows banks of all sizes to provide support to Main Street,"" he said in a statement.
The SBA released $310 billion in fresh small-business aid on Monday, after the program's first $349 billion was exhausted in less than two weeks.
Created as part of a $2.3 trillion congressional economic relief package, the program allows small businesses hurt by the epidemic to apply for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans with participating banks.
Wednesday's announcement is the latest twist for the program, which has been beset by technology and paperwork issues and subject to intense scrutiny due to worries the money was not getting to the most deserving companies.
During the second round, Congress ring-fenced $30 billion of the funds for banks with less than $10 billion in assets and other community lending groups that predominantly service minority-owned businesses, amid fears that the country's biggest banks would suck up the funds.
With so much pent-up demand, that pot of cash was exhausted on Tuesday, requiring smaller lenders that didn't secure funds to compete with larger banks, sparking worries businesses owned by people of color may miss out on the loans.
Still, big banks said the move could hurt thousands of other businesses that were depending on them.
""Don't play favorites with small businesses,"" Richard Hunt, CEO of the Consumer Bankers Association, tweeted.
""All need a lifeline right now.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) -  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd's (AX:VAH) administrators have halted payments to bondholders and appointed  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) to help sell the airline within four months, said a participant in a meeting of creditors owed nearly A$7 billion ($4.58 billion).
Administrators from Deloitte Australia were appointed this month to restructure and sell Virgin, making it the Asia-Pacific airline industry's biggest victim of the coronavirus crisis.
The administrators this week issued an information memorandum and opened a data room for interested parties that had signed non-disclosure agreements, administrator Vaughan Strawbridge said at the meeting on Thursday, a creditor told Reuters.
Strawbridge said the airline expected high-quality bids, but he did not name the parties, according to the creditor, who declined to be named for fear of breaching confidentiality.
A Deloitte spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Private equity and distressed situation specialists Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), Oaktree Capital Management and BGH Capital are among more than 10 firms to express interest in the restructuring, Reuters has reported, citing five sources. 
Deloitte also told creditors it would seek court orders to extend by three months a May 22 deadline to hold a second meeting. Delaying it to Aug. 22 would give it more time to investigate the company's affairs and find a buyer, the source said.
Virgin owes A$2.3 billion in secured debt to banks and aircraft financiers, A$2 billion to unsecured bondholders, A$1.9 billion of aircraft lessors, and A$450 million to employees.
Trade creditors are also owed A$167 million and landlords are owed A$71 million, court documents show.
Although lenders face the slashing of their debts, Strawbridge said that there probably were sufficient assets to cover employee entitlements, but that the administrators had put a moratorium on the coupon payments on the bonds to preserve the company's cash balance, the meeting participant said.
Strawbridge could not estimate the value of those bonds, the source said.

For now, Virgin is flying a skeleton schedule under its regular management team as administrators seek a buyer for the entire operation.

The unit, Tyson Fresh Meats, also said it was screening plant employees for COVID-19 this week and has scaled back production at the facility due to increased absenteeism over the last few weeks. 
The facility employs 4,300 people and is among the largest beef processing plants in the United States, producing enough beef in one day to feed 18 million people, according to Tyson. 
Some of the largest U.S. slaughterhouses have been shuttered due to outbreaks of the coronavirus among workers forcing the country's farmers to cull livestock as they run short of space to house animals.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered meat-processing plants to stay open to protect the food supply in the United States, drawing a backlash from unions that said at-risk workers required more protection.

Tyson has also voluntarily idled its pork facilities in Waterloo and Perry, Iowa, and Logansport, Indiana, and a beef facility in Pasco, Washington while it completes cleaning of the facilities and workers there undergo screening.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 09:31PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Chesapeake Energy preparing bankruptcy filing,"By Mike Spector and David French
(Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp (NYSE:CHK), the oil and gas exploration and production company that was at the forefront of the past decade's U.S. shale boom, is preparing a potential bankruptcy filing as it grapples with an unprecedented rout in energy prices, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The Oklahoma City-based company, cofounded by late wildcatter and outspoken natural gas proponent Aubrey McClendon, has held discussions with creditors about a possible loan that would aid operations while it navigates bankruptcy proceedings, the sources said. The loan could total roughly $1 billion, though its size remains in flux, one of the sources added. 
Such loans, referred to as debtor-in-possession financing, are key to companies seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection because they help them sustain as much of their business as possible during court proceedings. 
Chesapeake's discussions about possibly obtaining bankruptcy financing are in early stages, and the company has made no final decisions about how it plans to address its debts, the sources cautioned. It could attempt to persuade creditors to restructure its debt outside of bankruptcy proceedings, said the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Chesapeake did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Chesapeake was trying to pivot from gas to a greater emphasis on oil production when a Saudi-Russian energy price war earlier this year upended its plans and the wider crude market. It was dealt another blow by the coronavirus outbreak, which caused energy demand to dwindle by shutting large swaths of the global economy. 
Chesapeake, which employed about 2,300 people as of the end of last year, faces significant payments due this year on portions of its nearly $9 billion debt pile. Maturities and interest expenses combined total more than $1 billion, according to a regulatory filing. 
Chesapeake is considering skipping a payment of $192 million due in August, adding urgency to the discussions with creditors, one of the sources said. Chesapeake also faces a $136 million obligation on July 1.
Chesapeake is also discussing the prospect of obtaining an additional equity infusion that would likely follow a bankruptcy filing, according to one of the sources. The company does not currently anticipate help in the form of U.S. government aid provided to companies ailing from the coronavirus crisis, the source added. 
The company said in January it had cut debt by $900 million, and in February added it had ample liquidity of about $1.4 billion to address looming debt maturities. Yet much of that cash sits within a revolving credit line, the size of which could soon be more restricted, according to credit ratings firm Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investor Service. The company recently suspended its dividend on a series of convertible preferred stock. 
Earlier this month, Moody's cut Chesapeake's credit rating deep into junk territory, which makes it exceedingly expensive to borrow because of the high risk of defaulting on debt. The ratings move reflected plunging energy prices along with the company's eroding liquidity and ""very limited access to capital,"" Moody's said. Moody's predicted a ""high likelihood of a restructuring in the near term.""
Chesapeake has operations in five U.S. states, including Pennsylvania, Texas and Louisiana.
The company completed a reverse stock split in April to avoid being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares are down more than 80% this year, giving it a market capitalization under $300 million. [nL3N2C11TF]
Chesapeake started reworking its balance sheet before the end of last year and was able to push out some debt maturities. Still, portions of the company's debt are trading at prices that indicate investors all but expect they will never be fully repaid.
Its 11.5% bonds due in 2025, issued in December as part of a broader reworking of its liabilities, are trading around just 8 cents on the dollar, according to Refinitiv data. Another set of bonds due roughly a year later trade even lower, at about 4 cents.
FALL FROM GRACE
A bankruptcy filing, were one to occur, would cap a long reversal of fortunes for a company that became part of the S&P 500 Index less than 20 years after its founding, and helped revolutionize the energy industry. 
Chesapeake began with a small investment in 1989 by Oklahoma businessman Tom Ward and McClendon, the latter of whom became the company's longtime chairman and chief executive. 
Under McClendon's stewardship, Chesapeake spent $43 billion over 15 years snapping up land parcels across the United States, helping pioneer the relentless extraction of untapped oil and natural gas from shale rock formations, an environmentally controversial method that became known as fracking. 
McClendon was an unabashed evangelist for natural gas, arguing it could replace oil and coal. By 2005, Chesapeake was the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, trailing only the colossal  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM). 
A subsequent glut in natural gas caused the commodity's price to crash. In March 2016, a federal indictment charged McClendon with conspiring to suppress land prices by rigging bids for leases while leading Chesapeake. 

McClendon at the time called the charge ""wrong and unprecedented"" and vowed to ""prove my innocence and clear my name."" He died in a single-car crash the following day. A state medical examiner later determined the death to be an accident.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>",Facebook sees 'signs of stability' in ad spending after coronavirus drop,"By Katie Paul and Munsif Vengattil
(Reuters) -  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) beat analysts' estimates for quarterly revenue on Wednesday and said it has seen ""signs of stability"" for sales in April after a plunge in March, in yet another signal that tech giants may weather the coronavirus-induced economic collapse better than other sectors.
The announcement came a day after Alphabet's (O:GOOGL) Google said a drop in its online ad sales similarly steadied in April. Shares of Facebook, the world's biggest social network and the owner of WhatsApp and Instagram, soared 9% in extended trading.
Facebook said advertising revenue was roughly flat in the first three weeks of April compared with the same period last year, a tentative early sign of recovery following a ""steep decrease"" in revenue in March as lockdowns took effect worldwide to slow the spread of the virus.
Revenue growth was 18% in the first quarter, Facebook's slowest ever by a wide margin, although it beat analysts' expectations for growth of 16%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Ad sales, which make up nearly all of Facebook's revenue, rose 17% to $17.44 billion.
Some businesses took advantage of bargain pricing to run a heavier volume of ads after the pandemic wiped out Facebook ad pricing over the course of the quarter, contributing to a 39% increase in total ad impressions, executives said.
Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told analysts the company saw an increase in gaming ads and steady spending from technology and e-commerce players, which offset ""significant declines"" in ads from the hard-hit travel and auto sectors.
GLOOMY OUTLOOK
Even so, analysts have a gloomy outlook for Facebook's second quarter, with advertisers across industries slashing marketing budgets in response to virus-related uncertainty, including many of the small businesses and direct-to-consumer brands that market themselves heavily on Facebook.
Flat revenue in April indicates that the second quarter will be ""more challenging"" than the first, said eMarketer analyst Debra Aho Williamson, as countries emerge from lockdown and businesses reopen at varying rates.
The company said around 3 billion users interacted with at least one of its apps each month in the quarter, up from 2.9 billion last quarter, as social networks use surged during coronavirus lockdowns. Some of that engagement is expected to slip once shelter-in-place orders are relaxed, it said.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg cautioned against a rush to end lockdowns.
""I worry that re-opening certain places too quickly before infection rates have been reduced to very minimal levels will almost guarantee future outbreaks and worse longer-term health and economic outcomes,"" he said.
He struck a markedly different tone from fellow Silicon Valley chief executive Elon Musk, the head of Tesla (O:TSLA), who called the lockdowns ""fascist"" on Tesla's earnings call on Wednesday.
KEEP ON BUILDING
Executives said Facebook will move forward with plans to hire 10,000 new employees this year, largely in product and engineering roles, but will pull back on hiring plans for business departments like ad sales.
Facebook lowered its guidance for total expenses in 2020 to $52 billion-$56 billion, down from a prior range of $54 billion-$59 billion, citing the slower headcount growth and savings from canceled travel, events and marketing.
Total costs for the first quarter rose just 1% to $11.84 billion.
Zuckerberg said he accepted that profit margins will decrease this year, but said he was committed to maintaining plans for investment ""rather than slamming on the brakes now, as I think a lot of companies may.""
He said he aimed to ""keep on building and keep on investing,"" particularly to ""make up for some of the stuff that other companies would pull back on,"" which in some ways was ""an opportunity"" for Facebook, given its deep cash reserves.
Zuckerberg said he would eventually plan to moderate expenses over time, noting that the company's strong finances amid the economic pullback ""has certainly reinforced for me the importance of maintaining high margins.""

1474,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 07:17PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch on April 30,"By Kim Khan 
Investing.com - The stock market demonstrated its ability to turn any hopeful news into solid gains today, rallying sharply following a positive report on Gilead’s virus treatment.
And that enthusiasm could follow through tomorrow as big-name postmarket earnings satisfied the bulls.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rose in after-hours trading following their results.
Investors shrugged off a sharp contraction in first-quarter GDP reported today, but tomorrow brings the more timely jobless claims numbers.
More big-name earnings arrive as well and it’s ECB decision day.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Rise in Jobless Claims Seen Tempering Again
Jobless claims will be in the spotlight ahead of trading tomorrow, with forecasts expecting them to show another decline in those filing for benefits but to be still at historically high levels.
The Labor Department reports weekly initial jobless claims at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Claims for first-time unemployment benefits are expected to have risen by 3.5 million, down from a rise of 4.43 million the week before, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com. 
Continuing claims are seen rising to about 19.3 million.
At the same time, March personal income and spending data arrive.
Spending is expected to have fallen 5% last month, with income down 1.5%.
2. Another Big Bout of Tech Earnings on Tap
Major tech earnings have so far justified the bullish bets of investors and two more big names will dominate the postmarket results Thursday.
Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), expected to be one of the few companies not struggling during the lockdown, reports its results.
Analysts are predicting a profit of $6.34 per share and revenue of about $72 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
Last week Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) boosted its price target on the stock to $2,900 from $2,600, the high-water market on Wall Street, and said it should report numbers well above the consensus.
“The increase in demand the company's retail, (cloud) and ads businesses is seeing and Amazon's ability to meet the challenges of this demand, will, we believe, serve to steepen the curve of its long term growth rate, drive incremental profitability, and further deepen the competitive moat around all of its businesses,” Goldman analyst Heath Terry said in a note.
Shareholders will also be looking for any response to President Donald Trump's assertions that package delivery companies should be paying much more to use the U.S. Postal Service.
Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will also issue its quarterly numbers.
The company is expected to post a profit of $2.31 per share and revenue of about $55 billion.
Apple is reportedly delaying the ramp-up in production of its flagship 2020 iPhones due to demand concerns and manufacturing disruption due to Covid-19.
Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) will report ahead of trading, with the consensus calling for a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of about $791 million.
And McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) will weigh in ahead of trading as well. Analysts predict earnings of $1.60 per share on sales of about $4.7 billion.
Investors will also be looking for ideas as to when the company will start opening up its restaurants.
3. ECB Decision, Press Conference Ahead
Central banks continue to be at the forefront tomorrow as the European Central Bank has its decision day.
The ECB will issue its policy statement at 7:45 AM ET (11:45 GMT).
ECB President Christine Lagarde will hold her press conference soon afterwards at 8:30 AM ET.
The central bank is not expected to make any moves on interest rates or adjustments to its 750 billion euro Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) until it gets better clarity on how the easing of lockdown measures is progressing.
Policymakers are also awaiting details from the EU on a potential proposed recovery fund for the coronavirus.
""PEPP may be sufficiently large to fend off (temporarily) pressure on individual countries or product classes until we have more clarity on funding needs a bit later in the year,"" Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said."
1475,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",Trump says internet retailers that use 'laughing stock' Post Office must pay more,"By Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump lambasted internet retailers again on Wednesday for taking advantage of the U.S. Postal Service and said those firms needed to pay more for package delivery.
""We want our post office to be successful. We don't want it to be a laughing stock and a stupidly run organization the way it's been for so many decades now. It's ridiculous,"" Trump said during an event at the White House.
""We want to stabilize the post office, and the way you do that is these companies are going to have to pay more,"" Trump said of internet retailers. ""The companies are going to have to pay a percentage of that ... loss.""
Trump threatened last week to block federal aid for the Postal Service unless it raises shipping rates for online companies like Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), prompting criticism that the move would hurt consumers relying more than usual on packages during the coronavirus outbreak.
The Postal Service, which employs more than 600,000 people, has said that it may not be able to continue service past September without help, as the pandemic batters the U.S. economy.
Trump has long been critical of Amazon in particular. He did not mention the company by name on Wednesday, but his pique with the online retailer was clear.
""We're making a lot of people rich and a lot of companies rich by subsidizing these companies. On top of that, they don't pay the same taxes as a retail store. It's very unfair to the retailers,"" Trump said.
Amazon founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world, according to Forbes. Bezos owns the Washington Post newspaper, whose coverage of the Trump administration has angered the president.
The Package Coalition, whose members include Amazon, eBay Inc (O:EBAY) and others, has said that raising prices to deliver packages would mean Americans would pay higher prices.
The president, a Republican who is running for re-election in November, made clear he wanted to protect postal workers
""We want to take care of our taxpayers and we want to take care of, very, very importantly, the people that work at the post office.""

1476,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",Proxy advisory firms urge Dine Brands investors to reject activist's IHOP plan,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Two influential proxy advisory firms said Dine Brands Global Inc (N:DIN) shareholders should reject a proposal to spin off its IHOP pancake house chain in a rebuke to activist investment firm JCP Investment Partnership which proposed the plan.
Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis both recommended votes against JCP's shareholder proposal that Glendale, California-based Dine hire an investment bank in order to turn IHOP into a separately traded public company, the two reports, which were seen by Reuters on Wednesday, say. 
The firms' recommendations carry considerable weight with investors who will cast votes at Dine's annual meeting on May 12.
ISS and Glass Lewis both said JCP's arguments that Dine would be better off letting the pancake house chain become a standalone company were not convincing. Dine also owns Applebee's Grill & Bar in addition to IHOP.
JCP ""has not provided a thorough quantitative assessment to support its arguments,"" the Glass Lewis report said, adding ""this proposal is overly prescriptive and would limit the board's ability to fully consider other potential strategic alternatives.""
JCP's shareholder proposal became public in a regulatory filing earlier this month and has not gained much traction at a time most U.S. restaurants have largely been ordered to shut in order to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The investment firm did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Dine declined to comment.
ISS said bluntly that hiring an investment bank now to try and spin off a restaurant chain at a time few people are dining out would be a waste of time and money. ""Hiring an investment banker to effect a spinoff of IHOP may not be considered a prudent use of board and management resources at this time,"" the report said.
JCP, a Houston-based firm run by James Pappas, argued that ""the valuation increase and potential earnings increase for IHOP would vastly outweigh the existing synergies associated with keeping IHOP and Applebee’s together.""
Much has changed for investors after a historic stock-market selloff and as 26 million U.S. jobs were lost in the last five weeks. Many activist investors have quickly and often quietly dropped demands for change to let management navigate the crisis.
The Pappas family has deep roots in the restaurant business as James' father, Christopher Pappas, is president and chief executive officer of restaurant chain Luby’s Inc (N:LUB), which operates the Fuddruckers chain among others.

S&P, which downgraded its rating to 'BBB-/A-3' from 'BBB/A-2', said it expects a significant decline in cash flow as Boeing tackles lower aircraft deliveries and aftermarket sales resulting from the impact of the coronavirus on air travel.
This will only be partly offset by the company's efforts to reduce costs to match lower demand, S&P said.
The coronavirus pandemic, which has led to travel bans, has added to the crisis the company faced over the grounding of its 737 MAX following fatal crashes.

The company reported a second consecutive quarterly loss on Wednesday and said it would cut its 160,000-person workforce by about 10%, further reduce 787 Dreamliner production and try to boost liquidity as it prepares for a years-long industry recovery from the pandemic.

The Global Markets Division Sustainable Solutions Council's roughly 20 members will meet every few weeks to share information about strategies and what is working for trading teams based across the Americas, Europe and Asia, said Stacy Selig, co-head of Goldman's global markets structuring and solutions business.
""The council pulls together a collection of people who have the perfect expertise to share information more widely across the division and firm,"" Selig said in an interview with Reuters.
Sustainable investing skeptics have questioned for sometime how well portfolios focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues would perform in a down market. 
Investing research firm Morningstar Inc said in early April that sustainable equity funds and ESG-tilted index funds did suffer large losses during the first quarter because of the coronavirus outbreak, but that returns at most of these funds held up better than returns from conventional funds. 
Selig said the bank's institutional investors have put more money into sustainable portfolios since ESG funds showed resilience during recent market turmoil.

Working with Goldman's firmwide sustainable finance group and smaller councils within the bank, the council will be tasked with communicating across asset classes and products, Selig said.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 06:05PM ET</span>",Norwegian Air bondholders to vote on debt plan on Thursday,"By Victoria Klesty
OSLO (Reuters) - Bondholders in Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) are set to vote on Thursday on the airline's debt-to-equity plan, the first major test of the budget carrier's rescue efforts amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The carrier may run out of cash by mid-May unless its plan, involving a swap of up to $1.2 billion worth of debt into equity and hands over most of the ownership to the firm's lessors and bondholders, is approved by creditors and shareholders.
If successful, the plan would allow Norwegian to tap government guarantees of up to 2.7 billion crowns ($260 million) which hinges on a reduction its ratio of debt to equity, on top of 300 million crowns it has already received.
Bondholders start voting after 1600 CET (1400 GMT). If they agree, the plan will be put to shareholders on May 4 for their own approval. 
Norwegian Air warned on April 27 that taking the company through an alternative route of bankruptcy proceedings in Norway would destroy much of the value left in the firm and that most creditors would likely recover little of their claims.
Some bondholders have said they would vote in favour of the plan, although the outcome of the vote is unclear.
PIONEER
Norwegian grew rapidly in the last decade to become Europe's third-largest low-cost airline and the biggest foreign carrier serving New York and other major U.S. cities but it also accumulated debt and liabilities of close to $8 billion. 
Before the novel coronavirus outbreak all but shut down air traffic due to government-imposed travel restrictions, the airline had taken steps to cut costs and routes, aiming to make a full-year profit for the first time in four years.
Currently only paying invoices vital to its minimum operations, such as salaries for staff still employed and critical IT infrastructure, Norwegian has put payments for ground handling, debt and leases on hold.
Norwegian Air is yet to announce the conversion price at which the swap is to take place before four separate votes take place - one for each of the four bonds proposed to be converted into equity.
The plan, if approved by bondholders, also requires backing from shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting scheduled for May 4, and from leasing firms.
The airline also plans to raise 400 million crowns from selling new shares.

1480,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 05:45PM ET</span>","Virus Impact May Extend to 57 Million U.S. Jobs, McKinsey Says","(Bloomberg) -- The coronavirus pandemic will hurt 57 million U.S. workers, more than double the number of jobless claims so far, once furloughs and reduced hours and pay are included, according to McKinsey & Co.
The more than 26 million people who have filed unemployment claims in the past five weeks provide only a partial picture of workforce dislocations, with tens of millions more facing additional risks, according to a report by economists including Susan Lund at the McKinsey Global Institute, the think tank arm of the consultancy.
The earliest wave of unemployment claims in mid-March disproportionately hit the food service, entertainment and hotel industries. The disruption has since moved into categories including retail, business services, manufacturing and non-essential health care.
There’s significant overlap between workers who are vulnerable because of the virus and those whose jobs were already at risk from automation, providing a challenge for the U.S. to train at-risk employees for more sustainable job opportunities.
Low-wage, part-time and minority workers are the most likely to be hurt by the pandemic, with 74% of at-risk jobs paying less than $40,000 a year, according to McKinsey’s analysis. But the number of full-time and white-collar positions being affected is rising, with 16% of vulnerable workers making more than $70,000 a year.“It’s really the people who are generally lowest paid, less educated and least prepared to weather a spell of unemployment that are most at risk,” Lund said in a phone interview.
Education is the strongest demographic predictor of vulnerability, with people who don’t have bachelor’s degrees twice as likely to hold such jobs.
Companies can help by reducing hours and temporarily furloughing workers rather than firing them, McKinsey said. They also should offer greater flexibility to parents working from home and find ways to reconfigure office spaces to prevent a new virus outbreak. State workforce agencies can help provide training and education opportunities for the unemployed, McKinsey said

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 05:20PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Brazil, automakers deadlocked over loan collateral from parent companies - sources","By Carolina Mandl and Marcelo Rochabrun
SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Global automakers seeking emergency financing for their plants in Brazil have reached an impasse with several state and private banks, after the lenders demanded collateral from the parent companies, two sources told Reuters.
The sources said the carmakers have balked at the request, delaying any decision on the billions of reais sought by automakers.
Brazil is South America's largest auto producer and a major base of operations for General Motors Co (N:GM),  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA), Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), which are requesting a bailout for their local units to weather the crisis stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.
An auto industry source familiar with the negotiations said the companies still hope a deal can be made before May 8, when Brazil's auto industry association will hold a regular news conference to discuss production figures.
The Brazilian government has been trying to coordinate bailout talks with industries including airlines and autos through its National Development Bank (BNDES) and other state-controlled banks like Banco do Brasil SA (SA:BBAS3), but also including several listed banks with no government ownership.
The auto sector started the talks with banks and government demanding a 100 billion-reais ($19.10 billion) bailout. Reuters reported earlier that sources doubted the package will reach that amount.
The automakers, which also include Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co Ltd (T:7201), Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203), Honda Motor Co Ltd (T:7267) and Hyundai in addition to France's  Renault  (PA:RENA) and  Peugeot  (PA:PEUP), have stated they require urgent loans to make payroll and to keep alive what they describe as a crucial supply chain that contributes a significant chunk of Brazil's GDP.
The government and the banks, on the other hand, want to compel the carmakers to share any loans with their suppliers and dealers, who also employ many people, one of the sources said. Also included among the banks are Banco Bradesco SA (SA:BBDC4), Itau Unibanco SA (SA:ITUB4) and  Banco Santander  (MC:SAN) Brasil SA (SA:SANB3)
BNDES is also in talks to help airlines with 10 billion reais in aid, but discussions have stalled because of the Brazilian government's request that the loans be convertible into equity.
The auto industry source said the carmakers are seeking loans with low interest rates and long maturity dates, and with some form of local collateral.
The other source said banks do not consider auto plants in Brazil particularly appealing as collateral, saying they would be hard to sell if necessary.
Ford recently tried but failed to sell its oldest plant in Brazil, in the state of Sao Paulo. It has since shut down and employees have been laid off.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 04:37PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amazon turns to Chinese firm on U.S. blacklist to meet thermal camera needs,"By Krystal Hu and Jeffrey Dastin
NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) has bought cameras to take temperatures of workers during the coronavirus pandemic from a firm the United States blacklisted over allegations it helped China detain and monitor the Uighurs and other Muslim minorities, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
China's Zhejiang Dahua Technology Co Ltd (SZ:002236) shipped 1,500 cameras to Amazon this month in a deal valued close to $10 million, one of the people said. At least 500 systems from Dahua - the blacklisted firm - are for Amazon's use in the United States, another person said.
The Amazon procurement, which has not been previously reported, is legal because the rules control U.S. government contract awards and exports to blacklisted firms, but they do not stop sales to the private sector.
However, the United States ""considers that transactions of any nature with listed entities carry a 'red flag' and recommends that U.S. companies proceed with caution,"" according to the Bureau of Industry and Security's https://bis.doc.gov/index.php/2011-09-12-20-18-59/export-and-reexport-faqs/faq/118-can-a-u-s-company-have-any-dealings-with-a-listed-entity website. Dahua has disputed the designation, and Beijing has denied mistreatment of the minority groups.
The deal comes as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned of a shortage of temperature-reading devices and said it wouldn't halt certain pandemic uses of thermal cameras that lack the agency's regulatory approval. Top U.S.-based maker FLIR Systems Inc (O:FLIR) has faced an up to weeks-long order backlog, forcing it to prioritize products for hospitals and other critical facilities.
Amazon declined to confirm its purchase from Dahua, but said its hardware complied with national, state and local law, and its temperature checks were to ""support the health and safety of our employees, who continue to provide a critical service in our communities.""
The company added it was implementing thermal imagers from ""multiple"" manufacturers, which it declined to name. These vendors include Infrared Cameras Inc, which Reuters previously reported, and FLIR, according to employees at Amazon-owned Whole Foods who saw the deployment. FLIR declined to comment on its customers.
""It’s troubling to learn that well-known American companies are continuing to turn a blind eye to companies that are fueling the Chinese Communist Party's brutal treatment of so many of their own people,"" said the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul, in reaction to the news.
Dahua, one of the biggest surveillance camera manufacturers globally, said it does not discuss customer engagements and it adheres to applicable laws. Dahua is committed ""to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19"" through technology that detects ""abnormal elevated skin temperature — with high accuracy,"" it said in a statement.
The U.S. Department of Commerce, which maintains the blacklist, declined comment. The FDA said it would use discretion when enforcing regulations during the public health crisis as long as thermal systems lacking compliance posed no ""undue risk"" and secondary evaluations confirmed fevers.
Dahua's thermal cameras have been used in hospitals, airports, train stations, government offices and factories during the pandemic. International Business Machines Corp (N:IBM) placed an order for 100 units, and the automaker Chrysler placed an order for 10, one of the sources said. In addition to selling thermal technology, Dahua makes white-label security cameras resold under dozens of other brands such as Honeywell (NYSE:HON), according to research and reporting firm IPVM.
Honeywell said some but not all its cameras are manufactured by Dahua, and it holds products to its cybersecurity and compliance standards.  IBM  and Chrysler's parent  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) did not comment.
The Trump Administration added Dahua and seven other tech firms last year to the blacklist for acting against U.S. foreign policy interests, saying they were ""implicated"" in ""China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.""
More than one million people have been sent to camps in the Xinjiang region as part of China's campaign to root out terrorism, the United Nations has estimated.
Dahua has said the U.S. decision lacked ""any factual basis."" Beijing has urged the United States to remove the companies from the list.
A provision of U.S. law, which is scheduled to take effect in August, will also bar the federal government from starting or renewing contracts with a company using ""any equipment, system, or service"" from firms including Dahua ""as a substantial or essential component of any system.""
Amazon's cloud unit is a major contractor with the U.S. intelligence community, and it has been battling  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) for an up to $10 billion deal with the Pentagon.
Top industry associations have asked Congress for a year-long delay because they say the law would reduce supplies to the government dramatically, and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that policies clarifying the implementation of the law were forthcoming.
FACE DETECTION & PRIVACY
The coronavirus has infected staff from dozens of Amazon warehouses, ignited small protests over allegedly unsafe conditions and prompted unions to demand site closures. Temperature checks help Amazon stay operational, and the cameras - a faster, socially distant alternative to forehead thermometers - can speed up lines to enter its buildings. Amazon said the type of temperature reader it uses varies by building.
To see if someone has a fever, Dahua's camera compares a person's radiation to a separate infrared calibration device. It uses face detection technology to track subjects walking by and make sure it is looking for heat in the right place.
An additional recording device keeps snapshots of faces the camera has spotted and their temperatures, according to a demonstration of the technology in San Francisco. Optional facial recognition software can fetch images of the same subject across time to determine, for instance, who a virus patient may have been near in a line for temperature checks.
Amazon said it is not using facial recognition on any of its thermal cameras. Civil liberties groups have warned the software could strip people of privacy and lead to arbitrary apprehensions if relied on by police. U.S. authorities have also worried that equipment makers like Dahua could hide a technical ""back door"" to Chinese government agents seeking intelligence.
In response to questions about the thermal systems, Amazon said in a statement, ""None of this equipment has network connectivity, and no personal identifiable information will be visible, collected, or stored.""
Dahua made the decision to market its technology in the United States before the FDA issued the guidance on thermal cameras in the pandemic. Its supply is attracting many U.S. customers not deterred by the blacklist, according to Evan Steiner, who sells surveillance equipment from a range of manufacturers in California through his firm EnterActive Networks LLC.

""You're seeing a lot of companies doing everything that they possibly can preemptively to prepare for their workforce coming back,"" he said.

1489,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>","Fear, sticker shock over health insurance greet laid-off workers","By Beth Pinsker
NEW YORK (Reuters) - If you were laid off in April, the health insurance from your job may stop at the end of the month. Then what? 
Rest assured there are options, even if they are all expensive. 
If you are losing a workplace plan, you will get paperwork explaining your benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, known as COBRA, which allows you to continue on your same plan. The catch is that you have to pay the full amount of the premiums, not just the employee portion. 
""The employer was typically paying 50 to 100% of the cost, that's why COBRA is so expensive,"" said Anthony Lopez, vice president of operations for eHealth.com https://www.ehealthinsurance.com, a nationwide aggregator.
Lopez said most people calling eHealth now are looking for other options besides COBRA, and that means going through the state exchanges, private insurance or short-term plans. You can also go to state websites, healthcare.gov https://www.healthcare.gov or directly to insurance companies to find rates for your personal situation. 
""People are scared,"" Lopez said, mostly because they fear they will not be able to get health insurance. 
Lopez said he was not seeing denials, which is reassuring, but then the fear turns into sticker shock. 
The key to picking the best plan is to figure out if it is better to pay less for the premium, but more of the actual cost of the care through a high deductible - and which level to choose. 
The average monthly premium for 2020 was $456 for individuals and $1,134 for families, according to eHealth's latest analysis. Deductibles averaged $4,263 for individuals and $7,893 for families, meaning this is how much they would have to pay out of pocket, excluding services like well visits for children, before the insurance starts to pay. 
Options for high-deductible plans have been prevalent for years, even through employer plans, but many would have these costs offset by the employer paying a big chunk of the premium and also contributing a lump sum toward the deductible. 
Help might be available for premium reductions for those who qualify for government subsidies. The math will be a little tricky right now though, because the calculation is based on your last tax return. If you estimate your income based on your job loss, and then you get another job, you may owe a penalty, Lopez warned. 
DEALING WITH DEDUCTIBLES
It is not just Americans facing job losses who have to face the reality of high deductibles because of COVID-19. Those still on their workplace plans, who may have been furloughed but are able to keep their insurance, are having to manage their costs more than ever. 
Researchers at the University of Southern (NYSE:SO) California Sol Price School of Public Policy studied what happens financially to people who switch from traditional health plans to high-deductible plans, and found there was a significant increase in out-of-pocket spending and excessive financial burden. 
""If you are healthy and lucky, then a high deductible is a great thing for you,"" said Neeraj Sood, a professor at USC who worked on the study. 
None of us is very lucky right now, however. 
In reality, it is very easy to rip through a deductible of several thousand dollars. A couple of trips to urgent care at full price or an afternoon in an emergency room could do it. 
Even if the test for COVID-19 is a covered expense, there are all sorts of other costs you could face if you fall ill, and you are on the hook for normal healthcare costs too. 
It takes advance planning to properly deal with these expenses, and that will not be something everyone can pull off with stretched finances. 
Jeff Hicks, a certified financial planner from Illinois, is one model. He has had a $10,000 family deductible plan for nearly 20 years, and each year religiously puts aside the full amount of the deductible in a Health Savings Account, which is a specialized pre-tax account that also grows tax-free.
For the first four years, he spent none of it. Then his wife got very sick, and they went the next four years spending the full amount. Since then, they have gone back and forth on the spending. 
""Once she had this catastrophic deal, I knew we were looking at potentially having it every year. I resigned myself to the fact that this may be the path we’re on,"" Hicks said.

1497,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 04:03PM ET</span>","Stocks - Dow Racks up Gains on Fed Stimulus Hopes, Progress on Covid-19 Drug","By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com - The Dow rallied on Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stoked hopes of more stimulus and a positive update on a potential drug to treat Covid-19 patients lifted sentiment.
The {{169|Dow Jones Industrial Average}} rose 2.2%, the S&P 500 added 2.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 3.6%.
""It may well be the case that the economy will need more support from all of us if the recovery is to be a robust one,"" Powell said, following the Fed's indication to keep its benchmark rate within a 0% to 0.25% range.
""The committee expects to maintain this target range until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals,"" the Fed said Wednesday.    
Many have attributed the central bank’s efforts to prop up the economy to the recent surge in the broader market since the March 23 low.
Ahead of the Fed decision and remarkets from Powell, the broader market had already racked up gains following positive news on Gilead's potential Covid-19 drug.
Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) said a clinical trial evaluating its drug remdesivir in coronavirus patients had met its primary goal, sending its shares nearly 7% higher.
""The study demonstrates the potential for some patients to be treated with a 5-day regimen, which could significantly expand the number of patients who could be treated with our current supply of remdesivir,” Gilead Chief Medical Officer Merdad Parsey said in a statement.
Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he was told data from the trial showed a ""clear cut positive effect in diminishing time to recover.""
The drug is expected to gain approval from the Federal Drug Administration for emergency use as soon as Wednesday.
With parts of the economy beginning to reopen, investors were reminded about the pandemic's impact on the economy as U.S. economic growth contracted at an annual rate of 4.8% in first quarter of the year.
FAANG stocks, meanwhile, clawed back some of their losses from a day earlier after Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported earnings that were better than feared. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which is set to report after the closing bell today, was up nearly 6%, while Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) was up more than 2% and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) gained more than 3%.

(Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (DE:VOWG_p) and Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) said Wednesday they will delay restarting U.S. production amid the coronavirus pandemic and concerns about the automotive supply network.
VW said it is indefinitely delaying the resumption of production at its Tennessee assembly plant that had been set to restart on May 3.
Toyota said it will delay the resumption of North American manufacturing operations to the week of May 11 from the week of May 4 after an ""extensive review with our supplier and logistics network.""
The German automaker in a statement that said before it sets a new date it ""will weigh the readiness of the supplier base, as well as market demand and the status of the COVID-19 outbreak."" VW's U.S. production has been suspended since March 21.
Automakers had hoped to begin restarting production in early May but face hurdles including orders in key states like Michigan that limit non-essential business operations.
Detroit's Big Three automakers have been in regular talks with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union on the conditions needed to resume production, but the companies not appear likely to resume U.S. production before May 18 at the earliest.
UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said the union continues to ""have discussions about key health and safety issues and science that need to be in place for a restart.""
Ohio on Monday outlined its reopening plan, which included reopening the construction and manufacturing sectors on May 4.
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has not set a reopening date for manufacturing yet, and the UAW, which represents many hourly auto workers in Michigan and other states, has said early May is ""too soon and too risky"" to reopen.

Kristin Dziczek, vice president, Industry, Labor & Economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, said to restart production there needs to be a tremendous orchestration and ""synchronization” across many different regions with different challenges like COVID-19 and different state orders on what is essential manufacturing.

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",Amazon is Wall Street's biggest winner from coronavirus,"By Noel Randewich
(Reuters) - No company's stock market value has benefited more from the coronavirus pandemic than Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s.
The online retailer and cloud computing heavyweight's market capitalization has ballooned by over $90 billion to record highs since mid-February, adding $5 billion to the fortune of founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos.
Optimism about gradually reopening the U.S. economy has fueled a rally on Wall Street in recent weeks, but the S&P 500 remains down 13% since Feb. 19, just before fear caused by the coronavirus gripped Wall Street and ended the benchmark's 11-year bull market. With online shopping booming as millions of people stay at home and avoid traditional stores, Amazon's stock has climbed 9% in the same period, including a 2% jump on Wednesday.
(Graphic: Amazon vs S&P 500 IMAGE link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/xklvykgaevg/Annotation%202020-04-29%20112943.jpg)
""During this crisis, Amazon has proven irreplaceable in delivering the daily necessities to people around the world, a fact that we believe will increase the number of customers on the platform, expand the list of products purchased by existing customers, accelerate the shift to ecommerce at large and enhance the company's brand,"" Monness Crespi analyst Brian White wrote in a client note on Tuesday.
White is among 49 analysts who recommend buying Amazon's shares, according to Refinitiv. Just two analysts have ""hold"" ratings and none recommend selling.
The Seattle, Washington-based company's results on Thursday after the bell will give investors a glimpse of how the global crisis has affected its retail business in the final month of the quarter, as well as its highly profitable Amazon Web Services cloud computing arm. Investors will also want to know how Amazon expects the ongoing health crisis to affect its business in coming months, including the company's ongoing, deep investments to reduce its Prime shipping to one-day from two-day service.
With hand sanitizers, groceries, office chairs, home exercise equipment and other products selling out on its website as millions of people around the world shelter at home, Amazon has struggled to increase capacity at its warehouses and maintain its supply chains while minimizing health risks to employees. Critics, including New York Attorney General Letitia James, have accused Amazon of taking inadequate measures to protect warehouse workers from catching the illness.
Reflecting changes caused by the coronavirus, the average analyst estimate for Amazon's quarterly revenue has increased by over $1 billion since the end of January, while the average estimate for its earnings has dipped by 20 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data, reflecting expectations of higher costs related to the coronavirus.
Amazon and other leading retailers may also emerge from the pandemic in stronger positions relative to competitors. The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter at its sharpest pace since the financial crisis because of shelter-in-place orders, and stores that were already struggling may not survive the health crisis.
Neiman Marcus (NYSE:MCS) [NMRCUS.UL] is preparing to seek bankruptcy protection, Reuters has reported, and Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS) last week warned it may not survive the next 12 months.
Overall, about 50 S&P 500 stocks are up since Feb. 19, a few of them directly because of the coronavirus outbreak and related changes in consumer behavior. Some of those have risen more on a percentage basis than Amazon. Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), which on Wednesday gave an encouraging update on a potential COVID-19 treatment, has jumped 25% since Feb. 19, adding $21 billion to its market capitalization.  General Mills  (NYSE:GIS) and Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) have both climbed 15% as consumers stocked up on food and other consumer staples.

Analysts on average expect Amazon's March quarter revenue to have jumped 23% to $73.61 billion, with adjusted earnings of $6.25 per share, according to Refinitiv.

1504,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 03:27PM ET</span>",U.S. CEOs Say ‘Stir Crazy’ Consumers Are Ready to Spend Again,"(Bloomberg) -- The CEO of  Starbucks Corp  (NASDAQ:SBUX). says people are getting a bit “stir crazy.” His counterpart at  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc  (NYSE:CMG). says he sees “fatigue with cooking.”
Perhaps this is wishful thinking, or maybe pent-up demand will indeed give the economy a lift as the pandemic lockdown ends. Either way, Wall Street is hanging on to every offhand comment from corporate executives for clues as to when consumers will finally be ready to venture outside and open their wallets.
Manufacturer 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co. and drugmaker  Pfizer  Inc. (NYSE:PFE), among others, have said the second quarter is likely to be a low point for the economy before a rebound begins. Automakers are cautiously coalescing around plans to reopen North American assembly plants early next month after weeks of inactivity. As Pfizer CFO Frank D’Amelio put it on a conference call Tuesday, “Punch line: second-half recovery.”
Some data would seem to support that there’s nowhere to go but up, especially in the consumer world. Traffic across retail has fallen 98%, according to location-data provider Prodco Analytics. Restaurant researcher MillerPulse reported that same-store sales fell 83% at casual-dining chains in the last week of March.
Path Forward
Some companies are now mapping out a path forward. Starbucks, which has already learned from the reopening experience in China, says it has moved on from an initial “shelter at home” phase to a “monitor and adapt” stance. This includes store-by-store decisions on when to expand operations to takeout (from inside entryways), delivery and, in some limited instances, dine-in.
CEO Kevin Johnson says it’s inevitable that sooner or later, wary consumers will venture outside the safety of their homes.
“The fact is that, as human beings, we have this natural gravitational pull to interact with other humans,” Johnson said.
There are, of course, a wide range of winners and losers across the corporate landscape, and each company’s timeline varies depending on geography and industry. Restaurants, department stores and airlines have been especially hard hit, while big-scale retailers like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc., as well as food and consumer goods companies like Clorox (NYSE:CLX) Co. and  General Mills  Inc (NYSE:GIS)., have experienced an unexpected wave of new demand.
Inverse Pull
When the recovery starts to gather momentum, these companies may start to see an inverse pull as shoppers start to reallocate their dollars back to other areas. For example, Keurig Dr Pepper (NYSE:KDP) Inc. said that consumers stocked up on crates of soft drinks and bottled water at the start of the lockdown, but that has started to slow.
Others, like PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) Inc., say that Americans that initially stocked up on products such as Quaker Oats are actively replenishing their pantries -- a sign that people are indeed consuming higher quantities of the goods from before.
Despite glimmers of hope, the overall outlook remains undeniably bleak. Millions of workers across the country have lost their jobs, either temporarily or permanently, and more could soon. With growing numbers of companies inching toward bankruptcy, the effects of joblessness will ripple through the economy and could continue to depress demand well after the economy reopens.
“The effect and the experience in Covid-19 will affect all of us for the rest of our lifetime,” Starbucks’ Johnson said.

1505,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 03:18PM ET</span>",An Ex-Goldman Bond Trader’s Quiet Rise to Managing $1.6 Trillion,"(Bloomberg) -- Before he landed the top investing job at the world’s biggest pension fund this month, Eiji Ueda spent nearly three decades at  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). avoiding the public eye.
Now the 52-year-old former bond trader is stepping into one of the biggest spotlights in global finance. As chief investment officer of Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund, he’ll be responsible for $1.6 trillion of retirement assets at a time of extreme market volatility and rising public angst about the future.
Interviews with people who know Ueda paint a picture of a steady hand, steeped in knowledge of the bond market, who has both international experience and the capacity to manage a conservative Japanese organization.
While his predecessor Hiromichi Mizuno oversaw GPIF’s biggest-ever strategic overhaul and was at times outspoken, Ueda is seen as more likely to take a methodical approach.
“Mizuno created a completely new GPIF, and fought many political battles to upgrade it,” said Jesper Koll, a longtime observer of Japanese markets who has known Ueda for almost two decades. “Where Mizuno was ‘kaikaku,’ real reform, Ueda is the undisputed master of ‘kaizen,’ seemingly small but relentless and highly effective improvements.”
Ueda, who GPIF declined to make available for an interview, kept a low profile during his time at Goldman, with just a handful of mentions in the press. He began his almost 28-year career at the bank in 1991, just as Japan’s bubble economy was bursting. The University of Tokyo graduate started out working in government bond trading in the Japanese capital, before doing a stint at the Treasuries desk in New York.
Regional Co-Head
He steadily climbed the ranks, becoming a managing director in 2000 and a partner in 2002. In 2012, he was appointed co-head of Asia Pacific Securities, a position he held until he left the bank.
One of Ueda’s early bosses at Goldman was Oki Matsumoto, the founder of Japanese online brokerage Monex Group Inc. He recalled how, as a young trader, Ueda adapted to the high-pressure world of the brokerage’s Treasuries desk in New York.
“He was sent to New York when he didn’t even speak English that well, to the heart of Goldman’s trading floor,” Matsumoto said in an interview. “But he didn’t run away. He took it on and accomplished it and earned respect along the way.”
Matsumoto also said Ueda knows his limitations and has the personality traits to manage a team. “He doesn’t just push people to do things his way, but listens carefully to others,” he said.
Peers also point to Ueda’s background in bonds, which made up about 44% of GPIF’s assets at the end of December. Ueda is a respected insider in the world of Japanese government debt, according to Koll.
At the same time, Ueda brings experience of foreign debt markets at a time when GPIF is boosting its holdings. In March, the fund said it would increase its target allocation for overseas bonds by 10 percentage points to 25%, while cutting its weighting of Japanese debt as much of it trades with negative yields. For Travis Lundy, an analyst who publishes at SmartKarma, Ueda’s expertise will be thinking about risk and liquidity as the fund reshapes its bond portfolio.
Still, Ueda’s skillset may be a bit narrow for managing GPIF’s investments across all asset classes, according to Monex’s Matsumoto. His background in trading is “a different world compared to pension fund management,” he said. But what Ueda lacks in experience, he makes up for in willingness to listen to others, he said.
One area where Ueda will have to adapt is equities, which make up more than half the fund’s assets after GPIF revamped its portfolio in 2014, boosting stocks and cutting bonds. While most experts agreed the fund needed to make riskier investments to pay for people’s retirements, the public criticism in Japan when shares fall has been harsh. An index of global stocks plunged 22% in the first quarter of 2020 as the coronavirus hit.
Risk Management
“It feels like they’ve picked a person who’s very thorough about risk management to lead the fund,” said Hiroyuki Kubota, a financial analyst who runs a blog about the JGB market. They chose someone who is able to live through big market downturns, he said.
Investors will also be watching whether Ueda takes a different approach from his predecessor, Mizuno, who oversaw the fund’s expansion into equities and was a proponent of environmental, social and governance investing. Mizuno made international headlines by blasting short sellers for “short-termism” in an interview with the Financial Times last year. In December, GPIF announced it would stop lending overseas stocks.
But there is disagreement on what that approach should be, and little room to veer too far from GPIF’s prescribed direction. Kubota, the bonds commentator, says the fund should cut back on stocks because losses on them are unacceptable. “Maybe he will lead GPIF in a new direction, instead of absorbing the tactics of his predecessor,” he said. “I’d like to pin my hopes on that.”
Lundy, on the other hand, says the fund is probably underweight equities after the March sell-off and should buy more shares.
What direction Ueda will take remains to be seen, but the people who know him expect he’ll steer a steadfast course.
“From here, GPIF needs a steady hand,” said Koll. “And that’s exactly what Ueda brings to the table.”

(Reuters) -  Hertz Global Holdings Inc  (N:HTZ) said on Wednesday it was in talks with its lenders to avoid defaulting on debt related to its rental vehicle fleet, after skipping a payment that was due April 27.
Hertz, whose Hertz Corp subsidiary operates the Hertz, Dollar and Thrifty rental brands, said in a regulatory filing that it had suffered a ""sudden and dramatic negative impact"" on its business due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has crushed demand for rental cars as people cancel travel and stay at home.
Hertz's shares were trading at roughly $3.71 on Wednesday, down about 20% on the day and down around 80% from late February. Billionaire Carl Icahn owns 38.9% of Hertz. 
The Estero, Florida-based company has been working with debt restructuring advisers on re-working its finances, Reuters reported last week. The company's debt load totals $17 billion. 
Hertz said that not enough lenders have agreed so far to its request for a waiver or forbearance with regard to the missed payments. Hertz said it has until May 4 to reach an agreement. 
Hertz's preparations for a possible bankruptcy have been accelerating, a source familiar with the matter said this week. The source asked for anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.
Hertz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Hertz also said on Wednesday it has taken ""aggressive action to eliminate costs."" Earlier this month, the company said it would lay off 10,000 employees as its revenue dried up.
A trade group representing Hertz, the American Car Rental Association, has been asking Congress to do more for the industry by expanding a $2.3 trillion stimulus program and advancing new legislation targeting tourism-related businesses.
Even before the pandemic, Hertz and its peers were under financial pressure as travelers shifted to ride-hailing services such as  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER). 

To combat Uber, Hertz had adopted a turnaround plan, aiming to modernize its smartphone apps and improve its management of its fleet of rental cars.

The unit turned a 345.5 million real profit. 
""2019 was a strong year for the grain harvest in Brazil, which increased revenue and volumes traded,"" Paulo Sousa, chief executive of Brazil's Cargill, said in a statement.

1511,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>","Boeing to shrink workforce, raise cash as coronavirus slams jet industry","By Ankit Ajmera and David Shepardson
(Reuters) -  Boeing Co  (N:BA) said on Wednesday it would cut its 160,000-person workforce by about 10%, further reduce 787 Dreamliner production and try to boost liquidity as it prepares for a years-long industry recovery from the coronavirus pandemic that drove its second consecutive quarterly loss.
Boeing shares climbed 12% to $146.64 after the company said it was confident of getting sufficient liquidity to fund operations and would have positive cash flow next year as it ramps up production of the grounded 737 MAX.
The broader market was also higher on hopes for a potential COVID-19 treatment.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that Boeing is working with investment banks on a potential bond deal worth at least $10 billion. Last month it drew down its entire $13.8 billion credit line and is also weighing seeking government aid.
Chicago-based Boeing declined to say how much government assistance it may seek or under which part of a massive U.S. stimulus package.     
Planemakers, airlines and suppliers have been left reeling by the pandemic, which has crippled passenger travel and catapulted major economies into recession.
""Our industry is going to look very different as a result of this pandemic,"" Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told investors. ""We will be a smaller company for a while.""
Many of the job cuts, to be completed by the end of year through voluntary and involuntary layoffs as well as natural turnover, will be at the company's commercial aircraft division, where it was already grappling with a production freeze and year-long grounding of the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes.
Boeing expects to resume 737 MAX deliveries in the third quarter following regulatory approvals, CFO Greg Smith said, with production re-starting at low rates in the second quarter before gradually increasing to 31 per month during 2021. 
Further gradual production increases will correspond with market demand. Meanwhile, Boeing will focus on delivering jets that it has already built in order to unlock frozen cash.
Aerospace analyst Josh Sullivan said Boeing's comments on the 737 MAX and cash pleased investors.
""They provided guideposts that people can sink their teeth into and gain confidence,"" he said.
Reuters reported Tuesday 737 MAX approval is not expected until at least August.
WIDE-BODY SLUMP
The pandemic has also aggravated a slump in demand for wide-body jets like the 787, sapping a key remaining source of cash for Boeing as the 737 MAX remains grounded.
Boeing plans to reduce production of the 787 to seven a month by 2022 - half the planned rate of just a year ago when it was implementing a record monthly rate of 14. It had already progressively reduced the target to 10 on the back of U.S.-China trade tensions. It will also reduce the 777/777X combined production rate to 3 per month in 2021 from 5. 
The planemaker had $15.5 billion in cash at the end of March after burning through $4.7 billion in the quarter. 
The company's adjusted loss stood at $1.70 billion, or $1.70 per share in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $1.99 billion, or $3.16 per share, a year earlier.
Over the weekend, Boeing canceled a $4.2-billion deal for Embraer SA's (SA:EMBR3) commercial aviation, prompting the Brazilian company to initiate arbitration.
It is also facing lawsuits related to the 737 MAX crashes and federal prosecutors aided by the FBI, the Department of Transportation’s inspector general are investigating the aircraft's certification. Boeing paid out $700 million in 737 MAX compensation to customers in the first quarter. 
Calhoun said it could be a while before the company rolls out a new jet design. 
European rival Airbus (PA:AIR) on Wednesday posted a 49% slump in first-quarter core profit and called for an industry-wide campaign to restore confidence in flying.

In a memo to employees, Calhoun said: ""The aviation industry will take years to return to the levels of traffic we saw just a few months ago. We have to prepare for that.""

1516,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 01:54PM ET</span>",Negative Oil Scars Will Linger for Frackers,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- April 20 didn’t start like any other day — there’s a pandemic going on — and for oil, it sure didn’t end like one either. That afternoon, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate crude settled in negative territory for the first time ever. Now we all know it was a technical, contract-rolling, Chinese-speculators-getting-eviscerated affair. After all, oil and gas producer stocks closed up that day.
But that doesn’t mean frackers can expect to escape the impact of minus-$38 oil completely.
Most obviously, May-day was the prelude to the June contract’s current suffering: It’s under $16 a barrel, and that’s after a big rally on Wednesday morning. Even if it doesn’t eventually settle in the red, there’s a decent chance it will fall as we head into next month. There’s too much oil supply facing too little demand and trying to squeeze into too little storage; hence, the agonizing long-squeeze of April 20. Shut-ins of wells, the last resort for E&P companies, have begun already and will accelerate from here.
Beyond the immediate physical issue, the technical, contract-rolling stuff matters, too. The June contract’s plunge earlier this week was partly due to S&P Global Inc., which runs the biggest commodity index, telling clients to roll quick-smart into the July contract in case the June one ends up mimicking May’s. Not to be outdone, the biggest oil ETF, the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) LP, or USO, announced it too was over June already and would start spreading positions as far out as 12 months forward.
This matters because the futures market is where anyone in the business of producing or using oil comes for insurance against price swings. The fracking boom relied on third-party capital to feed it, and that capital relied on the relative certainty on cash flows afforded by producers hedging their output.
You can’t sell (or short) future barrels if there isn’t someone on the other side willing to go long. Energy economist Philip Verleger noted in a recent report, “Beyond Greed Redux,” that the oil market long had an imbalance of too many commercial operators seeking to hedge and not enough speculators to take the other side of the trade. That changed to some degree in the supercycle of the early 2000s as pension funds piled in, lured by influential research touting commodities’ high returns and portfolio-diversification benefits(1). As returns eroded, exacerbated by the 2008 crash, some traders began to drift away but others, such as hedge funds or individuals tracking indices or using ETFs, stepped up. 
John Hyland, the former chief investment officer for United States Commodity Funds LLC (which runs the USO), recalls that when natural gas prices tanked in 2009, trading of the sister product, the United States Natural Gas Fund LP, soared, stoking concerns similar to today’s around the impact of passive products on price formation. Since then, the gas futures curve has settled at low levels and in persistent contango (seasons aside) — upward-sloping, which is terrible for rolling front-month positions  forward. Activity in the USG has dwindled commensurately.
It’s too early to say if the USO will mimic that. Trading volume has been very high so far this year; annualized, it would be on a par with levels not seen since 2009. However, we are now into our third oil crash in 12 years, and the old bullish narrative of peak oil has given way to murkier considerations of climate change and price wars. Covid-19’s demand shock is an extreme situation, but that doesn’t mean it won’t leave scars. Talking about the recent turmoil, John Lothian, a former commodities trader who now runs his own eponymous financial media business, observes “the public has a bias to the long end [of markets] because prices can only go down to zero. Well guess what?”
While the USO has historically been owned more by institutions than individuals, according to Hyland, as such products rejig positions, they move further away from the original premise of passive money parked at the front end of the futures curve. That makes it harder to know what you are actually buying. Meanwhile, regulators and market managers spooked by negative oil prices may decide to impose constraints of their own.
Hedging isn’t a concern for frackers right now. Hedges cost precious cash; futures are under $40 as far out as 2024; and production has to fall anyway.
But when exploration and production firms eventually seek to stabilize and raise production, hedging will enter the equation once more. As it stands, E&P companies tracked by BloombergNEF had hedged just over a third of their anticipated oil production in 2020 at the start of the year. The corresponding figure for 2021, which is when frackers’ debt maturities start to seriously roll in, was just 3%.
E&P firms tend to hedge further out on the futures curve, so any lasting migration of speculative cash out of near-term contracts might appear to have less of an impact. However, as Professor Craig Pirrong at the University of Houston’s Bauer College of Business points out, spread trades linking near and deferred contracts provide some of that long-dated liquidity. Such trades account for roughly half the open interest of money managers in the Nymex WTI contract.
The cost of hedging may rise as another cohort of speculators learns a hard lesson about futures. Certainly, the lingering glut of inventories and economic damage from the current crisis should keep oil prices low and the curve in contango for a while, suppressing animal spirits.
This may add to a broader theme: a rising cost of capital for fracking and the eclipse of the small, independent model that has long relied on the OPEC put and accommodating financial markets. One day of negative oil prices isn’t an issue for shale. But it may well be a sign of, and catalyst for, fundamental change coming for this industry.

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>",Wall Street uniform to get a new accessory - the face mask,"By Scott Murdoch, Maya Nikolaeva and Matt Scuffham
HONG KONG/PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Face masks, temperature checks and packaged sandwiches could all become part of the daily routine for bankers as their employers work out how to get them safely back into the office. 
While a growing number of countries are starting to ease lockdowns to contain the coronavirus pandemic, the threat of a new wave of infections remains high. 
That means banks are having to look at new ways of organising buildings that before the crisis would have had packed elevators, crowded cafeterias and desks less than two metres apart. Given the risks, many staff will still have to work from home. 
""We're going to do it in a way where employees feel comfortable coming back in,"" said Mark Fedorcik, head of  Deutsche Bank 's (DE:DBKGn) investment bank, where around 84% of staff are currently working from home. 
Financial centres in Asia will be the first to see a significant return of staff to the office. 
Goldman Sachs (N:GS) had about 25% of its Hong Kong employees back in the office this week and has a target of 35% by May 11 and 50% by May 25, according to a source with direct knowledge of the plans. Like other major office buildings in the city, temperature checks will remain at the entrances. 
At UBS (S:UBSG), the key pad entrances to its three Hong Kong offices have been removed to avoid having people constantly touch them, and access will now be through swipe card systems. 
In most of its divisions, the bank is preparing to put staff in teams that will alternate between working at home and coming into the office, where it will be mandatory to wear face masks. 
In France, where the lockdown is due to start being gradually lifted from May 11, the country's third-biggest bank  Societe Generale  (PA:SOGN) has begun to discuss with unions how to protect staff when some of them return to the office. 
One union, CGT, has asked for suggestions on its website. Proposals include asking the bank to provide tongs for picking up coffee pods, to buy scooters for staff, or to subside the cost of travelling to work in a way that avoids public transport. 
Societe General declined to comment on the proposals.
A source at an American bank in Paris said it was preparing to carry out regular disinfections and to rearrange desks to make sure staff sit the recommended two metres apart. 
PAPER PLATES
In Germany, Deutsche Bank is in no rush to get staff back in the office, with strict limitations on gatherings still in place across the country, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The cafe at the bank's twin-tower headquarters in central Frankfurt is expected to continue to operate under reduced hours, with dining in and self service both banned. 
Kitchen staff give employees food on paper plates to be eaten at their desk or elsewhere. And many of the bank's coffee machines are out of commission to promote hygiene. 
In the United States, JPMorgan (N:JPM) told employees last week it was working on a plan to return staff to offices in phases, though it has no official timeline for the process. 
Discussions include possibly assigning building staff to press buttons on elevator key pads, and scrapping the buffet service in cafeterias in favour of selling packaged foods.
 Wells Fargo  (N:WFC) has cautioned employees that working conditions may not return to normal even as government officials loosen coronavirus-related restrictions, according to an April 22 memo viewed by Reuters. 
""Instead, we will continue with the safety measures we have put in place at our work locations and we will expect the more than 180,000 employees who are working from home to continue to do so,"" the memo, signed by Chief Operating Officer Scott Powell, said.
The bank has also launched an on-site nursing service at 56 of its largest U.S. sites to screen for coronavirus symptoms, such as a high temperature. 
As banks develop their plans, employee wellbeing is not the only criteria. With many leasing real estate in some of the world's most expensive financial districts, the potential for longer-term cost cuts will also be in play.
""I think every company, including Deutsche Bank, will assess whether you need everyone working in the office or if there are ways to have some people work from home that haven’t been doing so historically,"" said Fedorcik.
On Wednesday,  Barclays  (L:BARC) chief executive Jes Staley said the British bank would not revert fully to its pre-January working habits. Staff, including investment bankers, could work from branches as well as other locations rather than all being packed into their central offices, he said. 

""There will be a long-term adjustment in how we think about our location strategy ... the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past,"" he said.

1520,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",U.S. Wants to Know Where Aluminum Imports Are Really Coming From,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. proposed rules to track aluminum imports more closely, in a move that could address industry demands to block Chinese supply that skirts tariffs.
While the Trump administration’s import levies are aimed at protecting against excess foreign supply of the metal, concerns have persisted that aluminum from China -- the world’s biggest producer -- is still flooding into the market.
That’s because some Chinese supply could first be sent to another nation that isn’t subject to the duties. It’s then melted and reformed before being shipped again, masking its true origin. Criticism about surplus metal entering the U.S. via such transshipment and re-labeling to circumvent trade laws has preceded the Trump administration.
Under the proposed new U.S. rules, importers will be required to identify the country from which the aluminum was originally obtained. They will also need to get a license for shipments. The program is modeled on a steel-import monitoring system that’s been in place for years.
The Commerce Department’s regulations, which are subject to a 30-day public-comment period and would take another 30 to 90 days to be implemented, would give customs a strengthened tool to more quickly identify and react to improper trading of U.S.-bound aluminum.
Combating Evasion
“It is yet another affirmation of our commitment to use all available tools to combat circumvention and evasion of duties,” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in statement. “Today’s proposed regulations are an important step forward in ensuring that trade in aluminum is free, fair, and reciprocal.”
Under the new North American trade deal signed last year, the U.S., Canada and Mexico all agreed to ramp up efforts to trace where metal comes from originally in an effort to stop the diversion of shipments from other nations to dodge tariffs. After the agreement, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acted to beef up the government’s power to respond to dumping of aluminum and steel in the country.
As recently as December, the Aluminium Association of Canada complained that the new North American trade law has failed to implement rules that would prevent transshipment of metal through Mexico. Chief Executive Officer Jean Simard said it made Mexico “more or less China’s North American backyard to dispose of the products of its overcapacity.”
The U.S. Commerce Department is making the proposal just as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed demand in everything from retail goods to bank financing to commodities.
Demand Hit
American aluminum has been particularly affected, with all domestic smelters under water at current prices.  Alcoa  (NYSE:AA) Corp., the biggest U.S. producer, said last week that it would curtail all production at one of its smelters in Washington state.
If implemented, the new rules would include monitoring imports of so-called semi-finished aluminum products. Alcoa has for years complained about China’s surging output of such products, which aren’t subject to the Asian country’s export taxes.
Semi-finished, not primary aluminum, is the principal form of China’s market penetration into the rest of the world, which Alcoa Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey said in January is flooding the global market and effectively displacing output of the primary form of the metal.
China is the world’s largest exporter of the primary and semi-finished forms of aluminum, according to CRU Group. The country exports about 6 million metric tons annually, with about 90% to 95% of that being semi-fabricated products.

The official told reporters that U.S. officials were talking regularly, and often daily, about implementation of the trade deal and to make sure that China fulfilled its extensive agreements to buy American goods and services.
The U.S. Trade Representative's office kept China on its priority watch list for concerns about intellectual property (IP) protections, and was watching closely to see whether it implemented changes agreed to as part of the trade agreement and continue to open its market to foreign investment, the official said.
""China's placement on that list reflects the urgent need to remedy a range of IP-related concerns, including China's system of pressuring, and coercing, technology transfer, the need for fundamental structural changes to strengthen IP protection, and enforcement in the widespread infringing activity within its borders,"" the official said.
He said the Phase 1 agreement did include ""very robust"" provisions on IP protections and they were being implemented through a number of actions by China.
""We will continually assess its implementation of the Phase 1 agreement,"" said the official. ""We've had very good interactions with Chinese (officials) on that, and they are continuing to implement their obligations.""
The official said there were challenges presented by the coronavirus outbreak, but the overall experience showed Beijing was sticking to its commitments under the trade deal.
As part of the trade deal signed on Jan. 15, Beijing agreed to nearly double its U.S. farm product purchases and lower several agricultural trade barriers that Washington said limited access to the lucrative Chinese market.
However, White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien said the outbreak could have an impact on the size of the purchases this year.
The U.S. official said India and Saudi Arabia also remained on the USTR's priority watch list for IP concerns, but Greece had been removed due to what he called ""signficant progress"" in protecting IP rights.

He said the pandemic underscored the importance of solid IP protection to encourage innovation in development of new pharmaceuticals and other health technologies.

The company, which posted results for the three months that ended March 31, said it saw a bump in orders only at the end of the first quarter and added that most of the benefit from a spike in demand will be reflected in the current quarter.
""Even as restrictions on consumer behavior begin to ease, we expect that there will be a shift to new economic and social norms, reflecting the changes in cooking and eating habits developed during the weeks or months consumers spend at home, and these will persist for some time,"" Chief Executive Officer Linda Findley Kozlowski said on a post-earnings call.
""We expect that our Q2 results will begin to reflect this increased demand.""
The company expects second-quarter revenue to record a high single-digit percentage growth to about $130 million. [nBw5tCHrCa]
Shares of the company, which are trading at $9.93, have nearly doubled this year, benefiting from its model that favors social distancing norms with people being required to stay home and as restaurants remained shut.
Blue Apron, which went public in 2017, has been losing ground to competition from established grocers that are bringing out their own meal-kits. Earlier this year, the company said it was considering various options for its business, including going private. [nL4N2AJ40V]
The company said on Wednesday it continues to move forward with the plan.
Orders during the first-quarter fell 29% from a year earlier, while the total number of customers declined to 376,000 from 550,000.
Net revenue fell 28.2% to $101.9 million in the quarter, while net loss widened to $20.2 million, or $1.51 per share, from $5.3 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier, mainly due to higher expenses and the closure of certain fulfillment centers.

Traders pulled more than $462 million from State Street’s SPDR S&P Biotech exchange-traded fund, ticker XBI, on Tuesday -- the biggest outflow since December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A day later, the ETF rallied after one of its top holdings --  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD). -- said early results from a U.S.-government run study showed its experimental drug to treat the coronavirus helped patients recover more quickly than standard care.
“While it’s not a cure-all, it’s progress,” said John Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. “This is what the market has been looking for and expecting in these rallies.”
Another fund tracking the industry, BlackRock’s iShares Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) Biotechnology ETF, or IBB, also had outflows on Tuesday before jumping as much as 2.1% a day later. The $7.9 billion fund -- which has Gilead as its largest holding -- extended a rally from a March 16 low to 33%, compared with an advance of 23% for the S&P 500 Index.
Still, the surge in biotechnology shares is leading to warning signs that the sector is overvalued. While there’s the potential payoff when a new medicine succeeds, developing new drugs isn’t easy as there’s risk of failure.
The rally “could bring us to a point of overvaluation pretty quickly,” Stoltzfus said. “We would suggest investors consider curbing their enthusiasm going into this.”

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - India's Oyo Hotels and Homes, backed by SoftBank Group (T:9984), plans to offload more properties around the world, three sources familiar with the matter said, as the coronavirus pandemic prompts it to speed up a retreat from a rapid global expansion. 
The hospitality sector has been one of the worst affected by the coronavirus outbreak, with global and domestic travel coming to a near-halt.
While Oyo does not plan to completely exit any market, it will either terminate or not renew contracts with loss-making hotels, two of the sources said. 
A fourth source aware of the plans added that Oyo had already ditched a number of loss-making properties as part of a broader restructuring that began last year. 
The source also said the company may furlough additional staff in countries where travel curbs to prevent the spread of the virus persist for several months, making it difficult for hotels to operate.
The retreat comes just a year after a heady expansion beyond India and China into Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States, which made Oyo one of the world's biggest hospitality brands by room count. However, the push also widened its losses to $335 million last year.
It was not immediately clear how many hotel contracts Oyo plans to end nor in which countries, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the discussions were still private.
Oyo did not respond to an email seeking comment. 
Oyo will prioritise business and investment in India, Southeast Asia, Europe, China and the United States while sustaining a presence in places like Japan, Brazil, Mexico and the Middle East, said the fourth source.
The company has $1 billion of cash and the measures, along with other cost-cutting initiatives and furloughs outlined in early April, are aimed at reducing monthly expenses to about $25 million by June from $40 million, the source added. 
Other large hotel operators like Marriott International (O:MAR) have also abandoned their financial outlooks and furloughed staff to conserve cash.
On April 8, Oyo's founder Ritesh Agarwal, said the pandemic had resulted in a 50%-60% drop in revenues and occupancy levels, putting ""severe stress"" on the company's balance sheet.
""Given how unprecedented the current situation is, it's natural for Oyo to prepare for the worst,"" said one of the three people cited above.
HEADY EXPANSION
Oyo is one of SoftBank's biggest bets with the Japanese group holding a 46% stake.
The six-year-old hotel startup had already consulted turnaround specialist Alvarez & Marsal and Accenture Plc (N:ACN) last year, two of the four people said, and more recently it tapped human resources advisor Aon (NYSE:AON) Hewitt.
Alvarez and Accenture did not respond to emails seeking comment. Aon Hewitt declined to comment. 
Between January and March, Oyo cut 5,000 jobs mainly in China and India, leaving it with about 25,000 employees, and amended contracts with hotels to remove revenue guarantees.
It also decided to end contracts with hotels that did not generate annual revenues of at least $100,000, the two sources said. Emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia and Latin America bore the brunt of the cuts, one of the two people said, adding that Oyo now operated in 400 Indian cities from 550 previously.

The measures helped Oyo halve its monthly costs to $40 million from $80 million in January, said the two people.

1536,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",GE warns of more pain ahead as pandemic deals $1 billion cash hit,"By Rachit Vats and Alwyn Scott
(Reuters) -  General Electric  Co (N:GE) said on Wednesday the coronavirus pandemic dealt a $1 billion blow to cash flow at its industrial business in the first quarter, while total revenue fell almost 8% and the company warned the damage would worsen in the next three months.
Among many changes in response to the novel coronavirus, the Boston-based conglomerate said it had cut 700 workers at its power division, was bracing for repossession of some aircraft by its GECAS leasing unit and was cutting capital spending by 25% this year.
Chief Executive Larry Culp (NYSE:CULP) declined to be drawn in on when cash flow might recover, and said some of the $2 billion in cost cutting the company was undertaking to deal with the economic effect of novel would be permanent.
""We've been hit hard and fast ... in some of our most important, highest-margin businesses, be it aviation, and services, particularly, gas power services,"" Culp said on a conference call. ""We think that that gets worse before it gets better, particularly here in the second quarter.""
The one comparative bright spot was GE's healthcare business, where demand for coronavirus-related products rose 1.5 to 2 fold, he said. This was partly offset by declining demand for other products. The division, which recently sold its biopharma unit, generated $896 million in quarterly profit.
Some analysts saw little that was unexpected in the results. While aviation profit margins fell more than was predicted, GE's forecast that the unit will see a slow recovery ""should not surprise investors,""  Barclays  (LON:BARC) analyst Julian Mitchell wrote.
Others said the results were disappointing. ""Considering that GE had previously established a pattern of 'beat and raise,' we anticipated a result above 10 cents and a better free cash flow print,"" said John Inch, analyst at Gordon Haskett.
GE's share were flat at $6.82 in morning trading.
GE earlier this month pulled its 2020 forecast, citing uncertainties created by the coronavirus outbreak. But it had backed its first-quarter industrial free cash flow expectation of near negative $2 billion.
Free cash flow from industrial operations was negative $2.2 billion in the first quarter, missing analysts' estimates of negative $2.02 billion, according to Refinitiv data.
GE reported adjusted earnings of 5 cents per share, below the average estimate of 8 cents, according to Refinitiv.
Fallout from the pandemic caused revenue to fall 13% in both the aviation and power divisions. Profit in aviation fell 39% to $1 billion, while the power unit lost $129 million, GE said.
GE said about 20% of planned maintenance work on power plants had been deferred until later in the year, a factor that weighed on revenue and profit. Many U.S. utilities are deferring non-essential work because of health and safety restrictions.
GE said it planned to cut costs by $2 billion and take other, steps to save $3 billion in cash in response to the pandemic, such as reducing capital spending or adjusting working capital.
The company had already announced this month plans to furlough half of its U.S. aviation component manufacturing and jet-engine assembly workers, without specifying how many. That move followed GE's decision to lay off 10% of its 52,000-member aviation workforce in late March.

GE has also said the slowdown in aircraft repairs was affecting half of its maintenance workforce but has not provided numbers.

The world's largest retailer of hearing aids said it had no visibility over the length and depth of the socio-economic crisis resulting from the epidemic, which forced governments across the globe to impose heavy restrictions on business activity and people's movements.
The company had previously guided for 2020 revenue of between 1.8 billion and 1.86 billion euros ($1.95 billion-$2.02 billion), recurring earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 330 billion to 345 million euros and operating cash flow of around 260 million euros.

1548,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 10:07AM ET</span>",Stocks - Wall Street Leaps as Gilead Upstages Weak GDP. Dow Rises 400 Points,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets opened sharply higher on Wednesday as positive news from a trial of Gilead Science's (NASDAQ:GILD) experimental drug remdesivir upstaged the worst U.S. GDP report in nearly 12 years. 
By 10 AM ET (1400 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 465 points, or 1.9%, at 24,567 points. The S&P 500 was up 2.2% and the Nasdaq Composite was up 2.6%.
The Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) was helped by a strong contribution from Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock, which rose 7.8% after better-than-expected first-quarter results. Chief financial officer Ruth Porat told an analyst call that there had been no further big drops in advertising revenue in April after a sharp fall in March. YouTube, one of the company's biggest cash cows, raked in $4 billion in the quarter, a rise of 33% from a year earlier.
Earlier, Gilead had said that a stage 1 trial of remdesivir had shown that the retroviral drug helped improve symptoms in Covid-19 patients who were given the drug early. The effect on those who were given it at a later stage were not as positive.  
Interest in Gilead's drug has been high as there are currently no approved treatments or preventive vaccines for Covid-19, something that analysts say leaves the global economy vulnerable to secondary waves of infection over the next year or two. Gilead stock rose 5.9% at opening to within a couple of percent of the two-year high it earlier in April.
The prospect of progress in finding a cure lifted airline and cruise stocks disproportionately, on the perception that they have most to gain from the boost to public confidence from having a readily available treatment for the disease.
The same reasoning also lifted the price of crude oil. U.S. crude futures extended gains to be up 24.5% at $15.38 a barrel by 10 AM ET. The international Brent contract rose 7.2% to $24.38.
The news deflected attention away from the weakest report for U.S. gross domestic product in almost 12 years. The economy shrank by an annualized 4.8% in the first quarter, even more than expected by analysts, as personal consumption slumped in response to mass layoffs as state authorities issued a barrage of lockdown orders through March.
The collapse was also reflected in a wider-than-expected loss of $1.7 billion for Boeing.

Senior long-haul flight attendants stand to lose out as the carrier scraps its three existing cabin-crew organisations and reassigns a smaller number of staff to a single lower-cost entity, under plans outlined in the memo seen by Reuters.
""Our proposals aim to save as many jobs as possible and secure a sustainable future,"" the note from an in-flight customer experience executive that was later circulated among representatives of BA's 16,500 cabin crew said.
A BA spokeswoman declined to comment on the memo. Two union sources told Reuters they were aware of its content.
The plans would abolish the ""worldwide fleet"" of mainly senior crew that fly long-haul, as well as the medium-haul ""Euro fleet"" and ""mixed fleet"" categories, it states.
BA has opened formal union consultations on a proposal to ""restructure and significantly reduce the size of our cabin crew team in line with our anticipated operational requirement,"" the memo says.

Those staying on would be grouped into a ""single new cabin crew team"" based at London Heathrow, with ""all crew flying both short- and long-haul"", it adds.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",Corona what? Tesla retail investors appear unfazed by virus impact,"By Tina Bellon
(Reuters) - When Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc reports first-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, many individual shareholders will not be looking for details on the subject that drives most conversations: the effect of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Their view vastly differs from that of traditional analysts and institutional investors, who want to hear updates on Tesla's 2020 cash flow and potential moves to boost demand during a prolonged recession due to the epidemic.
Submitting questions for Tesla's earnings call on a website https://app.saytechnologies.com/tesla?origin=https://ir.tesla.com/events/event-details/tesla-inc-q1-2020-financial-results-and-qa-webcast, retail investors want to learn about Tesla's steps to expand into the robotaxi market, the company's self-driving technology and even plans to create airless tires to reduce maintenance costs.
Of the top 50 questions, only four refer to the novel coronavirus, with one investor asking what safeguards Tesla would implement to protect employees at U.S. factories. Another probed whether Tesla had plans to expand into the grocery delivery market, where demand has skyrocketed during the pandemic.
Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk early Wednesday morning tweeted ""FREE AMERICA NOW"" and shared an opinion article arguing that severe lockdown orders have not saved many lives, tweeting ""Give people their freedom back.""
Analysts expect Musk to provide details on Tesla's plans to restart factory operations after its only U.S. vehicle factory near San Francisco was forced to close at the end of March. The company originally said it would resume operations on May 4, but Bay Area health officials on Monday extended shelter-in-place orders to the end of May. 
Investors can vote for a particular question on the website and Tesla management generally answers the most popular ones during an earnings call.
Currently, the No. 1 retail investor question is whether Musk will stick to his target for a 50% compound annual growth rate over the next five to 10 years, or whether a 40% target would be more realistic.
Many analysts expect Tesla to have a compound annual growth rate of around 20%. 
Analysts on average expect March quarter revenue to jump 30% to $5.9 billion, according to Refinitiv, down from an initial February estimate of $6.7 billion. 
Tesla in early April reported strong vehicle deliveries in the first three months of 2020 - a time when other U.S. carmakers grappled with a slump in sales as virus woes and lockdown restrictions began taking hold.

The company in mid-February raised $2 billion in a stock offering, and investors on Wednesday will probe whether that covers the company's cash burn at a time when Tesla ramps up production of its new Model Y sport utility vehicle.

The company said it incurred a goodwill impairment charge of $139 million from its purchase of Habit Burger Grill, a burger chain it bought earlier this year. 
""First-quarter results reflect two different realities. We began the year with momentum ... however as the quarter progressed we were heavily impacted by the unfortunate spread of COVID-19,"" Chief Executive Officer David Gibbs said in a statement.
Restaurants across the globe have shut their dining areas and shifted to a delivery and take-away model due to the lockdowns imposed to combat the health crisis.
For Yum, which operates about 50,000 restaurants globally, KFC and Pizza Hut were the hardest hit. Taco Bell, known for its budget offerings, was a bright spot.
Yum said sales at stores open for more than a year fell 8% at KFC and declined 11% at Pizza Hut, while they rose 1% at Taco Bell.
Analysts has expected a 6.16% fall at KFC, 6.55% decline at Pizza Hut and 2.18% dip at Taco Bell, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",South African retailer Edcon to file for bankruptcy protection,"By Nqobile Dludla
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African retailer Edcon will file for bankruptcy protection in the next few days, it said on Wednesday, becoming the country's first major corporate casualty of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Edcon said it had lost 2 billion rand ($108 million) of sales since the virus reached South Africa in early March and the government responded with a nationwide lockdown that forced non-essential shops to close. 
That hit, coupled with a decline in collections from debtors, meant the company, which owns department stores chain Edgars and budget clothing retailer Jet, was unable to pay suppliers and creditors in March and April, it said in a statement.
According to its website, Edcon has more that 14,000 permanent staff and around 25,000 temporary employees. 
When the five-week lockdown is lifted on May 1, Edcon's stores will be re-opened under the business rescue proceedings, a form of bankruptcy protection.
In a letter addressed to creditors, suppliers and stakeholders, seen by Reuters, Chief Executive Grant Pattison said the start of the process meant a moratorium on legal and enforcement actions against the company.
""We will be working closely with the appointed business rescue practitioners, shareholders and government to find a way to plug the financial hole,"" he said in the letter.
""It is my hope that some version of the business will emerge to continue to serve customers.""
Edcon said it anticipates that sales will be depressed for some time during the phased lifting of the lockdown, which may last several months.
Just before the country went into the lockdown on March 26, Pattison warned the group might need to seek protection from creditors and would be heavily dependant on business support packages offered by government and other agencies and funders.
Edcon has been grappling with debt for several years after troubles in its credit business in 2014 coincided with an economic slowdown. Bain Capital, which took control of Edcon in a leveraged buyout in 2007, gave up equity control in 2016 to creditors.
Since then it has been trying to restructure by trimming its head office and stores, negotiating lower rents, and pushing its own clothing brands while cutting back on international labels.
A lifeline came in March last year when it secured 2.7 billion rand in new cash and rent deductions from shareholder the Public Investment Corporation and participating landlords.
Edcon said on Wednesday the money had been substantially used to fund losses for the financial years ending March 2019 and March 2020.

1564,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",The Quant Comeback Kids Are Buying American Stock Futures Again,"(Bloomberg) -- Devotees of a quant strategy famed for netting billions in 2008 are wading back into U.S. stocks, raising the prospect of fresh leveraged cash buoying the market.
With the S&P 500 up 28% from its March trough and volatility fading, systematic trend followers are turning bullish on the U.S. benchmark, according to  Nomura Holdings  (NYSE:NMR) Inc.
Typical models tracked by commodity trading advisers -- a regulatory term for the $300 billion world of futures speculators -- are flashing buy signals as U.S. stocks enjoy a rapid rebound a month after their sharpest correction in history.
All told this year’s wild pandemic-driven markets are burnishing the cohort’s reputation for delivering “crisis alpha,” albeit modestly.
“The buying of equities we are seeing has a strongly technical flavor,” Masanari Takada, a quantitative strategist at Nomura, wrote in a note on Tuesday. “With human market participants staying at home (both literally and figuratively), the machines have proceeded on their own to systematically buy up equities.”
The Nomura analysis chimes with that of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) & Co., which suggests CTAs are poised to finish covering their short bets -- a stepping stone toward building longs.
Extraordinary monetary action to combat the pandemic fallout has succeeded in powering a decisive cross-asset uptrend while bringing volatility lower, enabling CTAs to return to bullish stock bets. The group have posted a 1% gain this year, a Societe Generale (OTC:SCGLY) SA index of the largest managers shows. That’s nothing like 13% for 2008 overall but a source of solace next to double-digit losses across equity hedge funds and benchmarks.
After years trailing the raging bull market amid crowding and choppy trends -- with some pronouncing the strategy dead -- its practitioners are in better spirits.
Just ask Steeve Brument, head of multi-asset quantitative strategies at Candriam, a unit of New York Life Investments. Mostly thanks to long-bond and short-oil bets, his Candriam Diversified Futures fund has racked up a nearly 8% gain this year.
“We do see prospective clients coming to us and having a renewed interest for trend followers,” he said from Paris.
His fund has been cutting short positions in stocks and is now nearly positive on the Nasdaq 100 but still slightly bearish on the S&P 500.
Similar strategies overseen by AlphaSimplex Group LLC, Man AHL and AQR Capital Management LLC have also notched gains of at least 5% year to date. A handful of short-term trend followers, which can pounce on sharp market moves more quickly, have posted even stronger returns.
Whether the rest of 2020 will usher in sustained trends is the question. As countries ease lockdowns to contain the outbreak, the measures could unleash either an economic recovery or a fresh plunge in markets sparked by another wave of the virus.
While trend followers like sharp moves, it’s hard to build all-weather strategies that can capture the turning points through bull and bear runs when markets are choppy.
This is the conundrum weighing on Metori Capital Management, another relative winner in the turmoil. After reaping decent profits -- its Lyxor Epsilon Global Trend fund is up almost 8% in 2020 -- the fund has been downsizing exposures in a sign of continuing risk aversion.
“The model is very much risk-off, very little overall leverage and waiting for the next trend to start before increasing again the exposure,” said managing partner Laurent Le Saint.
It’s cut long wagers in U.S. and German government bonds, stuck with small long positions in U.S. large caps and remains short mid-caps.
The upshot? For believers in the long-suffering quant strategy, 2020 so far is turning into a victory of sorts. But while CTAs are back riding the U.S. equity rebound, price-momentum strategies are at the mercy of renewed pandemic-spurred reversals.
“There are some periods when it doesn’t really work, but the name of the game in those periods is to avoid losing too much money,” said Le Saint.

SEOUL (Reuters) - When the coronavirus outbreak in China disrupted global smartphone production in February, Samsung (KS:005930) looked set to weather the crisis better than most thanks to its limited exposure there and launches of pricey 5G phones. Its fortunes are reversing.
The world's biggest smartphone vendor, Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co in full, warned on Wednesday of a significant drop in mobile earnings in the second quarter, as recession fears dampen demand for high-end models and carriers in major markets delay the rollouts of fast 5G networks.
The COVID-19 pandemic is hitting all vendors hard. But Samsung's strategy of focusing on 5G in advanced markets like Europe and the United States - it captured nearly three-quarters of global 5G phone sales last year - plus dwindling market share in some emerging markets could put it in a deeper quagmire.
By contrast, American arch-rival Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) now looks better positioned as China, which accounts for roughly 15% of its revenues has reopened shops.
By contrast, the reopening has had limited upside for Samsung as the country accounts for a small fraction of its business; it does not break out China revenue, but it accounts for less than 1% of its phone shipments.
Apple, whose lack of a 5G model has been seen as a key disadvantage versus Samsung, has also launched a new budget iPhone SE model that many analysts predict will prove popular among consumers in a recession.
The California-based tech giant reports quarterly results on Thursday.
SECOND QUARTER
Samsung's total smartphone shipments fell by 18% in the first quarter from a year earlier. But a higher proportion of premium and 5G phone shipments, as well as lower marketing costs, helped profits rise 17% at its mobile division, which includes phones and mobile network equipment.
Profits were resilient in first quarter when the industry impact from COVID-19 was largely down to the outbreak in China, analysts said. However the company faces deep pain in the second quarter which will show the hit to its business from the spread of the virus in Europe and the United States, its strongholds for premium phones, they added.
""The problem is Samsung's mobile business will be really bad,"" said Park Sung-soon, an analyst at Cape Investment & Securities. ""It will recover in the second half, but not as strongly as Apple.""
Lee Jong-min, a Samsung vice president, touched on the difficulties on Wednesday.
""Although there are signs that the spread of the coronavirus in North America and Europe is slowing down, it is too soon to be relieved,"" he told analysts. ""Also, as it takes some time for the economy to recover, it is difficult to forecast how much of a demand drop we will see in the second quarter.""
'HEARTBREAKING'
Samsung said the deployment of 5G networks were being delayed in India, the United States and Europe because of lockdown measures there.
In China, it expects a boost in 5G spending due to government stimulus measures, but analysts say the policies will benefit local rivals such as Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp more.
In India, where smartphone shipments jumped 12% in the first quarter despite the impact of a nationwide lockdown in the final week of March, Samsung further ceded market share, becoming No.3 vendor after China's Xiaomi and Vivo.
Samsung is set to face further competition in those two markets, not just from Chinese rivals but also Apple, which launched lower-priced $399 SE model this month.
Samsung's CEO Koh Dong-jin said in late March that it aimed to reclaim its No.1 position in India by offering a wider range of models. The company also plans to boost sales of premium models in China, he added, describing its sluggish sales there as ""heartbreaking"".
Samsung said on Wednesday it would also boost offerings of mid and lower-end 5G models globally, while launching new premium models as scheduled in the second half of the year, including the Note and a foldable phone.
Some analysts are nonetheless worried about the company's prospects this year.

""While I am concerned about overall mobile demand, I am more worried about (Samsung's) flagship phones, as the chances they will sell well in advanced markets are fading,"" said Kim Ro-ko, at Hana Financial Investment.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Renault may cut sub-contractors to save up to 200 million euros: sources,"PARIS (Reuters) -  Renault  (PA:RENA) is considering cutting the number of sub-contractors it uses to develop car models in its engineering division potentially saving the carmaker between 100 million to 200 million euros, two sources close to the company said. 
Renault was already struggling before the coronavirus crisis hit sales and brought production to a halt. In February, the group reported its first loss in 10 years on faltering demand and lower income from its Japanese alliance partner Nissan (T:7201).
It is due to outline some 2 billion euros ($2.17 billion) in cost cuts from mid-May, alongside a joint strategy update with Nissan on how to reboot their partnership, as the company struggles with shrinking margins. 
Renault declined to comment. 
The carmaker, which is 15% owned by the French state, has been put under more pressure by the pandemic, and the government said last week it was working on a 5 billion euro aid package for Renault.
This would involve state-guaranteed loans to help the company shore up its liquidity in the wake of similar deals for the likes of Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF). 
Renault's interim Chief Executive Clotilde Delbos is overseeing the first wave of cost cuts at Renault before former Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) executive Luca de Meo joins as CEO in July. Delbos has said the government aid would not impinge on her ""no taboo"" pledge to find savings, including by shutting plants or cutting jobs. 
Renault's engineering business, led by former PSA (PA:PEUP) executive Gilles Le Borgne since January, is expected to be central to the cost cutting plan. 
The number of sub-contractors that work with Renault in the department could be cut to four or five from around 15 now, the sources said.
""There would only be a handful of big sub-contractors left to share some 80% of (Renault's) needs, but who would be in a position to make broader, more competitive offers,"" one of the sources said. 
Auto companies often outsource some of their development needs to engineering and services firms such as Altran (F:ALTT), Segula, Expleo (NS:EXPL),  Alten  (PA:LTEN) or Akka (F:AKA).
As part of cost-cutting, Renault has already ditched its main passenger car joint venture in China, and has also made real estate disposals. ($1 = 0.9218 euros)

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Boeing eyes major bond issue to raise funds,"By Greg Roumeliotis and Mike Spector
(Reuters) - Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co is working with investment banks on a multibillion-dollar bond-fueled financing package as it aims to shore up its balance sheet amid a sharp travel downturn due to the coronavirus pandemic, three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
The preparations reflect Boeing's confidence it can tap the capital markets to strengthen its finances, even as the largest U.S. planemaker weighs seeking government aid.
Boeing has lined up investment banks to potentially market an offering to bond investors in the coming days, provided that market conditions are favorable, the sources said, adding the exact timing and size of the offering had not been decided. 
The proceeds could amount to $10 billion or more, depending on investor demand, one of the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Boeing declined to comment. The company is expected to elaborate on its funding options when it unveils its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.
The planemaker has been trying to bring its 737 MAX jet back into service after two fatal crashes, even as the aviation industry has been hammered by the coronavirus pandemic. Widespread business shutdowns around the world to curb the outbreak have dried up demand for air travel. Boeing has also considered applying to the U.S. Treasury Department for aid under a $17 billion program for companies that are critical to national security, according to the sources. But Boeing's chief executive, David Calhoun, has been wary of the strings attached to such aid, especially the possibility that the company would have to give the government an equity stake.
The company is also examining funding support available to companies from the Federal Reserve, one of the sources said. One of Federal Reserve's newly established programs, the Primary Market Corporate Credit Facility, will provide support to companies issuing bonds without placing any strict conditions on them, such as limits to dividend payouts or executive compensation.
Boeing stopped its share buyback program last year and has also suspended its dividend. Last month, Boeing announced that Calhoun and board chairman Larry Kellner would forgo all pay until the end of the year.
Calhoun told investors during the company's annual shareholder meeting on Monday that the company would need to borrow more over the next six months.
Credit ratings agency Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Investors Service Inc estimated this month that Boeing's funding needs could top $30 billion in 2020. The company secured about half of this by drawing down on a $13.8 billion credit line in March, Moody's said. 
The 737 MAX jet is expected to remain grounded at least until August, as the manufacturer continues to grapple with software issues, people briefed on the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.
Boeing's first-quarter deliveries were a third of the 149 seen a year earlier and the lowest since 1984 for the first quarter.
The Chicago-based company canceled a $4.2 billion deal for  Embraer SA  (NYSE:ERJ)'s commercial aviation division over the weekend, prompting the Brazilian company to initiate arbitration.

On Monday, Boeing unveiled new voluntary layoff offers (VLOs) to employees. Boeing spokesman Bernard Choi said on Tuesday ""several thousand employees taking VLO or retiring is our expectation.""

""We have begun taking action to lower our number of employees by roughly 10% through a combination of voluntary layoffs, natural turnover and involuntary layoffs as necessary,"" Calhoun said in an email seen by Reuters.
Boeing will need to make ""even deeper reductions in areas that are most exposed to the condition of our commercial customers — more than 15% across our commercial airplanes and services businesses, as well as our corporate functions,"" he said.

Boeing has about 160,000 employees worldwide.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Wirecard slides again after short seller demands CEO's head,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Shares in Wirecard slumped again on Wednesday as a prominent short seller demanded the sacking of CEO Markus Braun after a special audit of the German payments company was unable to verify its financial statements.
Chris Hohn, head of $24 billion fund TCI, said in an open letter to Wirecard's supervisory board that the audit by KPMG raised questions over management's compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer laws.
""We are of the view that the supervisory board is legally obliged to intervene,"" Hohn wrote in the letter, addressed to Wirecard Chairman Thomas Eichelmann and other supervisory board members.
""In our opinion, the necessary intervention is now to remove the CEO from all management duties.""
Wirecard shares, which lost 26% on Tuesday following the release of the KPMG audit, shed a further 6% on Wednesday.
German financial regulator Bafin said it would include the findings of the KPMG audit in its ongoing investigation into suspected market manipulation in Wirecard stock.
""At present, we are still investigating whether Wirecard may have withheld information that is subject to disclosure rules or may have provided incorrect information,"" Bafin said in a statement.
Wirecard did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment from Eichelmann and Braun.
Braun told reporters and analysts on Tuesday that the KPMG audit had found no incriminating evidence to indicate that Wirecard's accounts had been manipulated, nor would it restate its accounts for 2016 through 2018. He is the company's largest shareholder.
Wirecard hired KPMG last year to address a series of allegations by the Financial Times and others, including that it had booked half of its worldwide revenues and much of its profits from three obscure third-party acquiring partners.
In his letter, Hohn noted that KPMG had not been able to verify the existence of 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in cash payments by the third-party acquirers.
Nor could the beneficial owner of a counterparty in an Indian asset deal struck in 2015 be identified, he said, which would have been a necessary part of due diligence.
""Wirecard operates a banking license in Europe and is strictly regulated as a payments service provider; in our view it has to abide by applicable Know Your Customer and anti-money laundering laws,"" Hohn wrote.
""This raises questions as to how it is possible to comply with these regulations if Wirecard either does not know or will not disclose who its customers are.""
TCI has disclosed a short position in Wirecard of 1.04% of shares outstanding.

The net loss per share of $1.70 was some 20% wider than expected, while revenue fell to $16.91 billion from $22.92 billion, worse than the $17.28 billion forecast by analysts. Analysts expect a further drop in revenue but a narrower loss. in the second quarter.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting every aspect of our business, including airline customer demand, production continuity and supply chain stability,” Boeing President and CEO David Calhoun said in a statement.
However, the company added that it expects to have enough liquidity to continue funding its operations, after taking a string of cash conservation measures in recent weeks. These include the drawing of a multi-billion credit facility, cuts to operating and capital spending; the suspension of buybacks and dividends, and the elimination of CEO and Chairman pay for the year.
The pandemic hit Boeing's airline customers at a time when the grounding of its 737 MAX by regulators had already effectively stopped one of its most profitable income streams. The Wall Street Journal reported late on Tuesday that the company may face criminal charges as a result of repeated quality-control lapses with the program, something that threatens to raise its legal liabilities still further.
""As the pandemic continues to reduce airline passenger traffic, Boeing sees significant impact on the demand for new commercial airplanes and services, with airlines delaying purchases for new jets, slowing delivery schedules and deferring elective maintenance.""
Against that background, Boeing said it will further reduce production of 787 Dreamliner to seven jets a month.
""With airline customers fighting to survive and unable to order or even utilize new aircraft, Boeing has little choice but to drastically cut its workforce and output,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said. ""Without a doubt, Boeing's standing will be much weaker than previously, leaving the company way more vulnerable than it had been before the pandemic.""
While Boeing didn't detail any staff cuts in its release, Reuters reported Calhoun as saying in an email to staff that the company will shed ""roughly 10%"" of its workforce ""through a combination of voluntary layoffs, natural turnover and involuntary layoffs.""

Boeing shares rose 2.7% in premarket trading as of 7:55 AM ET (1155 GMT).
Elsewhere on Wednesday, Boeing's biggest rival in civil aerospace, Airbus, warned that the sector was facing its ""gravest crisis ever"", after reporting negative cash flow of over $8 billion in the quarter.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Wednesday, ahead of the latest Federal Reserve meeting as confidence grows that the worst of the Covid-19 crisis may be over.
At 7 AM ET (1100 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 25 points, or 0.9%, higher, Nasdaq futures up 93 points, or 1.1%. The Dow futures contract rose 172 points, or 0.7%.
The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting later Wednesday. A change in rates is not expected after its largesse last time, so attention will be focused on any guidance the Fed has about the trajectory of the economy and Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference.
Analysts at Nordea noted that Powell hinted about more easing measures at his last press conference.
“The Fed could also opt to go for some more exotic (read: even more controversial) measures such as buying equities or commodities,” said Nordea, in a research note. “Although this is not our forecast, we would not rule out such a scenario.”
This comes as an increasing number of U.S. states start reopening their economies, the Trump administration ramps up the number of virus tests available and a number of companies try to speed up the time frame for a possible vaccine.
The corporate earnings season continues Wednesday, with the likes of Boeing (NYSE:BA) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) reporting early and tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the close.
GE noted that the Covid-19 crisis hit its first-quarter results to the tune of $700 million, although revenues still came in ahead of expectations. GE shares traded 0.7% higher premarket.
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) shares were 8% higher premarket after Google’s parent sounded a cautiously optimistic note that the steep drop-off in ad revenues in March was starting to moderate.
Shares in Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) were 1.3% lower premarket after the coffee giant posted late Tuesday its first quarterly sales decline since 2009, saying conditions will likely worsen in the current quarter.
In economic data, the advance measure of first-quarter gross domestic product is due at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT). This is expected to show the economy contracted at an annual rate of 4%, which would be the biggest contraction since 2009.
U.S. oil prices were higher amid volatile trading Wednesday. The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday a weekly climb of nearly 10 million barrels in U.S. crude supplies, but this was less than expected.
Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration will be released later Wednesday.
At 7 AM ET, US crude traded 15% higher at $14.21 a barrel, while the international benchmark Brent contract was up 4.2% at $23.70.

The multinational conglomerate announced earnings per share of $0.05 on revenue of $20.52 billion, compared with expectations of EPS of $0.08 on revenue of $20.27 billion.
The company said that Covid-19 factors hit its industrial profit by $0.7 billion in the first quarter. The second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from Covid-19, and thus GE expects that its financial results will decline sequentially. GE pulled its guidance for 2020 earlier in April.

“The impact from COVID-19 materially challenged our first-quarter results, especially in Aviation, where we saw a dramatic decline in commercial aerospace as the virus spread globally in March,"" said GE Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp (NYSE:CULP), Jr. 
GE is taking steps to survive the difficult circumstances, targeting more than $2 billion in operational cost cuts and $3 billion of cash preservation in 2020 to mitigate the financial impact.
However, ""there is hardly any good news for GE in the current environment when the industrial economy is at a standstill,"" said Haris Anwar, an analyst at Investing.com..
""One of the biggest setbacks for GE’s turnaround will come from the aviation division, which was generating positive cash flows. While the military business is mostly unaffected, the commercial aviation business faces a very bleak future in the short-run after the coronavirus pandemic.

A two-member panel headed by Justice U.U. Lalit allowed the return of only 7.3 billion rupees and dismissed the matter, according to a copy of the judgment on the Supreme Court’s website on Wednesday. The company had moved the court saying the income tax department deliberately withheld the dues since 2018.
The ruling is another setback for the British telecom giant’s Indian arm, after mobile operators in the country lost a case and were asked to pay $19 billion in total government demands. Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) Idea Ltd. is struggling to pay $7.2 billion in back fees to India’s government.
The wireless operator, formed by the merger of Vodafone Group’s local unit and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd., hasn’t reported a quarterly profit since announcing the deal in 2017.
The case relates to tax assessments between 2014 and 2018 when the Vodafone group of companies in India underwent a restructuring and merger of subsidiaries."
1591,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 05:43AM ET</span>",StockBeat: Dire Warnings Lost in Liquidity Comfort Blanket,"By Geoffrey Smith 
Investing.com -- Another day, another set of corporate warnings that investors seem determined not to hear.
Companies are running out of options: British Airways said it will cut nearly 30% of its workforce, some 12,000 jobs, in an effort to stop an otherwise certain spiral into insolvency. Even if lockdown measures are eased (which they haven’t been in the U.K., yet), the airline warned that it would take ‘several years’ for the travel industry to get back to where it was in 2019 – a year in which it was already plagued by overcapacity.
That has consequences for Airbus, which sits at the top of a hugely important value chain supporting tens of thousands of some of the best-paid manufacturing jobs in Europe.
The company’s chief executive Guillaume Faury warned on Wednesday that: “We are now in the midst of the gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known.”
Anyone doubting that need only take a look at the group’s cash flow, which was negative to the tune of over 8 billion euros in the quarter (although in fairness, 3.6 billion of that was due to a fine for historical corruption cases).
There was marginally better news from Germany’s big carmakers Volkswagen and  Daimler  (OTC:DDAIF). Daimler too had negative cash flow of 1.6 billion euros in the quarter, as sales volumes slumped by 16%, although revenue held up better due to aggressive discounting in the comparison quarter. VW, meanwhile, said it still expects an operating profit this year, which implies a punchy rebound after what is certain to be a dismal second quarter.
And yet, markets are acting as if all the bad news is priced in. Daimler (DE:DAIGn) stock rose 2.5%, Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) stock rose 2.3% and Airbus (PA:AIR) stock rose 1.3%. Only BA parent IAG (LON:ICAG) stock reacted negatively, falling 2.7%.
The silver lining for Daimler is the ready availability of credit, thanks to the European Central Bank’s easing of monetary policy and the German government’s comprehensive loan guarantees. That’s allowing the company to keep up spending on key technologies, including electrification and digitalization.
“They are non-negotiable elements of our future,"" chief executive Ola Kallenius said in a statement accompanying the results.
The ECB’s measures in particular are already making themselves felt across the euro zone. M3 money supply rose 7.5% on the year in March – the fastest rate in over 11 years - as the central bank shoveled out liquidity. Just as importantly, the European Commission’s proposals on loosening bank capital rules, released Tuesday, will help ensure that banks can continue to push out money to those who need it without worrying about breaching regulatory limits.
And yet, there is still more to do. A survey by the German research institute Ifo published this week showed that fewer than half of Germany’s companies think they can survive the current situation for more than six months. Over half of retailers say they won’t last four months. Given that there is still no sign of a medical cure for Covid-19, and that the risk of subsequent waves of infection will remain as long as that is the case, the race between the virus and the economy is still far from run."
1592,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 05:18AM ET</span>",Europe’s Virus Lockdowns Send Confidence Plunging at Record Pace,"(Bloomberg) --The closure of businesses and loss of work across Europe has shattered confidence at companies and households and left the economy in a deep slump.
The European Commission’s monthly sentiment index plunged by a record in April and is now near the lows recorded during the financial crisis more than a decade ago. Companies are worried about demand, employment expectations have dropped, and job concerns mean consumers are less likely to make major purchases.
The overall index, which goes back to 1985, dropped to 67 from 94.2 in March, just above the 2009 low of 65.5.
The report provides a snapshot of the damage the coronavirus-related restrictions are having on the economy. Governments are aware of the economic cost and are desperately formulating plans to reopen businesses before the damage becomes irreversible.
Separate figures from the European Central Bank showed increased demand for loans from companies as they sought emergency financing to cover rent and wages. Consumer lending slowed as the pandemic hit demand for mortgages and big-ticket items such as cars.
Some industries have taken a particular hit, such as airlines, hotels and restaurants. IAG (LON:ICAG) said Wednesday it will slash the work force at its flagship British Airways by almost 30% to shrink the airline group for a downturn that could last for years.
First-quarter GDP data due this week will provide an insight into the early hit from the lockdowns. In Belgium, the economy shrank almost 4% in the period. Similarly gloomy figures are expected from France, Spain and Italy when they report on Thursday. The ECB will announce its latest policy decision also that day.

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",European shares flat as defensives offset upbeat earnings,"By Sruthi Shankar
(Reuters) - European shares struggled to maintain early gains on Wednesday, as a slide in defensive stocks countered upbeat forecasts from German automakers and sensor specialist AMS as well as a bounce in oil prices.
The pan-European STOXX 600 (STOXX) rose as much as 0.3% but turned flat as healthcare (SXDP), technology (SX8P) and personal & household goods (SXQP) - sectors that have held steady in the wake of the health crisis - dropped between 0.3% and 1.4%.
London equities, however, outperformed their continental peers as lenders  Barclays  (L:BARC) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) rose about 4% even as they set aside billions more to cover potential loan losses due to the pandemic.
Shares in  BP  (L:BP),  Total  (PA:TOTF) and Royal Dutch Sell (AS:RDSA) advanced between 1.9% and 3.5% as crude prices climbed on the back of a lower-than-expected rise in U.S. stockpiles.
European shares have recouped nearly half of their losses since the February rout as many countries move to restart their economies following weeks-long lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
With global economic activity nearly halted in April, analysts are, however, predicting a sharper slump in second-quarter earnings. Latest data from Refinitiv pointed to a 40.4% decline in profits during the period for companies listed on the STOXX 600 versus 37% a week ago.
""We saw a bear market rally and this might come to an end soon,"" said Christian Stocker, an equity strategist at Unicredit (MI:CRDI).
Stocker added it might be too early to step back into cyclical sectors. ""I want to see some light at the end of tunnel - all the hopes for easing of lockdown should come to benefit,"" he said.
All eyes will be on first-quarter GDP figures for the United States and the release of the U.S. Federal Reserve's statement later in the day. Expectations are also high for more stimulus from the European Central Bank, which is due to meet on Thursday.
Sensor specialist AMS (S:AMS) jumped 17.3% to the top of STOXX 600 as it expects the impact from the coronavirus in the second quarter to be limited.
Automakers (SXAP) were buoyed after German carmaker  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) forecast operating profit at its Mercedes-Benz Cars (NYSE:CARS) & Vans division to be above the prior-year level and rival Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) said it expected to be profitable on a full-year basis.
Shares in Finnish flag carrier Finnair (HE:FIA1S) tumbled nearly 14% as it planned to raise 500 million euros ($543 million) through stock offering after reporting deepening first-quarter losses. 

Italian stocks (FTMIB) rose 0.6%, shrugging of rating agency Fitch downgrading the country's credit rating to ""BBB-minus"" on Tuesday, just one notch above junk.

(Reuters) - AstraZeneca (L:AZN) topped analysts' estimates for quarterly profit and reiterated its targets for the year on Wednesday, as the British drugmaker benefited from higher demand for some of its medicines during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Cambridge-based drugmaker joined other big pharma firms in either maintaining or raising its forecast for 2020 and said its supply chain had proved resilient to the coronavirus-induced disruptions in the period.
All of its China operations had come quickly back on line, it said, and while it assumed the pandemic would last for several more months, sales have been helped in the short term by stockpiling by distributors.
Revenues would increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage this year, the company said, comparing favourably to analysts current average forecast of 8.4%, according to Refinitiv data. 
Shares rose about 1.5% after the results.
European peers including Bayer (DE:BAYGn) and  Novartis  (S:NOVN) have also seen an uplift in demand in the quarter, as hospitals moved quickly to stock their shelves.
AstraZeneca's product sales for the first quarter ended March 31 rose 17% to $6.31 billion on a constant-currency basis, as asthma medication Symbicort and cancer drug Tagrisso fared well, helping it beat analysts' overall expectations of $5.89 billion 
Newer treatments, including those for diabetes, heart conditions and cancer, have put the company's business on track for its third consecutive year of growth, with a strong line-up in place for future sales. 
Revenue from China, a key growth region, rose 17% to $1.42 billion, accounting for about 23% of total revenue.
Like a raft of other drugmakers, AstraZeneca is testing two of its approved treatments as a therapy to help in the outbreak that has so far infected over 3.1 million people and killed more than 210,000. 
Drugmakers worldwide are also having to halt or stall existing trials as they divert funds and research into potential COVID-19 treatments, but AstraZeneca said it did not expect any delays to late-stage trials in 2020 and 2021.
Core earnings at the drugmaker rose 21% to $1.05 per share, while total revenue, which also includes payments from tie-ups, rose 17% to $6.35 billion from year earlier.

Analysts on average had expected core earnings of 94 cents per share, according to a company provided consensus of 22 analysts.

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Auto supplier Bosch sees global car production down 20% in 2020,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German auto supplier and technology company Robert Bosch (ROBG.UL) on Wednesday said it expected automotive production to fall by at least 20% this year, as the coronavirus pandemic slams the brakes on factory production lines and saps demand.
""We are bracing ourselves for a global recession that will also have a considerable impact on our own performance in 2020,"" Bosch Chief Financial Officer Stefan Asenkerschbaumer said in a statement. 
""Given the many imponderables, we feel unable to make a reasonable forecast for the Bosch Group for the year as a whole. It will take a supreme effort to achieve at least a balanced result.""
To cut costs, Bosch has pushed out timeframes for making investments, reduced working hours for half of its staff in Germany and imposed salary reductions. Managers and executives are taking a 20% pay cut in April and May.
""Even if production has been ramped up again in China, and European industry is preparing for a ramp-up of its own, we have to steel ourselves for a severe global recession over 2020 as a whole,"" the company said.
In January, before the coronacrisis had become a global pandemic, Bosch warned that global car production may have already reached its peak and released preliminary full-year earnings which showed weaker demand in Asia.
Bosch sales remained almost flat at 77.7 billion euros ($84.26 bln) last year, but earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell 38% to 3.3 billion euros, down from 5.4 billion euros a year earlier, with the EBIT margin dropping to 4.2% from 7% in 2018, it said. 
In the medium term, Bosch plans to return to a roughly 7% margin from operations.
The EBIT margin in its mobility services division, which includes automotive parts, fell to 1.9% last year as the Stuttgart-based supplier was forced to invest in the shift from combustion-engined to electric cars and to restructure its business.
Research and development expenditure rose by 7.8% to 6.1 billion euros, it said.
Group sales have continued to show weakness, dropping by 7.3% in the first quarter with the Mobility services segment showing a 7.7% decline.

Separately, Bosch said it will be capable of producing half a million facemasks a day after using its special purpose machinery unit to build a production line for facemasks.

LONDON/SYDNEY (Reuters) - World shares eked out slim gains on Wednesday, with optimism over economies easing coronavirus lockdowns and oil prices clawing back ground leavened by caution over corporate earnings.
MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) world equity index (MIWD00000PUS), which tracks shares in 49 countries, ticked up 0.2%, with European shares mirroring a buoyant day in Asia after initially choppy trading.
The broad Euro STOXX 600 (STOXX) gained 0.1%, with German automaker Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p)  saying it expected a full-year profit even after a plunge in first-quarter earnings and  Daimler  (DE:DAIGn) also eyeing an operating profit for its Mercedes-Benz Cars (NYSE:CARS) & Vans unit. Still, major drugmakers Roche (S:ROG) and  Novartis  (S:NOVN) weighed on the market, falling 2% and 0.7% respectively.
Markets in Frankfurt (GDAXI) and Paris (FCHI) both gained 0.3%, with London (FTSE) adding 1%. 
Risk assets including equities have rallied for most of this month thanks to heavy doses of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus around the globe aimed at softening the economic blow from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Still, Europe's quarterly results continue to deteriorate, with Refinitiv data pointing to a 40.4% decline in earnings for companies listed on the STOXX 600, versus 37% a week ago.
Investors across the world are growing confident the pandemic may be peaking as parts of the United States, Europe and Australia gradually ease restrictions. 
New Zealand this week allowed some businesses to reopen. 
""The market is broadly buying stocks on the hope of the recovery and focusing on the eventual winners of this part of the cycle related to COVID-19, and then the structural winners,"" said Sebastien Galy, a strategist at Nordea. 
Positive news around potential treatments for the infection as well as progress in developing a vaccine have also boosted sentiment. 
Earlier, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (MIAPJ0000PUS) gained 1% to a near two-month peak. Wall Street futures (ESc1) were up 0.7%, helped by forecast-beating revenues from Alphabet Inc's Google (O:GOOGL).
CRUDE COMES BACK 
Hopes the moves would help revive demand sent U.S. crude futures (CLc1) up about 15% to $14.12 a barrel, paring a 27% plunge over the first two days of this week. 
Brent crude (LCOc1) futures rose 5% to $21.47 a barrel.
The moves also emboldened bets on riskier currencies, keeping the dollar on the back foot, with the greenback falling 0.3% to 99.610 against a basket of currencies (=USD).
The euro (EUR=) was flat at $1.0860 though the euro index (=EUR) eased after Fitch cut Italy's credit rating to BBB-, just one notch above ""junk"" status. Italy's government bond yields rose after the cut.
Some analysts were circumspect about the rally in stocks, noting a concentration among tech and IT stocks.
""We were actually seeing a big dislocation in performance in the new world - the tech thing - and the old economy of industrials reliant on human costs,"" said Olivier Marciot, portfolio manager at Unigestion. 
Investors are now watching out for results from the other major tech firms including Amazon (O:AMZN) and Apple (O:AAPL). Earnings from Facebook (O:FB) and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT) are due later in the day.
The gains have come even as analysts predict a sharp contraction in world growth. 
Moody's (NYSE:MCO) expects economies of the group of 20 advanced nations (G20) to shrink 5.8% this year with momentum unlikely to recover to pre-coronavirus levels even in 2021. 
Markets were next looking for any guidance from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is due to issue a policy statement around 1800 GMT after its two-day meeting. The European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

Analysts said it was unlikely the Fed would make further major policy moves, given the scope and depth of its efforts to counter the economic damage caused by the coronavirus.

The carmaker, which has 24,000 staff in Sweden excluding some 2,000 consultants, said in a statement the measures also included a continued review and reduction of consultancy contracts but would not affect its manufacturing operations.
CEO Hakan Samuelsson said the coronavirus crisis highlighted a need for Volvo to speed up its work to transform the company, reducing its scope in some areas in favour of expansion in fields such as online business, electrification and mobility.
It also needed to simplify the organisation to enable quicker decision making, he told Reuters.
""We want to come out of the corona-crisis stronger, and that is why we are doing this,"" Samuelsson said. ""It will be important that we have the right cars when we get through this period, lots of electric cars, and I also think that people will learn to shop more online.""
Volvo said the exact number of jobs cut would be decided over the coming months in negotiations with unions. 
The carmaker has much like the rest of the auto industry been hit hard by the pandemic that has temporarily shuttered plants and strained supply chains due to draconian lockdowns in many key markets and transport hubs.
Last week, Volvo reopened its Torslanda plant, its main factory in Sweden, following a three-week shutdown caused by the pandemic, and Samuelsson said on Wednesday that the restart had so far gone ""very well"".

PARIS (Reuters) - Airbus (PA:AIR) on Wednesday posted a 49% slump in first-quarter core profit and called for an industry-wide campaign to restore confidence in flying after the coronavirus pandemic triggered the ""gravest crisis the aerospace industry has ever known"".
Europe's largest aerospace group also highlighted plans to save cash after gushing 8 billion euros in the first quarter, including a record 3.6-billion-euro fine to settle corruption investigations in Britain, France and the United States.
""All nature of costs are now being reviewed,"" CEO Guillaume Faury told analysts.
Airbus has been unable to deliver more than a handful of aircraft since Europe-wide lockdowns began in mid-March and Faury said he expected similar difficulties in the second quarter before a clearer picture emerges in around June.
Chief Financial Officer Dominik Asam told a telephone news conference he expected some recovery in the third quarter before returning ""basically to a neutral situation where we don't use cash anymore"" in the fourth.
Airbus expanded furlough schemes on Tuesday by sending home 3,200 workers in Britain after putting 3,000 workers on government-backed partial unemployment schemes in France, and Faury said thousands of German staff could also be affected.
He did not say whether Airbus would carry out forced redundancies but told staff last week to prepare for ""more far-reaching measures"" to balance the group's costs to the reduced outlook for aviation in coming years.
""We are doing everything we can to be in the best shape for competing again later,"" Faury said on Wednesday.
Airbus said first-quarter adjusted operating profit fell 49% to 281 million euros ($304.7 million) as revenue dropped 15% to 10.631 billion euros, mainly due to clouds that were already gathering over jetliner demand before the coronavirus outbreak.
JUNE PRODUCTION REVIEW
Planemakers, airlines and suppliers have been left reeling by the pandemic, which has crippled passenger travel and catapulted major economies into recession.
Airbus suspended its outlook and dividend and negotiated new credit lines last month. 
It said on Wednesday it does not immediately see a need for further government support.
Airbus this month cut jet production by between one third and 42% depending on the model, compared with previously announced rates. It could cut production again after reviewing the situation in June if a new surplus builds up, Asam said.
Industry sources say Airbus is currently producing few aircraft as it adapts to social distancing rules.
Airbus will reduce 2020 capital expenditure by around 700 million euros to around 1.9 billion euros and defer or suspend activities which are ""not critical"", Faury said. 
However, he stressed that Airbus continues to develop its fast-selling A321XLR.
Reuters reported on Tuesday that planemakers are drastically slowing other new projects to save cash.

In the longer term, Airbus remains committed to a new generation of green aircraft, and will intensify a focus on onboard passenger health as well as safety, Faury said.

Anticipating a higher rate of defaults among customers, the carmaker hiked risk provisions for delinquencies among customers who leased or bought Mercedes-Benz cars to 448 million euros($486.71 million), even as default rates have not yet started to spike.
Analysts applauded the carmaker's cash management.
""There is nothing cheering in the auto numbers we have seen so far across the industry but Daimler seems to have had a decent start to Q1 and managed working capital better than we had feared,"" Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) analyst Philippe Houchois said.
Daimler reiterated it expects group revenue and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to be below 2019 levels but given substantial one-off charges in the year-earlier period, the Mercedes-Benz Cars & Vans division is now seen delivering EBIT above prior-year, the company said.
Daimler is also sticking to its dividend proposal and ruled out needing to apply for state-backed loans, given an adequate cash position. 
Last week Daimler (DE:DAIGn) pre-released results, showing a plunge of nearly 70% in first-quarter operating profit and warned that the cash flow it uses to pay dividends would fall this year.

First-quarter EBIT was 617 million euros, down from 2.8 billion euros in the year-earlier period, of which 510 million euros came from the Mercedes-Benz cars unit.

The layoffs have become more urgent as measures to isolate populations and restrict travel weigh on car sales, Volvo said. The pandemic has forced carmakers around the globe to halt production and react to a rapid slump in demand. Volvo reopened its factories in Sweden last week after an almost monthlong shutdown.
“We can’t expect customers to come back and demand exactly the same products as before the crisis,” Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a phone interview. “The coronavirus means that it’s even more important to change rapidly, and doing it by voluntary redundancies won’t be fast enough.”
Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. bought Volvo Cars from Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co. in the wake of the financial crisis. Since then, the carmaker has revamped its lineup and invested in new business models, including subscription services and car-sharing. It has also launched its first all-electric model and aims to raise its total of all-electric cars to 50% of overall sales by 2025. The layoffs announced on Wednesday will reduce staffing in “non-focus areas,” such as activities related to combustion engine production and testing, Samuelsson said.

President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues have already ramped up bond-buying of vulnerable nations, but expectations are running high that the central bank will do more Thursday, given how the region’s governments are struggling to agree on joint fiscal action.
The corporate earnings newsflow has continued Wednesday, with German car giants Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) and Daimler (OTC:DDAIF) both said that they expect to be profitable this year, despite big falls in sales in the first and second quarters due to the pandemic.

With no end in sight for the travel bans which have brought flying to a near-halt, airlines across the world are facing deep uncertainty and heavy future losses, and no visibility on how and when operations can restart.
British Airways could make up to 12,000 staff redundant, its parent company said on Tuesday, as it forecast that passenger numbers will take years to recover from the crisis. BA has 45,000 employees, including 16,500 cabin crew and 3,900 pilots.
Traders said that IAG's shares fell due to the warning over demand and after first quarter results came in worse than expected. Its stock has lost 64% of its value in the last three months. 
The radical shake-out planned at IAG to help it survive the coronavirus crisis contrasts with moves at rival big European airline groups Air France-KLM (PA:AIRF) and Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), which are both hoping that government bailouts will see them through. 
Lufthansa said on Tuesday could seek some form of protection from creditors while talking to the Berlin government about a 9 billion euro rescue package.
But IAG's chief executive Willie Walsh has long-opposed state-backed rescues for airlines and BA said on Tuesday that there was ""no government bailout standing by for BA"". 
IAG, which owns Iberia and Vueling in Spain and Aer Lingus in Ireland as well as BA, has, however, used government furlough schemes to help pay staff who have been temporarily suspended while planes are not flying. 
Analysts pointed to IAG's strong financial position, it said on Tuesday it had 9.5 billion euros available at the end of March, saying that this meant IAG was in a better position compared to its peers. 
""(This) gives some reassurance to investors that IAG will be one of the survivors and possible long-term beneficiaries of this current crisis,"" Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said. 
Earlier on Wednesday Finnair (HE:FIA1S) announced plans to raise 500 million euros ($543 million) through a rights offering that would be almost as large as its current equity.

1604,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",Indians venture into U.S. stocks as markets slump at home,"By Abhirup Roy
MUMBAI (Reuters) - More Indian investors are turning to U.S. stocks to escape tumbling markets at home and pick up exposure to global technology giants that are rising through the coronavirus-led market turmoil.
With more mom-and-pop investors chasing overseas stock investments that were until now a hobby of the wealthy, brokers that help investors navigate these trades through India's highly restrictive cross-border investment rules are thriving.
Vested Finance, an investment firm that helps Indians buy or sell U.S. stocks, opened 4,000 new accounts in March, double that in February. The company usually sees a 30% rise in account openings each month.
Pranav Mehta, who owns an electronic parts manufacturing company, is one such investor. As his business hit a downturn, Mehta bought one share each of Amazon.com (O:AMZN), Adobe (O:ADBE), Microsoft (O:MSFT), NVIDIA (O:NVDA) and Mastercard (N:MA) last year. 
""Technology is the future,"" Mehta said. ""If you want exposure to technology, you have to bag U.S. stocks.""
Mehta, 45, bought more shares last month as widespread restrictions around the world to limit the spread of coronavirus sent markets tumbling. 
""I jumped at the opportunity and increased my holdings more than four-fold,"" Mehta told Reuters. As markets recover from the pandemic, he wants U.S. stocks to be a fifth of his portfolio, up from 5% now.
Vested Finance saw flows of more than $3.5 million into U.S. markets from India in the three months to March, a five-fold jump from the previous quarter and mostly from clients investing in the United States for the first time. 
""What's interesting about U.S. stocks is that you not only get exposure to the United States but also to the world, as many companies have global operations but are listed there,"" said Viram Shah, co-founder and CEO of Vested Finance. 
While most retail investors are interested in high profile brands such as Facebook (O:FB), Google (O:GOOGL) and Netflix (O:NFLX), Shah said, some have sought sectors such as cannabis and gene-editing CRISPR technology that are not available in India.
India's equity markets (NSEI) (BSESN) have lost more than a fifth of their value this year, while the S&P 500 (SPX) has corrected by just over 11%. The S&P 500 also has almost no correlation with India's markets, making it an ideal hedge for domestic investors.
The dash to U.S. stocks has helped brokerage Motilal Oswal, which launched an exchange-traded fund this month that will mirror the S&P 500 index.
The fund has had a strong start with 49,300 investors, said Aashish Somaiyaa, CEO of Motilal Oswal Asset Management, far more than the 31,000 investors its Nasdaq-linked fund garnered since its launch 18 months ago.
""Frankly a little bit of it is recency, which is that India has done much worse than the U.S.,"" he said, referring to the tendency to remember the most recent events.

The weakness in the rupee  against the dollar was another draw, Somaiyaa said, which enhances returns on overseas investments. The dollar is up 6% against the rupee this year.

1605,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",Worried China bondholders call for protection as restructuring wave looms,"By Samuel Shen and Andrew Galbraith
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's bondholders are increasingly worried that there is little to protect them from being railroaded into bad deals by troubled borrowers amid a wave of virus-related extensions and restructurings.
The country's 25 trillion yuan ($3.53 trillion) corporate bond market has become an increasingly important funding channel for Chinese companies and government-backed vehicles, but it has limited experience with distress or default. 
While bondholders the world over fret about what happens when a company can't repay them, those in China say they have few established precedents or procedures to guide them. 
China's first public bond default happened just six years ago.
""Onshore investors used to pay less attention to the covenants and provisions,"" said Ivan Chung, head of Greater China Credit Research & Analysis at Moody's (NYSE:MCO). ""Credit incidents and defaults in the past two years have alerted investors about these weaknesses. Yet there are still lots of outstanding bonds in the market with weak protection for investors."" 
Risks for bondholders are rising even faster now as Chinese officials seek to avert an avalanche of defaults caused by the country's coronavirus-ravaged economy. They are encouraging struggling companies to extend repayment dates or exchange debt coming due for new bonds - both of which need bondholder agreement. 
RISING FINANCING COSTS
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) analysts count at least 10 Chinese borrowers that have avoided defaults this year by extending principal repayments worth a combined 6 billion yuan ($846.80 million).
But not all such agreements have been reached smoothly, and disagreements can carry risk. 
Inadequate investor protection threatens to ""push up companies' financing costs ... and reduce foreigners' willingness to participate in China's bond market,"" said Xin Chen, finance professor at Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance (SAIF).
China has been courting foreign investors for its local markets to help bolster its currency and fund domestic growth.
One of the latest causes of investor outrage was conglomerate HNA [HNAIRC.UL], which gave holders of one $55 million bond just 30 minutes' official notice of a meeting that would extend by a year its imminent repayment, even though its own rules required 30 days' notice and exchange rules require 10 days.
HNA subsequently apologised and explained it had discussed the deferral with major bondholders ahead of the meeting. Three big investors accounting for more than 98% of the bonds represented at the meeting voted for the plan, while 29 voted against. 
""If authorities give the nod to such a practice, it shows deficiency in our legal protection for bondholders,"" Chen said of the move.
HNA declined to comment. 
Bondholders in other companies have complained about the way they have been treated. One angry investor found his line cut off mid-question during a call in February to discuss an offer to pay about 40 cents on the dollar for $850 million in Qinghai Provincial Investment Group (QPIG) bonds. 
QPIG didn't reply to requests for comment. 
GRABBING ATTENTION 
Unlike mom-and-pop retail investors, who dominate China's stock market, bondholders fear they can't get officials' attention because they are mostly institutions, and less likely to protest in the streets.
For example, while mechanisms for shareholder decisions have long been enshrined in national law, a requirement that companies should have bondholder meetings and disclose relevant rules and procedures in bond prospectuses was only added this March.
""Before it was a bit theoretical what would actually happen in a bankruptcy because you never had one. You can do all the preparation you want but you won't really know what works and what doesn't. Clearly there have been practical issues,"" said Samuel Fischer, head of China onshore debt capital markets at  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in Beijing.
In July, the National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors (NAFMII), China's interbank market regulator, will introduce new guidelines for bond trustees - third parties who ensure bond conditions are upheld.
Internationally, these have been independent. But in China, they have typically been the banks and brokers underwriting the deal, who may have conflicts of interest, Moody's Chung said. The new guidelines strengthen rules around conflicts of interest and disclosure requirements to bring China more in line with offshore markets.
Another thorny issue is courts' unfamiliarity with bondholder issues. Even if meetings and votes do not follow the rules, investors may struggle to contest those because of a lack of legal precedents, according to Lei Jiping, partner at King & Wood Mallesons.
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and NAFMII didn't respond to requests for comment. 
RISING DEFAULTS
Last year defaults in China's onshore corporate bond market hit a record 142 billion yuan, according to Moody's. But that accounts for just 0.6% of the total market, while the default rate in the U.S. bond market is about 1.8%.
The stakes are high for China as Beijing works to reform its financial system and deepen its credit markets to help shift some banking risks. And there are signs that bondholders' influence may be growing. 
Last week, Chinese property developer  Gemdale  Corp (SS:600383) offered holders of its 1 billion yuan 5.29% May 2021 bond  a 1.5% rate for the final coupon payment, despite a prospectus clause that said any coupon adjustments must be increases.
The move angered bondholders and prompted sarcastic suggestions on social media that Gemdale had increased the coupon by a negative number. The Shanghai Stock Exchange demanded an explanation.
On Wednesday, Gemdale said that after ""careful consideration,"" it had decided to maintain the bond's coupon at 5.29%, and issued an apology.

Earlier this month, Volkswagen Group said car sales dropped by 23% on the year, causing operating profit to tumble 81% in the January to March period, forcing the car and trucks manufacturer to withdraw its outlook for 2020.

In February Volkswagen had said it aimed to achieve customer deliveries in line with the previous year, revenue growth of 4% in 2020 and slightly higher passenger car deliveries.

1610,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 11:18PM ET</span>",Samsung Warns of Profit Slide After Virus Slams Tech Sphere,"(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) Co. warned earnings may decline this quarter after the coronavirus outbreak hurt demand for its smartphones and gadgets, trimming income gained from surging server-chip orders.
South Korea’s largest company reported a 4% slide in net income to 4.9 trillion won ($4 billion) in the three months ended March. Samsung (KS:005930), which had reported better-than-expected operating profits earlier this month, said the pandemic continued to hammer demand across an array of markets.
The warning from the world’s largest maker of memory chips, smartphones and consumer appliances underscores the uncertainty gripping global industry. As the pandemic spread in the first months of the year, the technology sector took hits from both supply and demand. Samsung joins peers such as  Intel Corp  (NASDAQ:INTC). in cautioning about the impact of a global economic slowdown.
Samsung “expects the memory business to remain solid, but overall earnings are likely to decline from the previous quarter because COVID-19 will significantly impact demand for several of its core products,” it said in a statement. “In the second half, uncertainties driven by COVID-19 will persist as the duration and impact of the pandemic remain unknown.”

In particular, Samsung said a drop in smartphone earnings is “inevitable” in the second quarter because of store closings and other factors, while profits would also slip in mobile displays. Executives on a post-earnings conference call refrained from offering guidance on the memory market but said the company will continue to invest in semiconductor expansions and research.
The Covid-19 pandemic has emerged as one of the largest economic shocks in recent years, disrupting both consumer demand as well as supply chains worldwide. Factories in countries such as China were temporarily shut, crimping orders for Samsung components like displays. Meanwhile, retail stores, including those of client Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., were closed to avoid spreading infections. That’s been offset in part by demand for the memory chips used in datacenters and computers, which allow people to work and study from home. Samsung’s shares stood largely unchanged Wednesday.
Samsung Needs You to Stay Home and Watch Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX): Tim Culpan
What Bloomberg Intelligence Says
Samsung Electronics’ downbeat 2Q profit guidance reflects its smartphone-shipment plunge amid the Covid-19 outbreak. In contrast to a sequential as well as year-on-year increase, according to Bloomberg consensus, Samsung expects 2Q earnings may decline. We expect its memory chip profit will stay sturdy in 2Q since most contracts should have been concluded with customers.

Should the pandemic persist into the second half, the tech giant foresees missing its own 2020 revenue projections by a double-digit percentage, Bloomberg News has reported. A prolonged virus outbreak may also disrupt its supply chain.
Predicting the outlook is difficult due to Covid-19 in the U.S. and Europe, said Samsung Securities analyst Hwang Min-seong. “But the good news is that China is showing signs of a fast recovery,” he said. “Still, there are concerns over whether chip demand will be sustainable in the second half despite improved sentiment on server demand.”
SK Hynix Inc. and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU)., which control the bulk of the memory chip market together with Samsung, have told investors that strong demand from data-center clients boosted sales and profits and that the trend is expected to continue in the first half.

Chip companies have projected that the contract prices for DRAM and NAND will remain solid throughout the second quarter. In addition to server expansions, the pandemic is seen as a catalyst for expediting the transition to 5G and autonomous or touchless technology, driving component sales.
Apple and Huawei Technologies Co. supplier Hynix said there was a possibility that even server demand could lose steam if the economic downturn is prolonged. Intel withdrew its full-year sales forecast last week for the year, citing “significant” uncertainty.
“Demand for server and PC to remain solid as more people work from home, but a decline in mobile demand to remain a risk,” Samsung said Wednesday in an earnings presentation.
Sluggish sales of Samsung’s flagship S20 lineup will be reflected in the current quarter, eroding profitability at the smartphone division, which has been reeling from plant and store shutdowns in some regions.
Its display business had a 290 billion won operating loss after smartphone sales from Apple and Huawei sharply fell in the first quarter. The consumer electronics unit, which includes TVs and appliances, reported operating profit of 450 billion won. Samsung’s major overseas appliances plants temporarily shut from March through early April.

The offering could raise at least $2 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The Beijing-based company, which currently trades on Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ), has a market value of $64 billion.
The deal comes after Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. raised $13 billion in a Hong Kong share sale last year. That much larger deal was hailed as a homecoming for Chinese companies and a win for Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., which lost these deals to its U.S. counterparts a decade ago because it didn’t allow dual-class share voting at the time. The bourse, which relaxed the rule in 2018, was up as much as 2.4% Wednesday.
JD’s listing could come as early as the second half of the year, according to one of the people. Deliberations are ongoing and the size of the offering could still change, the people said. A representative for JD.com didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

JD.com’s potential Hong Kong secondary listing may help to narrow its valuation gap with global e-commerce peers such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba.

JD’s decision comes after the Chinese online retailer’s forecast for at least 10% revenue growth in the March quarter suggested its business was proving more resilient to the epidemic than anticipated.
It may fare better than its peers because it employs a direct-to-consumer sales and in-house logistics model that may prove more resilient to short-term disruptions than platforms that connect merchants with buyers, some analysts say. Away from the outbreak, JD continues to win more consumers from smaller Chinese cities and towns, while demand for the electronics it depends on should rebound after the outbreak subsides.
The company’s shares slid 4.4% Tuesday, but have risen more than 23% this year while the S&P/BNY Mellon China ADR Index, which tracks U.S.-listed Chinese companies, is down 5.2% during the same period. IFR Asia reported earlier Tuesday that the company had filed for a Hong Kong listing confidentially.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 09:40PM ET</span>",NYSE to reopen San Francisco-based options floor next Monday,"By John McCrank
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said on Tuesday its NYSE Arca Options trading floor in San Francisco would partially reopen next Monday but its New York-based trading floors would remain closed for now, having been shut since March 23 due to the coronavirus crisis.
The Arca Options trading floor will operate with reduced personnel and additional safety precautions for exchange staff and floor traders, the NYSE, which is owned by Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) Inc, said in a traders' alert.
""Upon reopening, NYSE Arca Options trading floor personnel will be required to follow enhanced safety protocols, which include, but are not limited to, compliance with the public health orders of the City and County of San Francisco,"" the exchange operator said. 
The NYSE held a conference call on April 22 with NYSE staff and the traders who work on its trading floors to discuss an eventual reopening, but did not set any dates, according to two people who were on the call.
The exchange plans to eventually reopen its New York-based trading floors in phases, monitoring everyone who enters 11 Wall Street for symptoms and ensuring that traders adhere to social-distancing guidelines, the people said.
New York City, home to some 8.4 million people, is the epicenter of the global pandemic. The number of known U.S. cases of the coronavirus passed 1 million on Tuesday, with about 30% of the cases coming from New York state.
Health officials from San Francisco County, along with five other Bay Area counties and the city of Berkeley, issued a statement late on Monday saying they would issue revised ""shelter-in-place"" orders that are set to expire on Sunday. The new orders will keep the restrictions in place and extend them through May, with limited easing for a small number of low-risk activities.

As a financial exchange operator, the NYSE is considered to provide an essential service and can reopen its trading floors when it wants, but it has taken a cautious approach after several traders and at least one ICE employee tested positive for the virus in March.

BOSTON (Reuters) - An investor group that owns almost one-quarter of GCP Applied Technologies (NYSE:GCP) is backing activist investor Starboard Value's plan to remove most of the chemical company's current board members, arguing the committee is not making the best decisions for the company or shareholders.
Standard Industries Inc and affiliated entity 40 North Management LLC, which together own 24.4% of GCP's stock, told GCP's board about their decision in a letter on Tuesday, throwing huge support to Starboard's ongoing proxy contest at the company. Starboard nominated eight directors to the board, which the company said will be expanded by one to 10 members.
Together, Standard Industries, 40 North and Starboard own roughly one third of GCP's shares, putting the three in a very strong position to push for changes on the board.
GCP's board ""has proven itself incapable of making sound strategic and tactical decisions,"" Standard Industries' co-chief executives, David Millstone and David Winter, wrote in the letter, which was made public in a regulatory filing.
""We are left with no other tenable course of action but to support Starboard Value's call for an almost complete replacement of GCP's Board,"" they continued.
Standard Industries is a privately held global industrial business, and 40 North, an investment vehicle, is a related entity.
Cambridge, Massachusetts-headquartered GCP defended the stewardship of its board and management. 
""GCP's Board and management team have articulated a clear strategy to enhance performance at GCP and are successfully executing against that plan, as demonstrated by the company's recent business momentum and operating performance, including strong expected first quarter 2020 results,"" the company said in a statement. It added that it has ""also implemented substantial governance enhancements, including significant Board refreshment."" 
Millstone and Winter disagree. They say the company has no coherent strategy and blame the board for not overseeing management appropriately. They criticize certain executive compensation and the fact that a former CEO was made executive chairman. ""The GCP Board has not been held accountable for the failure of its 2019 strategic review process and, at this point, the Board appears to have no strategy at all,"" the letter said. 
Nearly four weeks ago Starboard, one of the industry's most powerful activist investors and the owner of a roughly 9% stake in GCP, nominated eight directors, arguing that its nominees would steer GCP through the current economic crisis more successfully than the current board.Starboard, whose nominees include one of its partners, Peter Feld, said its slate have experience in finance, operations, strategy as well as construction products. 
GCP last year handed the New York-based hedge fund two board seats.[nL1N2BQ39R] Since then the company has run a strategic process toconsider options, changed its chief executive officer and cutcosts.

1616,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",UK small firms use furlough scheme to avoid permanent job cuts: BCC,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three of every four small British businesses have temporarily laid off staff using an emergency government scheme to pay their wages, minimising permanent job losses during the coronavirus lockdown so far, a survey published on Wednesday showed.
The British Chambers of Commerce said 76% of member firms it surveyed had furloughed some of their staff under the wage-guarantee scheme, up from 71% a week earlier, and almost none had made staff permanently redundant. 
BCC Director-General Adam Marshall said the plan was an essential part of supporting businesses through the crisis and needed to be extended.
""While the furlough scheme cannot be indefinite, it will need to run well beyond June 30 in some form to help businesses transition toward a 'new normal' as the lockdown is eased,"" he said in a statement
Finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday that half a million firms had made claims in the first week of the job retention scheme, covering more than 4 million jobs at a cost of 4.5 billion pounds ($5.6 billion) to the public finances.
In another survey released on Wednesday, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development - whose members typically work at somewhat larger employers than the BCC - said 46% of firms had furloughed staff, and another 10% planned to do so.
However it criticised the scheme for not allowing firms to reduce staff hours, rather than furlough them completely.
The all-or-nothing approach to furlough would also make it harder to bring back staff gradually as social distancing measures are lifted, CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese said.
""This will be vital as lockdown measures are eased over a number of weeks or months, and will reduce the risk of large-scale redundancies in this next phase of the crisis,"" he said.
As well as the jobs retention scheme, Britain's government has launched state-backed loan programmes which have been slow to gain momentum.
The BCC said 57% of the firms in its survey did not intend to apply for the main emergency credit scheme and only one in eight of those which did apply had received money so far.
The proportion reporting success in the BCC survey is far lower than the average in the latest data from Britain's banks, which showed about 45% of applicants have had loans approved.
Sunak said on Monday he would launch a new scheme offering fully state-backed loans of up to 50,000 pounds ($62,000) to the smallest businesses, up from 80% support for the other emergency loan programmes for bigger firms.
""Loan support has not been getting to businesses fast enough, so this week's announcement of the Bounce Back loan scheme and further improvements to the CBILS scheme are welcome steps,"" the BCC's Marshall said.

(Reuters) -  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) said on Tuesday it sees sales in China, the company's biggest growth market, recovering by the end of September, following a massive drop in same-store sales in the current quarter on fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which forced Starbucks to close stores around the globe.
Shares of the world's biggest coffee chain fell nearly 2% in extended trading.
Restaurant chains around the world have felt the impact of lockdowns spurred by the deadly viral outbreak.
Seattle-based Starbucks reported a 10% fall in global same-store sales for its fiscal second quarter ended March 29. Analysts had forecast a 9.71% decline, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 
Excluding one-time items, the company earned 32 cents per share, in line with Wall Street expectations.
In China, where the coronavirus outbreak began late last year, Starbucks stores were closed for most of its second quarter, although 98% of China locations have now reopened. Those locations have modified schedules and extra safety measures, including limited cafe seating to maintain social distancing. 
Starbucks forecast a drop in comparable sales in China in the current third quarter of between 25% and 35%, followed by a decline in fourth-quarter same-store sales of as much as 10% before ending roughly flat by the end of the fiscal year in September. For the full year, China same-store sales are seen decreasing 15% to 25%.
""People are going to look at that (China forecast) as an indication of what they may have to face in the U.S., since China got hit first,"" said Tony Scherrer, director of research and portfolio manager at Smead Capital Management, which owns Starbucks shares.
Starbucks did not forecast sales for its U.S. business, citing the onset of the coronavirus outbreak late in the quarter, but said it expects the financial impact to be significantly greater in the third quarter and to extend to the fourth quarter.
About half of Starbucks' U.S. restaurants are closed, and those that have remained open moved to a pick-up and delivery-only model in March to stop people from gathering.
About 90% of U.S. stores should be reopened by early June with extra safety protocols on a community-by-community basis, in a ""thoughtful"" way, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson said in an earnings call.
Smead Capital's Scherrer called Starbucks ""one of the best performers in restaurants and retail right now.""
International comparable sales in the second quarter fell 31%. More than 75% of company-run locations were closed in Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom.
Even so, Starbucks is on track to open at least 500 net new locations in fiscal 2020, after deferring up to 100 new store openings to next fiscal year.

The coffee chain also said it grew its Rewards loyalty program by 15% year-over-year in the quarter, to 19.4 million active members.

1618,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Shale producer Oasis Petroleum to halt drilling in Bakken - sources,"By Devika Krishna Kumar
NEW YORK (Reuters) -  Oasis Petroleum  (NASDAQ:OAS) Inc has begun to wind down all drilling in the Bakken, three sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, as production cuts intensify across the United States the aftermath of a historic plunge in crude oil prices.
The company has asked its frac crews in the region to take time off, known as a frac holiday, and will completely halt all drilling activity within weeks, two sources said. 
Oasis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
U.S. crude prices collapsed into negative territory for the first time in history last week - meaning sellers had to pay people to take oil - with storage space quickly filling up as the coronavirus pandemic sent global oil demand crashing by about 30%. 
Oil producers across the country have scrambled to slash output and shut-ins have been particularly swift in North Dakota, which produced more than 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in 2019. 
Large operators including Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) Inc, the largest oil producer in North Dakota, have halted production in the U.S. state and notified some customers it would not supply crude after prices dived into negative territory last week.
Oasis planned to operate about 4 rigs throughout the year, with 2 in Williston basin, which is partly in North Dakota, and 2 in the Delaware in the Permian basin, the company said during the latest earnings call with analysts in late February. 
North Dakota regulators plan on May 20 to consider whether oil production at low prices represents a waste of resources, according to a notice published by the North Dakota Industrial Commission.
U.S. shale producers came into the crisis with already high debt levels and more companies are expected to seek bankruptcy protection in coming weeks, industry and banking sources have said.
Oasis had long-term debt of about $2.7 billion at the end of 2019, according to its latest earnings statement.
""While Oasis' cash flow deteriorates due to low commodity prices, the company will also face increasing debt refinancing risk,"" Amol Joshi, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) Vice President and Senior Credit Officer said in a note this month. The ratings agency downgraded its rating on Oasis and changed its rating outlook to negative from stable.

1619,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Fitch cuts Italy's credit rating to 'BBB-minus' with stable outlook,"(Reuters) - Rating agency Fitch cut Italy's credit rating to ""BBB-minus"" on Tuesday, just one notch above junk, saying the downgrade reflects the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the euro zone's third largest economy.
Fitch had not been due to review Italy's rating until July and the shock move is another blow to a country that has the world's second highest death toll from the virus and a chronically sluggish economy now heading into steep recession.
Fitch changed Italy's outlook to stable from negative, saying that it sees the European Central Bank's net asset purchases helping Italy's fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic. (https:// On Feb. 7, two weeks before Italy's first COVID-19 cases emerged, Fitch had affirmed its rating and outlook. The agency forecast that the Italian economy will contract by 8% this year, which is in line with the government's own projection made last week, and said Italy's public debt will climb to 156% of gross domestic product from 134.8% last year. That is broadly in line with the 155.7% forecast of the government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party. ""According to our baseline debt dynamics scenario, the debt to GDP ratio will only stabilise at this very high level over the medium term, underlining debt sustainability risks,"" the agency said. It said the country's banking sector has also deteriorated after the COVID-19 shock, relative to Fitch's previous expectations of a stabilisation in performance and further asset quality improvement in 2020.  Italian Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri said Fitch had failed to take account of important decisions taken by the European Union and the European Central Bank to support the economies of the euro zone and its members. ""The fundamentals of Italy's economy and public finances are solid,"" Gualtieri said in a statement. On Friday fellow ratings agency Standard & Poor's confirmed its rating and outlook on Italy.

Several U.S. companies began refusing government loans they were just awarded, after the Treasury Department said that publicly traded firms would have a hard time proving they really needed the coronavirus relief funds.
This follows public backlash after some large well-funded companies were granted millions of dollars from the fund, while many small businesses were unable to access any funding at all.
Restaurant operators  Shake Shack Inc  (N:SHAK) and  Kura Sushi USA Inc  (O:KRUS) were among the companies that returned loans from an initial tranche of the program.
""Although Covid-19 continues to create substantial uncertainty and hardship throughout the world, we repaid our loan as a result of new guidelines from the Small Business Administration,"" Escalade Chief Executive Officer Scott Sincerbeaux said in a statement.
The loan, provided under the Paycheck Protection Program, is designed to support businesses having no more than 500 employees to cover their employee payroll and rent, as large swaths of the economy have been shut down to keep the coronavirus from spreading.

1622,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 05:17PM ET</span>",Day Ahead: Top 3 Things to Watch for April 29,"By Kim Khan
Investing.com - Stocks found direction hard to come by and ended the day in the red after a volatile session today.
Major earnings were mixed after the bell, much like ahead of trading.
Tomorrow morning trading could be subdued until the Federal Reserve decision and subsequent press conference.
But before the bell there will be first-quarter GDP numbers for investors to digest. And the earnings assembly line keeps going.
Here are three things that could move the markets tomorrow.
1. Fed Outlook in the Spotlight
The Federal Open Market Committee will release its April statement tomorrow at 2:00 PM ET (18:00 GMT).
No change in rates is expected, so attention will be focused on any guidance the Fed has about the trajectory of the economy.
Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference at 2:30 PM ET will also be closely watched.
“As Chair Powell has stated several times, the economic outlook and the policy path will be determined by the virus,” John Velis, FX and Macro Strategist for the Americas at BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK), wrote in a research note. “Nevertheless we will be expecting some estimates of the amount of economic damage and possible paths of recovery from the FOMC on Wednesday.”
“In addition to some idea regarding the economic outlook, we don't expect the Fed to announce new policy measures, and that includes the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER),” Velis said. “This key rate represents the opportunity cost to banks' borrowing in the Federal Funds Market, and raising it would tend to pull the Federal Funds Rate higher.”
2. GDP Arrives With Expansion Expected to End
Along with the Fed, investors will get their first look at the number on economic growth for the first three months of the year. The numbers capture the tail end of the lockdown of the U.S. economy.
The Commerce Department will reports the advance measure of first-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) at 8:30 AM ET (12:30 GMT).
Economists expect that GDP contracted at an annual rate of 4%, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com.
That would be the biggest contraction since 2009 during the Financial Crisis, which saw contractions of more than 6%. The big damage is expected to be seen in the second quarter, where all but essential services are halted. The economy could contract as much as 65%, according to the most pessimistic estimate, Bloomberg reported.
3. Tesla, Facebook, Microsoft to Report
Among the raft of earnings reports coming tomorrow will be Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), which issues numbers after the close of trading.
Last week Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC) downgraded the stock to underperform from neutral on valuation. Shares are up more than 80% year to date.
“As the macro backdrop has deteriorated so rapidly/severely with the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines and business shutdowns implemented, along with what we expect to be a tepid U-shaped recovery as economies are reopened … we are once again cutting our global volume forecast,” analyst John Murphy wrote, according to Briefing.com.
Analysts predict a loss of 25 cents per share on revenue of about $6.2 billion, according to forecasts compiled by Investing.com
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will also report postmarket.
The social media giant is seen posting a profit of $1.75 per share and revenue of about $17.4 billion.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) will also be issuing quarterly results.
On average, analysts are looking for earnings of $1.29 per share on revenue of about $34 billion.
 General Electric  (NYSE:GE) will report before the bell tomorrow."

1625,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 04:54PM ET</span>",‘Game-Changing’ Stimulus Is Starting to Lift Even the Worst-Hit Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- Areas of the market shunned during the coronavirus crash are suddenly finding their mojo again.
Small-caps, cheap stocks and cyclical plays are all on firmer footing this week, ignoring the dire economic and earnings data that’s only getting worse in the background. Their strength has pushed the market to another milestone: More than half the S&P 500’s members are trading above their 50-day moving average for the first time since late February, a swift rebound from the low single-digits just a month ago.
The S&P 500 is in the midst of an astonishing run, with stocks posting one of the fastest recoveries on record over the past few weeks. Partly, it’s a response to improving coronavirus trends and the loosening of shelter-in-place decrees. To others, though, it’s a continued reaction to the unprecedented fiscal and monetary measures that are helping thrust equities higher despite deteriorating data and severe dysfunction in the commodities markets.
“Asset prices aren’t just reacting to economic recovery -- they’re more willing to react to stimulus measures,” said Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist at INTL FCStone. “And you have a flood of stimulus in this market.”
The Federal Reserve and Congress have announced a deluge of measures aimed at shoring up the U.S. economy and easing dislocations in credit markets. The alphabet soup of facilities set up to buy troubled assets or loan to cash-strapped companies seemingly grows by the week. On Monday, for instance, the central bank expanded its municipal-debt program to cover smaller cities and counties. More is likely to come from Congress, too, as legislators start to work on the next phase of aid.
The Fed’s balance sheet has already ballooned to a record $6.57 trillion as the central bank continues its robust purchases. It could reach as much as $12 trillion and top 50% of gross domestic product by the end of the year, according to Bloomberg Economics. The balance sheet troughed at 18% of GDP in 2019.
To Tony Dwyer at Canaccord Genuity, the Fed’s actions have been “game-changing.” When the central bank announced a fresh stimulus package in early April, he and his team took the worst-case scenario off the table.
“It wasn’t the amount of money that was important (although that is incredible), it was the fact that as soon as the Fed saw an area of stress, it attacked it with an incredible amount of money,” Dwyer wrote in a note. “It is clear the Fed and Congress are just going to keep providing money until it works.”
Though consumer confidence and retail sentiment have fallen sharply in recent weeks, some readings are still above the record lows reached during the 2008-2009 and 1990 crises and may not drop to those same levels again, according to Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS).
“With the stimulus so large and directed right at the consumer and small businesses, we may be surprised at how well the consumer fares in what is amounting to the steepest decline in economic activity in history,” he wrote in a recent note.
Earlier: Nothing Is Certain But Bailouts: How Stimulus Works in a Vacuum
All that largess continues to push up stocks, which have already retraced about half their virus-induced losses. While the advance was for a while confined to a handful of defensive names and the mega-cap tech firms that led the bulk of the recovery, the makeup of those benefiting has started to shift in recent days. Small-cap stocks bested their larger peers for the second day Tuesday, with the gap between the two at its widest in about a decade.
It’s also meant a changing of the guard among market leaders.
More economically-sensitive S&P 500 sectors, including financials, materials and industrials are among the leaders this week. And the equal-weighted version of the gauge rose as much as 2.8% Tuesday while the market-cap weighted index declined. Some of the largest tech stocks, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc.,  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). are lagging this week, with the latter two among the biggest drags on the S&P 500 Tuesday.
Of course, not everyone is convinced that the recent rally is justified.
To Jason Thomas, chief economist at AssetMark, stocks have become overly optimistic. “The economic policy is winning the battle for the hearts and minds of the market but not the arms and legs of the economy,” he said in an interview. “That’s what I think is the disconnect.”

""Booking.com B.V. has led unfair business practices by misleading advertisements claiming free cancellation for some accommodation as well as by exerting aggressive psychological pressure to facilitate faster bookings,"" the GVH said.

""Everything on our website, including how we display prices and payment policies as well as the availability and popularity of specific properties, among other features relevant to the customer booking experience, is intended to help customers,"" the representative said. 
The Hungarian watchdog said the free cancellation option was available only for a limited scope of bookings and customers were also charged a premium for the option as Booking.com had built it into accommodation prices.

1636,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",Toilet paper trophy hunters on a roll as U.S. shortages start easing,"By Martinne Geller and Lisa Baertlein
LONDON/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. consumers have begun spotting rare Quilted Northern (NASDAQ:NTRS) and Charmin toilet paper rolls on store shelves across the United States, as stocks start building after weeks of severe shortages.
Shoppers who bagged the coveted rolls are crowing on Twitter about their finds. ""Found some toilet paper in the wild! Driving it home now,"" tweeted @TransForYang on April 23. ""This is as close as I'll ever come to knowing what it feels like driving one of those armored money trucks."" 
Empty shelves were still a problem at nearly half of American grocery stores as of mid-April, but supplies were markedly more plentiful than they had been during the prior week, according to the consumer products data tracker NCSolutions.
About 48 percent of U.S. grocery stores were out of stock of toilet paper for some part of the day on April 19, the latest date for which figures were available. In comparison, out-of-stock shelves were prevalent at 73 percent of U.S. grocery stores one week earlier, on April 12, according to the data, provided exclusively to Reuters. 
Demand for toilet paper is still up 27 percent from pre-Covid-19 levels, NCSolutions said. 
The average U.S. household - 2.6 people - uses about 409 rolls a year, according to Georgia Pacific, maker of Angel Soft and Quilted Northern. It estimated that staying at home 24/7 would boost that by 40 percent, and that a two-person household would use nine double rolls in about two weeks. 
(Graphic: Percentage of U.S. grocery stores out of stock of toilet paper link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/qzjvqkkmmvx/NCS%20Toilet%20Paper%20Stockout%20Chart.png) 
Toilet paper is not the only essential item shoppers stocked up on after states started locking down businesses to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus in mid-March. The large size of toilet paper packages versus other staples such as pasta, soap and canned goods means that retail stores rarely keep much in stock, and so are quicker to run out.
In Europe, the shortages at retail stores may be less dire due partly to the fact that some production is done closer to retailers. 
""Normally there are fewer and larger factories in the U.S.,"" said Magnus Groth, chief executive of Europe's biggest toilet paper maker, Essity (ST:ESSITYa). Groth said Essity, which in the United States sells tissue products to businesses only, met a spike in European demand by boosting production, selling down inventory and securing extra transport capacity.
The U.S. retail market for toilet paper was worth $9.7 billion last year, according to Euromonitor International.
Procter & Gamble (N:PG) dominates with about a 29% share, followed by Kimberly-Clark (N:KMB), maker of Cottonelle and Scott, and privately held Koch Industries-owned Georgia Pacific.
(Graphic: Bath Tissue sales growth since the start of this year link: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/ygdvzyyerpw/Dollar%20sales%20growth%20of%20Bath%20Tissue.png) 
For Charmin maker Procter & Gamble, March and April will berecord production months, said Rick McLeod, its vice presidentof global family care product supply. 
The company's six U.S. plants are running 24/7, focusing on the most popular products. P&G's plants manufacture massive ""parent"" rolls of toilet paper and then convert them to small rolls for home use. The parent rolls, which are a standard in the industry, measure more than eight feet in diameter and weigh about a ton. 
""Our data says that in-stock levels are improving but notwhere we want them to be certainly,"" McLeod said. 
Georgia Pacific is now making 1.5 million more roles perday, and is trying to maximize the number of deliveries it canship. Its mills and regional distribution centers have shippedabout 120 percent of normal capacity, while a shift to directshipments where possible has reduced shipping time to retailersby up to three days, a spokesman said.
Store checks last week showed toilet paper was approachingnormal stock levels after being ""deeply deficient for over 50days,"" said Burt Flickinger, managing director of consulting firm Strategic Resource Group, adding that it was the first week his firm saw adequate levels of shelf stock.

Alphabet rose more than 2% in after-hours trade.
Alphabet A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced earnings per share of $9.87 on revenue of $41.16 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated EPS of $10.71 on revenue of $40.99 billion. That compared with EPS of $9.50 on revenue of $36.34 billion in the same period a year before. Alphabet had reported EPS of $15.35 on revenue of $46.08 billion in the previous quarter.
The company’s core advertising business grew 10.4% to $33.8 billion, slower than the 16% growth from last year’s fourth quarter.
YouTube ads generated $4.038 billion in revenue in the first quarter, compared with $3.025 billion a year earlier.
""Performance was strong during the first two months of the quarter, but then in March we experienced a significant slowdown in ad revenues,"" said Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet and Google.
Total acquisition costs rose to $7.452 billion from $6.860 billion a year earlier.
""Alphabet’s beat on sales shows that while ad revenues are under pressure, other parts of the business, led by the cloud computing segment, are helping to mitigate the negative impact coming from the Covid-19 pandemic,"" Investing.com analyst Haris Anwar said.

1638,By Investing.com,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 04:01PM ET</span>",Stocks - Dow Ends Lower in Volatile Trade With Big-Tech Earnings Eyed,"By Yasin Ebrahim 
Investing.com – The Dow swung between losses and gains to end Tuesday in negative territory as investors weighed up mixed earnings and further signs of weakness in the economy as consumer confidence plunged.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.13%, or about 32 points, but had gained as many as 378 points at session highs. The S&P 500 fell about 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.4%.
The earnings season continued to serve up mixed earnings and reflect the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on quarterly performance.
Merck (NYSE:MRK) fell after the drugmaker pulled its guidance and warned of a $2.1 billion hit to full-year sales from the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed about 57,000 nationwide and infected more than 1 million.
The gloomy outlook offset quarterly results that beat on the top and bottom lines.
In industrials,  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) missed consensus estimates following a coronavirus-led impact to construction and mining demand. 3M (NYSE:MMM), meanwhile, said its earnings received a boost from a coronavirus-led jump in demand in personal safety equipment sales.
The mixed backdrop of earnings arrived ahead of a big week for large-cap tech stocks, with the majority of FAANG names set to report this week.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which reports after the close today, slipped about 3%, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), all of which report over the coming days, were all lower.
Retailers, meanwhile, caught a bid despite signs of weakness in the consumer, as investors seemingly bet the worst of the pandemic may be over as the U.S. gets its partial economic restart underway.
JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) rallied 13%, L Brands (NYSE:LB) and Gap (NYSE:GPS) were up about 10%.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge fell to 86.9 this month.
Energy, meanwhile, rose more than 2% as oil prices cut some of their losses to settle down 3.4% as crude capacity constraints persist ahead of weekly data expected to show another large build in inventories."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Boeing Co 's (N:BA) grounded 737 MAX jet is expected to remain grounded until at least August as the manufacturer continues to grapple with software issues, people briefed on the matter told Reuters.
The largest planemaker has signaled it now hopes to win regulatory approval in August for the plane's return to service, but that could be pushed backed until fall, the sources said, as timing for meeting milestones is uncertain.
The best-selling airplane has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. Boeing halted production in January and has 400 undelivered MAX planes in storage.
Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV), the largest operator of 737 MAX airplanes worldwide, said Tuesday it was removing the MAX from its schedule through Oct. 30 based on Boeing's ""recent communication on the MAX return to service date.""
Last week, Reuters reported that a key certification test flight had been delayed until late May at the earliest and reported in early April the company was dealing with two new software issues.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has repeatedly said it has no timetable for approving the plane's return to the skies.
Boeing declined to comment ahead of its earnings release Wednesday. On Monday, Chief Executive Officer Dave Calhoun during the company's annual meeting did not repeat prior guidance that Boeing anticipated the plane would win approval for a return to service in mid-2020.
""We remain confident in the MAX,” Calhoun said.
Boeing said on April 7 it needed to make two new software updates to the 737 MAX’s flight control computer.
One issue involves hypothetical faults in the flight control microprocessor, which could potentially lead to a loss of control known as a runaway stabilizer. The other issue could lead to disengagement of the autopilot feature during final approach.
Boeing said on April 7 it was working with Raytheon Technologies Corp (N:RTX) unit Collins Aerospace Systems on the software updates, but it remained unclear when Collins will complete work and how long it will take U.S. and other regulators to validate the fixes as they complete a software documentation audit.
Last month, Boeing decided to separate 737 MAX wiring bundles that regulators had flagged as potentially dangerous, Reuters reported. 
In February, Boeing said it would need a software update to address a 737 MAX indicator light issue. In January it disclosed a separate software issue relating to a power-up monitoring function. 
Boeing is also inspecting 737 MAX airplanes after it discovered foreign object debris in undelivered airplanes in February.

The Wall Street Journal had reported the 737 MAX return to service timetable.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), JetBlue Airways Corp (O:JBLU) and  Spirit Airlines  (N:SAVE) on Tuesday asked the U.S. Transportation Department for approval to suspend flights to more than two dozen U.S. airports.
U.S. travel demand has fallen by more than 95% because of the coronavirus pandemic and airports are trying to cut costs to stay in business.
JetBlue wants to halt flights to 16 U.S. airports, including Chicago, Atlanta, Houston, Seattle, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, Dallas and Detroit through Sept. 30.
Delta wants to suspend flights to nine airports: Lansing, Flint and Kalamazoo in Michigan, and Worcester, Massachusetts, Hilton Head, South Carolina, Pocatello, Idaho, Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia, and Melbourne, Florida. Delta argues passengers could still use other nearby airports like Grand Rapids or Detroit in Michigan.
Delta says between April 1-April 22, just 1 to 14 passengers daily flew on the airline's planes each way from those 9 airports.
Spirit Airlines Inc (N:SAVE) asked the department for approval to suspend flights to Charlotte, North Carolina, Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Seattle, Portland and Phoenix, arguing requiring the flights ""during a period of almost zero demand is against the public interest as it wastes scarce financial resources while adding virtually nothing.""
The airlines must maintain minimum service levels in exchange for getting cash grants from the U.S. Treasury to assist in payroll costs unless the department issues a waiver.
JetBlue said it ""fully intends to gradually resume service to the levels prescribed (by the Transportation Department) at each of these airports as soon as it is both safe to do so and when even the slightest customer demand re-emerges.""
Earlier this month, the department rejected most of Spirit's requests to halt flights and said Spirit had to resume flights to the New York City area and to other tri-state airports after it suspended service to all New York, New Jersey and Connecticut airports it serves.
The department earlier also required JetBlue to keep flying to nine destinations, including Portland, Dallas, Houston and Minneapolis. 
On Monday, the department said it rejected most requests by United Airlines (O:UAL) and Frontier Airlines to suspend some flights.
United had sought to suspend flights to more than a dozen airports including Santa Fe, New Mexico, Green Bay, Wisconsin and Kalamazoo, Michigan.
Frontier asked approval to suspend service to 33 U.S. airports through June 10 and the department approved just three requests for service to Detroit, Charlotte and the Boston area.
United and Frontier declined to comment.
The department also said it had approved Cape Air's request to halt flights to New York, but said it was requiring it to maintain flights to three other smaller airports.

The department has also approved numerous airlines' requests to temporary halt flights to Hawaiian airports. On Monday, the state extended a mandatory 14-day quarantine for visitors through May 31.

The province, which accounts for more than half of Canada’s deaths from Covid-19, is letting stores outside of Quebec’s biggest city resume business on May 4 -- as long as they have a street entrance, because enclosed shopping centers remain closed. Retailers in Montreal and its suburbs, along with all of the province’s manufacturers, will be allowed to open a week later, the government said Tuesday.
“Our challenge is to gradually restart the economy without restarting the pandemic,” Premier (NASDAQ:PINC) Francois Legault said during a press conference. The government will “analyze the effect” on the outbreak as workers return, he said.
The plan to reopen comes even with the daily death rate still in the dozens, reflecting what Legault describes as “two worlds.” The vast majority of the deceased are seniors living in long-term care facilities, where the virus has spread rapidly. Outside of those, the situation appears under control and lockdown measures are bearing fruit.
Legault’s approach contrasts with that of Ontario Premier Doug Ford, who said Monday the phased reopening of Canada’s biggest province will last for many weeks, but refused to set firm dates.
Quebec manufacturers will need to limit the number of employees for the first two weeks, Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said, adding that detailed protocol manuals will be shared with employers. The construction sector, which is already partially authorized to work, will completely reopen on May 11 to include infrastructure.
About 1.2 million Quebeckers out of a population of 8.5 million had to temporarily stop work, Fitzgibbon said. Quebec’s unemployment rate jumped from 4.5% in February to 8.1% in March.

WASHINGTON(Reuters) - The U.S. Navy has paid defense contractors $600 million it had previously withheld due to poor workmanship, hoping the funds would shore up finances for suppliers ravaged by the coronavirus-driven economic downturn, a Navy official said on Tuesday.
The move, which follows a similar action taken by the Air Force that unleashed billions of dollars in payments, is aimed at replacing revenues vital Pentagon suppliers have lost in their non-military businesses as the spreading coronavirus has halted business activity nationwide.
""We were immediately able to infuse about $600 million of funds that we had on withholds,"" James Geurts, the assistant secretary of the Navy for research, development and acquisition, told reporters on a conference call. 
The Department of Defense has also accelerated contract awards as it leverages its portion of the more than $700 billion annual defense budget to help keep suppliers afloat.
Earlier this month, Geurts said he had authorized ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars through top suppliers like General Dynamics (N:GD) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (N:HII) but it was unclear if he meant money withhold for contract disputes or sped up contract payments.
While the Navy did not name any companies that received payments, industry sources have said the biggest contractors have been filtering recent coronavirus-related funds down to their suppliers and subcontractors who, because of their smaller size, are on much shakier financial footing.
Government waste watchdogs criticized the move.
""This current emergency shouldn't be an excuse to avoid accountability for poor performance that predated this outbreak,"" said Mandy Smithberger at the Project On Government Oversight in Washington.
The Navy's multi-layered supply chain is comprised of highly skilled workers building out President Donald Trump's vision for a 350 ship https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-shipbuilding-insight/missing-from-trumps-grand-navy-plan-skilled-workers-to-build-the-fleet-idUSKBN16O142 Navy. The funding will help pay salaries and ensure hard-to-replace workers are not lost to other industries or early retirement.
Geurts has said the Navy is pushing money into the defense industrial base by speeding up contract payments, hastening contract awards and releasing funds withheld for poor past performance. 
The U.S. Air Force said it would release $882 million in payments to Boeing (NYSE:BA) that were held back due to flaws in the KC-46 air refueling tanker.

MOSCOW (Reuters) -  Yandex .Taxi, the ride-hailing arm of Russian internet giant Yandex (O:YNDX), is hoping to remain profitable in the second half of this year despite a sharp drop in sales as coronavirus restrictions keep people across the country at home. 
Yandex.Taxi, part of Yandex's taxi segment, which also includes its driverless cars and food delivery service, brought the company almost 25% of its first-quarter revenue, with adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) returning a profit for the fourth consecutive quarter, company results showed on Tuesday.
Yandex was preparing for a initial public offering (IPO) of its taxi segment in the first half of 2020, three banking sources told Reuters in November, and had already hired three investment banks for the purpose, but the coronavirus outbreak has put market events on hold.
President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday extended a non-working period across the country until May 11 to curb the spread of the coronavirus, leaving many business operating under distance working regimes and citizens asked to avoid large gatherings, thereby reducing the number of journeys made by taxi.
Since the start of April, Yandex.Taxi's gross merchandise volume (GMV) in Moscow has dropped by 60% compared with the same period last year, and by 70% in year-on-year terms since the beginning of March, said Daniil Shuleiko, general director of Yandex.Taxi, during a conference call.
""We started seeing a slowdown in the second part of March due to fears of the spread of COVID-19,"" he said. ""As a result, if in early March we were seeing almost 5 million rides per day, towards the end of March this number decreased significantly."" 
According to Yandex forecasts, if GMV in the second quarter falls by 60%, the company will record negative EBITDA, but a fall of 40% would see the company break even.
""I do not have an exact forecast, but we expect some recovery in the third and fourth quarters ... If we compare the second half of 2020 with the first half, we expect that the taxi service will be profitable,"" said Evgeniy Senderov, Yandex.Taxi's finance director. 
Yandex.Taxi, in which Uber (N:UBER) has 36.6% stake, still has a $390 million buffer working in its favour, in cash, cash equivalents and term deposits. 

""We are in good shape to get through the current situation, we have strong balance sheet,"" he added.

Investing.com – The Dow erased some of its gains on Tuesday, paced by a decline in health care and tech stocks as investors weighed up the earnings from corporates against efforts to reopen the economy.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.48%, or 112 points, but had gained as many as 378 points at session highs. The S&P 500 added 0.33%, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.40%.
With the majority of FAANG names set to report this week, investors piled out of large-cap tech stocks, forcing the broader market to cut its gains.
Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which reports after the close today, slipped 1.9%, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which reports quarterly results tomorrow, fell 1.5%, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), both of which report results Thursday, fell 1.7% and 0.7% respectively.
On the earnings front, corporates delivered mixed results.
Drug maker Merck (NYSE:MRK) fell 3% to pressure the broader health-care sector after pulling its guidance for the year and warning that most of the negative impact from Covid-19 will be seen in the second quarter. But the company did beat earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter.
In industrials, investors had to contend with mixed earnings as 3M beat estimates, but  Caterpillar  missed.
Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) rose 0.5% despite missing expectations on both the top and bottom lines following a coronavirus-led impact to construction and mining demand.
3M (NYSE:MMM) reported better-than-expected revenue as higher demand in personal safety equipment sales boosted performance, sending its share price more than 2.5% higher.
Elsewhere, retailers caught a bid even as economic data flagged weakness in the consumer, the backbone of the economy.
The Conference Board’s consumer confidence gauge fell to 86.9 this month.
But JC Penney (NYSE:JCP), L Brands (NYSE:LB) and Gap (NYSE:GPS) were up more than 8%.
Financials, meanwhile, continued to build on their positive start to the week, amid growing hopes the reopening of the U.S. will kickstart economic activity and the labor market, which could potentially result in fewer borrowers defaulting on their debt."
1647,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 02:36PM ET</span>",Federal Reserve Buying Begets Strange Days for Mortgage Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve’s unprecedented pace of mortgage buying is causing some unusual changes in the sector -- such as UMBS 30-year 3% and 3.5% coupons trading at the same price.
Since they have different duration profiles -- and different levels of risk -- the 3.5% historically trades at a price above the 3%. On March 16, the Federal Reserve started buying agency MBS again at the fastest pace in its history, with a concentration on the lower-coupon mortgage bonds. Thus, the equalization of the two coupons’ prices.
“It’s all the Fed, they have created some anomalies and dislocations in the coupon stack,” Kevin Jackson, a managing director on the mortgage trading desk at  Wells Fargo  (NYSE:WFC) & Co. said in an interview.
Since this latest round of QE began, the Fed has purchased just under $568 billion in agency MBS, with the UMBS 3% and 3.5% coupons making up 24% and 11%, respectively, of that total, according to data from the New York Fed.
Over the past six trading sessions, the Fed has leaned even more into the lower coupons, with the 3% and 3.5% coupons making up 38% and 6% of total purchases, respectively.
“Technically, the Fed has created such a strong bid for the 3 percent coupon that the fundamentals are basically irrelevant,” Jackson said.
This tsunami of buying have had an effect on prices. The 3% and 3.5% coupons have rocketed to 105-12+/32 from 101-24+/32 and 102-29/32 on March 13, respectively, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Yet, while the 3% has risen from 104-19+/32 since March 24, the 3.5% hit its high of 105-12+/32 on that day, and has moved sideways ever since. “There is a natural ceiling to MBS prices,” said Walt Schmidt, head of mortgage strategies at FHN Financial in Chicago.
This focus on the lower coupons by the Fed is understandable. During the 1Q, the 3% coupon saw net issuance of $104 billion while the 3.5% saw a net reduction of $38 billion, according to Wells Fargo data.

International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG), which also owns Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, reported a first-quarter operating loss before exceptional items of 535 million euros ($580 million), compared with a profit of 135 million a year ago.
Revenue dropped 13% to 4.6 billion euros. IAG said it expected its losses to be significantly worse in the second quarter, when it is hit by the full extent of travel lockdowns imposed during the pandemic.
In a statement it outlined plans for a sweeping restructuring at BA.
""The proposals remain subject to consultation but it is likely that they will affect most of British Airways' employees and may result in the redundancy of up to 12,000 of them,"" the group said. BA has 45,000 employees, including 16,500 cabin crew and 3,900 pilots, according to its website.
BA Chief Executive Alex Cruz told staff the airline was taking every possible action to conserve cash to weather the storm in the short term, including renegotiating contracts and looking at options for its fleet, but it would not be enough.
""In the last few weeks, the outlook for the aviation industry has worsened further and we must take action now,"" he said in a letter to staff seen by Reuters.
""There  is no government bailout standing by for BA and we cannot expect the taxpayer to offset salaries indefinitely. Any money we borrow now will only be short-term and will not address the longer-term challenges we will face.""
The pilots union BALPA said staff were devastated.
""This has come as a bolt out of the blue from an airline that said it was wealthy enough to weather the COVID storm and declined any Government support,"" BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said.
""BALPA does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every single one.""
BA had used Britian's COVID-19 jobs retention scheme to furlough 22,626 employees earlier this month. Under the scheme, the government takes on part of the cost of retaining staff who remain on the payroll while being sent home during the crisis.
Echoing comments from rivals such as Lufthansa (DE:LHAG), IAG said it would take several years for passenger demand to return to 2019 levels.
Operating losses in the second quarter would be significantly worse than in the first given the decline in passenger capacity and traffic, despite some relief from government job retention and wage support schemes, it said. It did not give 2020 profit guidance.
It said it had taken an exceptional charge of 1.3 billion euros at the end of the quarter on over-hedging on fuel and foreign currency for the rest of the year.
The measures come after IAG boss, Willie Walsh, a dealmaker who made his name standing up to unions and cutting costs, last month put off plans to retire to deal with the industry's worst crisis.
Highlighting the speed of the damage as governments imposed lockdowns to contain the pandemic, IAG said all the decline in operating profit in the first quarter came in March.

1649,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",South African state airline SA Express faces liquidation,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A South African court placed state-owned SA Express (NYSE:EXPR) under ""provisional liquidation"" on Tuesday after the airline's administrators said rescue efforts weren't likely to succeed.
SA Express, which flies to domestic and regional destinations, entered a form of bankruptcy protection earlier this year after losing a court battle with a contractor, logistics firm Ziegler.
It later suspended all operations as the global COVID-19 pandemic caused demand for flights to plunge and governments to impose travel restrictions.
The ruling in the Johannesburg High Court means affected parties can still give reasons why the airline shouldn't be liquidated before a final order is made.
Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said in a statement: ""Government is reviewing its options in all airline assets.""
SA Express is a separate business to much larger state airline South African Airways, which is also under bankruptcy protection and fighting for its survival.
The pair have been a major drain on public resources in recent years, absorbing billions of rands of bailouts.
The public enterprises ministry said last month that the financial woes of SA Express were rooted in corruption and mismanagement under previous executives.
It rejected an initial request for funding from the airline's business rescue team because it lacked a credible business case, it said. The rescue team did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.

1653,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",U.S. Labor-Market Mystery: Applicants for Government Jobs Vanish,"(Bloomberg) -- For every job Kelly Hardwick has posted since March, there seem to be fewer and fewer applicants.
“That has been real surprising to me,” said Mississippi’s top government-hiring manager. “Generally what happens is that the number of applications go up as unemployment rises.”
The phenomenon is occurring across America. Neogov -- which runs governmentjobs.com, the largest government hiring website in the country -- said April applications plunged 54%, to 339,240 in the first part of the month compared with 735,756 a year earlier, even though the number of jobs available fell only about 13%.
The data so befuddled Neogov Chief Executive Officer Shane Evangelist that he commissioned a study. At a time of record unemployment claims, he couldn’t understand why people weren’t seeking work.
After surveying about 8,000 people with profiles on the website, Evangelist said the best answer he could come up with was: Coronavirus is changing the calculus.
“It looks just like people aren’t coming; they’ve stopped searching for jobs,” he said. “And what they’re saying is that they don’t believe jobs are available.”
The out-of-work are so troubled by headlines about the weakening economy and looming state-budget deficits, they’ve stopped going after openings that do exist. Almost 95% of people Neogov surveyed said they are looking for a new job, and about half said their employment status changed because of the coronavirus. But 40% said they’d recently slowed down or stopped their search, with most citing the fact that organizations aren’t hiring.
That’s worrying government managers, because it’s not true. Their average employee tends to be older than average private-sector workers, according to Evangelist. He said there’s a “silver tsunami,” with older people retiring faster than new workers can fill their spots. So even though budget cutbacks have affected some roles, states and cities still are hiring.
Hardwick’s counterpart in Nebraska, Jason Jackson, has been struggling, too. The number of job seekers there has been falling for weeks, and he had to ask the labor department to advertise openings to people filing for unemployment benefits. That’s a first for the state as far as he knows.
Nebraska and Mississippi are emphasizing that public positions are relatively secure from economic downturns. Neither has had any layoffs related to the economic effect of the coronavirus.
Prison Jobs
Hardwick said he’s especially having problems filling positions in corrections and direct care; he suspects applicants are worried they’ll get the Covid-19 disease in these jobs. Jackson said he hasn’t had as much difficulty with roles at prisons, but that’s partly because some people are told directly about available government roles in Nebraska when they seek unemployment benefits. The state received 80 applicants through that method the first week it was used, he said.
The second most-popular reason respondents in the Neogov survey curbed a job search was fear of in-person interviews. About 18% strongly agree they don’t want to participate in a face-to-face process. Another 14% said they couldn’t apply now because they had more pressing concerns. Fewer than 3% said the security of receiving the stimulus check had made a difference.

There’s some reason to believe applications will rebound when social-distancing measures are relaxed. More than 40% of those surveyed said they’d start applying again when the strictest rules are lifted. And once they do, job seekers may have new priorities. Typically, Neogov data show salary is the No. 1 concern, according to Evangelist. That’s now been replaced by “stability.”

1655,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>",Southwest cuts Boeing jet deliveries after first quarterly loss in nine years,"By Tracy Rucinski
(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (N:LUV) said on Tuesday it has agreed with  Boeing Co  (N:BA) to sharply cut its 737 MAX delivery schedule through 2021 and is reviewing its order book as the coronavirus pandemic caused its first quarterly loss in nine years.
Southwest, which only operates Boeing 737s and is the world's largest customer of the grounded 737 MAX, will take no more than 48 new 737 MAX jets before Dec. 2021, a fraction of the 123 it had originally scheduled.
However, it has no current plans to cancel orders, Chief Financial Officer Tammy Romo said on a conference call, noting that a more fuel-efficient fleet ""is still relevant and meaningful"" even given current low oil prices and demand.
Just months ago, airlines including Southwest were cancelling flights and delaying growth plans and aircraft retirements because the 737 MAX grounding left them without enough planes. 
Dallas-based Southwest has removed its 34 MAX planes from its fleet until Oct. 30 as the aircraft awaits regulatory approval to fly again following two fatal crashes.
As passenger demand has neared zero due to the COVID-19 crisis, airlines are parking hundreds of jets, accelerating aircraft retirement plans and deferring jet deliveries as the industry braces for a slow recovery.
Both Boeing and European planemaker Airbus SE (PA:AIR) are due to publish quarterly results on Wednesday.
Southwest swung to a $94-million net loss in the first quarter from a $387 million profit a year earlier, and warned that operating revenues would fall by 90-95% in both April and May, when it does not expect load factors to surpass 10%.
Total operating revenue fell 17.8% to $4.2 billion in the quarter. 
While the airline has more bookings for June and July - albeit in a drastically reduced flight schedule - it said it cannot reasonably estimate any revenue trends beyond May.
""We have no idea what kind of cancellations will come through before those travel dates; there's no way to be comfortable with what will happen to those reservations,"" Southwest CEO Gary Kelly told Reuters. 
Facing unprecedented flight cancellations, airlines are scrambling to preserve and raise cash.
Southwest had $9.3 billion in cash on hand as of April 24, with leverage of 47%. 
On Tuesday it announced an additional capital raise including a public stock offering of 55 million shares, worth around $1.6 billion at Monday’s closing price of $29.11, and $1 billion worth of convertible debt.
Shares rose 1.6% to $29.57. 
Southwest's average daily cash burn will slow to between $30 million and $35 million in the second quarter, it said.
The airline is receiving about $3.3 billion in government payroll support and is considering tapping an additional $2.8 billion in secured government loans under the stimulus package known as the CARES Act.
The coronavirus outbreak has led to the deaths of more than 207,000 people, including more than 55,000 in the United States, a Reuters tally shows.
Stay-at-home orders remain in place across much of the world and it is an open question as to when people will feel comfortable traveling again and under what safety requirements.
Airlines including Southwest support pre-boarding temperature checks, face masks and social distancing measures on airplanes and in airports.
Under the terms of government payroll support, airlines cannot lay off employees before Sept. 30. If demand remains weak, Southwest has said it may need to downsize.
Excluding special items, Southwest's quarterly net loss was $77 million, or a $0.15 loss per share.

Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) posted a first-quarter loss last week and  American Airlines Group  Inc (O:AAL) and United Airlines Holdings Inc (O:UAL) are due to report on Thursday.

(Reuters) - Slumping sales at big fast food chains could get a boost as hungry and restless customers spend stimulus checks after long lockdowns, analysts and some operators said ahead of quarterly earnings that will show the extent of damage from the coronavirus slowdown. 
McDonald's Corp (N:MCD) and  Starbucks Corp  (O:SBUX) issued earnings updates on April 8 that showed a sales hit from coronavirus disruptions. Investors will get more information this week - along with updated outlooks - when they and other companies officially report.
More states are beginning to ease restrictions on businesses that were shuttered to stem the spread of the outbreak - meaning more people will pick up meals and coffee before, after and during work.
Tired of eating at home for weeks, consumers may also seek someone else's cooking, and restaurants are trying new ways of operating including continued use of masks and social distancing alongside plexiglass dividers at checkout.
""Sales trends have appeared to bottom, with restaurants suggesting benefits from a reduction in pantry loading, stimulus checks and home cooking fatigue have supported improving trends throughout April,"" wrote  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) analyst Lauren Silberman in a note.
Stay-at-home orders from local governments and mandated closures have hurt big chains, though not as much as independently owned sit-down restaurants without drive-thrus or take-away.
Global same store sales for McDonald's, which reports earnings on Thursday, fell 3.4% in the first quarter, according to an investor update the company on released April 8.
While the effect could linger, sales could be on the upswing after falling as much as 30% in the first week of April, according to a Kalinowski Equity Research survey of 20 franchisees published on Monday.
Broadly, breakfast and late night sales suffered, said Peter Saleh, restaurants analyst at BTIG.
Nobody knows how many consumers will return and how quickly, he said.
Brands with widely used, easy to operate apps - including the ability to order and pay in advance for pick up - may fare better, as results for Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) and Domino's Pizza (NYSE:DPZ) showed last week.
""That is critical. You're seeing digital spike for almost every brand out there,"" Saleh said. ""Those are exceedingly important avenues to the recovery.""
Also reporting this week are Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (O:DNKN) and YUM! Brands Inc (N:YUM), which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, KFC and The Habit Burger Grill, as well as Restaurant Brands International Inc (TO:QSR), which owns Burger King, Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Tim Hortons.
Starbucks, which reports second-quarter results Tuesday afternoon, still had only 44% of its U.S. company-run stores open as of the last week of March, it said in an April 8 update.
Its China business began to recover in late February and picked up pace through the end of March.

""Each week, we see more evidence reinforcing our belief that the business will fully recover over the next two quarters,"" it said.

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN) may have violated safety measures and labor practices amid the coronavirus pandemic as it fired a warehouse protest leader last month, New York Attorney General Letitia James's office wrote in a letter to the company last week.
""Amazon's health and safety measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic are so inadequate that they may violate several provisions of the Occupational Safety and Health Act,"" James's office wrote in the letter, whose content was shared by a source familiar with the letter on Monday.
Amazon terminated Christian Smalls, a critic of the company's warehouse conditions in the pandemic, on grounds that he put others at risk by violating his paid quarantine when he joined a demonstration at Amazon's Staten Island, New York, fulfillment center.
The letter, sent to the company on April 22, adds that preliminary findings ""raise serious concern that Amazon may have discharged (Smalls) in order to silence his complaints and send a threatening message to other employees that they should also keep quiet about any health and safety concerns.""
In response, Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said the e-commerce company did not terminate Smalls' employment for organizing a 15-person protest but because he put the health and safety of others at risk, adding that he also received numerous warnings for violating social distancing guidelines. 
""He was also found to have had close contact with a diagnosed associate with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and was asked to remain home with pay for 14-days. Despite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite further putting the teams at risk,"" Lighty said.
The letter, first reported by NPR, also called on the e-commerce giant to close some warehouses for ""adequate sanitization and disinfection"".
""We encourage anyone interested in the facts to compare our overall pay and benefits, as well as our speed in managing this crisis, to other retailers and major employers across the country,"" Amazon's Lighty said.
The world's largest online retailer has been facing intense scrutiny by lawmakers and unions over whether it is doing enough to protect staff from the novel coronavirus.

In March, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he ordered the city's human rights commission to open an investigation into the dismissal of Smalls.

But Merck is particularly vulnerable to stay-at-home efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus and people avoiding doctors and hospitals over fear of becoming infected.
""Two-thirds of our products are physician administered, and that is probably somewhat unique and is causing the impact,"" Chief Financial Officer Robert Davis said on a conference call. 
Davis said he expected most of the hit to Merck's business in the second quarter, with a potential for recovery by the end of the year as restrictions imposed due to the pandemic abate.
The company, which also suspended its share buyback program, now expects full-year adjusted profit of $5.17 to $5.37 per share, down from its prior view of $5.62 to $5.77.
Johnson & Johnson (N:JNJ), whose large medical device business will be hurt by delayed elective surgeries during the pandemic, also lowered its 2020 profit forecast this month.
""Strong underlying demand for Merck's products will lead to a sales rebound in 2021 as the pandemic eventually ebbs,"" said Michael Levesque, senior vice president of Moody's (NYSE:MCO). 
Merck beat analysts' first-quarter profit and sales estimates on increased demand for Keytruda, largely before the coronavirus epidemic put most of the country under stay-at-home orders.
Keytruda sales jumped 45% to $3.28 billion. Total sales grew 11.5% to $12.06 billion, beating estimates of $11.46 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Merck said it saw a slight benefit as customers stocked up on some of its products, including animal health drugs and its Gardasil vaccine to prevent cancers associated with the human papillomavirus. 
Merck said it was working on a coronavirus vaccine, and was in discussions with multiple groups regarding three separate potential viral vaccine platforms. It said it would announce the details of those collaborations once they are finalized. 
Excluding items, Merck earned $1.50 per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 16 cents.
Merck shares were down 3.4% at $81.12.

1667,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 11:00AM ET</span>","Move Over, FAANGs. Goldman Unveils Europe’s ‘GRANOLAS’ Stocks","(Bloomberg) --  Goldman Sachs Group  Inc (NYSE:GS). strategists say that in Europe, the companies that can outperform during the next market cycle are firms with strong balance sheets, low volatility growth and good dividend yields. They’re dubbing them GRANOLAS.
The breakfasty acronym derives from the companies on Goldman’s list: GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) Plc, Roche Holding AG (OTC:RHHVF), ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) NV, Nestle SA (SIX:NESN), Novartis AG, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) A/S, L’Oreal SA, LVMH, AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) Plc, SAP SE (DE:SAPG) and Sanoﬁ.
Goldman strategists led by Peter Oppenheimer say that the next phase of the stock market, whether it turns into a new strong bull run or not, is less likely to be driven by an expansion in valuations. Instead, the leaders of the forthcoming market cycle will be companies that are able to generate earnings growth, sustainable dividend payouts and have healthy balance sheets.
“In the U.S., tech is still likely to remain the long-term winner,” Goldman strategists said in a note on Tuesday. “In Europe it’s more likely to be a combination of structurally strong and/or stable sectors: healthcare, consumer staples and tech.”
Among the challenges the European stock market has faced and one that’s made it lag behind the S&P 500, is the relatively low presence of technology companies in the Stoxx 600 Index. In the U.S., FAANG stocks -- a group of tech giants including  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB). and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). -- have been among investor favorites. The past decade’s bull market has been led by tech shares, which are usually associated with growth due to strong cash flows and higher expansion rates.
This is pushing Goldman to look beyond tech companies in Europe when searching for potential outperformers. The stocks comprising the GRANOLAS might not all beat the market, say the strategists, but they offer earnings growth and/or stability, while their dividend yields are “attractive” in the 2-2.5% range.
The 10-year-long bull market in equities came to an abrupt end in March when the spreading coronavirus and concerns about the global economy sent stocks tumbling to multi-year lows. From airlines to chipmakers, few industries have been spared as lockdowns intended to halt the virus disrupt supply chains, hurt demand and set the world up for its worst recession in decades.
“At least in the nearer term the size of the demand shock is likely to be more deﬂationary,” the Goldman strategists said. “This should support the trend of low interest rates and low nominal growth -- again factors that tend to reinforce the existing trend of relative winners: growth, defensive growth and strong-balance-sheet companies.”

1668,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",PepsiCo sees snacking boost as lockdowns hammer soda sales,"By Uday Sampath Kumar
(Reuters) - PepsiCo (O:PEP) warned on Tuesday surging demand for Lays and Doritos would only partially offset a hit to business in the second quarter from coronavirus lockdowns that have shuttered restaurants, theaters and sports venues key for its soda sales.
The company said it had seen an increase in consumers making breakfast and snacking during the day while stuck under stay-at-home orders, leading to a surge in sales of snacks, oatmeal and Aunt Jemima pancakes late in the first quarter.
Its drinks business, however, is not faring as well under the tough moves to stifle the virus, and the company ditched its full year forecast and predicted second-quarter organic sales would decline at a low single digit rate.
The warning mirrored that of rival  Coca-Cola Co  (N:KO), last week, which said volumes had fallen 25% globally since the beginning of April, largely stemming from a loss of sales other than at retail stores.
PepsiCo finance chief Hugh Johnston stressed the group was less exposed than Coca-Cola to the part of the market hit the hardest by the lockdowns.
""Compared to our biggest competitor in beverages, they clearly have higher market share in away from home channels- restaurants, movie theaters and the like,"" Johnston told Reuters.
Analysts at Jefferies (NYSE:JEF) estimate about 40% of Coca-Cola's volumes are sold through channels other than retail stores, compared with only about 10% for Pepsi. 
Still, demand for sodas at grocery stores is also starting to taper off after an initial phase of stockpiling at the beginning of the health crisis, Johnston said.
PepsiCo's net revenue rose 7.7% to $13.9 billion in the quarter ended March 21, beating analysts' estimates of $13.21 billion, also helped by a massive advertising campaign during the Super Bowl. Organic sales of snacks under its Frito-Lay North America unit rose 7% in the quarter.
Excluding one-time items, earned $1.07 per share, beating estimates of $1.03, according to Refinitiv IBES data. 
PepsiCo also said it still expected to pay $5.5 billion in dividends and buy back shares worth $2 billion this fiscal year, signaling financial stability at a time when several blue-chip firms have suspended shareholder returns to preserve cash. 
However, the company ditched its full year forecast over uncertainty related to the pandemic.

PepsiCo also announced a new North America distribution agreement with Bang Energy drinks on Tuesday, only a few weeks after striking a $3.85 billion deal to buy Rockstar Energy Beverages.

1673,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 09:57AM ET</span>","Piglets aborted, chickens gassed as pandemic slams meat sector","By Tom Polansek and P.J. Huffstutter
CHICAGO (Reuters) - With the pandemic hobbling the meat-packing industry, Iowa farmer Al Van Beek had nowhere to ship his full-grown pigs to make room for the 7,500 piglets he expected from his breeding operation. The crisis forced a decision that still troubles him: He ordered his employees to give injections to the pregnant sows, one by one, that would cause them to abort their baby pigs.
Van Beek and other farmers say they have no choice but to cull livestock as they run short on space to house their animals or money to feed them, or both. The world's biggest meat companies - including Smithfield Foods Inc, Cargill Inc, JBS USA and  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN) - have halted operations at about 20 slaughterhouses and processing plants in North America since April as workers fall ill, stoking global fears of a meat shortage.
Van Beek's piglets are victims of a sprawling food-industry crisis that began with the mass closure of restaurants - upending that sector's supply chain, overwhelming storage and forcing farmers and processors to destroy everything from milk to salad greens to animals. Processors geared up to serve the food-service industry can’t immediately switch to supplying grocery stores. 
Millions of pigs, chickens and cattle will be euthanized because of slaughterhouse closures, limiting supplies at grocers, said John Tyson, chairman of top U.S. meat supplier Tyson Foods.
Pork has been hit especially hard, with daily production cut by about a third. Unlike cattle, which can be housed outside on pasture, U.S. hogs are fattened up for slaughter inside temperature-controlled buildings. If they are housed too long, they can get too big and injure themselves. The barns need to be emptied out by sending adult hogs to slaughter before the arrival of new piglets from sows that were impregnated just before the pandemic.
""We have nowhere to go with the pigs,"" said Van Beek, who lamented the waste of so much meat. ""What are we going to do?""
In Minnesota, farmers Kerry and Barb Mergen felt their hearts pound when a crew from Daybreak Foods Inc arrived with carts and tanks of carbon dioxide to euthanize their 61,000 egg-laying hens earlier this month.
Daybreak Foods, based in Lake Mills, Wisconsin, supplies liquid eggs to restaurants and food-service companies. The company, which owns the birds, pays contract farmers like the Mergens to feed and care for them. Drivers normally load the eggs onto trucks and haul them to a plant in Big Lake, Minnesota, which uses them to make liquid eggs for restaurants and ready-to-serve dishes for food-service companies. But the plant’s operator, Cargill Inc, said it idled the facility because the pandemic reduced demand.
Daybreak Foods, which has about 14.5 million hens with contractor-run or company-owned farms in the Midwest, is trying to switch gears and ship eggs to grocery stores, said Chief Executive Officer William Rehm. But egg cartons are in shortage nationwide and the company now must grade each egg for size, he said.
Rehm declined to say how much of the company's flock has been euthanized.
""We're trying to balance our supply with our customers' needs, and still keep everyone safe - including all of our people and all our hens,"" Rehm said.
DUMPING HOGS IN A LANDFILL
In Iowa, farmer Dean Meyer said he is part of a group of about nine producers who are euthanizing the smallest 5% of their newly born pigs, or about 125 piglets a week. They will continue euthanizing animals until disruptions ease, and could increase the number of pigs killed each week, he said. The small bodies are composted and will become fertilizer. Meyer's group is also killing mother hogs, or sows, to reduce their numbers, he said.
""Packers are backed up every day, more and more,"" said Meyer.
As the United States faces a possible food shortage, and supermarkets and food banks are struggling to meet demand, the forced slaughters are becoming more widespread across the country, according to agricultural economists, farm trade groups and federal lawmakers who are hearing from farmer constituents.
Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, along with both U.S. senators from a state that provides a third of the nation's pork, sent a letter to the Trump administration pleading for financial help and assistance with culling animals and properly disposing of their carcasses.
""There are 700,000 pigs across the nation that cannot be processed each week and must be humanely euthanized,"" said the April 27 letter. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said late Friday it is establishing a National Incident Coordination Center to help farmers find markets for their livestock, or euthanize and dispose of animals if necessary. 
Some producers who breed livestock and sell baby pigs to farmers are now giving them away for free, farmers said, translating to a loss about $38 on each piglet, according to commodity firm Kerns & Associates.
Farmers in neighboring Canada are also killing animals they can't sell or afford to feed. The value of Canadian isoweans - baby pigs – has fallen to zero because of U.S. processing plant disruptions, said Rick Bergmann, a Manitoba hog farmer and chair of the Canadian Pork Council. In Quebec alone, a backlog of 92,000 pigs waits for slaughter, said Quebec hog producer Rene Roy, an executive with the pork council.
A hog farm on Prince Edward Island in Canada euthanized 270-pound hogs that were ready for slaughter because there was no place to process them, Bergmann said. The animals were dumped in a landfill.
DEATH THREATS
The latest economic disaster to befall the farm sector comes after years of extreme weather, sagging commodity prices and the Trump administration's trade war with China and other key export markets. But it's more than lost income. The pandemic barreling through farm towns has mired rural communities in despair, a potent mix of shame and grief.
Farmers take pride in the fact that their crops and animals are meant to feed people, especially in a crisis that has idled millions of workers and forced many to rely on food banks. Now (NYSE:DNOW), they’re destroying crops and killing animals for no purpose.
Farmers flinch when talking about killing off animals early or plowing crops into the ground, for fear of public wrath. Two Wisconsin dairy farmers, forced to dump milk by their buyers, told Reuters they recently received anonymous death threats.
""They say, 'How dare you throw away food when so many people are hungry?',"" said one farmer, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""They don't know how farming works. This makes me sick, too.""
Even as livestock and crop prices plummet, prices for meat and eggs at grocery stores are up. The average retail price of eggs was up nearly 40% for the week ended April 18, compared to a year earlier, according to Nielsen data. Average retail fresh chicken prices were up 5.4%, while beef was up 5.8% and pork up 6.6%.
On Van Beek's farm in Rock Valley, Iowa, one hog broke a leg because it grew too heavy while waiting to be slaughtered. He has delivered pigs to facilities that are still operating, but they are too full to take all of his animals.
Van Beek paid $2,000 to truck pigs about seven hours to a Smithfield plant in Illinois, more than quadruple the usual cost to haul them to a Sioux Falls, South Dakota, slaughterhouse that the company has closed indefinitely. He said Smithfield is supposed to pay the extra transportation costs under his contract. But the company is refusing to do so, claiming ""force majeure"" – that an extraordinary and unforeseeable event prevents it from fulfilling its agreement.
Smithfield, the world’s largest pork processor, declined to comment on whether it has refused to make contracted payments. It said the company is working with suppliers ""to navigate these challenging and unprecedented times.""
Hog farmers nationwide will lose an estimated $5 billion, or $37 per head, for the rest of the year due to pandemic disruptions, according to the industry group National Pork Producers Council.
A recently announced $19 billion U.S. government coronavirus aid package for farmers will not pay for livestock that are culled, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation, the nation's largest farmer trade group. The USDA said in a statement the payment program is still being developed and the agency has received more requests for assistance than it has money to handle.
Minnesota farmer Mike Patterson started feeding his pigs more soybean hulls – which fill animals' stomachs but offer negligible nutritional value – to keep them from getting too large for their barns. He's considering euthanizing them because he cannot find enough buyers after Smithfield indefinitely shut its massive Sioux Falls plant.

""They have to be housed humanely,"" Patterson said. ""If there's not enough room, we have to have less hogs somehow. One way or another, we've got to have less hogs.""

Investing.com -- U.S. stock markets pared early gains Tuesday as a barrage of downbeat earnings reports and gloomy economic data curbed the enthusiasm of those betting on a sharp rebound for the U.S. economy next month.  
By 10:30 AM ET (1430 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 130 points, or 1.5% at 24,264, having earlier hit a seven-week high of 24,512 points. The S&P 500 was up 0.5% and the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%, as the froth came out of stocks such as Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).
The market had earlier appeared to give U.S. Inc a pass on a quarter where results largely reflected business before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, and where visibility regarding the rest of the year has dwindled to near zero. 
Stocks weakened after the sharpest drop in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index in years, down to its lowest level since 2014.  
On a heavy morning for corporate earnings, 3M Company (NYSE:MMM) stock rose 4.2% after the company said a surge in demand for its health-care products (including face-masks) offset a decline in sales at its other divisions, which were all negatively affected by the pandemic. The company said it would cut its capital spending by over 20% this year to preserve cash. 
At the other end of the scale,  United Parcel  Service  (NYSE:UPS) stock fell 4.3% after the company was unable to translate a surge in demand for delivery services into higher margins due to an even sharper rise in costs.
Likewise, Merck (NYSE:MRK) stock fell 3.5% after the pharma giant warned that the pandemic could take over $2 billion off full-year sales as health care systems around the world de-prioritize some of the ailments that its best-selling drugs treat - notably its blockbuster Keytruda. The company also suspended its buyback program. 
 Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) stock rose 1.2% after a quarterly update that added little to existing knowledge, while PepsiCo  (NASDAQ:PEP) stock rose 1.3% after its first quarter was rescued by locked-down consumers' demand for snacks - an element that was missing from rival Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)'s disappointing update last week.
Elsewhere,  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) stock rose 2.2% to its highest in seven weeks after the volatility in the U.S. crude futures strip receded. Sentiment towards oil major was helped by the sight of BP (NYSE:BP) maintaining its quarterly dividend, even at the expense of a sharp rise in debt.

1677,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 09:36AM ET</span>",Mnuchin Says No Bailout for States With Badly Managed Budgets,"(Bloomberg) -- Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said states that had poorly managed budgets before the Covid-19 outbreak sent their economies reeling should not be rescued by the federal government.
“This isn’t just going to be a federal bailout of the states,” Mnuchin said early Tuesday on CNBC. “States that had specifically large expenses because of the coronavirus, like New York and New Jersey, it was the right thing that the federal government gave them money.”
He said he approves of local governments using coronavirus funding to enforce public safety through law enforcement, but not for revenue lost because of the economic shutdown or “states that were mismanaged” before the pandemic hit.
President Donald Trump on Monday appeared to align himself with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said Congress shouldn’t debate relief to cash-strapped states until lawmakers reconvene next week.
The Kentucky Republican has suggested states with large pension obligations under union contracts use bankruptcy as a way to manage shortfalls instead of receiving federal aid.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday continued to press for a large package of aid to states and local governments in the next pandemic relief measure, warning of a big potential reduction in public-sector jobs that could further hamper the economy.
“There’s going to be massive layoffs at the state and local level unless we get them money quickly,” Schumer said on MSNBC.
Many Democrats and some Republicans have criticized McConnell’s bankruptcy proposal, arguing such a move would have far-reaching and disastrous financial consequences for the country. Democrats say federal aid for state and local governments must be part of the next round of coronavirus-related stimulus.
Mnuchin also said he has emptied the $150 billion funding from Congress for states and territories established to help cope with a public health emergency crushing local budgets.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 09:20AM ET</span>",EU sets out 'quick fixes' to boost bank lending during pandemic,"By Huw Jones
LONDON (Reuters) - Banks should rein in bonuses to boost their capacity to help businesses and households hit by the coronavirus crisis, the European Union's executive said on Tuesday.
The European Commission set out a fresh package of temporary ""quick fixes"" offering capital relief that would support extra lending potentially worth up to 450 billion euros ($490 billion)to companies struggling as a deep recession looms.
""During the last crisis we had to prop up banks, this time we are helping banks to prop up households and companies,"" the EU's financial services chief Valdis Dombrovskis told a news conference.
The easing of capital and accounting rules will be temporary, and the package needs to be approved by EU states and the European Parliament by June at the latest to have the full effect, he said.
The EU executive backed statements from regulators that banks should refrain from paying dividends or making share buybacks at a time they are getting capital relief.
""For the banks, moderating the amount of bonuses paid out to senior management and high earners in these challenging times is also a way to express solidarity with those affected by the outbreak of COVID-19,"" the Commission said.
Banks like UniCredit and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) have begun reporting rising provisions for bad loans as a deep recession beckons after national lockdowns to fight the pandemic.
Tuesday's package offers flexibility in how provisions are calculated and to delay their eventual hit to a bank's capital buffer to avoid lending turning into a trickle in the face of mounting bad loans caused by the pandemic.
Delays to repayments should not automatically lead to a harsher accounting treatment of the respective loans, the Commission said.
An EU official estimated that euro zone banks could face an extra 100 billion euros in provisioning for loans in 2020, but the capital relief set out on Tuesday means they will still be able to support extra lending worth up to 450 billion euros.
The European Commission also proposed giving banks more leeway in how they calculate a capital measure known as the leverage ratio, brought forward easier capital treatment of lending to small companies, and accelerated a rule that allows banks not to deduct the value of software from capital. 
""These adjustments to the prudential framework would facilitate collective efforts aimed at mitigating the impact of the pandemic and thus moving towards a fast recovery,"" the Commission said.

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>","Harley-Davidson cuts dividend, halts buybacks to preserve cash","(Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc (N:HOG) cut its quarterly dividend to just 2 cents and suspended share buybacks on Tuesday to boost its cash reserves as global lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic hit motorcycles sales in the first quarter.
The company, which has $1.47 billion in cash, said it was in talks with big U.S. banks to get an additional $1.30 billion in loan to ride out the crisis. 
The cash preservation plan lifted Harley shares, which have lost nearly half of its value so far this year, up 9% in premarket trading. 
Earlier this month, the motorcycle maker pulled its 2020 profit forecast and decided to temporarily lay off most of its global production employees as well as cut salaries of its leadership team in a bid to lower costs.
On Tuesday, Harley said it would cut cost to match the lower demand and focus more on sales efforts in the United States, its biggest market.
The company has been struggling with falling U.S. sales as its baby-boomer fan base ages. To counter that, it has been trying to woo the next generation of younger riders with electric and more nimbler bikes. 
But that has done little to boost sales. To make matters worse, the pandemic has further hit demand as Americans are forced to stay at home to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Retail sales fell 15.5% in the United States in the quarter and 20.7% internationally. ""Global retail motorcycle sales in the first quarter were significantly impacted by COVID-19,"" the company said in statement.
Total motorcycle shipments to dealers fell 10% to 52,973 units in the first-quarter ended March 29, while retail sales at its dealers declined nearly 18% to 40,439 units.
Harley said it would expand its lineup of profitable ""iconic"" motorcycles, while also targeting to boost sales of some of its new products such as adventure touring, sport bike Streetfighter and electric motorcycles.
""These efforts will pave the way for...improved profitability and long-term growth,"" said acting Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, who took helm in February. 
Zeitz, who was a board member at Harley and best known for turning around the Puma brand's near-bankrupt business, replaced CEO Matt Levatich.
Harley's net income fell to $69.7 million, or 45 cents per share in the quarter, from $127.9 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier.

Motorcycles and related products revenue fell 8% to $1.10 billion. On an adjusted basis, it earned 51 cents, beating analysts' average estimate of 41 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

""We must be informed in good time about critical acquisitions from third countries in the health sector and be able to examine them,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement.

Investing.com - U.S. stocks are set to open higher Tuesday, continuing recent gains as more states look to reopen, taking advantage of growing support from the federal government with regard to testing. 
At 07:20 AM ET (1120 GMT), S&P 500 futures traded 32 points, or 1.2%, higher, Nasdaq futures up 98 points, or 1.1%. The Dow futures contract rose 315 points, or 1.3%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average cash index is having its best month since October 2002. The S&P 500 its best month since January 1987, while the NASDAQ Composite is set for its best month since April 2009.
These gains come despite over 25 million Americans claiming unemployment benefits over the last month and retail sales dropping 8.7% in March, the deepest drop on record.
Investors are now looking forward, as more and more U.S. states try to reopen their economies, Texas and Ohio being the latest to move on Monday. The coronavirus infection rate has dropped significantly in several hotspots across the country, including New York, the national epicenter. Confirmed cases in the U.S. rose only 2.5% on Monday, the smallest rise since the outbreak started.
President Donald Trump said Monday the U.S. would dramatically expand testing for the coronavirus in May to reduce the risk of reopening state economies.
The Federal Reserve starts its two-day meeting later Tuesday, a get together that could produce more stimulus to support the economy, although expectations are 'muted'
The corporate earnings season picks up pace Tuesday, with tech giant Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) set to release results after the close.
Ahead of that, Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) stock dropped 1.2% after it posted a $94 million net loss in the first quarter, its first quarterly loss in nine years. 
 Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE)’s shares gained 2% after first-quarter earnings beat forecasts and revenue topped expectations, but  Caterpillar  (NYSE:CAT) dropped 1% after earnings slumped as customers reined in capital expenditure.
Economic data comes in the form of the consumer confidence index for April, at 10 AM ET (14:00 GMT). This is expected to have dropped to 87.9 from 120 the month before - a sizable drop, but still well above the all-time low in the 30s seen during the Financial Crisis.
U.S. oil prices were lower, after S&P Global was reported to have told its clients to roll all their exposure out of WTI June futures and into July with immediate effect.

1687,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","China discounts, cheaper iPhone to cushion Apple from virus blow to demand","By Josh Horwitz
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Apple Inc's (O:AAPL) discounts on the iPhone 11 in China and the release of a new low-price SE model have put the company in a better position than rivals to weather a coronavirus-related plunge in global smartphone demand.
While China, which accounts for roughly 15% of Apple's revenue, appears to be a rare bright spot, investors will be keen to get a picture of global demand when the Cupertino, California-headquartered company reports second-quarter results on Thursday.
The iPhone maker has shut retail stores in the United States and Europe following the COVID-19 outbreak, and China is the only major market where it has been able to reopen all shops.
Consumer spending is expected to be muted as the pandemic has crippled economies and Apple, the world's second-most valuable tech company, is better armed with the launch of its new price-conscious iPhone model, analysts said.
""Apple is better positioned than most to experience a rapid recovery in a post COVID world,"" Evercore analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note. ""We see demand as pushed out, not canceled."" 
He added that the launch of the $399 iPhone SE suggested that Apple's supply chain was getting back on its feet after weeks of shutdown earlier this year. 
Analysts expect Apple to report a 6% drop in revenue and an 11% fall in net income in its fiscal second quarter, according to Refinitiv data.
On the other hand, Chinese brands such as Oppo and Vivo who have steadily moved to offer high-end models to challenge iPhones, stand to lose marketshare as bargain hunters choose Apple.
Earlier this month, several online retailers in China slashed prices of the iPhone 11 by as much as 18% - a tactic Apple has used in the past to boost demand. And while initial social media reaction to the new iPhone SE was muted, analysts said they were seeing a pick up in demand.
The cheaper iPhone SE could tempt iPhone owners to opt for a newer device, something they might have otherwise delayed in a weak economy, said Nicole Peng, who tracks the smartphone sector at research firm Canalys.
""People want to avoid uncertainty in a downturn,"" she said. ""Having a brand like Apple that can showcase quality and make people less worried about breakdowns or after-sales service can bring in buyers.""
CHEAP IS GOOD 
Early data suggests that the Chinese smartphone market is recovering rapidly in the aftermath of the virus, and Apple has emerged relatively unscathed.
Sales of iPhones in China jumped 21% last month from a year earlier and more than three fold from February, government data showed, meaning March-quarter sales in the country were likely to have slipped just 1%.
To be sure, a recovery in Chinese demand won't offset sales lost in the United States and Europe. And the company is yet to launch a smartphone enabled with 5G wireless technology like those offered by Asian rivals, a disadvantage for Apple so far.
But those same expensive 5G models may not sell well in the current climate of frugality, analysts said.
""If there are no massive subsidies (in China), I doubt there will be many smartphone users who will be eager to upgrade to 5G,"" said Linda Sui, who tracks the smartphone sector at research firm Strategy Analytics.
Sui expects iPhone shipments in 2020 to be down 2 percentage points at the most, versus double digit declines at Chinese firms.
Apple also has revenue from its services business to fall back on. It has leveraged its large iPhone customer base to boost services revenue from music, apps, gaming and video.

""Apple's Services segment should remain resilient in today's work-from-home environment, thereby demonstrating the durability of Apple's model,"" Cowen analyst Krish Sankar said.

1690,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",SoftBank may be winner as BOJ expands corporate debt buying,"By Hideyuki Sano
TOKYO (Reuters) - Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group (T:9984) could be the biggest beneficiary of the Bank of Japan's plan to buy more corporate bonds as it expands stimulus to lend more support to the virus-hit economy, analysts said.
For that to happen though, the BOJ will have to come out of its comfort zone.
The BOJ does not disclose what corporate debt it buys, but market sources with knowledge of the matter said the central bank has so far avoided the firm's debt, presumably to limit exposure to the highly-indebted tech investment company.
With 17.2 trillion yen ($161.24 billion) of interest-bearing debt, the owner of Vision Fund is the most indebted Japanese firm. The highly leveraged tech start-up fund is a clear outlier in Japan where companies have been paying down debt and hoarding cash for years.
The coronavirus pandemic is sparking fears of a global recession that has heightened worries about the company, which announced earlier this month it expects an annual operating loss 1.35 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) as its investment in co-working firm WeWork went sour.
Bond yields of SoftBank Group  have risen to as high as 4.5% this month, even as many other Japanese companies' bond yields stayed relatively calm during the market storm.
It is against this backdrop that the BOJ on Monday ramped up by three-fold the maximum amount of commercial paper (CP) and corporate bonds it buys to a combined 20 trillion yen.
""I was surprised by the scale of the increase in size,"" said Toshiyasu Ohashi, chief credit analyst at Daiwa Securities. ""So now I am eager to see whether the BOJ will expand the target of its corporate bond buying.""
The BOJ said it will buy corporate bonds with up to five years left to maturity, compared with the current limit of three years. Its next corporate bond purchase is scheduled on May 8.
SoftBank Group has about 2.8 trillion yen of bonds that are due to mature within five years, by far the biggest and about four times as large as the outstanding debt of the second biggest Tepco Power Grid, according to SMBC Nikko Securities.
The BOJ had long sidestepped the power grid firm too, a subsidiary of Tokyo Electric Power Co (T:9501), which had been effectively shut out of the market for a long time after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011.
But the BOJ began to buy the TEPCO Power Grid last year, and some market players say the move reflected the central bank's limited investment choices.
Japan's corporate debt market is relatively small -- at about 93 trillion yen -- as bank lending has traditionally dominated.
The BOJ has generally accepted most bonds with investment grade credit ratings but has rejected some companies without any explanation.
Standard & Poor's has a rating of BB+ and Moody's Ba3 for Softbank Group, just below investment grade.
""Considering that the BOJ's corporate bond holdings is getting bigger, the BOJ should consider disclosing its holdings,"" said Kentaro Harada, senior credit analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.

At the same time, we experienced weak demand in several end markets that were more severely impacted by actions taken around the world to slow the pandemic.""
3M decided to withdraw its previously communicated full-year 2020 outlook given the evolving and uncertain impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and will reduce its full-year 2020 cap-ex plan to approximately $1.3 billion versus $1.6 to $1.8 billion, previously.

The source added that Lufthansa was still considering the insolvency protection procedure as an alternative if a rescue package limited the company's ability to compete too much.
Under consideration is a type of creditor protection scheme which requires that a company is not yet insolvent and in which a company's management can remain in place to execute the restructuring.

Lufthansa declined to comment.
 
"
1697,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Berlin government, Lufthansa pursue rescue deal: sources","BERLIN (Reuters) - Lufthansa (DE:LHAG) and the Berlin government are pursuing a 9 billion euro ($9.76 billion) rescue package for the airline, company and government sources said on Tuesday, but gave no timing for an agreement after a report overnight said the deal was complete.
Lufthansa declined to comment and a spokeswoman for the economy ministry had no immediate comment. A government source said talks would continue.
Sources close to the talks said there would potentially be a conversation on Tuesday between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Lufthansa Chief Executive Carsten Spohr, but they added this was not with view to concluding a deal.
Lufthansa's shares were up as much as 12.1%, which traders attributed to prospects of a nearing deal amid time pressure to stem ongoing losses. The shares were also supported by reported the size of the rescue deal, which met with some earlier expectations, they said.
News outlet Business Insider had cited company sources as saying that Berlin would help the airline in return for a blocking minority and one or two supervisory board mandates.
The question of state influence in the management of the company is a tricky one for Germany's coalition government.
Merkel's conservatives (CDU/CSU) want to leave Lufthansa's management relatively free of intervention, while the Social Democrats (SPD) want the state to share ownership in order to influence decision-making to protect employees.
Unions representing pilots, crews and ground level workers demand job guarantees if tax payer money flows.
Spohr was cited in weekly newspaper Die Zeit as saying the company needed to remain in charge of its decision-making. 
If Berlin had too much say, then governments of Austria, Switzerland, Belgium and federal German states could want to follow suit. Lufthansa has subsidiaries in Austria, Switzerland and Belgium and its two German hubs Frankfurt and Munich are located in the state of Hesse and Bavaria.
The company has issued stark warnings about its solvency amid a gloomy outlook after the coronavirus crisis has grounded almost all its planes. 
Spohr this month cited cash burn at a rate of 1 million euros per hour, meaning the airline's 4 billion euro cash reserves will be inadequate.
Lufthansa currently only transports one percent of passengers compared with a year ago. Some 100 aircraft of its 760-strong fleet could be idled and 10,000 jobs are in danger, Spohr said last week.
Some rival airlines in Europe and in the United States have secured government help, but others have said they aim to manage without it.
Spohr assured Belgian Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès in a letter seen by a broadcaster he has no plans to sell Belgian unit Brussels Airline.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Ford investors keen for details on when automaker will restart U.S. operations,"By Ben Klayman and Nick Carey
DETROIT (Reuters) - Investors already know how the coronavirus outbreak has hurt  Ford Motor Co 's (N:F) bottom line, so when the automaker releases first-quarter results on Tuesday they will focus on how and when Ford plans to restart North American operations.
Ford said on April 17 that the outbreak would result in an estimated first-quarter loss of about $2 billion. That warning came the same day the Dearborn, Michigan-based company raised $8 billion from corporate debt investors. 
Last month, Ford moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business. It also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast. 
Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. However, with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states beginning to reopen their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can be restarted. 
Ford, General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) are aiming to resume production some time in May, and are negotiating with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents their U.S. hourly workers, about how to safely resume vehicle production. FCA and GM are scheduled to report quarterly results on May 5 and 6, respectively.
Last week, the UAW said it was ""too soon and too risky"" to reopen auto plants in early May. 
Ford, whose credit rating has been downgraded to ""junk"" status by Standard & Poor's, has not said when it plans to reopen in North America. It previously had hoped to resume production in April at plants that make its most profitable vehicles, but subsequently backed off those plans.
Ford has idled most of its European plants until May 4, but has resumed operations in China, where the pandemic began and where sales fell 35% in the first quarter. U.S. sales fell 12.5%. 
Prior to the bond deal, Ford told investors that absent new funding and a restart of production, it had cash to last until the end of the third quarter. It also said revenue in the first quarter would finish at about $34 billion.
Ford also warned that production of high-priced versions of pickups and SUVs could be hurt due to damage caused by a tornado at parts supplier BorgWarner Inc's (N:BWA) South Carolina factory. That facility makes transfer cases for some of Ford's most profitable vehicles, such as four wheel-drive large F-series pickups and large SUVs.
Once production resumes, the question will be how fast U.S. demand bounces back.
Earlier in April, Ford's U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, told Reuters the automaker believed some level of government stimulus for the U.S. auto sector will be needed for consumers once the pandemic recedes. 

During the Great Recession of 2008-09, the U.S. government rolled out a ""cash for clunkers"" program, which offered consumers rebates of up to $4,500 to trade in older gas guzzlers.

1699,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Aurubis to win EU approval for Metallo takeover - sources,"By Foo Yun Chee
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's biggest copper smelter Aurubis (DE:NAFG) is set to win EU antitrust approval for its planned 380-million-euro ($412 million) acquisition of Belgian-Spanish metal recycling group Metallo, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
Aurubis agreed in May 2019 to buy Metallo as part of an acquisition-led expansion into other metals. Metallo processes about 220,000 tonnes of scrap and recycling materials annually at its plant in Beerse, Belgium, with another 95,000 tonnes processed at its plant in Berango, Spain.
In February Aurubis offered to sell assets in Spain and Belgium to address the European Commission's concerns about the deal, one of the people said. It is not clear if EU competition enforcers accepted the offer in its entirety or in a revised form.
The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by May 7, declined to comment. 
Aurubis said it was cooperating with the Commission.
""We still believe that the merger should be cleared unconditionally. Due to the extension we expect the final decision early May,"" the company said.
The EU competition enforcer opened a full-scale investigation into the deal in November last year, saying the merged entity could hold a dominant position in copper scrap with increased purchasing power to negotiate lower prices for the copper scarp it buys.
Another concern centred on Aurubis' market power in the downstream markets for copper cathodes and wire rods.
Before the Metallo deal, the Commission in early 2019 blocked Aurubis' proposed sale of its flat rolled products division to German copper products producer Wieland, arguing the deal could lead to higher prices.
